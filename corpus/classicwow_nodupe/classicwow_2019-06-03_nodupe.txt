That is correct and classic is actually on 8.0, they updated the classic client for beta.
---

---
All they need to do is remove that targeting restriction that was grandfathered in.

---
He has Manual Crowd Pummeler.  This weapon is endgame for the spec.  It has no upgrades.  He ends all fights at 1:30s to have 100% MCP uptime.
---
He has HoJ.  He has 1.11 Mark of Fordring, and he has several Rare Etlie Dungeon Mob drops.  He even has a BoE epic sword he never even hits the mob with.
---
A warrior with this level of investment would easily do 600+ dps.
---
I wish I could be a Chinese undead model, I don't like my bones ):
---
Holy fuck dude, your website was my bible as a noob rogue back in 2007. I totally forgot until I saw this post and then got hit in the face with a giant dose of nostalgia. Glad you’re still around!!
---
Ouch, that accidental Gnome Rogue scatter was rough to witness. 
---
Congrats to Venruki, the final duel was pretty great to watch.
---
There are many lists linked here and the best advice I can give you is to take all of them with a grain of salt. If the lists all agree on an item then that is probably correct, but keep in mind your specific situation such as hit cap etc.
---
Maybe. But in my defense, gnomes are the worst.
---
nothing in classic even come close to heroic raids.
---
I don't know what kind of mythic player you are, but MC with it's 1 ability per boss gonna get really old, really fast.
---
Ouch, that accidental Gnome Rogue scatter was rough to witness.
---
Nice! I been watching his streams since the start of the Beta! He is great to watch
---
I appreciate you effort to answer my answer and it was done so well, thank you :)
---
Ah OK then it wasn’t me. Back when I was still leveling my first toon I was up in Winterspring and saw a hunter trying to run away from a huge demon. Was frost at the time so I shot a couple frost bolts at it to help the hunter get away. 
---
Didn’t find out until afterwards that I’d messed it up for him. Apologized profusely and vacated the area. This back before I even knew about Thottbot or any other resources.
---
Esfand is equally as great but his feats are primarily on the PvE side of things... And trolling Asmon hardcore lmao.
---
With the Tournament win, Venruki edges him out in my book.
---
Love both though, really. My most watched streams by far.
---
This is hilarious. Much respect to the effort you put into this joke.
---
&gt;i really just wanna ignore what everyone else thinks and play what i think will be fun.
---
This is generally a good way of living your life.
---
so.. you too cannot explain why somehow classic 5-man will be amazing while BFA 5-man aren't... so you'd rather just ignore the question.
---
got it.
---
Its not so much aoe, but significantly increased rage generation from pulling multiple mobs.
---
I was a feral Druid in vanilla and will 100% be doing it again. It's S MUCH FUN, quite powerful PvP/battlegrounds and is a viable DPs, offtank and offhealer options for dungeons and raids. Go for it dude, don't let "horror stories" turn you away.

Personally I think leveling in vanilla is boring as fuck, and apparently it's harder on Classic, but the 60 content is very much worth it. ESPECIALLY if you can hit 60 with the first wave of good players and really experience dungeons etc without wiping 50x. Highly recommend not doing any dungeons while leveling unless you have several quests or you're seconds from quitting from the monotony. Wiping 10x in SFK because your group is trash is not worth it, better to just leave the group. I never played during vanilla and my first 60 on a pserver I thought every 5man/new raid was very much worth the grind. Just don't quit when you've died 10x in the last hour or your gear is complete trash. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
People telling you to "learn to enjoy lvl 25 content, roleplay, professions or read quests" are delusional. If you don't enjoy that on retail, you probably won't enjoy it on classic.  Just remember that the prize is at 60 and set mini prizes for yourself depending on your class (shadowform, sweeping strikes, cat form, getting your mount at 40, etc.) to get yourself through it. Make a bank alt, always have health pots, level skinning for gold and watch movies/streams. Good luck bud, 60 content is definitely worth it.
---
At least it was an accident.  One of my old guildies would purposefully ruin it for people.
---
This whole thread seems to be about griefing. And in my opinion, ruining a person's funeral is far more heinous then interrupting a couple duels. The Tauren ruined a few people's duels for an afternoon, but they'll get over it in a day. Having a funeral ruined for someone you love is soooo much worse.
---
So it's super fucked up for me to see people defending that act of barbarism, but be so appalled that one dude interrupted a few duels on a test server. Especially cause the winterspring community event led to real tears over the loss of a loved one. The 2 events aren't even comparable.
---
It's too late to abort him, hes like 30 something.
---
I play both factions so I don't let my bias get in the way, but everyone has their own opinion. Every race looks good in certain sets/armor, every race also looks stupid in certain sets/armor.
---
Orcs look great in most plate sets, their 2H animations&gt;Human and NE. 
---
Undead look great in most Cloth sets, specifically T2 Warlock.
---
I read it as “alcoholic” and thought you were poster shaming your alcoholic cousin.
---
&gt; playing a druid isn’t gonna be easy work
---
&gt;i’m planning to put a lot of time in
---
*thinking* So do you want it fast and easy or are you ready to put time?
---
where did you get that 200k from?
---
Even assuming it's true, 2 million players during a content drought ( aka few week efore 8.2 hit) still seems really nice.
---
I doubt classic after 2 months of MC farming will retain many players.
---
The whole thing [is here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433510386) right now.
---
yeah its actually dumb. Like I'm not complaining. I'm just pointing out an observation: it's dumb. 
---
They allow trinkets that are a free i win button for some classes vs others. Those same trinkets also have chance to fail or backfire, so its just added RNG on top of the already rng game. At the same time they ban items like thistle tea which are consistent and considered food.
---
"BaCk In mY dAy" we banned all profession related consumables (except bandages and food) in serious duels.
---
The private server meta formed around people playing with every consumable as a means of practicing for battlegrounds/world pvp on servers where your cooldowns reset after every duel.
---
i was dueling a mage on a classis private server, he mustve sucked because he had full raid gear, i just dinged as a rogue and beat him 100-0 if i had my cds.
---
I've always been curious about this, since I never raided in vanilla. If you're in a more casual guild that allows a few people to play "bad" specs (like feral cat, ret paladin, etc.), how gimped are you going to be? Assuming it's just a few, and not half the raid.
---
Thank you!
---
Well that fucking sucks but I got a job so maybe not the worst thing in the worst. If I get any of the good names ive been thinking up, I can accept that. Now to find somewhere to camp for actually fast and reliable internet. Haha. Thanks my friend! Upvote for you :P

he didn't really stomped seren, seren was fucked by trollgodx
---
Nothing amazing about it, he just got lucky with windfury procs and windfury is stupidly broken. When RNG is in his favor he can two shot someone. It's borderline retarded.
---
Played a mage, made it to Rank 13 only solo queue for AV. Played 16-20 hours a day for a solid 2 months to get there.
---
Obviously being AV, class was irrelevant. Remember ultimately you're competing against other players from your faction. You either need to win more or play longer if you want to make high rank.
---
Because they're playing to ruin the experience of others. That's literally griefing.
---
it's like saying frostbite carried ven
---
Yeah, I’d have much rather seen a “No Rules, Anything Goes” tournament.
---
oh yikes that is a contradictory statement lol.
---
i’m ready to put in time, i’m just worried it isn’t gonna bear fruit at all. as in i’m gonna get facerolled and denied from premakes no matter what lol
---
happens if the vod gets deleted on twitch. Some subreddits have a bot that automatically uploads the clip to another site, so even if the vod gets deleted on twitch there's a "mirror" of the clip on another site that can be viewed.
---
Lol that's completely subjective, lol
---
As a Druid in PvP you have to utilize all aspects of your kit. If you're just interested in Kitty form, probably better to roll Rogue honestly. Druids are definitely viable in PvP, especially wPvP. 
---
As for PvE, it is possible to roll a Feral DPS. However, the optimal way to do it is as Night Elf. Windfury doesn't help kitty DPS in anyway, but Blessings do. You also have much easier access to Gnomeregan, which believe it or not has a necessary item that needs to be farmed regularly if you really want to compete as a kitty DPS.

Actually where you on Hyjal by chance?

Why is this? I wanna shammy it up in classic and am curious now
---
No one gives a shit about feelings that got hurt. It’s the fact that NOTHING could be done. 
---
If the people running the funeral were better at the game they wouldn’t have gone down in history. 
---
There is literally nothing the players can do against same faction trolling.
---
WSG would like to have a word with you.
---
What other comments? People get reported all the time, not every one of them gets banned. Show me the email they got that they're banned or stop spreading rumors / fake news.
---
Hunters are also pretty weak at level 30 I think
---
The most important macro to have, is a mouse over macro for CC abilities. Not having to change targets to cast a Fear, Poly, Silence, Roots, Blind, or Scatter on that guy running up to you while youre already fighting his friend, IS GAME BREAKINGLY USEFUL.
---
Twitch has been doing that a lot recently, I don't know why. Keep refreshing or try pasting in the URL manually.
---
gotta rp
---
One hunter lost because he accidentally tabbed an Alliance with his concussive shot. Fine margins.
---
The pve server has completely different personality types.  It is wild.
---
Genuine question, what's the point of making macros of just spells like that? Why not just put the spell on your bars and set the keybind from there
---
By the TBC prepatch raiding mages could have over eight hundred spell damage. Hunters slip down the meters the later into vanilla's lifespan you get; the pet's damage doesn't scale, ever, and neither do the coefficients on their spells.
---
Snutz played horrible. Like seriously really bad.
---
For damage spells, it's pretty black and white. You either use max rank for the damage or rank 1 for the utility, nothing in between. Healers will use the middle ranks of spells though.
---
The only exception for damagie spells: Moonfire. Because it deals instant damage and also applies a dot, you can use max rank first to  apply the dot, then use max rank minus one (I think it's rank 9) to deal instant damage without overwriting the max rank dot. It's pretty niche though - Moonfire spam isn't used in PvE, only as a last resort in PvP.
---
Went all of vanilla without a single bre or spinal reaper from rag.
---
The real vanilla effect that gave your crits a bit of "oomph" was the original combat text. The way crits popped up on the screen was actually awesome
---
He’s the first boss in mc!
---
Yeah, the health funnel was a bad move for sure. It's literally one of the worst abilities in the game
---
&gt; Get a guild that cares more about a persons personality rather than ~~progression past BWL~~
---
FTFY
---
Ah, that I can see.  Still not sure you would dish out enough damage to warrant leveling as it though, at least pre 60.  
---
Though 60-70 due to frequent dungeon running can be interesting I imagine.
---
You absolutely can get banned or suspended for what he did. You also can't just follow a player around and tag all the mobs he wants for quests to prevent him progressing in the game. 
---
The in-game funeral thing is different. Thats engaging in PvP on a PvP realm in a contested zone. Very much within the ToS, even if it is kind of a d-bag move.
---
i agree
---
That's it! I couldn't find it for the life of me. Thank you.
---
You want a Hunter.
---
Thought ranged + mashing buttons like a maniac never really nice together that well, that's mostly a melee thing.
---
Apologies on the frenzy/enrage mistake, it’s been some time. Those bosses will prevent you from clearing the raids, no?
---
 
---
NA Horde player looking for a semi-hardcore guild.
---
Prefer a guild that's lighthearted and joke about serious stuff without people getting upset over stupid stuff. DKP/Loot Council(If fair).
---
Intended classes would be Hunter, Warrior(prot/fury) and Shaman. PST/CST times. Msg me here or to inquire for discord info for more information on my raiding background or guild history.
---
Public Service announcement that improved cleave's tooltip is bullshit and doesn't increase the total damage of cleave, but instead only the bonus 50 or 70 dmg cleave adds (whatever it is), so the talent is adding like, 20 dmg to your cleaves, or whatever, not what you'd expect. 
---
Just so everyone knows with regard to AOEing. 
---
Also pro tip for beating elites as a warrior, no matter what spec you are put on your biggest 2h (probably your whirlwind axe) and pop retaliation and go to town on that ho
---
Played wrath for a while on a bandwidth capped 3G dingle in a cabin in the woods. Luckily cassequence macro for marksman worked perfectly.
---
I really liked this explanation in a thread about how Vaelastrasz's mechanics work:
---
&gt; “...it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs.”
---
Any chance you can send video of it?
---
I was 15 and the bills I had to pay was for my phone. Something like 15-20 ish $.
---
Not really. I’m honestly convinced that all horde players are blind. Like how to fuck do you play wow for hours on end looking at a orc in the middle of your screen.
---
Nice job applauding delinquency. Playing just for the sake of ruining the experience of others is the lowest a person can go. Insane to me that people like that are in the beta.
---
I think the answer is eventually going to be some kind of seasonal system. As in Diablo 3, have seasons that reset periodically (1 year? 2 years?) that contain a subset of dungeons. Then, when the season ends, your characters are merged into the un-seasoned servers and become regular characters. 
---
In Diablo 3, people play the seasons for a variety of reasons: For achievements, for transmogs, for leaderboards, and (my personal reason) the opportunity to reset and play with friends with a clean slate.
---
Now, the classic devs (and rightly so) have stated they won't do any of those meta-features like Achievements and so on. However, there may still be the ability to issue limited-longevity servers that offer access to re-tuned content (BC, WotLK raids) for interesting item sets that re-balance hybrid builds and such.
---
For instance, what about a Black Temple item set for Druids that elevates Cat Form DPS to top-tier? That gives people a reason to roll druid in the season, collect the armor, then merge back into vanilla and have their cool set.
---
my feelings were deeply hurt by 2 taurens jumping around during a pvp tournament! can we lets just start banning all the trolls and attention whores, this is unacceptable! :(
---
It wouldn't have mattered if it was on pve. The griefers were the same faction of the people they were griefing.
---
there are many more gold farming strategies that need to be addressed as well if we decide to take this stance as a community.
---
I wonder what you look like haha
---
Hehe, well, I don't know enough about premades to be honest. All I know is that you'd need to be more of a bear than cat to carry flags well. Also I'm sure druids are good BG healers, quite impossible to kill earlier than your buddies kill the attacker.
---
As with many things in Vanilla, the more time you put in, the higher are your chances. If you're ready to do BGs all the time your premade does, you won't be denied, because a premade needs people with a lot of time first and foremost, to get those honor caps for everyone.
---
For PvE, I suggest [this](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) if you want some inspiration.
---
It's not about feelings, but it literally is just an annoyance and makes the action harder to see. Why wouldn't people ask for that to be stopped?
---
I'm pretty sure there is actually a clause that states that you playing the game, even how you mention above isn't bannable even if it impeads another players experience.
---
The ToS clearly states that camping people, graveyards, mobs, quest spawns etc are NOT bannable, it's part of the game. If you want to play a class fantasy of an absolute asshole, you can.
---
I feel so called out...
---
Tbc had some currency too but not used as much
---
You're so dumb it hurts. The viewers enjoyed too.
---
Almost no one raided in Vanilla and people still had stuff to do.
---
It will take the average casual person many months to be even ready to enter MC.
---
Called this about 10 hours before the tourney, even in his practice he was playing flawlessly on stream, not surprised he took out the win even with all the other amazing pvpers in the tourney
---
OP asking the real questions.
---
Where are they? I don't recognize that area.
---
What hell are you talking about? When and where did I ever say anything about classic 5-man vs. BfA 5-man? Or when did you ever ask me?
---
This isnt one of the "Pixel Perfect" things they were talking about, this is a effect which is completely missing.
---
How dare you
---
I can’t wait for the adaptation where Shia LeBouf plays your cousin.
---
That doesn't make it a better argument for WoW's "value".
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuevmjLB3s4Yb4RUuR5Ik1Uq0g7txfoni
---
Ah, I didn't know that. What I meant by 'normalized' is that all weapon speeds are now the same in BFA, so item level is basically all that matters. You're technically right though, the best kind of right.
---
Does he know you posted a picture of him online telling the world he's an alcoholic?  If so, is he cool with that?
---
Shame. The cows really annoyed me, then suddenly they were gone after moving to a different spot for a second time. I wanted the satisfaction of watching him/them get banned.
---
At least he talks
---
Uff so ugly, so glad that Classic uses the old models
---
!remindme 2 months
---
Wow vanilla client doesnt update your character position until you land.  So if you jump from out of nova range, you can avoid nova a few yards into the real range as long as they cast it while you are in air.
---
[removed]
---
I forgot all about that!
---
Feral druids are great off tanks but they do have a high skill cap.
---
mage is literally one of the top two classes in vanilla purely DPS-wise, whether PvE or PvP and everyone sure as shit knows that lol
---
Do Scatter Shot and Freezing Trap (incorrectly) share diminishing return types on the beta right now?
---
Some of the scatters into Freezing Trap durations seemed incredibly short.
---
Its a copypasta from Twitch Chat
---
I'd so love watching competitive vanilla bgs regularly
---
as annoying as it was, he was tenacious. too bad he didnt stream it for maximum effect.
---
Almost a guaranteed beta on that account if it had been subbed about a month ago.
---
I understand why you would say that, but I fully disagree. McIndex is a very broad sounding term. Makes you think it's referring to the menu (or even more) as a whole. Since it isn't, and it[s only referring to 1 item (for good reason, its just tryna make exchanges easy to visualize), then Big Mac Index is better, even though McIndex got a chuckle out of me x)
---
Atloholic* And he is aware and love sit, he's in this comment section a few times. Altoholic means he has multiple characters in WoW. Doesn't stick to just one
---
Baron also tanks Naxx as a bear, hes streaming beta too.
---
You are assuming that item has been converted to the new data schema already.  
---
Also TBC items were starting to be tested even in 1.12 iirc.  Items like the Alch stone were probably in the game files in a strange level 60 state.
---
venruki would have lost to a hunter in earlier rounds if that hunter didn't accidentaly target a griefer running into him and scatter him instead of ven. Woulda changed the whole thing
---
It looks like it was flipped around on accident in classic though...
---
4 hunters isn't a lot...
---
How about they move to a higher level area a level 1 couldn't survive?  Don't stream it so thousands can interrupt it? Hell just go to the gurubashi arena where they can camp a level 1 of the same faction. There's plenty of ways to get around it. 
---
And you may need to look at your morale code if you don't give a shit about a grieving family, but get livid when a duel is interrupted...
---
That sucks. I don't see why Tips would delete the VOD, or if it was not him, I wonder how that works. Anyways, thanks for the info.
---
I suggest you do some testing while the beta is out now (considering you have access, try a pserver if not)
---
I recently leveled a warrior on a pserver #nobetaclub and I've been loving it personally. I think it's best to just do what sounds fun and not worry to much about what other people say.
---
You wont be ripping people to shreds as Feral, but you will be able to escape any fight and torture people to death is they decide to chase you.
---
Yes... you can.  That feature wasn't removed until like Legion...
---
Leveled Druid 1-60 in resto spec... I pretty much only did instances which took about 30 days played to 60.
---
At lvl 60 while leveling enchanting died in bwl resto gear while aoeing with hurricane in deadmines.
---
It's pretty arbitrary to allow grenades but not potions. 
---
Basically, engineering OK but alchemy not?
---
Targetting hostile totems doesn't work: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433646958
---
people act like windfury procs is this mythical, never seen thing. It's 20% procrate, not that rare
---
I watched him today out of curiosity and changed back to Ven as soon as Soda called a guy a retard for asking a silly question regarding the druid vs. warlock matchup in the in-game chat.
---
I understand why people might like him but it's just not my cup of tea.
---
Go to a higher level area where people dueling also pull mobs? Good thinking. 
---
Don’t stream lol. Yeah that’s a good solution to people greifing. 
---
The arena? Where the level 1 can jump in and attack the people fighting? Where anyone can jump on and attack the people fighting? 
---
Your ideas arnt good
---
Fellow skinny guy I understand your frustration, I've been 5'11/135lbs since 16 years old. Im now 23 and finally reached a consistent 150. I just gained weight out of nowhere. I eat anything and as much as I want. I've always stayed active and never worried about my size. I'm skinny and i often hear it but I always think to myself how difficult it's been to gain weight and that I'm fortunate I'm not attempting to lose weight. I'll enjoy this good fortune while I can and expect that one day I won't have this privilege. Enjoy that metabolism while we can!
---
Okay so you addressed literally one of my points, ran with it, and couldn't even do that right.
---
MCP is endgame for the spec, sure, but it's a level 30 blue item. Not exactly unrealistic to get. Not sure what is unrealistic about HoJ, almost every melee dps wants it and will run BRD with it on reserve, same with paladins. The mark of fordring might be itemized for 1.11, but it will be in at launch, and it's a quest reward, not seeing how that's unrealistic, almost every melee dps will have it.
---
He has... literally one rare elite item. Briarwood Reed. ???
---
He does have a boe epic, it's a weapon for trash mobs, and no one else has any use for it in the entire game. It will be cheap on the AH. You could replace it with a great many things since the trash weapon is, obviously, not vital.
---
The 1:30 second uptime would be a fair point, if many boss fights in MC took much longer than that, which they don't. Also it's not like the dps goes to 0 when MCP runs out of charges.
---
Anything else you'd like to focus on or fabricate for no reason?
---
Yes this game is about interacting with other players and there will be more played classes and lesser played classes. The beat advice anyone can give you is to not worry about anything other than what you think you would enjoy playing the most. Throw viability and ranking out the window and just immerse yourself into a class that usually fits your play style and just play.
---
Tab targeting is his own fault. Sucks but what can you do? Replay for something so minor as that would be taken advantage of. 
---
In the rule set itself there's literally a clause about being forcefully feared out of bounds via Fear. I'd link it, but I'm on mobile. Tips read the clause out while it was happening to either cdew or Soda.
---
Can I ask what is wrong with this? I am a clicker and haven't played WoW in about 8 years. Is clicking so bad that I should try and force myself to learn keyboard for spells?
---
We are talking about level 30 here. Not level 60
---
Unluckiest and almost luckiest at the same time.
---
I had top DKP in my guild and I missed one and only one ZG run. This happened to be the only time the Zulian Tiger mount dropped. I was Horde too so it was the only cat mount at the time.
---
If you're rank 6 with 20000 RP, after 4 weeks of getting 10000 RP you get 20000+10000-4000+10000-5000+10000-6200+10000-6960, which puts you to rank 9.
---
I think you misremember.
---
So was watching the Duel Tournament stream today, it seems like a few people had issues getting feared outside of the duel area causing them to lose the duel, since fear is very RNG. Seems like a silly way to lose a duel because of this issue. For some reason i felt like back in the day you had a lot more time to get back into the dueling area. I'm curious what other peoples takes are on this? If anything you would think that the duel area timer shouldn't tick if you are CC'd outside the duel area.
---
"See how this one ~~Warrior~~, ~~Priest~~, ~~pPaladin~~, ~~Druid~~, Rogue main managed to overcome his addiction."
---
It was an introduction to macros, really. He goes on to give an example of how the simple macro can be altered to have added complexity.
---
Griefing was bannable in vanilla. And they were out of bounds, the taurens didnt stumble into anything
---
guy...
---
as soon as AQ and Naxx hit the servers its over for PVP
---
The power creep removes all strategy from vanilla wow pvp we enjoy so much. Some classes can kill you with 2 buttons and not even talking bout pom pyro
---
Fake news!
---
"See how this one ~~Warrior~~, ~~Priest~~, ~~Paladin~~, ~~Druid~~, Rogue main managed to overcome his addiction."
---
Blizz take note, what a stupid comment....  
---
What do you even mean by this?
---
Leveling on a private server is like 90% similar to leveling in actual Classic. The biggest difference would be the lower mana regeneration from 1-10. You will get the gist of the classes just fine.
---
He just uses that word pretty excessively. Not even always in a purely negative way either. Sorry to hear he left a bad impression but he's generally a pretty chill guy, and often answers a lot of questions from chat, even if he has to talk about the same thing several times. But yeah sometimes he gets fed up and calls someone a retard, but usually there's no real animosity behind it.
---
2 Glowing Brightwood Staffs dropped in Felwood 3 mobs apart.
---
I’ll never be that lucky again.

Yea this is totally me. I had a priority list but I leveled a Priest, Mage and rogue since 06. Didn't reach end game till wrath launched but I got to raid wotlk naxx with my 3 mains lol. Good times. Sad part is I'm still undecided what to main this time around but I think it'll either be Spriest, mage or shaman 😂
---
For clarity, what do you consider the "tremendous" downsides?
---
I seem to remember the flip happening in late TBC or early Wrath, because I was trying to farm it on two characters.
---
yes go resto shaman and she can go disc, that way you can enjoy lvling for an extra year.
---
Agreed, it was fantastic but Twitch numbers mean very little :/
---
Guess he did suck. I can’t beat mages who use the right counters as a 60 rogue, unless I gank them when they’re in combat like a real rogue. You just run out of tools before them. Maybe I suck, but I expect with proper spell batching implementation it will be easier to vanish disjoint a lot more spells.
---
To have blood and hit effects you need this macro :  /console violenceLevel 5
---
But the macro is not working in the beta...
---
In Vanilla the value was at 2 by default, but in classic beta it is at 0
---
I'd be impressed if you hit level 20 in 4 hours
---
The hunters seemed super weak, not sure if it was the players or just being lvl 30
---
i'd imagine playing tank druid is 1000% more fun than rogue
---
A AAA game is 60$ usd, if you play wow for 4 months you got more out of it then a brand new game.
---
he didnt kite it. 
---
be factual if you wanna jump on the train man.
---
hahaha fuck I wish I thought of that I would have put it in there
---
That sounds cool and is what I did back in the day. Two chars to 60 before TBC came out. Maybe you could make a twink later on, then you’d be as competitive as anyone else in BG’s.
---
better idea IMO is to just get an Razer Orbweaver or another equivalent alternating gaming keypad. It has 20 normal keys, 2 thub  buttons (1 is upper side button, the other is a down almost/pedal lke button) + a dpad. It is lkike a numbpad on steroids. Easier to rest your hand. And it has software that can save different configs. It will save macros for you. And you can combine any number of buttons on it, including you nomal keyboard keys and mouse clicks). It is perfect, and the only way I can even attempt to play WoW with my disability. Oh, and hte orweaver? Its glows and yo can configure the clors as well, even changing the glow per config, so you can have it glows for each dfferent secs/class which not only good as fuck b u t a good way to make sure you are the right config without having to tab off the game! Sorta pricey but 100 worth, holes with other games as well! (got mine for wow years ago and have end up using it mostly for OSRS lmfao)

Are there any classic-friendly addons to make tracking DKP and such easier for raids? I'd really just need something that logs items that drop, who gets them, and the names of all the people in the raid when it happened, ideally storing everything in a text document I can copy from easily.
---
If you can export the in-game chat history to a text document somehow, I could also just do that and Ctrl+F through it for system messages of people joining/leaving the raid and items being looted, but that seems like more work. :/
---
I stand corrected on that point. Evidence still says devs were corrupt.
---
As to the impact on economy, part of me feels that it only had such a huge impact on private servers because of the massive amount of gold farmers that made up a lot of the population and farmed it for X hours a day.
---
I wonder if the impact will be near as bad on classic servers where there won't be so many gold farmers concentrated on one or two servers. I feel most people probably won't spend months farming to the point where it will destabilize the economy.
---
Sure some people will do it and become massively rich, some will do it just to get their epic mount and cover raid costs, but I doubt a majority will be farming it nonstop to rmt and ruin the economy.
---
Because he’s a human
---
And for those of us who gave a rats ass about PvE and raids aside the gear for pvp (but oh wait, due to resilience it was worthless) it was worse in every way.
---
So continued harassment is bannable. This guy was a Tauren that repeatedly jumped into player duels to impede the duels for several hours despite being told to stop. That is harassment. The clause you're referring to basically says if there is a PvP solution Blizzard won't do anything, but there is no PvP solution to a lvl 1 of your own faction sitting on tremor totems to fuck up duels.
---
True true true
---
Naw, gotta play on a pvp server, then hide and have the Gm's protect you.
---
Mages are a very fun class to play and Aoe farming is great in vanilla
---
You have the spectators protect the area. A high level zone or gurubashi. If the funeral people could just "be better", then the same thing applies here. Especially since gurubashi would have been the perfect place for this event, and made it completely preventable. If you can't stop a level 1 before they interfere in the pit, you don't deserve to run a community event.

Isn't devour magic  a lvl 30 spell? ...

This is great, but I see one that’s wrong. You can no longer target totems with macros. We’re not going back to the old macro system that allowed this.

Literally anything other than those two in their purest forms.

Skill vs peoples champ
---
Paying $15 a month when you're only looking to play *one* of those games, which is an old ass game that won't get any updates after the phases are rolled out is a shitty money grab from Blizzard. They'd be wiser to make a second cheaper subscription for those only looking to play Classic. Plenty of people won't play because they won't want to pay so much for added services they won't touch, but you won't find sympathy for that fact here as this subreddit is full of blizz fanboys who would pay even more just for the chance for Blizz to fuck them in the ass.
---
Classic level 30 "meta" is hard to adjust to, even if he did play during actual vanilla. He's still arguably the best Warlock to ever touch the game.
---
A lot of the time I wish he wouldn't. He seems to just be filling silence at times. Soda seems much more laid back/natural with his speaking.
---
Clicking is extremely slow and inefficient compared to keybinds. Keybinds increase your APM (actions per minute) thus allowing you to use more abilities/potions/etc. in the same amount of time as the clicker. I would highly encourage you to keybind your most commonly used abilities at the very least, eventually having a keybind for every ability/trinket/potion/etc. Your gameplay experience will be significantly improved imo.
---
Jesus 260 people? On facebook?
---
Frost abilities are good in both pve and pvp. The problem is that the best PvE talents don't have much PvP use, and vice versa. It's definitely doable, but other classes do it much better.
---
Well, we should be cognizant that the playerbase as a whole will be better now, so the same raid comp that failed to clear BWL in Vanilla could probably do it today. So that's the first reason why casual guilds won't mind so much.
---
Beyond that... You'll be a bit gimped here and there, depending on how much "a few" is. Let's say the absolute lowest DPS output of one of the pure DPS classes in a raid, on Ragnaros (largely a static fight in terms of DPS positioning), is 400 when the guild is progressing. You can expect a hybrid to be doing maybe half of that. Often they'll be doing as much damage as the Off-tank Prot Warriors. But there are, say, 25 DPSers in the raid. If the best one is putting out 700, and the average is 500, then that's 12,500 DPS total not including the OTs and MT. A single 200 DPS Ret Paladin or Oomkin "taking the place" of an average pure DPS player is going to take that 12,500 to 12,200, or approximately 98% of total possible DPS. That is not enough to wipe on Ragnaros.
---
But 5 or 10 offspecs? Well, now you're expecting that the guild in question also has poorer than average pure DPS players, since the above average ones wouldn't want to be in a guild like this. So this raid comp is now putting out 400 average DPS for pure DPSers, and tehre are only 15 of them. And it has 10 Hybrids putting out the same 200 (let's assume they're of equal skill and equally geared/buffed). Now instead of putting out 12,500 on Ragnaros, your raid is putting out only 8,000. That's more than enough to possibly hit a third Sons of Rag phase, at which point your healers will be oom, and you'll wipe for lack of damage. And that's only Ragnaros.
---
As the other commenter mentioned, the first real gear check boss ever introduced to WoW was Vaelestrasz the Corrupt. It was responsible for more guild breakups than potentially any other boss in Vanilla. Because you HAD to kill him in 3 minutes, with maybe a few seconds over if he was at 1%. Now, the average-geared Rag-killing-but-just-barely guild is probably going to wipe on Vael several times with their 12,500 DPS, until they juuuuust manage to kill him right before the soft enrage timer. That means that even a single hybrid in that raid makeup who isn't vastly overcompensating with buffs galore is going to take that guild from *just barely* killing Vael on their 20th attempt to *never* killing Vael on any attempt. That lack of 300 DPS makes the fight impossible to pass. And at that point, everyone starts pointing their fingers at the lowest performers and saying, "Either they leave, or I do."
---
And a guild with 5 or 10? Forget about it. They'll never pass Vael unless their raid flasks up for BWL fights and overgears well after Phase 3 has hit. And even then it's going to be nearly impossible, because the difference between 8000 and 12,500 is vast, right? That's a full third less damage than could be put out if the raid was properly specced.
---
Now, my actual numbers were off for the sake of arbitrarily making a point. Vael's HP is such that the total raid needs to put out a minimum of 5,500 DPS for 3 straight minutes (and it's actually more at the beginning, because DPSers *will* have to commit suicide as the fight progresses. So let's use the real numbers. If your raid group puts out 6,000 DPS in the Vael fight (wherein everyone is buffed up to do even more damage), then you can clear him. But if you were in a guild with 10 hybrids and thus doing 2/3 of what you could be doing, that will make or break your guild progress.
---
So for a lot of bosses outside of AQ, lack of DPS simply means that the healers need to be able to sustain for longer. A few hybrids here and there not pulling their weight (or pure DPS classes who are playing poorly) may not be the deciding factor in fights like Rag or Vael, assuming there were only a few. A lot of them? Well, Vanilla is "mechanically easy" unlike the bullet hell of retail, but the hard numbers can't be overcome through thoughts and prayers. If you have a spec and gear that prevents you from ever passing X number, and the raids were tuned for a team of DPSers putting out a minimum of X DPS each, then you're holding the guild back and making others (either very good DPSers or very good healers) literally carry you.
---
Vanilla guilds didn't invite hybrids simply because they didn't like them. It was because in many places, the fights became mathematically impossible or extremely difficult without a raid that avoided hybrid DPS. Every hybrid DPS was essentially someone who was implicitly saying, "Because I refuse to play the spec my class is best at, everyone else needs to work harder to appease me." And that sort of egotism didn't fly in a 40-man raid.
---
**tl;dr A few hybrids really can make or break a guild even in "easy Vanilla" on fights like Vael, when the guild doesn't yet have the gear to overgear the fight. A *lot* of hybrids are a massive tax on healers, they oblige other DPS to overcompensate, and they'll likely never pass BWL "on time" (which is to say that maybe that sort of guild clears BWL after ZG has already released and people can start getting ZG catchup gear). The game might be mechanically simple, but there's a reason that fights like Vael destroyed casual guilds left and right.**

Hey, this is a very serious affliction which has cost me hundreds of hours!
---
Needed only the shoulders to complete the dreadmist set. Ran it several times a day for weeked, never dropped.
---
Finally, it drops. I'm the only warlock, I've let everyone know. It's mine. I'm trying to click it to pick it up...nothing happens. Server disconnects for like an hour or so it felt like. When I log back in, no dreadmist in my bag :(
---
So underrated
---
No clue where you got rank 6 starting point from. I didn't say I got from fresh 60 to Command in four weeks, I said I ground out AV like a 9-5 job for three-four weeks and ranked up to commander.    
---
My point was, that with enough time commitment anyone can get higher rank. It wasn't any kind of brag anyway. Rather a critique of how mindless time commitment can give you results. The honor system wasn't based on skill, it was based on time, and how competitive your realm was.
---
Just look better i guess. Theres lots of new games that are top notch in their corner of the games market. Factorio, path of exile, tarkov, mordhau, exanima, witcher 3, kenshi, just to name a few. And PoE and tarkov are unforgiving if you wanna have a hardcore experience (of you play blindly without getting help do lots of reading).
---
But i know what you mean. Games arent designed for the small group of nerds anymore like 10 years ago. Nowadays pretty much everyone is playing some sort of game. So the Industry changes and tries to cater to all the casual people cuz thats easier money. Way easier, sadly. 
---
Thats why lots of people go back to older games like wow classic, mount and blade, old fallout titles, age of empires 2, stalker series. Its hard to find demanding games nowadays but theyre definitely out there.
---
Most likely a gm intervention since it looked like they were about to stay.
---
Im the exact same, found Quinn to be such an annoying streamer until watching Classic
---
Yeah. Really loved my guild. Cool people for the most part, minimal drama, no attendance pressure. Accidentally caused a little myself that killed a BWL raid for an evening but that’s another story. 😖
---
in classic do you get a bonus when using the best armor for your class?
---
in other words, would a lvl 60 hunter lose out on some sort of bonus for having a leather item equipped?
---
On p servers yes
---
It's extremely lucky. Like insanely ridiculously lucky. He was *hilariously* close to losing in r1 against Jelly. Then, the way other matches shook out, he never had to fight Chance or the other druid, who he would've lost to 100%. Then Serendipity or whatever was griefed by that level 1 so he lost to cdew. All of these things created a lane for Ven to sail through to the top.
---
If it isn't too extensive, could someone list the rules for the tournament? Thanks.
---
Guess I triggered another lolret.
---
Any class in this level of gear investment will do at least 50% more dps, no question.
---
See you in classic, lolret.
---
ill have more drarven spirits fuck it, i aint gettin in
---
Your ability to critically think is lacking to a degree that renders having any sort of productive discussion with you impossible.
---
LOKTAR OGEEZ GIVE ME SOME CHEESE !!! - Its the little things OP! Thank you.
---
no.
---
Luckiest. Found edgemasters in Mara as mage aoe farming.
---
Unluckiest.  Had full tier 2 minus the helm. I ended up getting almost full t3 before it dropped for me. Raided every week...
---
Nexus crystals will always be dirt cheap. Think about it, how many garbage items drop from MC each week.
---
This.  Honestly.  Using this for my warlock pets and their abilities made me seem a lot better than I was.
---
K
---
No one is forcing you to play Classic.
---
I thought he played ok. Except missing that one sacrifice.
---
hmm, interesting question. i would assume so. but a test would be cool
---
I played Classic the entire way through, but I played very casually and never reached level cap (I got a Troll Mage to 50 and dicked around on a bunch of alts). I’m currently trying to decide between two classes for Classic: Mage and Priest. 
---
My absolute favourite class are Shadow Priests. I love the look and feel, the lore, and the abilities. However I remember Mages being a ton of fun too. Because I never played endgame (raids or PvP), I’d love to know what’ll suit me more. 
---
I’ll primarily be PvPing, but I’d also like to do some casual raiding. I want a class that can hold its own 1v1 with good utility. I’d also like to be able to jump into raids with a solid guild when I can. I don’t mind healing, but because I love Shadow, would respeccing be an issue given how expensive it is in classic?
---
I’d love a comparison of the two classes if anyone has any experience.
---
To venruki too
---
Can't test this, but I've heard that in Vanilla you can DE any level item with only level 1 Enchanting, so, sure they'd lose progress on a desired proff but they wouldn't need to spend a tonne of gold powerleveling Enchanting to a level sufficient for DEing high level items like you do in Retail.  
---
Some people might deem it to be worth it.
---
so back then people just stole accounts and played them for years afterwards? that sounds fucked up.
---
Wow fuck you are triggered, instant downvote, instant reply.
---
So are we picking what we’ll be leveling as, or is it what we’ll mostly be spec’d as at 60?
---
Thank you! glad someone saw it lmao
---
So many players picking pve based specs....
---
...perfect.
---
Oh for sure, fucking stun resist is a biiiiiiiiitch.
---
Eh, not sure about that. They're pushing corporate esport bullshit so hard there's an article out about long time Blizzard and Activision quitting because of high management shitting on the games to make tourneys better.
---
Any hunters do well? Missed this
---
Good question. Guess it depends on where the spell origin is in relation to the hit box. Is it from the center or from the box edge. Or even edge of the model itself.
---
I have heard people complain that the dead zone for tauren hunters is longer.
---
Not really, I’d play a gnome over any of the horde races.
---
until 38, and then become a thunder god.
---
Level faster, heal easier, and nuke better in pvp.
---
It starts with a K and ryhmes with oh noes.
---
I believe behind Stratholme. If you walk through the uninstanced instance you can sneak out the back and onto an area similar to this.
---
Well you are giving them money every month so who's the real winner here?
---
Where did this badass sword come from?
---
Still recruiting?
---
Just a random guess of starting point. My comment was to emphasize that you were probably R8 or 9 already, and it's not completely fair to say that you got R11 in 3-4 weeks.
---
I completely agree with the rest of what you're saying.
---
No, there's bonus for wearing all one type of armor class (cloth, leather, mail, plate. In fact, much of the best healing gear for all classes is of a lower armor class. I believe the same armor type bonus started around Cataclysm or so.
---
I played melee from Vanilla until wod (warrior, rogue, pally) I finally mained a ranged class (hunter) in wod and absolutely loved it.
---
I really enjoyed the depth of quests getting quel serrar in vanilla and wanted to make sure the class a played had something similar at max level. So with that... Going to continue with hunter and aim for that rhok delar.
---
Griefing is a reportable offense in literally every multiplayer game, including WoW.
---
For beta players with good memories...
---
Is the character creator functioning the same as it was back in the day (and even on PS's), that is, are the sliders that change corresponding character features exactly the same?
---
What I'm getting at is as follows: when the rush to create characters and reserve names begins, can you "practice" making your avatar using the beta creator screen (and even on PS screens) and expect those same sliders to correspond to the exact same character details? Basically, can you make your character at the 3 week prelaunch as quickly as possible and still get the details right?
---
(Perhaps not as simple as I was hoping)...
---
I like to combine this with loot council for a limited set of items that are prioritized for guild progression, generally legendaries and tank loot. Decide ahead of time who gets these items, then for everything else use EPGP.
---
The loot council can reference the EPGP values, which can help fight against favoritism. Also, since its a limited pool you don't suffer the fatigue of arguing over EVERY. SINGLE. piece of gear. It also prevents people from hoarding points, delaying gearing up, to get that super rare drop.
---
Volume warning!
---
Both thekels grasp in one run.
---
The idea here would be you need 2 sets of gear, one to level as melee and the other to heal with focusin on int, mp5 and +heals.
---
Alternatively, you could just respec ele at 38 and just have 1 set of gear and level much faster.
---
Last boss in ZG. Hakkar.
---
yeah i had that thought, beforehand have people go to random hard to reach safe enough spots, summon the appropriate folks in, then go to next spot, etc etc
---
Imo pay 2 win destroys 99% of all mmos for me. FFXIV os a good example how to make (a more casual friendly) mmo. But even ffxiv has lots of skins and mtx shit despite a monthly fee. Dunno why you have to have both but whatever. People pay for it so nothing will change.
---
But wanding is basically just waiting, not "mashing buttons like maniac" like the op said.
---
Also coordinating 40 people and managing that was probably more difficult then any fight in MC
---
This dude is straight up fucking retarded. No one is forcing you to buy anything dipshit.
---
Nope
---
Yes, but at least for modern WoW, you're paying for the game too (~$50).
---
Subscriptions leave you with nothing, while at least you can return to a game if you want. I'm just playing devil's advocate, and how many people see things.
---
simply restrict tournament to BWL gear
---
Another way of saying sold and recovered.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
yeah, i remember talking to alliance people at booty bay when i was infected
---
usually either dual swords or dual daggers, but sometimes youll see slow MH fast OH
---
I have a feeling since it's in beta already they may not even add this back in............. but they absolutely need to.
---
I was honestly surprised how long some of these lasted. My dueling experience was very limited because I never did it, but the few I would see outside IF on occasion would be over fast. Never occurred to me that the skill ceiling could be that high.
---
I think you misread my comment above. I was pointing out the kind of craziness you have to go through to rank, 9-5 days for three/hour weeks is nuts. It is a marathon. You misread it as a brag about speed, when it was a complaint about the honor system.
---
Yeah it's really a win-win-win-win-win if you ask me
---
Mage AOE farming BRD is pretty damn OP.
---
I'll just shill [this](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table) and [this](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Parry-haste) here as well. Oh and [this](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues).

Tldr, money is what's changing, so using the $1000 in the bank was a bad example. Big Mac pricing is much better reference
---
Here you are again with your braindead shit.

that is how enchanting works, correct.
---
Yeah I think people are forgetting that you literally run these raids for months and months, even when there's new progression content out.

Nutz
---
He has every right to do what he did.  That's what classic is about.  Classic isn't about what you think it is supposed to be about.  Classic is about everyone being able to do whatever the fuck they want online as long as it isn't illegal or against the TOS, in which case, this is not.  This guy acted within the TOS and Blizz intervened because a buncha people threw a temper tantrum over a troll.  
---
PATHETIC
---
As long as you dont have your heart set on main tainking or being a reliable DPS player.  
---
Druids do well in tanking a few fights, and their dps is passable given the fact that they can pretty much offtank in the same spec.  
---
For PvP Druids are powerhouses IMO.  They have a great role in WSG, they are great solo defenders in AB, and in duels they are a really strong class too.  
---
In 5 man content they can do anything.
---
Not even specifically warlock - he is arguably one of the most mechanically gifted players in the world according to a large number of top tier players.
---
C'mon now. Horde has meat head orcs, tall gangly Jamaican trolls, bulls in trousers, and dead people who accurately reflect on the outside how you feel on the inside. Whereas Alliance has humans, short humans, tiny humans, and purple humans.
---
I don't even understand how this is a choice for most people.
---
what about with yourself with an elf under the shelf?
---
I hope it's true because I am leaning towards playing as a Tauren shaman and this would make me very happy.
---
hahaha get a grip
---
even at 30 mage is the biggest cheese class lmao
---
Atleast you can kill nerds at world bosses
---
Right but we're still waiting to hear your alternative system.
---
I was thinking each few duels needed to be in a different area. With a lock in each secret location to summon Tipsout and the duel participants. When trolls arrive, you move to another location.
---
Seen and appreciated! It was my favorite detail of all the little touches you added in.
---
Except it's a PVP SERVER. If people of opposite factions want to mess with a *player made* event they should be allowed because it's not interfering with a Blizzard made thing. 
---
Player driven events shouldn't be subjected to the same rules because the event isn't driven or setup by Blizzard.
---
Well Blizzard agrees that it's bannable because this same thing happened during the Classic Demo duel tournament where people were trying to disrupt it with druid bears. Blizzard responded by later banning a number of them and saying any bans during the demo would also apply to the full release. Griefing is bannable. Go play something else if you don't like it.
---
Don't enable the insta-quest text feature? I don't know if it still exists in retail, but in Classic the quest box would fill with the quest text as if it was being written right then. Forces you to read it instead of clicking accept as soon as the box pops up.
---
a guy on sargeras has it and scarab lord
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/sargeras/dinglesberry
---
I used this system in TBC and it was somewhat problematic because classes that had little-no competition could bid 1dkp on tier pieces and save up for items like rings, necks, trinkets and easily outbid other classes that had more tier piece competition.
---
I know where you and the other guy are coming from. Since your point is clear.
---
Its a custom tournament by the community. Nothing in the rules states its forbidden for them to do shenenigans. Griefing is forbidden. Good. But how far does it go? Will i get banned when i constantly slay noobs in a low level zone? No cuz thats part of the game. Is it griefing? I guess yes. So you cant be as black and white as you want to be. 
---
Better ask bliz or gms or even the other faction to help with those events. Punishing people wont rly stop the problem.
---
Generally 2 swords as there's better sword itemization as you level.
---
I can't see the clip but I'm almost positive that fear should never path your character off an edge. Bug?
---
I explained in the original post: It's to avoid having to drag new ranks into your toolbar. It's an 'evergreen' spell in your toolbar. This isn't a problem with retail, they fixed it long ago. This is specifically for Classic (which didn't have a single "frostbolt' spell
---
Rerolled to lock after a break in mid 2006. Hit 60 and got attuned. Random message that a guild needed a lock for their raids. Joined, got T2 head and chest in week one and a bunch of other stuff. , There's a photo of me at the guild first razuvious kill with the ogre magi staff. Spellpower enchanted, of course.
---
Confirmed.  And for anyone wondering, it's ((2/3)*(2/3))^11 because there's two 66% chances that it wont drop each week over 11 weeks.
---
Are there VoDs?
---
Your point gets immediately invalidated and you decide to block the guy for talking sense to you instead of acknowledging you were wrong? Pretty hilarious.
---
I’m casual af so warlock, just like in late vanilla when it became my main. Hunter alt probably.
---
That's stage two. I was just trying to get people into macros with the simplest possible example that still have strong value. My next post was going to use \[@mouseover\] which, i agree, is HUGE...
---
If it was right click to duel, hunters are always going to be gimped. You have nowhere near room to kite and start with the other player in your grill. 
---
30 is actually a solid level for hunter pvp, though. You have fd/trap and cheetah. With more room to work, hunters dominate that range.

How classic is set up lends itself to encourage people playing nice with each other on the same faction. Ask a question in chat and those vet players should be more than eager to flex their knowledge and help you out. I honestly can't say I've played an MMo where everyone shits on the people asking questions. There are always friendly helpers. You also shouldn't look at this subreddit as what the community will be. Is retail so bad now that people don't even do this?
---
&gt; Also, How much better would it be to play warrior and would the world be so over-saturated with warriors that when our party gets to be geared enough for raiding, would I even be able to get raid gear
---
Good Warriors will always be in demand for raiding guilds. And the prevailing theory is that while there does seem to be a lot of interest in Warrior, many will burn out on it fast when they start hitting some of those hell level ranges because Warrior is one of the longest and toughest to level solo.
---
Nope, Blackrock.  Then, latter, Black Dragonflight.
---
Good explanation.  It always gets to me when people conflate "casual" with "people who willingly choose sub optimal stuff for raids."  
---
You're already spending less time doing everything, why would you not want to make your chances of succeeding as high as possible by taking things that aren't deadweight.
---
The fact that you think I was invalidated by him means you're up for a big ol' block yourself. That's how you deal with the internet.
---
The only thing the horde have going for them. Is undead. They look cool, if you into the undead look. If you’re not. Then your fucked. Also alliance has paladins, soooooo that alone just renders the horde pointless.
---
I think ven takes it for me. The Cinderella story with him getting the beta he didn't expect and trying it just for fun then falling in love with it to becoming the mage god he always has been in classic has just been a joy to watch.
---
Says the guy who’s posted dozens of comments in this thread alone white-knighting the guy like you’re on his payroll.....yikes.
---
My guild let me roll on Zin'rokh on my hunter my first time raiding with them, and I won (beat 4 pissed off warriors, sorry lads).
---
Unluckiest was getting my account hacked a bit after AQ.
---
Cross-realms was in vanilla.  I don't want wait times for BGs. Just be social with the people within your BG group. Most people play for a bit and you'll get to know names at least within your play session.
---
Well streamers differ in personality and skill in games just like the whole gaming community or your everyday encounters differ in personality. Theres a type of streamer for everyone. Even in games like LoL or fortnite i guess.
---
You can also get back there by climbing up the hills behind Scarlet Monastery and running to the right, which I suspect is the more likely pathway given how hard it would be for level 14s to reach the Quel'thelas zone through EPL.
---
Ok big man.
---
Hah this sounds perfect, I'm glad he did it - now we're getting back to 2004 open world fun.  Downvote away :)
---
"simply"
---
The tauren griefing them was of the same faction, what are you talking about?
---
"Your opinion is wrong" Alright buddy
---
Most likely he had to go to bed. Mom wanted to make sure he does well on his 7th grade Math test tomorrow
---
Leveling a warrior is fun, but it is hard. If you arent racing to play 60 content, and can enjoy the leveling process, then warrior could be a good pick for you. But it will be hard
---
The event that happened by accident was interesting. Dozens of corpses in Ironforge. The event that they planned to try to be like the previous event was just meh.
---
that's what I wanted to say but figured some idiot would come start an argument about Hydra or Reckful or Pshero and i didn't wanna get into it
---
Yup, they already have most of their kit by that time. Very strong abilities
---
dunno if this counts but; my group disbanded after wiping on the last stage of warlock epic mount quest chain  (fighting off waves of enemies in Dire Maul)
---
I was mega bummed, we were all "gg" "will try again another time" kind of stuff as we went to get our bodies
---
... to then discover we had JUST survived long enough to trigger quest was complete.  
---
Got hand in, got my mount, best wow moment for me for sure
---
I see we have another gnome to take care of then.
---
It's likely due to us using higher resolution now than the 4x3 used back in vanilla
---
What spec in particular? Would any combo work?
---
I would fucking love to raid with Dave Chapelle.

Druid travel form (like mounts) sometimes didn't always disable as soon as you went inside, and IIRC there were several times where I made it deep into one of the two bases up the lower ramp in travel form, only to switch over to cat and sprint the rest of the way.
---
IIRC you could do the same thing with mounts too, all depended on the lag and where the sever thought you were when it did it's outside/inside check.
---
Oh nice, thanks!
---
An important part about loot council is that it gets way better as the level of the guild improves. When you know 100% your guild is top tier and will clear naxx you’ll be much more confident that you will eventually get all the gear you want so you won’t mind as much missing items for optimal raid decisions because eventually you will get all your BIS gear. In worse guilds there’s always that element that things will collapse and you’ll just get screwed and people lose trust
---
since it *is* original vanilla functionality and there's no blizzard post regarding this issue, it is being left on the sheet intentionally until blizzard clarifies whether or not they want totem-targetting functionality or not
---
His ass. Other players /who'd him and he was just ported back to Mulgore.
---
Flag run and sit on points in BGs. Go tank guards so people can take over enemy cities.
---
Makes sense to me
---
stuff to do = dicking around on alts or bg, farm gold, or get steamrolled by pvers whenever they show up.
---
What else are they going to do, play everquest?
---
Devils advocate is my favorite part to play so I get it. The way I see it is someone that is concerned enough to shoot down 15$ for a month of entertainment would not pay for a game they did not want to play (bfa). Personally imo the worst case is you play classic for a week and hate it your still better off than a new game and playing it for 3 weeks from a strictly  monetary pov.
---
I have made this point to friends of mine before, for some reason the fact that i need to click a cancel subscription button makes it more inconvenient than spending an additional 45$. I guess my whole point is this is like anything else, perspective. 
---
I think its also worth keeping in mind that even as a pretty frugal person going out can easily be more expensive in any given night of boozing or splitting 2 appetizers at a restaurant.
---
Well yes, because it’s not an opinion it’s fact. Alliance has paladins and races that don’t make me wish I was blind. Meaning they are better than the horde. The horde is just full of PVP chads, which is why they are called “The Horde”.
---
Because the only way they can get any kills is by gathering a massive group to kill a group of people 20 levels lower than them is STV.
---
Nobody is complaining about the other faction.
---
Well, that's an easy question.
---
Besides the normal default humans, the rest of alliance aren't really people. So a naturally stupid choice for people are not what the short, shorter, or purple human players pick!
---
Hence, we get gnome players whose sole purpose is to get ganked in STV.
---
Yes, that's correct. Why are you asking?
---
This is a very good point. It seems unfortunate how much luck went into this tourny considering the dynamics of certain match ups. I would love to see them all duel it out a bunch and we could get a chance to see a proper test of how well these players can figure each other out and perform.
---
Please, shamans are totem twisting, frost shocking death machines you can delete most characters in a single windfury crit. They are way more bad ass than auto-attacking, bubble-hearthstoning paladins.
---
Why would you do that to yourself?
---
Yeah that was a blood elf. You must not of been that invested if you quit over something so petty. :)
---
Aight, that's opinion is cool and all, but how much does Santa pay to make toy every year?
---
Nice try, but tauren couldn't be paladins until late 2010. So, you are wrong,
---
hey someone gotta stand up for the minority. go back to your streamer, he needs his view count up.
---
Here is the clip from Cdew's perspective, since the original was deleted:
---
[Cdew Gets Feared Off a Cliff during Duel Tournament](https://clips.twitch.tv/SourCautiousPlumageSSSsss)
---
Genuine question: for PvE what’s a great but laid back class to serve as a raider and farmer? what should I pick? Lock mage or h pala? I hear hunters dps is sub par...I’m genuinely thinking of dual boxing since I can’t make up my mind
---
And hopefully you also have more than sub $100 allowance to help with it.
---
lmao "go play something else" :D i mean they were being dicks, but a ban for that is just too much imo
---
Stop crying...
---
Tipsout appears to have deleted the entire VOD of the tournament.
---
This was clearly an explicit trolling attempt. Killing the other faction is something you do in the game, you get honor for it, it is obviously more of a gray area. Standing on people dueling, especially in an organized duel over the course of hours is about as clear an example as possible of what I would consider bannable.
---
Yeah but then you can't increase your power with a gas pedal.
---
I just posted the clip from Cdew's perspective since the original VOD that I clipped from was removed. It was in an area that is sort of a glitch zone/bugged so I would not really say it was a true "cliff" in the bug regards, but correct me if I am wrong.
---
With how a lot of people are, they want to play what is the best. Warrior is best melee dps and best tank so expect a shit ton of them. I don’t think you’ll have trouble finding a raid group but expect it to take longer to gear up because you will be rolling against so many. However, end of the day just play what makes you happy.
---
&gt; Was the first guy with a 1v2 PvP video made, along with Snutz.
---
huh?
---
There was no pvping his take isn't relevant
---
Meanwhile, if the level cap is increased to 40, hunter becomes the most overpowered thing in the history of gaming. Gonna be interesting.
---
Player that griefed, what should result in a ban that we don't know if happened or not.  
---
There is a difference between grief and pvp, if they were in a contested zone it would be just pvp, that's that.   
---
They were in a horde zone and a horde level 1 alt (you can't attack your own faction even in contested zones btw), came in to grief (harass) other players, that is by disturbing view and targeting of other players with the sheer model size of the race (tauren).   
---
We all know that it is against the ToS of WoW to show destructive behavior against your own faction, that is impeding someone of your own faction from doing anything. A example would be a level 60 player A hunter tagging all the mobs of a level 1 player B warrior, in this case Player A is griefing player B by preventing player B from playing the game.
---
it dropped from Geddon. but it wasn't supposed to be in the game, so it wont
---
Where did you learn this?
---
You a fucking retard or something? How could you ever possibly trace a lvl 1 to their main?
---
Clearly you give a shit about feelings. You want a person banned cause they made someone angry...
---
Slow mainhand sword and faster sword in offhand
---
You're correct, but he was technically out of bounds in an area not normally accessible to players, so odd pathing behaviour is to be expected.
---
It also seems like he fell through the ground rather than pathed off the edge, which would funnily enough be pretty accurate vanilla behaviour.
---
They do get scatter and feign death at 30. Hunter's are definitely going to look more powerful out in open wpvp vs a duel.
---
You can't, they're not using the system that allowed script macros. Maybe there will be a button/bar add-on that will change based on states such as a certain range. I know I've had them in the past that swap what bars show depending on Druid form...
---
Glad you are having fun, August can’t arrive fast enough
---
All hunters got knocked out round 1
---
pvp generally gets more bursty at 60 when people get epix etc. The later in vanilla it goes the more bursty and quick it gets.
---
no, vanilla was its own balance
---
Time to let Ol'painless outta the bag
---
what if I get a dagger that has a lot more DPS than a sword I have? Would I still use an offhand sword over the dagger?

You can't petition a GM on the Beta realm, according to one of the streams. Technically, everybody is there to test out the game and provide meaningful feedback so they can make the real game better. It's not there to be a place where the community can hold serious competitions free from trolls. Trolls are part of the game, StaySafe put it best that if a player wants to be known as a fucking douchebag to the community, it's their prerogative - the community will deal with that player and you don't need to go whining to Blizzard every time sombody spergs off or whatever they choose to do.
---
Spoilers: if the spectators protect the area, they just made it safe for everyone else as well. 
---
It’s not just “stop a level 1”. It’s “stop everyone that jumps into the arena, alliance, horde”. Literally anyone can interfere if you do it in the arena. 
---
Why is it the community event runners fault? Why isn’t the blame put on the people greifing?
---
It's not incorrect, they share diminishing return since like 1.7.
---
The hunters in this tournament were atrocious.
---
You can't grief people in the game. They guy is explicitly being disruptive, not playing the game. There is no reason for the tauren to be there except to disrupt the experience of other players. There couldn't be a more cut and dry example of unacceptable behavior.
---
There's a sword specialization talent, so two swords
---
I mainly raided on PvP servers and rarely did BG's. World pvp was just cherry on top. Some memorable/funny/heart-racing moments added to the experience.
---
For what your looking for I'd say Beast Master.
---
For more finese Survival and if you're patient and really understand how to weave your skills through your auto attacks then go Marksman.
---
Mmmm nope. Trolls are possibly the worst offender. Lol, might wanna go get yuh eyes tested.
---
I enjoyed the part where he repeatedly failed to understand how basic PvP flagging worked. He was so amazed that not a single alliance attacked the two duellers... _who weren't PvP flagged_.
---
Thats a really damn good level 4 sword holy shit.
---
No? I want someone banned because they were greifing over 100k players. 
---
If someone was ddossing the server wouldn’t you want them banned for ruining your fun time?
---
He didn’t have to play a Druid. Xaryu, another R1 mage, lost to a Druid first round.
---
"Meters". Raid boss armor scales (insanely so to the point that Blizzard started making armor pen a stat instead of chilling out on that), a clothie's armor really doesn't (a few points here and there - they dabbled with the concept of high armor cloth sets with the Arathi Basin BGs but that armor was pretty bad). IIRC near the end of vanilla aimed shot was 1-hitting cloth and auto-shots were otherwise doing massive damage. You saw the same thing with melee DPS - mortal strike crits gibbing cloth players. I know everyone has their own fantasy of what vanilla was but cloth was NOT good in vanilla. The best PvP healers were Paladins, the best PvP DPS were Warriors and yet people played tons of Mage, Lock, and Priest (and Rogue, but I think Rogue is actually a good PvP class in vanilla because it scales well with gear, has great utility, and can avoid being a target) because those classes were popular and good in raiding, not because they were the strongest PvP classes (they weren't). 
---
Until resilience was added in BC, playing a character in cloth PvP was a massive liability. Most healers were better off letting you die than trying to keep you alive when someone is on you
---
Don't stress over it too much - roll whatever you guys want but if you go 3 paladins - at least one of you will regret not going warrior after spending 100 hours together.
---
I am playing in the beta and I get 150-190ms from Japan. You should see comparable results. Not sure if it will hinder pvp that much.
---
Gratz to Venruki and whole thing was really fun to watch!,,, On a side note...  
---
Good thing Blizzard gave such tightly closed beta access to the two retard taurens today. I'm sure they're contributing so much feedback to the game.
---
Shit troll is shit
---
Look at Curse of Elements. Increase fire and frost damage on target by 10%. So you may not be doing as much damage yourself, but you're personally responsible for potentially hundreds of dps increase to the raid. That's what makes classic great, truly a team affair.
---
Again, if you looked it up you would know the whole story, mostly. I'm not advocating for any server nor do I have any hidden agenda just trying to clarify for people who dont know
---
Ah okay. I misread the original post and thought he was asking for one that would be pretty good at both not best for both
---
Don’t expect much. OP wants server transfers for classic wow. Not the sharpest.
---
go play retail and queue bg/arena, your ping will be similar :)
---
Requires a lot of volunteer leveled Warlocks who arent even there to duel as well as more prep. It's works in theory but is a nightmare to arrange, especially if you have to solve it on the spot.
---
Yes trolls are shit, I agree!
---
Pog MonkaS kappa lul
---
what is it about using the area of the game specifically intended for arena fighting and the spectators killing the griefer that is so hard for so many people on this subreddit to understand
---
I don't think Mage has a lower skill floor than most classes tbh.
---
&gt; he problem is always when a person with some sort of reach spreads said misinformation. If he says something false about spell batching his viewers are going to latch on and say the same thing. 
---
Spot on. People be like "Just don't watch him hurr durr"... 
---
Yeah but his tens of thousands of followers are now going to spend the next 2 years spreading the same fucking misinformation that they got from him.
---
Is 3% int really worth it, to sacrifice your dignity? I think not
---
In classic my guild had a shadow priest that would heal during raids and he never had a problem.   
---
If you are not in some super hardcore guild I think you would be perfectly fine healing while in shadow spec or just dpsing as shadow in raids. 
---
Both are good for PVP.  An Undead shadow Priest is amazing at it.
---
You can dispel yourself sheep/nova and dont look like a fool for running after a mage for like 10 mins.
---
Im pretty sure Snutz has the most rank 1 titles across different classes. Lock, warrior, rogue, priest, mage, prob more. He is certainly one of the most mechanically gifted wow pvpers, if not the most.
---
&gt; I think its also worth keeping in mind that even as a pretty frugal person going out can easily be more expensive in any given night of boozing or splitting 2 appetizers at a restaurant.
---
No doubt on this point. I think it's crazy the value games in general can provide. Especially something like WoW. I think of taking a vacation, which is something I enjoy doing, but I can also say that in some aspects I've had more enjoyment staying up playing WoW way back int he day than vacations I've had.
---
Pass get this crap out of here. I use general and trade chat like a man.
---
The community can handle a couple of idiots, especially on a PvP server. If this was a live server, everybody would eventually know who they were and when your name turns to hit like that, you don't get into raids or any kind of group except with the other shit players on the server. So they will end up rerolling on another server, because in vanilla/classic there is no cross-server grouping.
---
Rank 1 nova is only useful when your mana is really important. Most of the time you'll use it for aoe grinding. In pvp unless you're gonna go oom by the end of the encounter you'd benefit more from doing that extra bit of damage you never know when it can mean the difference between life and death and every little bit counts. Same logic applies to cone of cold, unless specifically you need the mana to spam it on CD you might as well use max rank.
---
The community outrage is *really* fuckin funny. This kinda shit is what the mid 00s internet was all about.
---
Sure MC is pretty dull, but places like ZG and AQ20 are legitimately fun even for a Mythic Legion/BFA player. Same with most of Dire Maul.
---
I wish Vanilla saw more high end 5 man content towards the end of its life cycle though, that would have been great.
---
felt really bad for soda, he got cucked so hard. He would have won against snutz 100%
---
Tank, healer and 3 dps is the party recipe! :)
---
I don’t think you lose durability from getting PKed unless you choose to ressurect a graveyard but I don’t much remember how it worked in TBC/WotLK let alone vanilla which I stopped right before TBC came out because I wasn’t 60 yet and druids were awful lol.
---
As for when and where you can be attacked, well anywhere actually that isn’t an instanced dungeon (only you and your group/raid can enter the same dungeon). That said there’s a color system for zones that represents the threat each poses to you which sort of reflects the practical limitations of your being ganked in certain areas:
---
Green: these are zones controlled by your faction and include major cities, towns, starting zones, and other early leveling zones. These are safest areas in game and if you plan to start week 1 its competition with other players on your own faction for mobs you’ll need to worry the most about. The cities are full of npc guards that deter even rogues from entering until much later in the game. Even then cities will only be unsafe if the opposing faction raids them (which you’ll get plentiful warning to) as its dangerous to gank there for even 60 rogues let alone other classes. The starting zones arent 100% safe but in my experience neither faction bothers as there’s not much to gain harassing level 5’s plus reinforcements are quickly called in as your 60’s won’t take kindly to these areas being Griefed. As you get into ancillary leveling zones assuming it’s still early on in the servers life your still fine but as the server ages areas like crossroads on horde side are more exposed and thus common griefing targets but you shouldn’t find it a huge hindrance to your leveling. Green zones involve next to no PvP especially at sever launch.
---
Note: there are popular instances the opposing faction may want to do in your green zones like Scarlet monastery, gomergan(sp), or deadmines. Which may result in some pvp threats around your level. It’s also relevant to note that both undead and night elf zones are on the opposing factions continents making them more susceptible to the opposing faction if only due to ease of access (although I think needs are pretty safe because I don’t remember horde needing anything and their starting zone is an island.
---
Orange: this is contested territory and where you’ll spend the lions share of your time leveling. These zones are where you’ll experience your first taste of cross faction PvP as they tend to have both alliance and horde quest hubs or even shared quest hub like in STV. The danger of each zone depends on its popularity for leveling and higher level world PvP all of which depends heavily on how old the server is. Certain zones contain end game raids, dungeons, or gold farming spots that present an extra danger in mature servers especially during peak raiding hours. But assuming your in at the start it’s run ins with players in your level range you need to worry about since these are shared zones. The flow of the game naturally makes contested zones more dangerous (aka leveling/questing paths, end game content etc.) and that varies from zone to zone. Basically it’s not the color of the zone that matters or determines how safe an area is (your PvP flagged everywhere) but rather how people play the zones so some contested areas may feel relatively safe while others are like STV or TM/SS can be brutal war zones. So “contested” contains the broadest range of PvP experience and frequency from practically a green zone to enter at your own risk. But that’s the fun of it, to brave highly contested zones for their huge xp or item rewards or just the thrill of outplaying someone.
---
Notes: while there’s guards at most faction quest hubs they aren’t always as strong as say green zone guards thus offering less protection but there’s no shame in kiting opponents into them. Quests offer a lot of xp so if it’s between losing xp on mobs and losing time on tanks you may want to duo, trio, or even full group up to finish quests in hostile areas assuming the quest goal can be shared between all members otherwise I’d keep it to two st most (one dps, one healer is great) or three with warrior tops.
---
Red zones: these are the opposite of green zones. They are the safest zones for the opposing faction. Getting to them is time consuming and often dangerous. There’s also little reason to enter these zones so your unlikely to have friendly players and there will be no friendly npc’s and few quests; also it’s where the highest density of the opposing faction will be including 60’s. Like I said the zone system is sort of organically enforced by the nature of WoW. Of course there are a few instances where you’ll find yourself entering enemy territory including dungeons, certain quests (I think almost exclusively for dungeons), city raids, if your some sort of exploration junkie, or if you just want to grief in a high risk area. There was a UD frost mage who was well known even on alliance and he would freely visit ironforge to duel. Red is a warning not a restriction.
---
Conclusion: your PvP flagged the same in every zone, but different zones offer different degrees and kinds of challenges. Like the tunnel entrance to the goblin city in STV, a popular leveling zone both factions will need to enter and exit the town from there making it a popular gank spot. I both hate and love STV, it’s a deadly jungle with a narrow single road that’s seen more than its share of honor kills making it not much safer than the jungle itself, If the mobs don’t kill you the players probably will. STV is one of the first zones that will make you hate the opposing faction. It will provide thrills and rage in equal measure. It may even break you in the right server conditions. But that’s world PvP. That’s what you sign up for. You might want to keep an alt on hand because that zone literally caused me to uninstall at one point. I’m chiller now so hopefully that won’t be a problem lol. All that said I think PvP severs are worth the hassle because the experience is second to none. Battlegrounds don’t come close to replicating the sort of PvP experience you gain leveling in the world. You can always use an alt if your camped.
---
Most likely done by a gm, i doubt those degenerates would hs on their own.
---
I would say probably about 13-14 of your item slots will have intellect.   Let’s just say they have an average of 15 intellect. You would be looking at bout an extra 150-160 mana. Now that’s not including buffs and consumables.     And less than 1% crit.   Of course it depends on how much int each piece gives but in my calculation it was 15 int per piece which may be a little too gracious
---
There is no stopping a smart, well played troll in classic. Unfortunately part of the beauty of classic involves having to deal with griefers. Can't have the good without the bad in this situation. You just gonna have to deal with it
---
Lol so when someone jumps onto the field of a football game, you expect the players to kick the shit out of him and carry him out? 
---
You want people to stop mid duel and kill the people trolling? 
---
All I have to do is wait till they start fighting, jump in, kill one of them, i die to spectators, but it’s fine because I ruined the duel. They have to reduel. I do it again. 
---
But hey, “just kill them” is your answer so I don’t expect an actual reply.
---
i would suggest holding it at the stv arena and spectators helping out with security to prevent legends like trollgodx from stealing the thunder
---
Time to sharpen your torches and light your pitchforks!
---
I agree, if I recovered my account I would also be showing off stuff like what was in my bank and inventory. OP hid their bars and name
---
yeah, just kill them
---
I think they flipped it when they added it back with archaeology in Cata.
---
Jesus Christ. Gotta get that YouTube money.
---
"Harassment, “griefing,” abusive behavior or chat, conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others, deliberate inactivity or disconnecting, and/or any other activity which violates Blizzard’s Code of Conduct or In-Game Policies."
---
Literally from the ToS, nobody "has the right" to grief other player's experience.
---
Report them for griefing and move on.
---
I don't see how this is more important than botting caravans or gold sellers. I'd say they are all about the same and there is nothing more you can do but report them and move on.
---
"ok let me swap to my full tier 2 gear set.....EVERYONE, SWAP TO YOUR FULL T2...PROBLEM SOLVED...."
---
It doesn't matter if it's a "blizzard made thing" or not. If they see it as an promotion event (with high enough viewership), any obvious troll gonna get booted, as you saw near the end.
---
I knew what was coming. Look at the game today and tell me it's not a glorified chat room. By then pservers were around, guess what I did.
---
You think people care about their reputation on their mains??? That’s what they want. They want to be famous on stream for ruining everyone time. Just wait till release, you’re gonna have so many rogues camping streamers and having their name on screen for tens of thousands of people to see. 
---
There’s no stopping this unless we get GM help and to punish the people greifing.
---
cAtA aNd mOp  WeRe tHe ReAl ArEnA eXpAnSIoNs
---
I don't want him to be bullshitting, it is exceptional.  BUT, it reeks of bs hahahahah
---
Those duels vs Jellybeans were super-close. Too bad a griefer had to possibly affect the outcome.
---
That's a very good point. I don't even mind if I'm last in dps. Just as long as I don't lose a raid spot for it and in turn recognized for the utility. I think retail wow has ruined my perception of class value in classic wow.
---
Lots more in 1.12 though.
---
Tips and these steamers are just lazy, they didn't even know where to duel at the start.
---
There are plenty spots in the map where low levels can't get in due to high level mobs, that said, I don't like steamers and I don't want classic to be their playground, most of them never cared about classic in the first place and are just jumping on the band wagon.
---
I hope blizzard don't start giving steamers privileges and banning people for shit reasons, if you don't want to be griefed/streamsniped, use your brain.
---
Do mouseover macros even work in classic? Im in beta but never thought to try one. Maybe I will tonight.
---
No he’s undead actually
---
The matchup is different v. Felhunter, as witnessed in the video itself. Venruki doesn't try to play a kiting and outlasting game against FHs, but rather attempts to go all-in and race down Snutz. It's impossible to outlast against a FH+Drain strategy, so his best bet (which won for him) is to hang close, use roots for Shatter instead of control, and avoid Poly.
---
Report them for what exactly?
---
Seems you’re a dumbass who doesn’t understand arguments or how WoW works at all. Enjoy struggling to clear SFK 4 weeks into classic nerd
---
Yup. Even simple corpse-camping has limits afaik.
---
Alts never really existed in classic until later because it is so hard to level and maintain 2 characters.  Remember you need to do all the time consuming atunments such as the onyxia one just to get into the raids.  I'm not saying that people didn't have alts that sometimes came to raids but unless you have tons and tons of time to play I wouldn't count on being able to raid on multiple characters.
---
I would play whatever you want.  You should be able to find a raiding guild either class.
---
Griefing.
---
Ah! Kk. I guess I’m not to surprised that it wasn’t an isolated incident. I’m also not surprised that your friend trolled with it. Hard to counter stuff like that on a PvE server. &gt;_&lt;
---
Selling accounts was pretty real too.
---
We brought Resto Druids (Innervate, Combat Rez) and an OT (best add pickup tank) throughout most of AQ40. Didn't finish Naxx but nobody on our realm did. So it can be done, and guilds did it in classic.
---
One macro spell rotations and macros being able to change keybinds in combat were also in Vanilla, you think Blizzard is going to bring those back? /s
---
Honestly, trollgodX was the star of the show today.
---
The tournament was pretty boring to be honest. The. Trollgodx showed up and the salt flowed from all the streamers and made the whole thing very enjoyable me to watch.
---
Paladin too I believe.
---
God I hope the OP is just a troll. How could some one think this would even be a thing. The Zin'rokh skin didn't change until path 3.2. Classic is based off patch 1.12. Simple google search would have resolved your own concern.
---
Probably sold
---
Or keep them around lvl 50ish, where most classes are fleshed out but no gear tier shenanigans.
---
We call those people "morons."
---
Luckiest, I got a chance to experience it.   
---
Unluckiest, didn't get into the beta.
---
no, because blizzard has specifically mentioned things like that
---
all these people are wrong, i have about 6 night elf hunters atleast, im just fucking nuts and REALLY enjoy leveling.
---
They do
---
only slow and blind people ask for spell batching because they lack reaction time
---
But, within gameplay rules how is it griefing?
---
As others have suggested try retail and see your ping-it will be quite similar. Back in the day I used to play on Garona US and while living in Sydney Australia my ping would flactuate between 250ms (on a good day) to 450ms.
---
He called me a nerd! Me feelies!
---
It's great that I get people to line up so I can purge them from ever having to hear from them again! B-locked!
---
&gt; they share diminishing return since like 1.7.
---
Do you have a source for this? Scatter was moved to a disorient somewhere down the line, but Freezing trap was never classified as such as far as I am aware. If they aren't similar effects, they shouldn't be sharing a DR.
---
Scatter Shot being a disorient: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19503/scatter-shot
---
Meanwhile, it lists Freezing Trap as its own frozen category:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3355/freezing-trap-effect
---
WoWWiki lists Freezing Trap as a sleep: 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Sleep_effect?oldid=173188
---
And there's much later discussions about Scatter Shot and Freezing Trap sharing DRs as a nerf to what they originally were, e.g. https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1293455-Scatter-Shot-now-shares-DR-with-Freezing-Trap &amp; http://www.skill-capped.com/forums/showthread.php?25346-Scatter-shot-DR-s-with-Freezing-trap-now in 2013. Are you sure this was changed much earlier? 
---
Scatter into Freezing Trap with shared DR would lead to a 5 sec Trap, which seems awfully short going by memory (granted going by memory seems about irrelevant).
---
I wish I could get my original account back, but unfortunately I used a fake name and no longer have the key, so there's no way to prove that I owned it.
---
No thanks fag
---
I'm this cousin for sure. I don't know how many times I've made hunters because I've thought "I wanna change their appearance but don't wanna pay for a race change. Might as well just start from the beginning!"
---
Blizzard *could* make an instanced dueling arena. But hey, #nochanges amirite?
---
You reap what you sow, this is vanilla
---
Pretty sure even Reckful said Snutz was probably the best mechanical player ever, while Azael was probably the smartest player.
---
Have you never been annoyed by another player?  What this guy did doesn't directly violate anything in the TOS.
---
You're trying to justify a ban based on how a person should conduct themselves online.  That's the LEAST Vanilla thing I can think of.  This community isn't ready for Classic.  This shits a dumpster fire because of the community.
---
Quinn was fucking hilarious all day particularly whenever Payo was involved.
---
It's the same thing... the change to the macro API is what removed the functionality of targeting totems, changing keybinds in combat, and much more complex macros.
---
Wow, had no idea that is a thing.
---
I think it's too early to say that you just have to deal with it. WoW is such a big world with so many things you can do. I feel like there is probably a way that we just haven't thought of yet to deal with this type of griefing.
---
Thorium Brotherhood, yeah. Loooots of BRD for that shit. Only use is really for MC, maybe a little BWL, all it has is stam and FR.
---
Would you consider camping someone while questing griefing? 
---
If it was for 3 hours?
---
Anytime there is something organized and someone comes to interfere with it - it's griefing.
---
You can pit any spin on "he's allowed to walk wherever he wants to in game" but he is intentionally walking in a specific spot during a specific time to grief.
---
The end.
---
Eh, your link leads me to a wow guild site ?_?
---
Seems like a very small issue lol
---
I don't remember ever not dragging new abilities to my bar when I purchased them.
---
Shadow priests are great in 1v1 at 60, but not so great in team fights due to severe mana limitations. 
---
I was torn between priest, lock and mage. My deciding factor was that melee is incredibly popular in vanilla and I want to be able to kit fools all day. So I went with mage. I dont want to facetank damage. I want to be a mobile god.
---
Oh of course. Making this about expressing your streamer hatred again. You guys are the whiniest people in the community. Streamers are playing a classic. Deal with it.
---
#NoChanges and all but I'm glad this one is in.
---
Playing PServs with no tooltip and having to put pictures that remotely looked like what your want to do was annoying as fk.
---
Right, but that's no different from any other system, while loot council itself will likely be *why* it collapses.
---
Even if you had the key they would probably ask for ID. To verify the person making request is the one who owned the account.
---
Made an account once to give a friend a char it got hacked and he was unable to recover it cause of the name.
---
Thats why you have hidden bidding. Bids go to the lootmaster via whisper. Good way to get rid of all DKP.
---
Yeah griefing is one thing when there are consequences, or you can at least be held accountable in some way ( or someone can try to hold you accountable ).  But since they had to hold this in an uncontested zone there was no way they could handle this person. 
---
You could argue that they should have this tournament in a contested zone but that would have made things worse because then you'd have alliance dipping in.  So as annoying as this was too watch it was the lesser of two evils. And they got off easy with just the 1 or 2 guys. 
---
However I do think buddy should have been temp banned at least. The precious community that everyone here goes on about so much can't hold him accountable. Impossible to find  out his main character. Can't kill him since he's not flagged. There's nothing you could have done to him. He would have just logged back on his main and kept going about his day. There's just no recourse, and that's not right.
---
Why can’t you just be happy that you’re getting classic ?
---
All you need to do is not stream it. If you want to share the tournament, record the footage from all the points of view you want, cut it together, and post it on youtube.

They weren't griefing though, it's called PVP. If they don't like it then go play on an RP server
---
Consider Jellybeans got 2nd at blizzcon last year, the hunters were not  bad.
---
You can download retail starter edition for free to try.
---
If that works classic will since it has less graphical requirements.
---
Scroll down for a detailed explanation of loot lists.
---
Does it physically hurt to be this fucking brain dead?
---
You can say that about every class. Such a tiring trope.

Insert hunter
---
Insert rogue
---
Etc

Oh em g he's trying to screw up duels!!!!! Wow such a huge offence!

I had auto attack bound to 1 till cata for every character. For some reason I just liked know auto attack was working.
---
these are vanilla macros, classic will use modern scripting
---
So PVP happened on a PVP server? GMs don't get involved with those matters.
---
It's not the type of action that a GM will interfere with. They didn't then and won't now.
---
I played a hunter for the whole duration of vanilla (i didn't play TBC as hunter), and i was duelling like every night in Dun morogh. I can't say when but it pissed me off when they added it, and DR on those 2 abilities were present at the end of vanilla. I'll search for a source but i am certain it was like this.
---
The same faction running on top of people dueling wasn't pvp.
---
Sorry I didn't realize you weren't informed on what was going on -
---
If it was alliance attacking the horde during the event then yes it would 100% not ve griefing.
---
Uninformed.
---
Would not have expected that a mage could beat a lock.
---
Yeah same been following him since the beta invites went out, plays the same thing I'm going to roll and was surprised with the quality streams. He's got another fan now. Was happy for him today he earned it.
---
I'd be willing to bet 3 Big Macs that this isn't true.
---
Yea, warriors are special in vanilla.  
---
I really don't care how many people choose to play it, because at the end of the day, no other class can be in that 'brotherhood' of people who experienced true leveling hell.
---
I wonder when the loot is rolled though. Could've been no drop with you in the raid.
---
Yes, it seems you are.
---
Lol arguably everyone’s game play experience is greatly improved with less clickers.
---
Mouse cursor seems to be somethimes spazzing out for a lot of streamers
---
I don't care about streamers, but if people are getting banned for "griefing" and streamsniping them, then it's a problem.
---
It's stupidly broken at 30, the level you get it.  It tapers off quite a bit as you get to 60.  1.6 or so was the heyday.
---
It’s basically intentionally ruining someone’s else’s enjoyment of something.
---
Somebody had to say it
---
Anything after rank 10 requires you to dedicate 4+ hours of straight up kill grinding to compete.   Honestly.. I might be underestimating just how long you have to play each day.
---
Broad question - asks specifics pls.
---
If you don't want to know what happened that's on you - but griefing is when someone intentionally goes out of their way to ruin another players playtime over a long period of time.
---
Griefing is NOT camping the opposing factions corpse.
---
do you use that for playing the game instead of your keyboard, like have run bound on there?
---
If you want to do less damage than the tank, go balance.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
QQ same faction is following people dueling and tbagging them!
---
Every hate post you make just fuels the person to do it more.
---
Also god way to have people who agree who gets what on the side so that you have more dkp to get other items.
---
The amount of people that seem to think using a staff on a warrior is bad somehow is insanely high. 
---
Literally some of the best guaranteed two handers you can get are staves.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy
---
My mom paid my sub so technically this isn't true for everyone
---
Where can you go in the world where you don't risk one of your duelists getting ganked by an alliance rogue during the finals series, where it is also hard for lvl 1s to go?
---
Part of the Vanilla experience for many were RP-PvP servers. The better question is why does it upset you that some want that experience again? An experience you don’t have to participate in?
---
Pretty sure blizzard are the ones who make and enforce the rules. Not you sweetie.
---
You haven't played a game 5 hours straight?
---
A balance spec is actually one of the best pvp specs but you don’t get moonkin form. 
---
In raids it’s bad don’t do it.
---
Surprisingly similar to my thought process lol
---
I think the furthest most semi casual/semi serious raiding guilds will get is clearing BWL.  AQ40 ramps up the time investment to insane levels really.
---
What do they get between 30-40 that makes them so good?
---
Druids are a much worse matchup, like if he vs'd soda I don't think he ever wins. Warlock is winnable if he plays it perfectly
---
Hooray you have a dumb opinion! Congratulations!
---
I'm very happy i'm getting Classic my friend! Just hoping that other people feel the same as me and if not that's cool too =)
---
I think what's worse is threads like these are upvoted...yet it's someone bitching about the orientation of a fucking weapon model that changes very little in the grand scheme of things.
---
The OP is literally threatening to not play the game if they release the model in that manner.  Seriously?  Who but basement dwelling incels or socially inept adults make ultimatum threats like that about games?
---
Before the event starts have a warlock summoning group ready at a hard to get to location, like Kharazan crypts. Have them summon the participants and them relocate to another spot, in case a location change is needed.
---
My wife’s practice treats your condition. You need some help.
---
You know how long that would take if every duel had to be reset?
---
Like at what point do you actually blame the person who is in the wrong? Like it’s a bannable offense yet you keep putting the blame on the streamers.
---
You are all puppets!!
---
At least he isn't butthurt. It's only a game and an unofficial tournament btw. If pixels make you this mad along with player interaction stick to your single player RPGs.
---
Hard to argue with that.
---
I play a gnome mage. Ignore the haters, play what you like.
---
And all of those places are in contested areas where it's even easier to grief an event.
---
So much for using your brain.
---
Do you mind me asking what field of practice she's in? So I can seek out others.
---
What other consequence would end the behavior as quickly?
---
People will be using massive Discords to do this same job, I was just hoping to try and make the process as simple as I could
---
Fine for pvp. And fine for pve but you have to try hard (like get an obscure item from gnomeregan several times per day) or you will be deadweight.
---
Why not have the duels inside an instance? Can get a group to clear out the dueling arena and rotate people in and out as they move up the brackets. Would mean though if you wanted to watch you'd have to watch the stream. Is that such a bad thing for streamers though?
---
I’v been playing eso until classic is released. Having a lot more fun compared to retail wow. If classic wasn’t coming I’d probably full switch to ESO
---
Clicking everything all the time means you are performing just about as slowly as is possible.  
---
With that said, I do think you can be a hybrid of sorts.  If you keybind at least your important spells that you are using 90% of the time, and click CDs or other misc things, then you'd be fine.  
---
But to click everything?  It is just way too slow; it also means you are likely keyboard turning, and if you aren't, then you are missing out on valuable time you could be doing anything else.
---
And @cursor could easily be lumped into the same post.
---
Certainly, she’s a licensed psychologist. Gaming addiction and other sexual disorders are on her treatment list. Most therapists can tackle this with you.
---
1. Do I want to this class?
---
2. Play class I want.
---
3 ?????
---
4. Profit
---
Whatever the next fresh vanilla private server was this year just like the previous 8 years.
---
Totally forgot about that! Man, expansion transitions are always interesting. Remember when TBC was ending and they sorta gave everyone a huge buff and nerfed all the raids to the point to could pug them easily.
---
Ok so - this is where we talk about weapon speed and dps and how it correlates to overall damage. 
---
In the 1.12 patch - weapon speed is normalized. This simply means that for abilities there is no attack speed multiplier in the damage formulas. 
---
This means that a weapon with slower speed around the same quality as a weapon with higher speed will yield similar dps.  
---
The reason you want your mainhand to be the slower weapon (all else being equal) is the damage range will naturally be higher and thus instant attacks like sinister strike only calculate based off the attack damage ranger and do not give one fuck about dps or speed of the weapon. 
---
This means that if for some reason you have a very high level dagger with fast speed but the damage range is still higher than your slow off hand sword (this probably will not happen if you are playing the game normally but let’s just say it is for a teaching point) then you’ll take the dagger. 
---
Instant attacks ignore weapon speed...so all things being relatively equal 
---
Slow swords in the main hand - and a faster offhand to help poison applications (assuming dps is equal)
---
Because your attacks use main hand damage and are instant. You want a slow wpn with high damage. Your off hand is fast for poison application.. as for dps you could have a 9-11 dmg  wpn with a 1 sec attack speed which would net you 10 dps. Or a 10-30 dmg wpn with a 2 second attack speed which would also get you (if my math is right..) 10 dps. But with instant attacks (sinister strike, etc) you are going to have much higher damaging attacks with the slow weapon.
---
Appreciate it.
---
And that Druid?  Former rank 1 druid Sodapoppin.
---
I'm one of these "a lot of off-specs are viable!" people, but unfortunately even I have to admit the futility of Balance in classic PvE Raids. I did ZG with a handful of Balance Druids, nice people, but in longer boss fights their damage massively declined even using Innervate on themselves.    
---
It is a darn shame, and they got a fair shot in BC and beyond, but in classic they're really only remarkable for fun burst potential in PvP (and a few quirky shifting builds).
---
This is smart.
---
The fact that a barbarian like Trollgodx got into the beta but countless educated, well-dressed and respectable gentleman didn't is further proof that God doesn't exist.
---
Normally I'd say yes, but they did it for hours even after being asked to stop, and followed them around while they moved locations.
---
I think there's at least a case for harassment.
---
You'll do less damage than a hunter pet.
---
You'll do less damage than the tank.
---
You'll do less damage than a mage AFK for half the fight.
---
You'll do less damage than a rogue does in JUST magic damage with lvl 24 Shadow Oil on his weapons.
---
Yeah, it really is that bad.
---
Yeah, I added that in as an edit earlier. I think it's a great suggestion for beta tournaments, although it basically makes it so that you can only watch it via streams, which might be bad post-launch if people want to watch it in-game.
---
They were decent in 5 mans, but you can't do anything meaningful in raids what so ever.
---
Classic private server :)
---
If you aren't making your chances as high as possible by farming everything you can, I also don't think you care about lowering your chances of success because some people want to play a bad spec.
---
Honestly just replace your auto attack button in slot 1 with /startattack so you can spam it without turning off your attacks
---
Funny post, thanks for sharing.
---
I’m far from butthurt. I didn’t really care that much at all, he only affected one duel and the outcome wouldn’t have been different if he wasn’t there. There were tons of other people running through the duels too. But what’s worse, making one comment saying the guy was annoying or making 100 comments defending him? Kind of feels like one party in that situation is more “butthurt” than the other.
---
Thank you for the mention
---
Glorified chat room? that's funny because everyone complains that nobody ever talks in retail lol You can try to make it seem like you knew what was going to happen to wow, but in reality mom stopped paying for your sub so you started playing private servers. Not to mention almost everybody agrees that tbc was the best version of the game. But considering you cant tell the difference between taurens and blood elves, I shouldn't be suprised that you have no idea what you're talking about. :D
---
&gt; Gotta get with the times and adjust.
---
seems you're the one who has to get with the times, seeing as those trolls no longer have beta access blizzard doesn't agree with you and this clearly falls under the griefing rules (they were also in back in 2005)
---
I love these polls because it's so interesting to see the results change over time and across different polls.  This is the 4th or 5th I've seen recently and they're all so different.
---
ESO would be a fun mmo to play to pass the time
---
Paying the game in an unintended manner for the purpose of annoy other players.
---
Pvp is a thing, camping a player is part of pvp, not greifing.
---
Standing on a totem to prevent a player from selecting it is an unintended consequence of existing mechanics, and if you do it with the purpose of interfering with someone's game, then you are griefing. 
---
What trollgodx did is not comparable to when a funeral was attacked.
---
I hear that argument a lot but the amount of people who are going to play classic and played on private servers is quite small. 
---
PvP builds are highly dependent on the individual and how your play style is. My recommendation would be to try a few ones out before making any final decision.
---
You could call yourself a no-life guy as well, because you spent hours watching a duel and getting mad for whatever dumb reason.
---
People can play games however they want. Why and how can you fairly assume he's a no life and a waste of organs? I hope people say that about your kids.
---
&gt;playing a character in cloth PvP was a massive liability  
---
&gt;everyone has their own fantasy of what vanilla was  
---
I wasn't even taking sides in your argument, only calling out one place you were undoubtedly wrong: respective scaling and the existence of spell power. I don't need to hear anecdotes about one-shot combos from the end of Vanilla; I played Vanilla, which based on what I've read here makes one of us.
---
If you think cloth is so bad that taking one to a BG is an active detriment and you don't want or need the buffs and utility they bring, then don't play one and don't invite them to your groups. Just as a favour to me, stop raving at strangers on the internet, too.
---
Someone with beta access needs to report this, I tried to make a post in the classic beta forums but you need beta access to do so... So can't report because I wasn't invited
---
Going out of your way to harass someone intentionally for an extended period of time.
---
Corpse camping is okay 3 times.. 4 times... 5 times. for an hour maybe but more than that - it may be considered griefing since it will be subjective. One can say the player could have taken a res sickness and avoided the camp or logged into an alt. 
---
But what will be griefing is - knowing their alt and camping their alt as well. Stream sniping them. Chasing the player down after a res sickness and killing them again. 
---
When you have shown full INTENTION to ruin someone play. but the occassional corpse camping for near hour, 4-5 times is okay.
---
don't worry, everyone will be experiencing this during phase 1 - brace yourself for some epic ragequits
---
I think this is the greatest post on this sub, ever.
---
Yes, which I'm letting you know, they won't involve themselves in this.
---
I leveled a warlock and a paladin at the same time. Free mount at level 40 and 2 completely different playstyles so I would not get bored. 😂
---
I'm sure they did...
---
It didn't have anything to do with PvP though.
---
Why do so many people feel like they have to pretend like they know about something. You don't always have to press the reply button.
---
Bold of you to assume I'm not just going to make them all at the same time and switch between them at my pleasure.
---
Given this was asked in /r/classicwow, I'll add some more detail. It was when someone had fun by using the game to make your experience terrible. This often took the form of ganking you (attacking you by surprise) and then corpse camping (stiking around until you resurrected so they could keep doing it over and over. 
---
If you are on a PVP server and they are your level, you can argue that attacking you is part of the game. Where it really becomes griefing is when they do it over and over. The really bad cases was when a high level, well geared character would go around lower level zones easily killing characters who had no chance.
---
This is one of the main reasons for have PVE vs PVP servers. It is much much harder to grief on a PVE server as you are protected from ganking. You simply can't attack characters from the other faction.
---
If you are a casual player and don't want to engage (e.g. fight) the opposite faction and just enjoy the game, then chose a PVE server.
---
Was she blonde? Remember a bunch of her videos, think she was demonology. Wearing felheart horns. Loved her videos and she was a great inspiration but can't remember her name for the life of me
---
He couldve done many things, parking locks on different high level locations to summon whoever is dueling, even on contested areas with hard access, people wouldn't be able to follow up.
---
Aw, damn, I wanted to troll him.
---
From memory it was a +5% int? If so per 100 int you get an extra 5 points. From looking at various sources per 59.5 int you get 1% crit. Even if you were to hit the 1000int mark, which is not possible, you would be looking at +50 extra int which is just under 1% spell crit. In other words its a nice little bonus to have but its far from being a game changer. I would focus more on what you find more pleasing to look at/play as and other benefits-for example humans get diplomacy which is +10% which can make rep grinds less painful.
---
Problem. I just recovered my first wow account with my first 60.... a warrior. Now I’m all undecided again.
---
It's an issue for those of us who continued playing past Wrath, when you didn't have to put new ranks on your bars (first they auto-replaced, then spells scaled and ranks died). It's been lost in my muscle memory. I'll definitely beneift from this truck
---
Thank you guys! I think i’m gonna go combat now because using swords seems super cool.
---
He is a good player (mechanically, at least he was back in the day), he's just not a smart player
---
Soon-ish the Halo Master Chief collection for PC. No official release date for Reach yet, but it is expected this year.
---
We never really had a problem since everyone had around the same DKP. It's just if you were willing to spend 100% of all your points on a specific item. Personally i find DKP tedious.
---
Found the guy haha
---
With Classic, they built the game on the 7.3.5 release version which includes further macro possibilities
---
Because this is Trump's America. Making Azeroth great again.
---
Have to test it.  It's irresponsible as any kind of software developer to launch a part of a product without it being tested.  Heck, if they'd had non-internal testing on AG40, they might have figured out C'thun wasn't possible to beat without pushing it live and having someone tell them that it was literally impossible (which is kind of embarrassing... but hey, at least it landed that guy a job which has put him in a major position with the company).  Some bugs will always get through to the end, but you want to minimize them as much as possible.
---
The "competitive" crowd might not like to hear this, but having a final product that's as smooth as possible is infinitely more important than any "world not-so-first race."  (And seriously, let's stop with the "world first" stuff.  It's used as a joke with beta streamers, but in the live product, you're not somehow magically going back in time to finish any of these raids before they were originally downed in 2004-2005, so there are no "world firsts" in WoW Classic.)
---
Yup
---
Griefing in 2019 can be summed up as playing the game in any way that someone thinks is wrong.
---
In 2004, it would be unrelenting verbal, or in game harassment (such as corpse camping for extended periods of time).  Note that for corpse camping much be extreme and excessive as even in the game manual it states corpse camping as a normal thing to expect.
---
Feral is decent in PvP and in 5 mans. 
---
It drastically falls off in raid content.  
---
If your goal is to join a serious raiding guild, then feral might make things difficult (not saying impossible, but you will have to try much harder than everyone else at every given moment).
---
Shouldn't have a problem getting in a semi casual/semi serious raiding guild though.
---
Yes but will they be in the released product? it is a change after all
---
For every 40 players there’s 1 main tank. There’s off tanks who are more dps specced and plenty of room for dps warriors because of how strong they are. Basically you’ll like 8-10 warriors per raid. It’s not like you won’t find a raid spot just to be the 1 out of every 40 in a raid guild is highly unlikely because not every guild will raid at a high level. Of course if you level your warrior first at server launch and do so quickly you’ll have a higher chance but more than likely you’ll dps or ot. Warriors are a high population class but should still be in high demand at least for dps.
---
Rogues are fun don’t get me wrong but a dime a dozen. Everyone wants to be that guy from world of roguecraft with the pve and PvP gear.  Of course being in early and being dedicated helps but the fact is that rogue will be a difficult one to find s good raid spot.
---
Fundamentally broken class through most of vanilla, and therefore classic. Balance being the most broken part.
---
You dont. 
---
This is a basic fundamental of vanila; act like an ass-hat and thats what you will be known for.
---
lmao @ ur viewing experience
---
You can be banned for aggressively seeking out specific people in order to disrupt their play or kill them repeatedly.
---
It's the difference between happening to kill the same person because you camped a quest hub and going out of your way to kill the same person because you find it amusing.
---
Lmao. I was mid 20s when I played. I played from beta to launch, got BE and Tauren mixed up for a second - it was about 12 or so years ago - and here you are upset and emotional on the classicwow sub defending retail, hahaha.
---
I of course have no knowledge of TBC - like I said I was too cool for school and quit the day it launched - I didn't make it  a life goal to remember what race/class combos so years later a little kid wouldn't throw a hissy 😂🤣
---
Classic is coming back in no small part because it was a better **social** game. RP is a social experience. Therefore it makes a lot of sense to encourage RP-ing, since it ties in so heavily with what they were trying to do with classic.
---
/1 and /2 like we did back in 2004. Don’t try to solve a solved problem 😄
---
Whilst true that deep wounds makes blood spill, that's a different animation than the basic attack one, which is baseline for every class in the game when dealing melee blows. 
---
Hell even npcs have it when hitting on melee
---
Continue playing Vanilla Private servers, and probably whatever the next Fresh server would be.
---
Ok, but at the end of the day, a guild that progresses isn't going to be able to bring 5+ feral druids as well as the other underperforming specs out there.  
---
Have to look at it from a broader angle.  Yes, you can get in a raiding guild as just about anything.  No, it wont be that feasible to get into a naxx40 raiding guild as an underperforming spec.
---
decent in pvp
---
trash in raids.
---
anyone have a VOD of all duels?
---
Sick of seeing all the classic content flooding my YouTube feed I love to watch them but I'm an impatient child so I started on a vanilla private servers and so did everyone else and their mother by how active those servers are at the moment.
---
Be warned anyone wanting to start playing on a private server there are many fully geared lvl 60s fully aware of the influx of new players so Lowbie ganking is incredibly common on the pvp servers so the levelling time will be drastically longer then it will be when classic launches
---
Warlocks bring bres, healthstones and summons. Bringing a lock will be just as attractive to a group. Oh and pet buffs!
---
Borderlands the since its 2 weeks after classic launch
---
i'd be dead lol
---
Casters(perplexity/tips) and venruki both said this was huge, but snutz said he didn't think it mattered cause venruki would just poly and kite the shield duration. I'm not sure who's right, just providing this for some possible discussion.
---
a gtx 1050 laptop will be much better than what im using atm. Will be more than fine
---
Its called Hyperbole.  I was being facetious.
---
It's was just my favorite sword and they flipped it. 
---
I don't know how they constructed classic and wasn't sure what version of the sword would be in it or why. I don't know the exact patch numbers, I was just taking the opportunity to highlight my favorite sword from Vanilla.
---
if i may ask how do warriors tank groups of mobs without being able to use thunderclap?
---
Pantheon when it releases. I'll still play that of course.
---
I mean obviously an action RPG is for you.  Judging by your post history you do not enjoy classic or see the value in it, which is fine.  I am sure mythic raiding is harder than anything classic can create, but if you think that is the point of classic you're definitely missing the point.  I bought BFA I literally played it for 9 days, gear was thrown at me, none of the content matters it is all a treadmill with fake difficulty.  I want a dungeon to feel like a group achievement, those same guys you said were average and had to "challenge" themselves to make classic hard, were losing their mind over their achievement of completing those dungeons under leveled.  No one gets that feeling in retail, except maybe top end raiders doing mythic raids but even those guys don't seem too excitable just glad they are finally finished playing 24 hours a day.   
---
I know this is falling on deaf ears as I said, this isn't the game you want to play and that is fine, just not sure why you're posting in every thread bashing a game that is obviously not your cup of tea.
---
It’s not incorrect. They announced that the 2nd test was a supplement to the first one as they didn’t get all the testing they needed to in the first one. So far the other two are still planned.
---
Huhm, I am pretty sure you're incorrect, the value in my beta client was defaulted to 2 too, but even setting it to 5, it does nothing. Animation missing or bugged.
---
You may be correct.
---
Cause, we do? Why do people who don't like the answer, always have to press reply and think they are right? It goes all directions Dude, it's a different POV and experience. 
---
Don't like my view and opinion, ignore and move on.
---
yep! but it was the last duel, and jellybeans lost by like 5% hp, the scatter grief legit 100% decided the outcome
---
I got Ashkandi on our first Nefarian kill. I think it was the 2nd or 3rd if the server.
---
You just wanted to make this point, didn't you?  Despite your initial premise being wrong?  Alliance could have attempted to attack the horde at any point (even though the horde wasn't pvp tagged...).  It's not griefing to engage in pvp.  That's really obvious.  Duel tournament or not.  Foreknowledge or not.  It's not griefing and it's obvious that it's not.  
---
Creating a level 1 character of the same faction and standing ontop of people for 5 hours while they try to duel is griefing and it's obvious that it is.
---
the new Torchlight, which they appear to be ruining with micro-transactions.
---
or, Borderlands 3.
---
They just don't have enough mana to do well.
---
It’s not longer it’s just further out. Still only 3 yards it just starts at the end of Tauren melee range. The downfall of Tauren hunters is against other hunters in PvP they (ally hunters) can stand in your dead zone but still range attack you.
---
Based on how Tauren hunters work I would think shamans would have “increased” spell range.
---
just keep in mind Combat swords pvp, you are dead weight against anything that's not a warrior.
---
I was a feral druid in vanilla and i 100% will not be touching that shit again.
---
&gt;Corpse camping is okay 3 times.. 4 times... 5 times. for an hour maybe but more than that - it may be considered griefing since it will be subjective
---
&gt;But what will be griefing is - knowing their alt and camping their alt as well. Stream sniping them. Chasing the player down after a res sickness and killing them again
---
&gt;When you have shown full INTENTION to ruin someone play. but the occassional corpse camping for near hour, 4-5 times is okay
---
If this is true then classic is gonna be lame, because one of the only reasons im going to play this game is to camp people,  this is just retarded. If you don't want to get killed/camped/streamsniped, just roll on a PvE server.
---
My good luck moment was solo healing UBRS. Played a priest.
---
My alt combat rogue always used 2 swords, at times 2 maces if they were available. He had the Dal’Rend blades and later I took his spoiled ass to BWL and Ony, my guild carried me and I picked up Viskag, CTS and Maladath. Good gear in its day and nicely mogs today.
---
Yay!
---
Resto druids weren't underperforming, and having a single feral druid in as an OT isn't a big deal.
---
Problem comes when you try to fit a bunch of cats, boomkins, ret pallys, arcane mages, etc. into your progression guild.
---
The game of Life.
---
I almost wanted to tell him that it would in fact change just so he wouldn't. Classic doesn't need this type of attitude thats for sure. Although I suspect in this case the OP will likely be one of those players that stops playing 3 weeks in when their level 30 and complains how hard the game is and doesn't under why the quests don't show you a marker on where to go complete them.
---
You realize, what he did doesn't fall under any of that. A dueling tournament, isn't protected by those rules.
---
Just duel in a contested zone where they cant res if you kill them like caverns of time. Anyone who fucks around kill them and they get spirit res. Waiting on gms takes too long
---
"griefed over 100k players"
---
I had no idea there was 100k players in the beta, all on one realm. Since when?
---
Honestly, I think you could have just stopped at your earlier statement.  
---
Bottom line is that a single boomkin, cat and ret pally can be in the raid... but that is basically it for a 'good' guild.  And even those are there by the good graces of the people leading said guild.  
---
If people roll a feral cat in mass in hopes of raiding, then people will be disappointed to say the least.
---
Is this up on YouTube yet?
---
make sure to report it i guess, see if theyll do something about it. hope they do and good eye OP
---
When I do play wow, yes, I use it to control the character run and such.
---
 Realistically, you have more  buttons than a keyboard due to the proximity of the keys + instead of having to a awkward contorl+soft alternate keybind, you can just use the thumb buttons and eybinds. Yes, it does take a few of the 20 buttons. But so does using a keyboard. 
---
If you really need more buttons, you can still use your keyboard for non-urgent stuff like mounts. It's legitimately superior than using a keyboard in every way (other than the cost to get an extra accessory but, its sorta w/e in that regard. it works with other games too). 
---
On retail I rmeber also using some addon that let you use a keybind to dospaly a wheel that held a bunch of other abilities/items/mounts. You did have to click them but it was still fasting than normal clicking and it saved space on bUI. I expect an addon like it will be made for Classic too. Add in gaming mice and I cannot possibly fathom anyone needing anything more than the OW+Mouse+addons, even hard core players
---
It's 100% bannable.  Read the TOS if you want a source.
---
Blizzard give us blood
---
No, you cant. It's been tested.
---
I would be getting much more hyped for Pantheon, but other than that, I'd probably be diving into more single player games, and expanding my console game library.
---
Thanks for the spoiler. I was going to watch the vod when I got home.
---
This guy gets it. 
---
If you want to do something that doesn't fit the puzzle, then you need to take initiative and likely lead something.
---
the only stat I cared about for my armor was literally "armor".  That's what it was for right?  I wish I could recover my old middle school characters to see what they were wearing.  
---
Pretty sure I tried to evenly distribute skills between skill trees too, and was surprised when my friend said he put all of his into the same one.
---
He get crushed by a random xD
---
I just don't get that. I knew a few main Druid's in Vanilla and they all were geared to the teeth and viable contributed in endgame content even AQ 40 and Nax in Feral/Resto.
---
In PvP balance is fun and effective, though other classes accomplish the same plus better in terms of damage, but mobility and the ability to Flag Carry made them MvPs in WSG.
---
All ur friends are gay lmao
---
The best dkp method is to assign value to an item. Whomever has the most dkp and wants the item gets it. At the time they economy of dkp was figured out pretty well so no one should have ended up with a shit ton of dkp, but 8 weeks of no items for 4-5 rogues that showed up for every raid. That's tough to balance for. It all eventually got spent once we got to BWL and rogue items started dropping.
---
Considering they are using the same engine as retail I'd say the performance requirements will be similar as well. So I would be looking at what performance people are currently getting in retail with different equipment combos and go from there.
---
Same here!
---
From watching those vids, I had forgotten about these effects, and it's surprising how much more impactful they make each hit look. I vote for blood and glow!
---
I'm a newly minted level 60 mage, back in December 2004. LBRS run, we kill Overlord Wyrmthalak. He drops his epic caster ring - Mark of the Dragonlord. I roll a 15. The two other casters roll an 8 and a 13.
---
Holy shit I can't believe I just got my first epic and it's fucking awes---instance server crashes.
---
15 minute rollback.
---
Item gone.
---
Petition GM, they can't/won't restore.
---
GG old me, welcome to the real world (of warcraft)!
---
Yes, but you also need to be aware that many other people will be having the same mindset as you. 
---
When push comes to shove, will you be one of the few that get a spot in those 40 man raids?  It isn't like a 40 man raid can afford to take several of each of ret pallys, cats, boomkins, bears, arcane mages etc...
---
You don't think that obscuring the tournament for the spectators detracted from others' enjoyment/game experience? Despite the fact that stream chats and in game chat was getting spammed with how annoying the tauren were?
---
May this send a message to all of you that gave me shit when I told you that gladiators/r1s would shit on pserver players after a few weeks.
---
Well there were horde spectators flagged. Also Venruki accidentally got flagged in a duel and Alliance didn't do anything, except for one warlock that did a 0 dmg spell for the visual effects (that did prolong combat status) but ultimately didnt change the outcome
---
when i say classic i mean actual classic
---
It just saves time when leveling and forgetting to upgrade (the bar) when you get a new spell. You still need multiple ranks of most spells, but wherever you want to put your max rank frostbolt, using that macro is good. I think his overall point stands, he just used a meh example that doesn't seem very appealing to people that are new to them. This isn't BFA, there is an actual need for quite  alot of macros if you want to be top end PvP, and some are pretty important for PvE too. There are a lot more useful macros, especially pet based ones. 
---
Hunters don't really just let their pets run wild in classic, not good ones anyway. It's also good to control them in PvP. If you are fighting a warrior, you don't want to let him just build rage on your pet as he runs to you and then dump it all over your face.
---
Baking in autoattack into some of your spells is also a good idea.
---
Are you some kind of a retard? You don't get to take the "moral high-ground" and also get the last word in. 
---
Dude, you're talking out of your fucking ass if you think spell-based damage out-scaled physical-based damage in PvP. It didn't. It doesn't matter if casters were better in raids - in PvP where armor for cloth and leather barely scaled and weapons scaled for insane boss armor, physical damage massively outscaled magical. It just did. There's a reason there's memes about warriors with pocket healers being unstoppable killing machines. It was reality. Physical damage dealers could regularly shit on cloth, and cloth could only burst down plate every so often lining up giant cooldowns. Physical &gt; magic. It just was. That was the meta. 
---
#That was the meta. 
---
Like, god damn, I know you didn't play vanilla **competitively** if you're arguing with me on that one. Because you would know you're full of horse-shit.
---
He used to be on Dragonmaw, I remember seeing him around in vanilla
---
I like to distinguish between "content" and "systems". The WoW team was excellent at developing good new content when I played, and for the most part it looks like that's still the case. Unfortunately, the systems have been far more variable, with an overall downhill trend. BC and even WotLK introduced a handful of nice new systems and overalls, but even then it was largely negative in my opinion.
---
Go cold turkey man
---
Half-Life 3
---
Hyperbolic; in the same way seventeen year old girls freak out when they brake a nail? Gotcha.
---
Dude... Cdew literally did it on stream.
---
If everyone else except the griefer is planning of cooperating then just host it in the Gurubashi Arena in STV.
---
I dare you to try and Grief.
---
Most idiots will parrot memes that they don't do any damage but they scale better than frost mages. Their main problem is that they go oom super fast. Also the boss won't have any debuffs that buff their damage specifically like shadow weaving or Winter's chill so even if they did the same base damage their damage in the end will be lower without those debuffs.
---
That is assuming that items works the same way in classic.  Has it been proven that this isn't just a private server thing?
---
I really thought it would be the opposite and that there would be a lack of tanks
---
lol stop your internet hyperbolism
---
I'm explaining in detail so they, as someone who never played Vanilla, better understand *why* it's so detrimental to have to shoulder a bunch of hybrid DPSers, even if they're really, really good players (which a lot aren't, because really good players already know how bad hybrids are and typically tend to avoid them without some extremely convincing superseding reason).
---
Cats have a decent skill cap, but I wouldn't say bears do.   Unless you count popping out of bear form to cast a brez on someone as skillful I guess.
---
It not being in game means it's pretty much going to be ignored. I'm not opposed to group addon so long as it doesn't automatically do things for you. If only to free up trade chat a bit, the spam can get overwhelming at times.

Oh, i'm not wanting to revert nerfs. I'm quite fine with this. I kinda wish it progressed with the patches, but know it wont.
---
If it was a same faction duel tourny, why not hold it inside an instance?
---
People be wilin', I def would raise an eyebrow at someone using grenades in a duel. You use engineering in organized PvP and WPvP of course,  but duels are (typically) for a pure class ability vs class ability showdown.
---
They we're ok with it in this tourney either way so it's not really an issue, but historically bombs in a duel def wouldn't be kosher amongst random duels.
---
[https://discord.gg/cSpdjk](https://discord.gg/cSpdjk) :D

....I didn’t think I really had to be in detail...
---
There was over 100k people watching. He was ruining what we were watching. 
---
If GoT turns off half way through, millions of people are effected.
---
I can't. I can't. Trust me, I've tried.
---
Remove yourself from that cross buddy. It doesn't have anything to do with me liking your views or opinions. Saying that "PvP happens get over it" is factually irrelevant to the topic because the complaints are about PvP in any way.
---
Just wait until these kids experience a Tauren on mount on-top of the mailbox with "Increase Size" buff x10.
---
Way too risky. That relies on EVERY SINGLE PERSON (both horde and alliance) to not suicide-kill someone. Absolutely ruins the tournament if it's anywhere relatively late in the bracket.
---
Venruki is amazing and such a nice guy. I’m really glad he won!
---
You camp camp someone and their alts for as long as you want. This isn't griefing.
---
Haha. I'm all for wPvp, ganking, camping -- whatever. But if "one of the only reasons" you're playing Classic is to endlessly camp people for hours, I hope they do clarify the ToS so people like you dont play. Good riddance lol.
---
Those blues are better than MC drops in 1.12.1
---
This makes no sense.  Of course it matters if it was possible back then or not.  If it wasn't considered a bug back then, then it was likely intentional for one reason or another.  
---
If we start delving into the realm of changing things to something some people might consider 'better', then that opens the door the changing anything and everything.  
---
So I completely disagree with you on this.  A lot of what ifs involved, and you disregard one of the bigger ones.
---
Yeah you're right i've wasted my best years trying to remember race/class combos! This is literally basic shit. Be gone casual boomer. "I played from beta to launch" lmfao alright dude
---
They should do a liga tournament with Elo rating
---
Simple joke man. Venruki beats snutz, one of the greatest locks on the beta, in the final round of the tournament today. 
---
But loses 2/3 to this random lock a week+ ago before people on the server started getting more into PvP with the release of wsg and what not.
---
Didn’t they say they will take it out?
---
I guess we will find out, because no one has any proof one way or the other atm.
---
Nice mentality you got there buddy, why is his way of having fun wrong?
---
That’s so crazy how their were 110k watchers for duels that were completely community driven. No esports announcers or any promotion.
---
Thanks man
---
Lots and lots of range dps, with quick heals. For melee heavy groups you'll want all the shaman chain heals you can get. You can easily farm 100 fr from lower dungeons before hand.
---
You won't be banned.
---
&gt; C. Rules Related to Game Play. Game play is what World of Warcraft is all about, and Blizzard strictly enforces the rules that govern game play. Blizzard considers most conduct to be part of the Game, and not harassment, so player-killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance, including gravestone and/or corpse camping, is considered a part of the Game. Because the Game is a "player vs. player" game, you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you, rather than contacting Blizzard's in-game customer service representatives for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race.
---
Corpse camping is written into the EULA as an allowable action.
---
They gonna half us, had in first not the lie.
---
If someones definition of fun is camping people on the internet for *hours* with the sole intention of making their gameplay as miserable as possible, I'd say that person needs therapy lol.
---
The manual talks about dishonor points for killing low level players and various essential non-combat NPCs.
---
This has potential. However, I'm not sure if there are any instances you can actually duel inside. Also, confined spaces (common in instances) change the meta a lot, and make it much much worse for whoever needs to reset (poly, etc.) and run far away. And it's much worse for kiting in general. It's not necessarily bad, but you can't deny that confined spaces DO change the meta and it's something that should be heavily considered.
---
&gt;waaaaaaaah your way of having fun is wrong go seek therapy
---
&gt;people can't enjoy things i dont enjoy
---
maybe you should seek therapy
---
Griefing cannot be stopped in this regard.  
---
If you decide to warlock summon to random points in the world and have people simply watch the stream... then doesn't that devalue the entire event as a whole anyway?  Seems anti vanilla to me.  
---
Remember the wedding event in vanilla?  Was an absolute grief, but it was legendary regardless and simply added to the interesting nature of the game itself.   If you start trying to control things, then you lose the fire that made it interesting to begin with.
---
That is due to a very specific fight that is in the very last raid. It requires a lot of fully geared tanks. That is what you're thinking of.
---
I loved watching Quinn play Lost Ark but couldn't stand his PoE streams. It's weird.
---
Congratulations Human Rogue, your job is to stand around in westfall and keep watch for the hordes of mass murders soon to be invading from goldshire.
---
Slay them Al,  Lok'Tar Ogar!
---
If the only way you find enjoyment in the game is to grief others, you don't like the game, you like being a prick.
---
Yeah my tool will almost certainly be ignored, but I had an idea for how I'd approach this and wanted to hack something together as a proof of concept.
---
The PoE community is a good example of user-created tools flourishing, and if Classic addons will have a restricted API this seemed like something worth trying out!
---
this is what made vanilla vanilla. STVnam is gonna be a living hell for most players. Those, who will nolife the first week to hit 60 are gonna gank the shit out of everyone, everywhere until Phase 2 starts and we begin our grind to R14.
---
There's gonna be so much salt - any server event not hosted by blizzard is going to get raided if the other factions get's a sniff of it.
---
Any guild raid event will get raided by same faction guild in the name of competition or epeen swinging status. 
---
shit is gonna get be real and everyone needs to understand - this is what classic is about. What Trollgodx did was something very vanilla. Dick move? yea but it put a damn smile in my face because it's gonna be infuriating phase 1.
---
What in the 40 year old virgin did I just read
---
Cdew Shaman vs Serendepitys Priest Classic Duel Tournament Round 3
---
watching the tauren go and sitting on top of the totems during the match, poor form
---
Yeah it was mainly the 4 horse men that I heard it from
---
Ssshhh don't tell Blizz. This would likely be the one time one time only they could get away with a price increase in NA.
---
You probably wont be banned, but it does make me wonder if you have some sort of unresolved issues lom. If continually making strangers as miserable as possible is how you have fun, ya need help man.
---
Eh, we all get camped from time to time. That's why we have alt characters. I've never had someone care enough to be there an hour later. It's a PvP server, I knew what could happen and prepared myself for it.
---
Just the idea that you derive pleasure from upsetting people is sorta unhealthy IMO. Why do you desire for others to be angry in order for your enjoyment?
---
Do more of these animated skits please
---
Do it in an area that level 1 characters can't get to.
---
Haha. Waaaaah? Solid come back dude.
---
If you're playing on a PvP server then I see no reason why you would be facing a ban for corpse camping people-yeah you will be labelled as scum but its not something I can see you getting banned over. As far as stream sniping, that could be a grey area. I guess one could argue the fact that you having access to the streamers location, what they are doing etc and using that info to gain an unfair advantage could be construed as cheating. I haven't played WoW since TBC days so obviously streaming was not a thing back then-in current retail is there world pvp? If so, is there penalties for "stream-sniping"?
---
Youd get alot of death threats but no ban
---
And if you punish this stuff, then you lose a lot of interesting possibilities that made the original vanilla fun.  
---
I say deal with it and move on.  If rogues want to camp a streamer then so be it.
---
I'm 18 and I'm certainly not "slow and blind", but keep making stupid assumptions about thousands of people, buddy.
---
Not that I dont want the "hardcore" aspect of WoW but I played warrior in classic and leveling up until about level 40 was a bitch so I'm gonna take it easy and roll lock.
---
Imo they're the easiest to level if you go afflic with life tap, drain life, dark pact, etc. Don't have nearly the amount of mana problems as other casters plus you have voidwalker for soloing. You get a freebie mount at 40 which is awesome when gold matters so much more. People like to bitch about farming soul shards but if you're smart you work that into a farming routine and it's not that big of a deal tbh.
---
Don’t lie to him that was a horrible joke
---
If he's going full prot he wont get improved cleave until like mid 50's anyway.
---
Very true, but personally I cannot imagine its super relia ble to use a gaspedal at exact intervals precise enough to pick abilities. Youre trying to be hardcore and exact. Unless its non standard and has "locking" intervals as you press and release, seems like a good way to accidentally waste CDs/mana/then die
---
There was honor in Vanilla.  Immature players just never have had any in their lives.  Sorry, you didn't experience any and showing that funeral is ONE time.  You'd have to show it on every server all the time from Vanilla to state what you stated.  Thanks for being ignorant though!
---
Alright, I probably won't play Classic then. Was kinda looking forward to it too.
---
Should this be for every single attack?
---
Bestial Wrath is an i-win button
---
As long as you have int gear.  If you're decked in rogue leather with no int you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Not sure you can either, though I think being able to would be an amazing way to enable 1v1 "arena" w/o having a significant impact.
---
That's strange, I didn't know you could log on to 2 characters on your account at the same time. McConnell character was in the alliance crowd you know
---
The question is does the good outweigh the bad.
---
Spammy unusable chats when streamers are live.
---
trolls doing things like happened today
---
the death threats/jail threats/people saying he should be banned for life from wow! towards said troll because of the toxicity of the streaming community
---
the root cause is the stream, even if the streamer isnt encouraging the behavior, without the stream it would not be happening to this extent.
---
Does Blizz just deal with it and start banning people who upset streamer for whatever reasons or do they relegate streamers to specific servers or ban streaming altogether?
---
this is the kind of care bear bullshit that got us BFA.
---
To answer your question they got separated from the layer because the finals ended up taking place in a less populated one. Or other way around idk, but basically they weren't banned.
---
My friend said there are Chinese in the beta so he’s assuming it’s one global server. Chinamen aren’t allowed blood in their country.
---
He's a person playing a video game. Not everyone you disagree with has to be given the armchair psychiatrist evaluation. I get camped too, it happens on PvP servers. Lead by example and don't gank or camp yourself, but not everyone should be expected to follow our example.
---
Badlands
---
I'm really disappointed in the caster PoV tbh. First of all looking at it was a pain because Tips was unable to control his ADHS and jumped all over the place while spectating. Two easy rules: If you don't have to move, don't move; and if you move, don't jump. Makes watching duels 200% more enjoyable.
---
And second the commentary was quite lacking in quality. From not knowing anything about the duelists ("He has multiple #1 title - or was it gladiator? I don't know, but he's great"/Calling Pshero "Pschero"...) to not realizing what's going on. A mage was melee range to his target and used Frostbolt + Fire Blast, and Tips suddenly yells "HUGE FROSTBOLT CRIT". Cdew after one duel was talking about how he forgot about Grounding Totem and didn't use it/didn't prevent anything with it, meanwhile you can hear the casters in the background talking about "great grounding totem usage"... like come on.
---
On the positive side the organisation was very good. I would've expected way more delays and disruptions (I saw a private server tourney where at least ~8 tauren where trying to troll the duelists), and the duels followed quickly onto each other. Props for that.
---
Yeah, I didn't really care too much about my character names before. But now that blizzard actually created a way to reserve a name early I suddenly care more. I guess Blizzard wins ... I'll pay half a month of sub for nothing to reserve a cool name lol.
---
Woah be careful - comments gonna get deleted! Don't tell someone they have a "dumb opinion" :)
---
As much as I hate the macro transactions in WoW, they are probably the main the reason that the sub cost has not kept track with inflation
---
Well you may want to reconsider, because that's going to get very confusing going forward.
---
Who knows.  Alliance was way more popular back in vanilla.
---
Yet, horde is far, FAR more popular in current retail.
---
So I imagine a lot of the people who transitioned over to horde in the last 6-8~ years might feel inclined to stick with the horde going into classic.  
---
I think it is likely that horde may have the edge this time around.
---
Seek professional help.
---
Your analogy is literally retarded. In the end, the guy only fucked up ONE DUEL over the course of hours. This didn't cause ANY twitch stream to "turn off halfway through". 
---
Wow is always LIVE unlike game of thrones(except during maintenance).
---
I was playing Dota 2 on 3g with a 50ms ping. You should be totally fine.
---
Be careful to not describe someone in a negative light!
---
I am facing this situation myself, but alas no friends.  I have been for since early 05 and never really looked at alliance.  But I would like a completely different experience this time around.  Back in the day I had a rank 10 Tauren hunter with my epic bow and staff he was a wrecking ball in pop and loved every minute of it but I was poor, I just barley scrapped getting my epic mount, I was marksman and stayed that way as I could never afford a respec, raiding and PVP took all my time and all my gold.
---
But this time around I want a different experience, I want to see what its like on the other side and I want to have some spare gold I want to take my time to level professions, would love to get back into PVP and raiding but not at the rate I was before
---
Then they should just split it like they're already doing with the skulls and bones. For example the Forsaken don't show any bones at all in their version, same with the DK original flying mount or any other thing.
---
Ironically death threats are actually harassment and is actually bannable, and potentially illegal. Death threats are very serious and people throw them out like candy when someone plays a video game in a way they don't like. It's crazy.
---
Ahhh seeing more and more people on this SR fancy Twitch streamers warms my heart.  Ven kicked ass he's also an amazing dude
---
Can't wait to get this mount.
---
Oh I dont mind wPvp. I dont mind camping or getting camped from time to time. Brings a fear to the open world that's nice to experience. 
---
But *loving* streamsniping and getting some sort of thrill out of ruining someones day so much that they quit playing is something else.
---
In my professional arm-chair physicians opinion, he's a prick lol.
---
Oh nice, I didn't realise a /cast macro defaults to the highest spell rank level.
---
And I love macro talk, please post more :D
---
It's pretty much the same as Retail for the most part.
---
I didn't take any video sorry.   I thought for sure someone like Esfand would have made a clip already.  The window for it is large as well, but I am pretty sure SoR is so bad you don't even want to bother twisting from Command, and SoCr twisting with SoR is too many Globals/s to make it worth it.
---
You're not gonna get banned dude. Gank and camp away. It's part of the game and there's nothing wrong with it.
---
LOL i didnt realise THIS was gonna happen until he said let me in
---
Vanilla is not equal to release (day).  Dingus.
---
Just do this stuff in a pvp zone so somebody can axe that guy
---
Horde always beat out alliance in progression back then, so I really don't think salvation was enough to carry alliance ahead.  
---
I think you underestimate how good shamans truly are.
---
I actuallx think they got some seriously good replacement models, if not even better models that are already in the normal game. Just look up how pretty the DKs original flying mount is :D
---
No, but 5% is
---
Down. Toes of truth?
---
I hate alts. I focus everything on my one character. I played the same hunter for 12 years. Since classic i also got an Paladin alt. I made a new one for WoD (on horde side, but i transferred my hunter to horde).
---
This round it will be an Orc Warrior and that's it.
---
i honestly cant even tell if this is a troll or not
---
Yes. There are many small changes due to the different client, this included. Macroing and commands in general are at most vanilla-inspired.
---
&gt; Creating a level 1 character of the same faction and standing ontop of people for 5 hours while they try to duel is griefing and it's obvious that it is.
---
This happened in vanilla, there just wasn't as much an incentive because streamers didn't exist. It's *still* part of vanilla, and people didn't get banned for it. Just like bringing a mob to kill everyone in a city or summoning people off a cliff.
---
If you don't like it, go play retail. That's what I'm told every time I have a suggestion for classic, and none of mine require a team of GMs monitoring streamers
---
When people mention mentions vanilla, they are not talking about day 1 release. They are talking about how the devs meant it to be.
---
Okai
---
Crazy. I also stopped playing in the beginning of cataclysm, just couldn't do it anymore. Was a pally.
---
Downvotes of truth?
---
Yes. I think this also covers something that OP didn't explicitly write in his original post:
---
6. Everything you did felt more rewarding, because you earned it.
---
I started playing in Vanilla, but didn't reach max lvl until BC. No epics dropped in normal dungeons. I farmed Cenarion Expedition rep for weeks to get my first epic. I felt like the biggest badass in Outland when I finally bought that sweet 2H hammer.
---
Look, even 15 years since Vanilla, people keep talking about the legendary mount from AQ. Some parts of that quest was a painfully un-fun grind. That shit was utterly brutal to complete and only available for a limited time. But that's exactly why it's so coveted. It meant something because it was hard to accomplish.
---
Requiring extra effort to get better loot is just good game design. The challenge is designing things that people with limited time to play can do to feel rewarding, giving them gameplay that is accessible, but still hard.
---
This was funny until it got all weird and homophobic at the end.
---
Alternatively, get a MMO mouse like the Logitech G600 (my mouse of choice for MMO's), Razer Naga/Naga Trinity, Corsair's, or any of the hundreds of chinese brands.
---
It puts the buttons where your right thumb is and comes with 8-12 buttons that you can set. I personally prefer MMO mouses over gaming keypads but the important thing is to try them before you buy, if you can.
---
Any intention on bringing this to addon format? I'm sure it's a lot harder than it seems, but I wonder how viable it would be to plug it into a leveling addon where you check boxes to progress through the guide.
---
For reference, the Wow-Pro Guides addon (picture on right): [https://willitclassic.com/view/smJSzxaQLjPKavn418l1](https://willitclassic.com/view/smJSzxaQLjPKavn418l1)
---
I'm still debating on either using your video guide or the written one. The text version would be easier to just look at on a second monitor, where as a video would take more attention and you may need to rewind or wait for the next step, pause, etc. However, you get the visual representation of what you need to be doing.
---
I was far noobier than most, I didn't play in vanilla but started early tbc, but dealt with a lot of the same systems as in classic. To be fair I was a kid. I remember the most nooby thing was thinking that I needed to save my talent points in order to get the cool stuff at the bottom. I didn't realise it meant you had to spend the points in that tree to progress down, I thought it just meant if I saved up 30 points or whatever I could get the thing at the end. So I just ran around in white gear with no talents for a long time. I was doing the ironman challenge without even realising it lmao.
---
Easy to deal with it if you have an answer for it. Yet no one does. There’s nothing you can do as a player.
---
@OP are you sure this correct? I recall plenty of enchanting recipes that took Nexus Crystals prior to AQ. If anything I remember the guild drama on my server when several Guild Leaders of top progressed guilds got their accounts hacked (before guild banks, Guild Leaders used level 1 alts as guild bank toons) and tons of Nexus Crystals flooding the AH as if it was rain Crystals from the sky.
---
I think your way of having fun kind of makes you a bit of a dick, but I don't see why anyone should consider it a bannable offense lol
---
But yea, you aren't alone.  There will be tons of people on PvP servers doing the same thing, and quite frankly, people on PvE will be camping quest givers constantly until a fight breaks out. 
---
Griefing was a huge part of the game back then.
---
This is actually a valid point. Maybe that's what others meant when they said you should just let it happen. You articulated it better though, if that's the case. 
---
I'd challenge you on something though. The Serenity Now massacre was a very unique event, and it had extreme novelty because nothing like it had ever been done before. It was a remarkable event in WoW history because of that. But let's look to the future. When we're doing duel tournaments 2 years from now, presumable having been duel tournaments frequently up until that point, how will we view the "griefing"? 
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is that, I think the novelty of having someone trying to obstruct duel tournaments might have been a little funny at times today, but I predict that it's going to get old quick.
---
&gt;If you don't like it, go play retail.
---
It's against the TOS and is 100% bannable (even in vanilla this was bannable behavior and yes people did get their accounts suspended for doing this.  Source:  I had a younger brother who played wow in vanilla and got his account suspended for 3 days).  I don't like it, and it's bannable per vanilla, so I'll stay in classic.  Thanks for trying to derail the whole conversation.  You're coming across as someone trying to make a point but are so far way off base and keep trying to drag it back to your point.  Your point is that every time you have a suggestion for classic people tell you to play retail, but nobody in this conversation has said anything contrary to vanilla.  So really you're just complaining.
---
true, this sub is a disgrace infested with carebear bfa players
---
&gt;mum halp me they are killng me in da game :(
---
Pepegag LULW hyperclap pogclap poggersaurusrex
---
The guy did it for hours.... it was every duel.
---
What vanilla? 1.9 or 1.12.1
---
Don't you think phase 1 will be way too easy with the items?
---
I hope others will enjoy as much as i do. i dont know if any of it is on the gameplay cause of only being an hour in it.
---
You're getting flak cause you were condescending.
---
I was thinking this the whole time
---
Get a team to work on that as soon as the round starts you send them to the second location and start summoning once shit starts getting hectic etc..
---
Some of the best Vanilla and Nost moments was answering the call to corpse campers as a decked out 60 and long battles would ensue resulting in 20 60s on each side battling over a tavern.
---
Aren’t all the pserver guys on alliance tho?
---
Perplexity was casting with tips..
---
I want to note - there is a lot of players who played vanilla here. We do have a different mentality and accept these griefing manners. Wether we like it or hate it - it's what made vanilla wow vanilla.
---
We grew up at the birth of MMORPG with the 3 godfathers of MMO.
---
Ultima Online - the ultimate hardcore pvp, full loot, full griefing experience.
---
Everquest - you think WoW corpse run is bad? you think being griefed by player was bad? Imagine EQ where mobs don't lose aggro and forces you a 10 minute run out of the zone, or being prevented to enter a zone due to a train. Griefing was a part of our life. We breathed and lived in those hardcore times and adapted.
---
Then WoW came along and challenged EQ/Sony with Vanilla. We were already hardened and heartless after UO and EQ. This was the new battleground and boundaries were pushed. World PvP was huge and will be huge again come classic. It will be pretty and it will be ugly.
---
Virtually no aoe tps, too.
---
Targeting someone for repeated ganking can be considered harassment, and in vanilla it sometimes resulted in a temp ban. I have a feeling Classic won’t have nearly the GM manpower devoted to it that Vanilla did, so I highly doubt you’ll get banned, though it’s possible.
---
I believe the devs have acknowledged it and it will be in for Classic
---
Except Resto is still a great spec idk what ur on about.
---
Problem is when they stand on a totem, you can’t target the totem if they do it right. He really screwed the priest who was fighting the shaman doing this, and I don’t blame the priest for getting worked up about it. It’s a real attention whore sad lame thing to do to so many people.
---
When I refer to the old classic I usually just say "original Classic" and to the new one I just say Classic. I dislike calling it Vanilla.
---
I'll be playing more casually than the first time through, so I'm not too worried with raiding all the time, just try to get that 5 man loot and hop in raids when I can lol.
---
its not "slight". Skram's videos basically have him playing duel weild fury prot with a thunderfury to be COMPARABLE to slightly favored threatwise vs his druid. A prot warrior stands no chance especially in mitigation gear.
---
A lot of melee classes are balanced around gear. Mages would just destroy at 50
---
In order of effectiveness (most to least):
---
1. Demoralizing Shout.  It does more threat per mob the more mobs there are, because each mob you debuff gives threat on all the others.  At 5+ mobs, spam demo shout and pretty much everything will be glued to you.  (Same applies for druids with Demoralizing Roar, but without a shield to block with they take a lot more damage from AoE groups).
---
2. Tab-target.  Tab-sunder is a great way to generate threat on a small group of mobs.
---
3. Tactical Mastery allows you to swap to Battle Stance and Thunderclap and swap back to Defensive without losing too much rage.
---
I do not recall ever seeing a duel in an instance
---
Wait, this makes perfect sense. This should be the norm from now one. I wonder why they didnt use the arena. Its literally made for stuff like this
---
If you betray your faction, then you are truly lost.
---
This is actually a good point.  Did they do anything to the undead character models because I know that had to be altered for the Chinese version as well?
---
Great! Thanks. Guess I'm going to have to put down at least 600$
---
Your ping will be somewhere from 180-250 depending on server location and your isp. It’s annoying but doesn’t hurt you much in pve. In pvp it’s annoying to being a big handicap depending on class and competition level. I wouldn’t recommend playing rogue and trying to be the best premade on the server with 250ms.
---
I think stream sniping is a dick move because it gives you an advantage over ther other person.  The rest, have at it.
---
Yea, but that is a massive time sink if it happens.  If he hits 60 as horde, his friends don't make it and quit, then rerolls on alliance, he just spent 200-300~ hours on a character that is likely to be abandoned. 
---
This is made even worse if his time schedule doesn't allow for him to play 50 hours a week or something.
---
it isn't big enough to kite in. warlock would auto win
---
Kill me
---
Hi, /u/ZebusAqua
---
Seems that mechanical skill beats game knowledge any day. Two weeks of game research seemed to be enough to catch up to the veterans and pserver players.
---
100% that Trollgod was Charles' alt. Charles wins in the end. ;)
---
We already know it won't work. Blizzard will not be implementing a system of "progressive itemization," meaning that the stats on items will not change each patch. That means the first raids will be trivial because blues in dungeons will be considerably better than when MC was released. On private servers raid compositions are 25% warriors and there's classes that have no value in raid except for providing 1 buff. This is the meta right now on private servers.
---
The arcane missiles clip doesnt work.
---
Of course you won't be banned for it. It still makes you an obnoxious asshole that will have an awful reputation on your server, but you won't be banned for it
---
This is shitposting at a level at which it breaches the heights and glory of all other shitposts. Give this man beta, he deserves it after this.
---
As someone who played classic, one of the best things about it is that people like OP exist. Although not as common, they increase the risk of being out in the open. Ya it's annoying, but it's also dangerous. Bring, or make friends... And fight back.
---
Vael is probably a fight where the druid doesnt start tanking as they can do a lot of damage in Cat with infinite energy. The mechanics of the fight mean most of your tanks will be getting a chance to tank at some point though.
---
Wow two people made all you guys so mad rofl. Can't wait for undead rogues to camp you all day
---
Same here!  Never watched a wow live stream before but after seeing his YouTube vid about classic wow I looked him up on twitch and have been really enjoying the content.  I wish I could find a clip from a few days ago of him running around an ogre cave in Badlands at like 10% hp, funniest shit I've seen in a while.
---
Not sure what you mean by that, but not griefing as in killing in world pvp, because he was the same faction.  He was constantly running on top of the players dueling to try to get them to click him instead of their opponent.
---
Because I will straight up hack you if you do that to me
---
Weren't Paladins with the latest class overhaul in classic really decent tanks?
---
Neat thanks. Will watch that.
---
I don't buy the fuss about the Tauren. They could've turned turned off friendly nameplates and kept enemy nameplates to make mouse targeting easier. I doubt many, if any, were tab targeting.
---
Lol don’t be a baby.  I don’t mean don’t play - I mean learn!
---
A) it’s not hard to learn to use keybindings. It’s usually one of those things where you can start with just a few of your most used spells early on and just slowly add keybinds as time goes on. 
---
Once you start playing with key binds - it’s impossible to go back. I’ve seen some stubborn clickers that don’t want to change or improve try just a little bit and all of a sudden the flood gates open. It really is a whole lot better/easier/faster. 
---
B)  you could just still click. If you can make it work - good on ya. It’s just highly suggested you at least TRY to start using keybindings as you will absolutely get faster and more efficient which will result in a higher level of play for you personally and your group as a whole etc. 
---
C) don’t be such a baby man. If you let some people like me make some off hand comments stop you from playing games you’re looking forward to then honestly that’s on you.
---
It’s almost 9:30pm has your adderal not worn off yet?
---
Good to know. I'm currently playing on a vanilla private server waiting for classic and started leveling a warrior to tank with since I had a lot of fun warrior tanking in wrath, and I was kinda worried when I saw tc as battle stance. Does cleave come in a later expac as well?
---
He’s been going at this for hours bro, I stopped replying to him after I realized looking at his post history he spends hours on here upset about streamers because he’s butthurt he didn’t get a beta invite or something.
---
Take my advice and just stop replying to him to save your brain cells haha.
---
He loves men man what you got against that
---
I remember the day I dinged 60 in retail vanilla like it was yesterday! I had used almost 10 months getting there and I dinged the 23rd of December in 2006. Grinding in Winterspring all the way from 54 until 60, I dinged 60 on the yetis down south.   
---
Just in time for christmas celebration in Alterac Valley! 60 AV was my carrot on the stick all the way.
---
Tears is more effective
---
Maybe on the streamer's servers there will be an imbalance because of people wanting to play with them, but also people will want to gank them. I think alliance will probably have bigger numbers because as much as people like to try and deny it, a lot of players want to be one of the pretty races. And there's no Blood Elves on the horde. I think you'll probably find the more serious players might choose faction based off recials, especially pvpers which might lead to most of them going horde, but for casual people who just wanna have fun and play the game, I feel like it'd probably be a 60/40 split in favour of alliance for those people. They are gonna make up a big big chunk of the population, and humans and night elves will probably be pretty popular. Humans are still one of the most played races on retail today, and combined with good racials and class choice in classic, I imagine alliance will be the pick for a lot of people.
---
I do not think I can commit to the raiding time requirements.  What is the best class for someone who is mostly only interested in dungeons and PvP?   I prefer healing, but if there is a dps class that doesn't require crazy raid gear to be competitive, that's good too. Thanks!
---
So? It didn't change the outcome at all in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Do you not think people working at Blizzard weren't watching the tournament too? The fact that no one on the team did anything about the guy speaks volumes.
---
Hahaha I do love the effort in your comment, great read my friend
---
everyone and their mother knew what happened when that event took place. that thing went mainstream media and the forums blew up.
---
with that said, take a deep breath and be civil and respectful. we don't want you to lose honor here on this subreddit don't we
---
Love it.
---
Oh but your wrong oh so wrong
---
Yes, using a gaming mouse can work too. And arguably it *can* have a slightly higher skill ceiling (Id argue simply because you can ever so slightly do it faster due to distance in a lot of scenarios, assuming you only use a modfier like right click or S) B U T! Even for those with full functionality of theor hands, I think it is way harder to use a mouse like that than using a keypad. Way less margn for error and you don't have the luxury of using sight to confirm what you are pressing (not like you do with the keypad, anyways(. The most buttons id wnat use on a mouse would be something like 2-4 bg ones that are easy to use, but I dont need tp with my keypad)
---
But yeah, try before you buy with a keyapd. You might like it but I dnt think most people woll. Unlike a keyapd, which is jsut an easier/more functional verison of your keyboard/or even a controller
---
Bot bad advice though. I do thi nk in theory some mice have the highest skill ceiling, even if ever so sligthly. Might be a bit cheaper too. I just dnt think its feasible for msot people to use a mouse at near the level they could use a keypad. But hey, fuck it. Get it off amazon and return it if you have to!
---
Maybe that should be the first addition to classic wow content. Duel Arena Island!
---
Some locks use Curse of Doom.
---
What would be really cool is if they brought it back but from a different source. Some obscure 'plagued' mob, hidden away. Or would add to the shock and panic to not know what was happening.
---
You can´t come back from a mistake as a mage your a squishy af.
---
I played hunter for 12 years. I played the warrior of a friend in classic when he didn't have time, and also tanked as a Paladin in WoD quite a lot. So this round it will be warrior. Although fury warrior, because tanking in vanilla is bit... tedious.
---
Well...the character that pops up is randomized - so even if the sliders were the exact same - are you saying you’re willing to memorize all the various start positions for each detail?  
---
What I’m saying is - your starting point for each detail is random - just seems a little extreme. 
---
Like god damn how popular is the name you’re trying to get lol
---
It's a troll no doubt 😂
---
Mage still has imo scorch for when they go fire.
---
Just a heads up if this doesn’t work like you want.
---
I’m assuming your mainly wanting the name(s) - if so, just get the names, and when classic actually launches, you can then figure out what you want your character to look like, delete the other, and quickly remake.
---
I am holding off right now because every day I am learning stuff I forgot.  Sometimes its stuff that wont affect my decision - i was reminded today while watching a vid that you have to pay to mail stuff.  and spell ranks had completely slipped my mind. So i am going to give it a month. I am leaning towards mage or warlock though since I have decided to be DPS but not committing.

I saw streamers entertaining people and hosting a tournament for thousands to watch, if you want to play on a dead server where events like this don’t happen then your envy for streamers is going to diminish your classic experience.
---
Unfortunately no. They're pretty bad all around. Druids are mildly viable on certain fights (some will argue more than others) but they dont bring much to the table that a Warrior couldn't bring besides snap threat with a Manual Crowd Pummeler. It's sad really, such a waste of a two potentially great specs. 
---
That being said, I still intend to level both a druid and paladin to 60 just incase we do get a TBC expac.
---
please tell me what faction are you going
---
Yeah but it's only one guy who stacks it up for the others.
---
Executus Gaming on YouTube does a lot of 1v1 live commentaries. Shows you what to do against most classes you’ll encounter. After a while you start to understand matchups and rotations. Pretty informative for me.
---
He has seriously started to piss me off lately.  I used to follow and enjoy a lot of his content, but lately he has spread so much misinformation and has honestly just become a bane to Classic.
---
Oh my god lol. you're more worked up than you're making me out to be. This was less about me and more about beta invites being sent to people who don't help. I think you and everyone else who are veterans should be the ones testing the beta, because they're the people they should be making it for. I'm not wrong.
---
I watched quin and it was great, he just switched to each player’s stream.
---
You sound like you got beat by a Gnome.
---
Good points.  One of the things that helps with hoarding is separating DKP by content tier.  Players should not be allowed to hoard DKP from one raid into the next, so you can either make the points raid-specific so if you generate points in MC you have to spend them on MC gear, or you allow points to carry over and set a larger decay between tiers.  For example, if you have a 10% point decay each week to disincentive hoarding, you can set a point in time to transition to the new content tier and apply a one-time 50% decay.  Folks who hoard will still have an advantage, but it will disappear quickly.
---
The best systems I’ve ever had were loot council (as were the worst).  The most competitive guild I ever played with used DKP with a decay mechanism, and there was essentially zero loot drama.  The best way to avoid loot drama is to find the right people to play with.  If you can’t trust the people, DKP is a pretty safe bet.
---
Didn't cdew even comment that he was targeting his own totem and didn't know if you could otherwise? Is there a clip of a target totem macro working for a totem that isn't allied
---
I played on a pvp server as the underpop faction most of my entire wow career.   I have no illusions about how bad playing on a pvp server is. It's really not that difficult to get people to flag up on pve servers either. If I wasn't already committed to a community that's rolling on a pvp server I would go pve in a heartbeat. With cross server bgs it won't really matter anyway.
---
This is something I didn't even notice, but now that I do it can't be unseen. Give us blood!!
---
Yea the videos are convincing, and this makes me wonder if this was a 'late vanilla change'.  
---
I remember from my hunter leveling in vanilla tracking beasts and humans was the buff.  It is possible that Track Minerals and such was migrated first.
---
Oh nice this is what I was looking for.
---
Never been a fan of Silithus, Badlands, Plaguelands or Blasted Lands personally. They always just felt unpleasant to be in. I think I just have something against red-tinted places, makes the atmosphere just feel a little overbearing.
---
What will be the easiest role to get placed into a raid group if you fulfill?
---
Haha I like where you're going, but let's be honest. Odds are you'll never see OP if you're smart and avoid streamer servers and youre definitely not hacking anyone. That whole post looks cringe bro.
---
Got some pop culture ones thatll work, or even a couple related p8un ones that IMO are equal to or better than any WoW names I have thought up, assuming you arent a kill joy who hates ay any name thats remotely pun related. Ill PM you so I can let you know what they were/are. I relaly hope no one has tohught of them, though with so many peple playing its unlikely. So the real hope is that few enough havenmt thought of them that if Im ASAP ceating, ill get them first on a server I want
---
The only actual ex gladiator mlg streamer, wins a tournament with a bunch of non vanilla playing casuals?
---
Who would have thought.
---
+1 for more macro stuff. 
---
Between the macro rework that happened at some point after Vanilla (right?), and that Classic is based on the modern engine with old features brought up, I have no idea how the macro system works anymore. 
---
Even when I search I'm not sure if I'm looking at a private server 1.12 guide, Modern wow, or classic.
---
It's my actual name and very popular. And I want that because I remember having an imperial agent in SWTOR named "Tim" and I thought it was hilarious... everyone else running around with crazy complicated names and I'm.... Tim.
---
I fucking almost choked on a pop tart
---
Battlegrounds, farm for the epic mount, professions, dungeons, farm for respecs, world pvp, fishing, rep grinds, auction house, gathering, etc.
---
Multiply this by alts.
---
Mara yes. DM not sure but I don’t think so unless you are in the highest tiers of gear.
---
I don't disagree. The core systems of the classes, questing, loot design, stats and stat allocation etc. all slowly started going downhill every expansion, with TBC and Wrath being barely noticeable because they did introduce some good ones as they took away some good ones, and took away so little we didn't even notice or care at the time.
---
The real problem started hitting in CATA for me when I saw they did MAJOR class changes, Holy Pally as an example that I listed above, that changed the way a lot of classes felt at their core. Mists came around, and I honestly didn't notice much difference from CATA and also didn't play it too much either, so I don't have much of an opinion over it besides hating monk as a class and pandas as a race. I heard people loved the content of the raids and stuff though.
---
WoD hit and really showed that the ONLY thing really propping WoW up at all was content. When people ran out of raids and instances in WoD, they really started shitting on it. No one was happy with that and it made all the gameplay changes to the systems easier to see. They also decided to add a ton of casual-friendly and time-wasting systems to the game that triggered the hardcore fans. I personally kinda liked the follower/garrison stuff at first. It was new and seemed interesting until it wasn't. It was a very tedious thing that I had to constantly deal with and even download an app on my phone to do it efficiently. Like I said, it felt nice to get all that free gold, but then i never had anything to spend it on by this point and I felt compelled to do it even though it stopped being fun.
---
Legion and BFA just kept stacking on the same design philosophy and making it worse without ever going back to the roots and seeing what made wow fun originally. Hopefully Classic blows up and it lets Blizzard know that we are tired of their current designs and they go back to the beginning for the next expack. Unfortunately, even if they do, I'm sure a lot of the next expack is already done right now, not to mention the story has gone to shit and is unsalvagable, imo. The best hope that I can think of is an entire reboot of the series like that one game dev guy was suggesting from vanilla. We just diverge from the retail path and do it different. Same assets and dungeons and stuff, but different systems and mechanics more inline with vanilla.
---
[Something kinda like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz-PtEJEaqY)
---
Well Paladins were excellent single target healers, so there's that. Retribution was also somewhat viable, not very preferable though, if your healing Palas could keep the mana seal on a boss.
---
I'm just not sure if i tanked with my Pala back then or if my memory is mixing it up with expansions.
---
Yeah I don’t even play pvp realms lol, I was just saying what I would do if I were to encounter someone like him lol
---
Resto shaman/Holy Paladin.
---
Almost scammed Venruki tho haha
---
Lol ally on a pve realm. Why, you want me to take your account or avoid losing it? 😘
---
Relying on click targeting for totems is a mistake in the first place.
---
It's Mondays
---
Blizzard's official stance on *stream sniping* in Starcraft II (there is a blue post somewhere) is -- The person streaming is giving their opponents an advantage. While it is unsportsmanlike to stream snipe, it's not a violation of TOS. I imagine this will be the case in Classic, too. 
---
Corpse camping was/is ok in World of Warcraft, too.
---
I think there is a boiling point, though. You can get suspended for repeatedly killing quest NPCs, Flight Masters, etc. (Source: Personal Experience)
---
That poll has druids as number 3 which blows my mind.
---
I'd blow my brains out if I had more than 4 characters to manage.  No idea how altoholics keep grinding out new toons, or why they'd create multiples with the same class.  My personal limit is shaman, druid, priest and a BE pally when TBC comes out.
---
Ive healed a bunch of people dueling over the years and sheeped mobs someone if fighting so they'll regain health and mess with the player a bit for fun. Ive also camped a corpse anf killed lowbies repeatedly. Should I get banned?
---
Not OP, but I’ll be on the most populated PvP server that doesn’t have a big streamer. I’ll be camping lvl 30s relentlessly in STV from about mid week 2 till p2 starts if you’d like to try.
---
I've got like 3 of each, but most of it is because of the heritage armor stuff. Once they hit 110 I almost never touch them again, lol.
---
Hi, /u/LazyWoodz
---
That needs to be fixed for sure or I might main shaman...
---
Cleave is in Vanilla at level 20.  It only hits 2 mobs.
---
Cleave and Heroic Strike have an extra hidden rage cost because you don't generate rage on the white hit you sacrifice to use them.
---
Vanilla and TBC tanking is a lot different than Wrath and onward.  CC is much more important, and half your job is telling DPS which mobs to CC and which mob to focus-fire, and then not breaking CC.
---
Hey, just wanted to let you know that the dude got his battle.net account banned for 1 month.
---
Before you delete all your comments in this thread I’d just like to let you know all this time you’re wasting because you’re jealous of streamers who live a better life than you could be better used towards something else, defending pure toxicity because you want to prove a point is irrational and having that line of thinking is harmful in the long run.
---
Good luck fellow traveler.
---
Lol reminds me of Monty python. 
---
Well what you could do is just instantly make one character named Tim as whatever looking character first pops up at the name release to lock the name out. Then wait a bit. Then delete him and make a new character with Tim as your name because then you’ll only open up a small 10-15 second window that only you know about to make that character. Doubtful someone would beat you there assuming you got the first Tim. 
---
Does that make sense?
---
If you spent hours following one person around doing that specifically to disallow them from playing the game in any meaningful way, yes you should.
---
&gt;ally on a pve realm
---
Judging by your carebear cringe post I guessed you would roll alliance, and even worst, on a fucking PvE server lmao.
---
&gt;you want me to take your account or avoid losing it
---
Do you really believe people are afraid of hack threats? Lmfao this isn't 2004 bro, I bet you don't even know how to create a Facebook account.
---
Mages and Rogues are the DPS slots that will probably have the lowest supply vs demand.
---
Hey guys,
---
I have struggled with finding the information about the patchwerk dps between orc and undead. I would prefer the undead for the aesthetic but I understand that the stun resist and berskerking might be too good. Any concrete ideas?
---
Do we know how will the servers will work? Will there been a ton named ones like there is now or one of each type? Thanks!
---
I feel like theres a croggie and shenna joke in there somewhere, but nothing I'm thinking of is funny enough.
---
This is a fucking beautiful video man well done
---
It’s fn amazing.
---
I looked at the official Blizzard post from the 14th, and the sub, but I couldn't figure it out.
---
I know I will get to create a toon 2 weeks early to reseve names/save time creating the toon etc. But it says nothing about being able to download the game before hand. Do you know if I will be able to/is beta gonna be basically the same game file? Seems like if beta is the more or less the game, and you cant DL before the 13th or whenever, then beta has a huge advantgae in names. Or even if its not, and I cant DL, itll be a huge pain in my ass, case my net is only like 1mbps/sorta unreliable, so im going to have to camp someones house to even do it, lol
---
If it’s red it’s dead! Camp away brother! PvP game. All these people saying you need counseling and shit need to lighten up, it’s part of the game. Just because you enjoy the PvP aspect more doesn’t make you a serial killer or demented.
---
Nelf BM Hunters absolutely busted in BG and world pvp.
---
I'll upvote anything with a dwarf in it.
---
This ain’t how the economy work chief. You think my wages gone up 30% since 2004??
---
Yeah, TBC is where both Bear and ProtPallys started to shine. They were unique and great at their specific role, OT and add/heroic tank respectively, but could easily MT if the situation arose. 
---
I love Vanilla for what it is, but I really did enjoy feral tanking. (:
---
Yeah. That is definitely plan b. Hoping to make my character in record time first and if not, switch to another random server.
---
Eating/drinking after poly was not allowed during duels in vanilla. JS.
---
That's probably what I will end up doing. Level one or two to 60, max out professions, run dungeons, get pvp gear, grab pug groups for easy fun raids, level up cooking and fishing. Do the long quest chains for things like the zf mallet and such, and make money selling to the raiders. I've seen the content so I know what it is.
---
rogue mage maybe warlock at 40 and maybe paladin have answers to beast wrath, the rest im not sure
---
That auction house has no idea what it's in for!
---
Had highest dkp for the dagger off rag. Finally drops 1 week before bc.
---
Yea but you're all just assuming he's lying. I got my account hacked twice during TBC. It happens a lot. No reason to assume he's lying.
---
Twitch.tv/tribe_tv1
---
Hooray! Now we just can't let blizzard get away with having layering for the first 6 months!
---
yeah this is the dumbest fake gatekeeping I've ever seen, good luck with classic
---
Private duels arent a core part of the game. Messing with people's duels shouldnt be a bannable offence. I also sometimes have fun by using my character to mess with others because i can. Sometimes i have fun by helping the opposing faction instead. It's not an oprn world if you cant fuck about.
---
And warrior DPS is sub par until tier 3.
---
He got removed dude haha. You didn’t even watch.
---
Hi, /u/enjoyscaestus
---
Probably TBC. Still not sure. I played Vanilla and TBC extensivly. With Wotlk i made my first break after leveling up and getting into the first raids.
---
I kinda have zero memories of what i've done with my Paladin alt in TBC. I can recall a few moments in classic though. Weird.
---
Most of the time when an account is compromised it's simply stripped of all its items and the gold is mailed off. To not only have the person keep the items on the character but also buy expansions is extremely unusual.
---
&gt; StaySafe put it best that if a player wants to be known as a fucking douchebag to the community, it's their prerogative - the community will deal with that player and you don't need to go whining to Blizzard every time sombody spergs off or whatever they choose to do.
---
this is flawed logic though because it was just a level 1 toon.  He can (and will) just make a different character to actually play on and nobody will know it was him.
---
I've already got all nine class/race picked, working on names before August. 
---
Yes I know I'll never hit 60 on even 1 of them, I never did back in Vanilla either
---
Serendipity should have had a /tar tremor totem keybind from the start.
---
When I played the most, I was a core raider in a progression guild, raid leader and in a loot council in another guild on a second server, and RL/ML for a third guild on an alt for people trying 40man raids (MC when most guilds had BWL on farm).  
---
Main guild was DKP with council for legendary calls.  I don’t recall anyone ever complaining about the legendary priority because it was either the main tank, the highest performing healer/dps, and/or someone who was a high performer and dedicated tons of time and effort for the guild.  We had remarkably low loot drama.
---
Second guild was loot council.  We were in constant communication with the raid members about who got what and why,  Loot was distributed based on need with slight priority to folks who were always around, high-performing, or dedicated time to the guild by operating the website, handling recruitment, helping people with attunements, farming raid mats, etc.  Also zero drama, but I think it helped that I was the face of the loot counsel and respected the priority to better performing members of my own class.  
---
Third guild was straight up /roll.  We were a glorified PUG where people joined the guild to try to ensure their ongoing PUG spot.  Also no drama.  Most folks were just happy to see and complete some of the content.  
---
My experience taught me that all are viable and LC is probably the best for progression. But unless you know and trust the LC, DKP is probably you’re best bet. But with the potential to abuse the DKP system, having an LC that sits above DKP to prevent abuse is a good idea provided the LC is generally not involved in the majority of loot decisions.
---
At first I thought you were being an asshole by implying OPs post was over the top or something but that last sentence had me dying laughing lol
---
I mean there's really nothing special about playing a computer game here. You can be a prick when you're on a train, or driving in public or walking down the street. If you literally get satisfaction and happiness from making other people annoyed/angry then yes, you probably have some issues. We kind of expect that from 8 year olds for a while, but if you're an adult and you think it's funny to annoy other people then you don't need to be an armchair psychiatrist to know that's someone that needs help.
---
Well please tell me how to access the sarcasm font on Reddit so I don't trigger someone.
---
Calling it now, Erik will win the whole tournament.

I do recommend to most people to make their own list mostly based on this, some boes like freezing band for frost is going to be either very expensive or kind of rare early on, and probably both
---
I'm getting major beta fomo for the level 30 level cap more than anything. All my altoholism has done good is it's readied for the 1-30 meta
---
your hots must last a really long time, and tick in really fast windows. 2 seconds until your next rejuv tick? mmaky.
---
Thistle Tea allowed? It is part of the rogue class like blinding powder.
---
Wow he got layered, or grew bored of it. If it was so important that he got removed, it would of happened a lot sooner granted how many were watching. Haha!
---
How woukd he have a bad reputation fighting the other faction that can't talk to anyone about it?
---
I've always felt like M+ was like pulling teeth, personally. I was forced into it to be up to date with gear for raiding and I never did it ever for fun. In vanilla, dungeons were there to get the gear to move on to raiding, I think it benefited from having a piece of content actually be obsolete at a certain point, that felt like WoW rather than Diablo. But I really don't see why they couldn't implement M+ into Classic, if the community wants it enough I seriously doubt anything is off the table.
---
But still, my main point stands, people disagreeing with you isn't an echo chamber..
---
Right...but if the account was a top ranked PvP’r they’d have been able to recover it for him pretty easy...I mean back then nearly everyone knew the name of their server’s highest rank PVP’r...if their account was stolen it would be big news on the forums...he sold the damn thing and you know it.
---
He made it pretty clear that he gets his fun from making people mad, not just ganking
---
I know APES are really good, but I'm not sure their content is actually explanatory.
---
In WoW its anything that prevents the player from playing the game in a meaningful way. People get confused because they also get upset in a similar way when being spawn camped or mind controlled to jump off a cliff.
---
**If a problem has a PvP solution, it is not griefing.** This has always been Blizzards stance on things like corpse camping.
---
However, when its your own faction, you don't have a PvP solution. If you have a group of 5 people that hate you for whatever reasons, so you decide you're going to follow him around all day and tag or instakill all the mobs he needs to grind for quests... well thats griefing. 
---
Similarly, preventing people from dueling in a meaningful way is also griefing.
---
No changes.
---
Its a level 30 dueling tournament that means nothing?
---
Also, it should be noted that instanced duels means that it can only be watched via stream, or if you're lucky enough to get invited into the raid or whatever.
---
They're not allowed to see dead bodies, I don't know about blood.
---
I've already made the case that walking around people dueling was part of vanilla, and gave you examples of actually destructive play (luring bosses back to cities to teamkill faction players) and you couldn't refute it.
---
Since you ignored that, all you can now say is "ur off base bro"
---
I thought so originally as well, but if you watch the vod, Ven did almost no dmg (MAYBE 5%) to Snutz in the minute after Snutz could have sac'd (sac buff lasts 1 min).
---
I care.
---
Totally valid if you didn't like it. I absolutely loved it.
---
Is there a vod?
---
I like how you're bringing retail players into this for no reason.
---
No, but playing a game for 5 hours on a level 1 alt with the only intention of pissing people off is pretty low.
---
The way i see it your own faction griefing you would just put that persons reputation in the ground. Idk kf people will do this on live. Simply because theu have to live with the consequences
---
If only everyone behaved like this throughout the tourny instead of fucking over the duelers

I haven't gone through with it yet but I like raiding as a ranged dps and the only thing I even want to play is shadowpriest so I was giving a second priest alt a legitimate thought
---
And you are whats wrong with the world.
---
The biggest factor will be likely raiding times.
---
I wouldn't necessarily call jumping on top of players for five hours who are just trying to duel "playing the game".
---
You guys know those are emotes that are only visible with certain extensions installed in your browser, they aren’t just words....
---
Mage can be very good in subpar gear if you are skilled.  Their playstyle relies on control and not getting hit, so missing gear matters less.
---
Healers are usually targets in pvp so struggle with subpar gear, paladin is the least targeted and most tanky.  You will oom faster and not heal as much in blue gear, but cleanse, freedom, bop, bubble, aka all the things that make paladins good is still there. 
---
Also probably quite easy to pick up group raid a few bosses here and there as a holy paladin.
---
It's not practical. Imagine game 4 of snutz vs venruki. Trollgodx logs on to his level 30 main rogue, trollface, and ganks venruki right as he's about to finish the series. Tournament experience ruined. And now both horde and alliance can grief the duel tournament.

I literally quoted the ToS. You are stubbornly trying to justify your original point. The behavior is obviously griefing. There should be consequences for people who only want to ruin an otherwise cool and interesting experience other people are working to create. If you think this behavior is justified and classic won't be the same without this, then don't play. You won't be missed.
---
Yeah, when I get mass downvotes and bad arguments, I tend to defend myself. Don't mind too much when I have to poop a lot.
---
I wouldn't even step into the beta if I had an invite, so your assumption is incorrect.
---
What makes a good main tank is a combination of things, some of which have been mentioned in replies to your post. Nice downvotes too, salty lads.
---
1. Gearing. Know what gear works best for a given situation. Pre-raid when you're just doing 5 mans, gear doesn't matter that much. UBRS is when gear starts to matter. Focus on mitigation stats like +defense, stamina, agility, and dodge/parry etc. Also don't be afraid to toss on some +hit gear since that can help your rage generation. 
---
2. Rage management. This ties into gearing somewhat. If you put on too much mitigation gear for content that doesn't need it, the tradeoff is usually that you don't hit as hard which means slower rage generation. Get a feel for which abilities generate the most threat, and what to spend your rage on in situations when it's low. Warrior is one class where you almost never need to downrank abilities unless it's for a very niche case. Your abilities cost the same amount of rage regardless of their rank, so 99.9% of the time you want to use the highest rank possible.
---
3. Familiarity with abilities - On the topic of abilities, learn what every ability you have at your disposal does and when it is applicable. All of your abilities are useful in the right situation. Know when to use your shouts, when to disarm, when to shield bash to interrupt a cast, etc. 
---
4. Threat generation - Learn how the threat mechanic works, and always be on top when you're the MT. Some boss fights are tricky and require threat management (vaelstraz in BWL comes to mind) and take a few attempts to learn properly. 
---
5. Leadership - Tanks have the most important role in a raid. When the tank(s) die(s), the raid wipes. You will most likely be put in a leadership role where you tell people what they need to be doing and when they need to be doing it so they don't peel threat off you, or start DPSing the CC'd mob, etc. If you want to be a raid tank, you'll most likely have to take charge on some organizational stuff in your guild.
---
Hope this is insightful.
---
That Sodapoppin set is so painful. I'm not a fan of the guy, but I 100% believe that he had a real chance to win the tournament if he didn't hit the worst RNG fear making him flee the duel. He was ahead and had used his CD's, which fucked him for the rematch.
---
Soda can be pretty annoying at times, but there is no denying how damn good the guy is at Druid. I'm not sure if it's because he's popular that people dont want to credit him or because he didn't compete like Reckful, but the guy is one of the best Druid's I've ever seen.
---
It’s worse.
---
The person griefing will have consequences on a live server. This wont happen as much on live cuz people have to live with the reputation they build.
---
Also make the location harder to get too. And dont duel streamers
---
I want to play a warlock on launch but having to wait 3 or 4 months for DM to release so I can get the epic mount just seems terrible, and having to grind out the gold for it twice seems worse. I have no idea what the hell to play now. It's definitely going to be a "pure" dps class but can't decide on which one.
---
Get a grip lol!
---
You know you want a true to vanilla mission table
---
It absolutely does ruin someones reputation your right. I would hope this troll guy has a harder time playing the beta because of it. However, the report function exists for a reason and this would one of those reasons.
---
People will do this as long as there aren't any actual consequences to it. This guy wants to force himself to be the center of attention on a 100k stream. People are talking about him on Reddit. He's gotten what he wanted I suppose.
---
Post a working link instead of a dummy of that clip you have thrown everywhere before  you lay down your 'gotcha' you're relying entirely on claims as well here no different
---
Happy to post more. The issue with macros is that they can get quite terse and confusing. I chose this example as it's so simple and it opens the door to modifiers (which can be very handy to keep your keybindings down.
---
I'd say that 90% of my macros (and I have quite a few) are variations of this one example.

I'm thinking of \[@mouseover\] next. It's very specialized but it extremely helpful for healing, decursing, and sheeping.

Just playing devil's advocate here, but leveling up into 21/8/22 has some advantages if you've never played a rogue before. For one thing, it teaches you to stunlock. Having full ranks in Master of Deception helps a whole bunch too. It takes longer to kill mobs and you're squishier, so leveling will be a little slower, but it's not that bad.
---
With the progressive itemisation we’re getting T1 is still desirable. A lot of the best blues are missing. Nor should we all expect to have full preBiS for the first few raids.
---
Would be wise yes
---
I like class so I play class.
---
No you won't.
---
This makes sense for Rainbow 6 as well. Their PTR has a different symbol for dead players, rather than the usual skull.
---
Hey man you can spend your free time however you want, but if you’re constantly getting mass-downvoted it’s most likely due to the fact that you’re wrong.
---
I know you’re line of thinking is going to drive you to think it’s the streamers fanbases but if you take the time to understand the situation fully I believe you’ll be able to see the error in your train of thought.
---
Uhh we definitely need the blood. Cmon blizzard stop being sissies.
---
Skarm Tank has some good videos on high level tanking
---
Also consider someone on your faction who griefs would quickly have a bad rap
---
Also, even two slow swords is better than a MH sword and dagger offhand as ‘combat sword’ spec.
---
I feel this, I'm probably not going to get any character to 60 for the longest time
---
Pretty sure Blizzard is aware of how the game should look like. The question is to what extend will they act on it. They were even fiddling with the light of a lantern so who knows.
---
No justice boners ruined you have no clue what happened to his account like the rest of us. Your opinion isn't fact
---
Cool, and in being what is wrong with the world I represent my place in WoW as something you need to watch out for.
---
That's part of the Vanilla experience.
---
Why is missing key ring a bug?  Key rings weren't a thing til 1.10 or something.
---
I'm not sure the policy on stream sniping in WoW. But I know there are some games who will ban people if there is sufficient evidence of stream sniping. (An example if some of the lengths people will go to camp Ninja in Fortnite even without name displays, the way they stalk him all game it's clear that they are stream sniping)
---
I think it's actually against Twitch TOS too to stream snipe, but I could be wrong there.
---
Man whens the last time you performed the thing your most known for in front of 100k and lose. Id prol at least be a lil sad
---
mobs did not sit still for 5 seconds, but they did not aggro.. still the case, doesn’t seem bugged
---
Daenerys.... Hmm...
---
With your logic the duel tournament taking place under a map wouldn't be "playing the game" either.
---
Needs appropriate engine RPM sounds.
---
Why would I delete my comments, any action taken against his account means nothing to what I said. 
---
If they are banned for a month that only furthers my point that special treatment for streamers makes no sense in classic. It also calls into question other things, like bringing bosses back to cities or summoning people off cliffs, things that *actually* impact intended player gameplay but make vanilla fun, even if it is technically more griefing that walking around people dueling
---
Fundamentally it doesn't matter at all in the beta, but on classic release it will
---
Good. Hopefully the people turned off by that go play a different game. We could stand to have a couple fewer asshats.
---
DUROTAR its so fucking bright orange it literally hurts my eyes to be in there
---
You do good damage for like 20 seconds then you go oom and Meele the boss
---
Slam spec was a thing, just not a mainstream thing. When most people see imp slam in a build, they make the mistake of thinking it's going to be a primary damage ability. It's not, it's an extra "near instant" ability that's faster than a weapon swing and is a better rage utilization than heroic strike when you have a 2 hander. You slam when your instants are down and you have a white hit. 
---
This is from a private server, but you should get the idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US5DJAy-ASg 
---
It even works with an Arms build:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZ594vknh0
---
When it's a level 1 alt like Trollgodx, the person faces no social consequences. He then gets on his main and chuckles to himself thinking of how big of asshole he was and no one knows it was him.
---
Trollgodx was a Level 1 alt. The only punishment he would face is a ban. And it seems Towellie semi-confirmed the guy did get banned.
---
The fact this asshole won the lottery of WoW Classic Beta and now lost it is absolutely hilarious to me.
---
Really? I thought they were just speaking some fucked up language
---
Weren't rogue abilities normalized to set weapon speeds at some point in vanilla? I can't remember when but I'm pretty sure that's why Barman Shanker (2.0 speed dagger) went from being everyones favorite blue dagger to not being necessary to farm for anymore. Been many years since I looked at rogue theorycrafting stuff so I could be wrong though.
---
ive actually completely narrowed it down to priest. great for raiding, pvp, always got a spot. 
---
But then again ive never really liked priest. If im going to heal ive always liked my paladin more even if its a little less effective in raids. But then again why am I thinking of healing? I could do anything, and ive always said if classic came back id do rogue because of how badass they were. im always a mage guy in dnd games though, and mage is super badass in classic. I have done it before though and it wasnt exactly my favorite playstyle. So lock is a good option, but damn ill be missing blink. Hunter looks fun in classic too since pet speeds and stuff will be back to normal. A casual PvP hunter sounds pretty fun. Druid ive never considered but it is super cool to have access to everything. That would really give me the full experience. No warrior. 
---
So anyway im thinking its for sure gonna be one of those, definitely alliance because all my old friends are coming back alliance.
---
Im glad the release is a few months away because i need every second of my free time to analyze every inch of every class and race and really figure this out. I do not wanna be altaholic this time. This time i will stick with 1 of those
---
I always hated Moonkin form. I always wished Balance spec didn't have a form so I could cast in my normal form.
---
Welll said. Reading this thread is really sad with all this PvP etiquette bullshit.
---
Its not that you CANT do it with those specs, but those specs do suck. Most of the guilds ive seen will take the meme specs but you can be damn sure not many. Guilds might take a boomkin but there wont be 2.
---
Balancing wow = retail.
---
Retail = boring
---
Classic = rock paper scissors 
---
Rock paper scissors = god tier experience
---
&gt; most likely due to the fact that you’re wrong.
---
And that's fine. If I'm wrong, someone just needs to simply explain why and convince me. So far, I've just been insulted and lashed with bad arguments that only cement my beliefs.
---
&gt; drive you to think it’s the streamers fanbases
---
It just so happens I don't pretend they don't exist
---
I’m not sure on the history of it exactly but thats how it is on every private server i’ve ever played
---
And you can implement a PoM by a pedal kickdown.
---
Resto Druids gave pretty unique and excellent utility in the form of brez and innervate, and did decent healing in resto. But in terms of straight healing done, they never compete with equally geared and skillfully played priests. Their utility doesn’t really compare with Paladin buffs, either. Can’t speak to totems, because I didn’t play horde.
---
But yeah, as good as resto was, it was the weakest of the three healer options. You’d want a couple but just so they could keep your priests’ mana pools filled and pick up anyone important who died.
---
Druid was easily one of the weakest classes in classic. Still a hell of a lot of fun (I’m actually considering playing one myself), but never comparable to warriors as tanks, couldn’t hold a candle to rogues as melee dps, weakest of the 3 healers in either faction (and lacking a regular Rez making them really poor dungeon healers without Rez support), and 100% garbage as caster dps for anything beyond dungeons. And even in dungeons, they needed to stop to drink often/stock a lot of expensive consumables.
---
You did occasionally see great druids, but it takes so much more time and effort to get even slightly good results at cap level. They’re great levelers, but once you’re cap, they’re crap.
---
I'll just ask here since the automod keeps removing it.
---
What professions should I take to make the Secpter of the Shifting Sands questline easier?
---
Me and my significant other were still very new to the game and basically only quested together, and we just absolutely could not figure out why we were doing fine until we went inside the one castle and then we'd immediately get wrecked. We must have spent hours in there slowly pulling mobs and dying repeatedly before we figured out we were A.) in Shadowfang Keep and 2.) We'd need help to do it.
---
Thanfully eventually a higher level dwarf hunter (It's weird what you remember, this was easily a decade ago) came by and we finished with the 3 of us. Then we came back to duo it the next day and got wrecked again, still not fully understanding the situation.
---
This was my first thought as well, but he did just win a competition in front of 110K people. That's pretty wild.
---
Dont worry about people being jerks
---
I hope there is another way to get the pets. The whole reason I have been fighting for classic was so I wouldn't miss anything like that.
---
Yeah it’s a fundamental problem with twitch and it’s not a big deal that you didn’t know that but it’s just one of those inside jokes that have been taken way too far throughout the years to outsiders it looks extremely dumb (not saying it isn’t with context either)
---
But these plugins are called BetterTTV or everyone uses one called FrankerFaceZ because it’s the superior plugin now. 
---
Hope that makes the experience a little better my man
---
Not having a warlock for Twin Emps makes it suck but you could probably pull it off.
---
I was reading on dualboxing.com that /castsequence works, which is amazing news as I will be 3-boxing in classic and this macro is a godsend.
---
Pink haired female gnome 
---
Horde be salty mad
---
Thank god rosilana wasnt a female tauren.
---
Wait I’m confused. What happened ?
---
You mean a community event would need coordination? No shit. But easily done with everyone in a raid. Duelers to the center, everyone else kill anything that comes close. It would even make watching it more fun, especially if both sides have streamers to coordinate the ally and horde raids to block assholes.
---
Not really throwing it away. The characters will all be wiped for launch so why not just have a little fun.
---
That is sad.
---
Spectators aren't playing. They are there on their own terms. They chose to watch.
---
Doesn’t really matter how well your spell damage scales when you go oom before the boss hits 50% health...
---
Here's a little commentary with some footage: https://youtu.be/RevirDl5oAU
---
They can work, but will be low on the charts.
---
What an idiot.
---
&gt; How the heck are classic dungeon in any way shape or form harder than retail stuff? 
---
When people say it is harder, they mean the most basic minimum level of challenge in dungeons in classic is tougher than the most basic minimum level of challenge in dungeons in retail. 
---
Obviously this content does not in any way hold up to Mythic+. Even the timed strat run, the hardest dungeon content in vanilla, is not challenging if you're not a total retard. Stuff like "don't run ahead of the group". Remember though, most people don't play Mythic+. I don't even think most people play heroics in modern WoW. They play the most low-level casual content (normal), and so that feels exhilarating in classic for some players to play content where the possibility of dying is on the table.
---
TL;DR: Most people suck and don't play hard content. Having the easiest content available being harder than the easiest content retail offers feels better to the people interested in classic Wow.
---
Idk how standing on a totem is fun
---
Even pvp corpse camping actually takes a bit more skill
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTSyexUNN9E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTSyexUNN9E) \- good example of the glow and blood spray from vanilla 1.9.2.
---
Get this man a beta.
---
Nobody thought that the best pvp class in the game would make it far? LOL.
---
What the hell does dkp stand for
---
I have been playing on private servers and playing wow since 1.9, LISTEN when I say this FUCK LOOT COUNCIL. All the raiding guilds I have been in that I enjoyed were DKP. I like zero sum DKP myself everyone goes to negative when they get something. Loot council sucks because it robs you of the rewarding feeling of farming all your own consumes and shit.
---
So how many bugs were reported during all of this? If you're a beta tester, please do your job.
---
What's sad is your inability to cope with problems.
---
END THE FED
---
Lol cheer up dude
---
Streamers and social media are going to make the 2nd Vanilla play-through feel different.
---
You won’t have quite the same mysterious “amazement wow factor,” since you’ve seen the locations before, you know what’s around the corner environment wise.  You’ve seen the fights and know the quests.  The nostalgia will help fill in those gaps.
---
But this new vanilla experience will be fucking epic.  The raid on the funeral, kiting world bosses, stories and rumor that you only maybe saw from a 15 fps fraps recording.  It’s all going to be public knowledge.  It’s all going to happen on a much large, much more intense scale.
---
It’d be like if Roman Empire and Gladiators had Twitter.  They’d be shit talking, causing drama and hyping shit to the next level like celebrities and professional athletes do today.
---
Spontaneous (streamer motivated) world events are going to make this vanilla experience the greatest gaming timeline possible.
---
Wow pvp is more more luck and gear than skill.
---
It’s because crit is overpowered in vanilla.
---
I know right? People are so entitled.
---

---
I don't know, I would think being able to participate on a small server with tons of player driven content and a unique level 30 meta that won't ever exist again on official servers (probably not even p servers) would be more valuable than ruining everyone's time for a few hours. 
---
Just because it goes away doesn't make it lack value.
---
fucking rekt
---
Dragon Kill Points. It originated with dragon bosses in Everquest.
---
They’re the best at level 30 too and it’s not even close.
---
Warlocks don’t even have death coil.
---
Its a shame soda got feared out after popping everything. I think that could've changed the entire tourney. Shit happens though and im glad Ven won
---
Ven is a rare breed of humble and grateful though
---
Because at the end of the day everyone is sitting around enjoying a tournament and that dude is on a server for beta testing and is jumping around blocking players dueling. That act is a breach of TOS whether he’s doing it to streamers or not, and this has been explained to you multiple times in this thread but you refuse to accept that because it doesn’t fit your narrative.
---
Beta or not, he broke TOS, he gets banned, and imo it should be much more severe since it was a beta server but meh 1 month is good enough.
---
Towellie and others already confirmed the guy who was doing this today got banned. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bw0jlr/tipsout_duel_tournament/epuotiu/?context=3
---
PVP happens dude. Blizzard wont ban you for corpse camping a random/streamer. Fight back 4head.
---
A dude in the beta spent his time ruining a dueling tournament by running around in duels and sitting on totems and shit trying to invalidate any result the duel might have had.
---
Id say value increases cuz it goes away
---
I mean, if you're going to constantly broadcast your location on a pvp server, you're just asking for trouble, especially if the streamer throws a tantrum everytime he dies.
---
The first question has to be what class are you talking about - warlock? Doesn’t matter. Warrior/rogue? Orc has the advantage because of blood fury.
---
Being amazing at the game is step 1 in becoming a top streamer.  Sure some people make it on personality, wit or humor, but 99% of the time they are the top .1% of skill.
---
This was great! I would totally watch more videos like this you have a YouTube?
---
Whoever wins the duel, no buffs from other players. Anything else went really
---
He threw away 2 months of Classic WoW Beta on an official Blizz server.
---
I'd say odds are pretty likely that..
---
1: The Beta stays up past the final stress test into early August
---
2: That at some point, the beta level cap goes up. Although Alpha testing is at the Level 50 cap already, that is such a limited pool that I dont think this is going to be the same beta that is played for it's entire duration.
---
For those that are tackling Classic "hardcore" this is a great time to get the feel for official Blizz Classic servers, and to plan out leveling routes, etc.
---
We arnt talking about pvp.
---
He didn't get banned. He was layered and couldn't get back. They've already /who'd him on stream and he was online.
---
They do make PVE servers, if you play on PVP it's kind of the point to kill the other faction.
---
You cannot kill someone fast enough to stop them before they interrupt. 
---
It would not make it more fun if every duel had to be reset due to someone moonfiring or sheepish someone currently dueling.
---
Classic will definitely outnumber Retail by a mile. It’s already being extremely hyped up on Twitch and within the gaming community in general. No one has shit to do in BfA - those players are gonna migrate somewhere.
---
Dude I know what you mean couples that play together are the worst ppl to play with. Right now the guild Im in on netherwing is LC and the GM and his GF raid together and I want out.
---
dude relax with this side picking shit. the community is the community. people switch between horde and alliance all the time. equal likelihood the griefers main alliance on another server. they just make taurens because it’s the most effective way to get in the way and not get killed.
---
Uhmm..
---
What were the numbers for BFA? 
---
My assumption is that BFA started stronger than most expansions but Classic will have stronger lasting power.
---
I see zero need to play any WoW after 8.2 since classic will be shortly after 
---
The only reason I played Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion or BFA is because I enjoyed playing wow but had no alternative.
---
Level 60 is the BEST alternative and I won't ever play modern wow again. Might sound like Hyperbole, but I can assure you it isn't and I'm not alone :)
---
No I dont think it will necessarily match BFA but I think the day 1 #'s will be extremely high and fade a bit overtime and then stabilize then have incremental population increases during content draughts with the main game. I think it might rival the current game and kinda say "Hey this is what a very large portion of your base wants, maybe you can use some of this for your design moving forward".
---
Like bring friends to block routes of escape?
---
Match? It will outgrow it probably in the first few months then take a dump...then those who still play will last years.
---
I think the achievements on the live game devalue themselves by mere inflation. When there are 1000 mounts then only the newest ones for hc content or whatever is the hot shit.
---
Wasn't just the totem, he was intentionally copying the movements of all the duelers just to be an annoying ass. For 5+ hours.
---
People wanted him booted for hours. I imagine the guy got thousands of reports and crying to BlizzardCS
---
Lol.
---
It looks like it’s going to take you more than a few weeks to realize that vanilla pvp isn’t really skill based, but more luck and gear based.
---
At 60 and BWL-AQ tier gear, it’s either you two shot or you get 2 shotted.
---
I think probably more than 5
---
lol. that’s solving a problem by creating a much bigger problem.
---
Roll troll
---
Yea don’t listen to Towlie. He is the last streamer you wanna use for news. The dude healthstoned midtanking and didn’t even realize it. I doubt he is up to date on the horde dueling event.
---
Literally the first time I ever played the game, I gave a guy like 25 silver for a skinning knife.
---
Simply because I had no idea where to buy one.
---
Really depends on him if he got more value out of making a lot of people mad and getting all the attention he got. For some trolls, that 15 minutes of fame is worth it.
---
Blocking the mailbox is always a good waste of time
---
I'm not really sure which of my points you're trying to refute.
---
In the EULA, it says "disrupt the Game experiences of others" which could reasonably be interpreted to mean that they only care about the experience of players. 
---
However, in the Code of Conduct, it isn't so specific. "Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment." I think that trollgodx's actions probably are punishable under that.
---
Feral bear in phase 1 and 2 is really wrong in shoulders and debatable in boots.  Hunter phase 2 is really bad, swapping out truestrike shoulders and breaking devilsaur set is terrible advice. Plus are class quests item confirmed for launch?  These are just the two classes I know best, I'm sure there are other errors.
---
STOP POSTING THIS SOCIAL DRAMA CRAP
---
Ohhgee Haptix Gaming on youtube is pretty good.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwdUQvn5wiWEcjHE77k4Dnw
---
Not the big straw poll, druids are still there least played in everything I've seen.
---
Might be a better idea to wait til Classic releases, so more people can participate. I'm not in the beta atm, and would love to participate in this. Having it when beta launches would increase turnout, most likely.
---
We raided 6 nights a week from 6:30-11pm.
---
You sound like a real keyboard warrior, oh boy, this sounds like a test to me. I hope you’re good at saying goodbye to things. My post wasn’t a threat, it was a statement. The difference between ally and horde means nothing, they’re factions in a video game and the fact that you have such passion towards either side means you are too invested in something totally fictional. Get a real life keyboard man.
---
Professions aren’t really relevant for that quest - networking/finding a good guild should be your priority.
---
If you’re really set on professions for this, then I guess engineering for goblin sappers charged?? Because you’ll be doing a lotttt of farming in Silithus.
---
Absolutely hilarious all the people trying to justify that it was "part of the rules" and "blizzard won't interfere since he was just standing on a player"
---
Maybe this will help them understand that in Vanilla the players helped each other way more than they ever did in any of the expansions... 
---
Or maybe not and they'll only last 6 weeks anyway ;)
---
Well this made my day.
---
Cant wait for live. Streamers are going to be in for a rude awakening. 
---
I'm wondering how far GMs will go when it comes to helping streamers. Can't wait for the drama.
---
Sounds like a challenge to me 😘
---
Very true. Still makes me regret not being able to go though.
---
You can't hit rank 13-14 without premades. In classic there were people who hit rank 14 without that by grinding AV non stop but as a general rule you ain't getting above rank 12 without a premade.
---
I’ve definitely explained the point to you multiple times you’re either just really bored or you live for being wrong on reddit all day.
---
The reason you’re getting insulted by others is because people generally don’t like someone who ignores their points and then claims they never make any good points and constantly find straw-mans in order to support their narrative and keep the argument going, the only reason I’m even still replying is because I’m bored out of my mind on this international flight but it’s incredible how long you’ve been going on about this.
---
There are more than enough people in Australia to continue playing this game. Play OCE unless you are always up late and willing to deal with 200ms latency
---
Sonidigitals stream did this I thought. He’s deep wound warr
---
Oh don't say that. I want it for my fury warrior. like Op I got arlocks but never thekals. At the time I got it as a fury warrior cuz rogues either wanted daggers or maces. And hunters wanted a big 2h with a large agility stat. Other warriors wanted slow 2hs with str. I like living in a world where no one else wants them so I can get tossed to me. The moment you say hunters can use it my dream goes out the window
---
Jellybean did well
---
God damn, the items on that guy. I'd let him impregnate me and I'm a dude.
---
and yet he continues to answer simple questions as if he’s a massive authority on wow.
---
And duels are super important that blizzard needs more manpower making sure people don't stand on top of each other
---
4Head
---
What classes?
---
 "Oh and because you feel so poor about yourself that you have to ruin other people’s fun in order to have fun. You have a sad shitty life."
---
Says the guy threatening to hack people if you're worse at a game.
---
So funny that he couldn’t do the wall jump into the tirisfal dueling area and was getting all embarrassed about it and had to be summoned.
---
Took me about 8 months to get Transcendence Pauldrons after the 1st Chromaggus death.
---
On the lucky side, I basically had every epic item for a Priest drop for me within a month other than Tier 3 chest prior to BC.
---
Some players don't have a 'clique', and (understandably) feel wary about trusting loot distribution to the best judgement of a group of friends that you're not necessarily a close part of. DKP puts your fate more into your own hands.
---
It had great class balance, but flying mounts and the complete separation of gear between pve and pvp was the beginning of all the ruinous things to happen to the game.
---
Streamers are going to ruin classic by constantly reporting. I just know it.
---
Dueling tournaments are always going to have bracket luck. WoW Classic is a big rock paper scissors (Make no mistakes, these guys are INSANE)
---
There are some matchups that no amount of skill will overcome.
---
/sigh Im going to really miss all the graphic updates
---
It wasn’t a threat, it was a statement. It’s more of a “you ruin my fun, I ruin yours” type of thing. Being worse at a game has nothing to do with it, level 60 vs level 30 it doesn’t matter how good you are, you’re not going to kill the level 60.
---
What happens at 38?
---
That's fair but pure classic still supplies at least a year of content and by then people might change their tune about adding new content.
---
I did not know they updated the character models at some point. I just went down a rabbit hole. Maybe I'm an old fart, but I really don't like any of the new character models.
---
Anyway, Classic will peak super hard initially and level out over a month or two. I do think it will compete with BfA. I don't know if it will "kill" BfA, but it will certainly compete with it. I do think it will at least match BfA.
---
No competitive guilds will be taking shadow priests until ZG when the debuff cap is raised to 16. Your safer bet is with mage, but you sound set on shadow priest.
---
100% agree and that's why I'm actually worried about layering staying in the game for 6+ months.
---
Blizzard has not commented on what happens post "phase 1" or "a few weeks" when the populations don't die down and they can't just simply merge the layers into 1 and remove layering.
---
How that isn't the top priority in every media channel about Classic is bonkers... everyone acknowledges it and just "hopes" it magically gets removed within 1-2 months into launch.
---
People pretending that there won't be a build up (sure people will drop off) but the buildup of players will be stronger than the fall off of players.
---
Hmm. I've been thinking about this more, and honestly it could cause some drama simply due to the fact that it would limit the amount of streamers able to stream the event. Just imagine, you're streaming the event with 200 viewers. The next duel is about to start and summons start going out. The show must go on though, so they stop summoning after 10 people. Obviously the duelist, tips, and 7 other streamers who have more viewers than you take priority. Now you're just sitting there, and you have to either literally just watch tips' stream on your stream or sit there and do nothing. I'm actually not even sure it would be better than just having a trollgodx.
---
Early numbers will probably beat retail by a lot, then, like a week or two in when people hit the real leveling system at like 35 people will drop like flies. Most people quit around there on private servers, i dont see it changing for classic
---
Wow. I don’t even need to reply if you’re just gonna put words in my mouth.
---
I 100% believe they should have it as an option. I want classic gameplay I don’t want 2004 models.
---
Meh, just teach yourself to use keybinds. I was a clicker for most of Vanilla and BC.  I switched to keybinds and mouse turning late in BC like while raiding Sunwell!  My capability in-game increased dramatically.  This change combined with the improvements to feral dps in Wrath made me one of the top melee dps in my guild.  I later started tanking on a warrior alt and this helped tremendously with my coordination as a tank. I remember tanking in Vanilla and BC and the slower pace of pulling, gaining and maintaining aggro, marking, etc.   
---
That all to say I think learning to keybind would improve your WoW game experience a lot.
---
I'm surprised people bring up Seren so much, but I guess its because of trollgodx.
---
No one got fucked more than Sodapoppin. He was 100% winning Game 3 before he hit the fucking bad luck RNG lottery on having a full fear run him straight out of bounds to where he couldn't get back in time.
---
Soda was probably winning the tournament if he didn't get forced to flee that original Game 3 match. He was ahead and was seemingly going to win that set.
---
Hmm. I've been thinking about this more, and honestly it could cause some drama simply due to the fact that it would limit the amount of streamers able to stream the event. Just imagine, you're streaming the event with 200 viewers. The next duel is about to start and summons start going out. The show must go on though, so they stop summoning after 10 people. EVERYONE on the server is going to want to be summoned of course. Obviously the duelist, tips, and 7 other streamers who have more viewers than you take priority. Now you're just sitting there, and you have to either literally just watch tips' stream on your stream or sit there and do nothing. I'm actually not even sure it would be better than just having a trollgodx.
---
Thoughts?
---
I also think it will depend on server type as well. I see more rogues being on pvp servers that pve. So if you plan to play on pve servers(like me) then I doubt rogue will be overly saturated.
---
It actually helps a ton, I thought these people needed some serious help. I've played games my whole life, watch twitch somewhat often, and have never heard of this lol. Thank you, seriously
---
Envelope/ Splityourwig here. This video brings me so much joy.
---
For healing and dps no, but as a warrior tank you’ll want to be wearing all plate for the most part. Same for feral druids or prot pallies, since armor is valuable.
---
I remember being obsessed with getting flights paths when I first played vanilla. I would deathrun to areas that were well outside my level range just to see if their was a flight path there.
---
Maybe I can convince you then.... warlock is the smoothest leveling experience, one of the best 1v1 classes in pvp, low pop so there's less competition, most of the best pre raid gear can be crafted via tailoring yourself, free level 40 mount, pvp and pve spec can be the same (sm ruin) and one of the best classes for farming gold. Warlock is the dad class... if you want to get the most out of classic and you have less hours warlock is for you. I might make a video about this because after agonising over it and comparing the pros and cons of every class warlock wins.
---
We all know, if you want to have a lot of people on your friendlist, all you have to do is to be a fail streamer like Asmongold. :)
---
apparently not. people go nuts about their ‘team’ after they start feeling allegiance to the side they’ve chosen. it’s complete stupidity but it’s human nature.
---
Lol wat
---
If this was a big deal don't you think GM's would of stepped in or something granted how many people were watching?
---
Too many carebears in today's audience.
---
Leveling as a party is already so much slower than soloing, it really won’t matter. That being said:
---
Dungeons/group content give horrible exp per hour, and are only “worth” it if you have quests or are gunning for specific gear upgrades that are worth the time. Because of that, most players spec/gear for optimal solo potential. For paladins, that’s ret.
---
The friend rolling holy is going to find out quickly that the cloth gear with isn’t/spirit, and a 1h and shield is going to leave them taking more than a full minute to kill a single enemy their level.
---
The friend rolling prot is going to find out that even with str mail gear, 1h+shield damage is awful before late 40’s-60, and even then is pretty bad outside of gimmicky AoE builds.
---
One you all realize how terrible Paladin leveling is in general, and how bad group / dungeon focused leveling is, you’ll all start to want to optimize your solo gameplay (if you don’t straight up quit). Doing so means you’ll all start aiming for strong 2h weapons and ret gear, and will all likely spec ret.
---
You’ll then end up having to run the same dungeon multiple extra times until everyone gets what they want from it, which will end up taking **way** more time than the gear itself is worth.
---
So yeah, if you’re set on doing group leveling or dungeon focused leveling, triple Paladin is about the worst way to go about it.
---
I mean everyone in australia played with 200+ ms during vanilla.
---
Educated guesses put BFA at having stabilized somewhere between 2-4 million players worldwide.
---
I'm sure that it will be fine once the data is acquired but that's going to take time.
---
I would hope that there would be at least one site out there that can get cooperation from blizzard to at least fill the loot tables even if drop rates are unknown.
---
But from what you said it seems that we will never get highly accurate drop rates since it will only be select sample data to draw from.
---
stop posting at all lol
---
Yeah, Sonii texted some Community Developer he knows and the response was "nothing we can do".
---
Shut up you miserable sob.
---
Hi, /u/new-stock
---
&gt; ignores their points and then claims they never make any good points
---
And yet not a single person addressed my main point about bringing bosses back to cities technically being against TOS - in an even more serious manner - but should still be in the game. They are the ones ignoring my points, not the other way around.
---
You should just relax. It's just a videogame beta. No need to get worked up.
---
People will insult me because they *have* no argument, that's what ad hominems are for, though I think they've been deleted by now.
---
I just found out I can run retail on a 400$ acer aspire from like 4 years ago, haven't tried a raid, big cities are a little laggy, but otherwise it's fine. May build a pc when I get close to 60 lol
---
When raiding MC as a rogue I had medium DKP and ended up in a run as only one of 3 rogues, and the other 2 were already geared. I got something like 3 pieces in 1 run, including the boob shoulders.
---
Epic shoulders were so awesome to get back then I would get random whispers in Org about it.
---
I agree, everything people have been talking about that they wanted has been the community, difficulty, and just the play of the old game.
---
The graphics is all about nostalgia, and its fine for people who want to play with them, but there is no reason for people to be as vehemently opposed to an option for all the new graphics that is currently in retail as I have seen in threads.
---
Have you seen the new WSG? I just did my first time in it yesterday, and it was the most beautiful thing I've seen in years.
---
Very nice, more than I expected but given that I would assume Classic will be on par with BFA for a solid year since those BFA numbers will go down.
---
No it was strictly forbidden
---
I can totally relate with that. I was 100% about rolling a Dwarf priest now I'm not so sure.
---
That's one thing I don't mind all that much to be honest. The drama will be juicy.
---
On the other hand, it's only juicy if they are quarantined to their own server, would suck to level to 20 and realize a big streamer is on your server.
---
I was in the same boat. Finally just told myself in playing gnome Warlock. I want to casually raid and pvp and warlock is perfect for that.
---
You don’t have to miss it. Afaik codes from 2004 are still valid as long as you’re willing to shell out something like $10,000 :)
---
Really though, these things are extremely rare and valuable and I think it’s fine they won’t be obtainable through alternative methods.
---
Not impressive in the slightest.
---
A lot of these duels were decided by rng, and it’s just constant resets by the class that is the best at resets - mage.
---
Also, that warlock was pretty fuckin bad. He had plenty of chances to get shadow bolt casts off and opted for wanding instead. On top of that, he could’ve hard summoned a succubus to ensure one of those wins. 
---
When will you fools realize that wow pvp relies on gear and luck moreso than skill, and the reason resets are King is because classes can two shot each other at a decent gear level?
---
He didn't get layered. GMs teleported him to Winterspring. Trollgodx was whispering Sony about it on stream.
---
The Glossary sections with common terms and acronyms got me emotional.
---
That's a very good population for EQ. Especially for one that's been stuck on the same content.
---
  
---
My point was that the pop didn't drastically decrease. It's been very steady and healthy. In my opinion, WoW which was about 28 times more popular than EQ, will also have a very active classic population. Will it be over a million be players? Hell no. Will they always be able to fill a server? Definitely.
---
6 hours and 33 minutes?! Jesus, is it actually them making the whole game?
---
I'm the kind of player that thinks that scamming (in game) should not be punished by blizz, and still think that tauren should have been banned.
---
Any griefing that doesn't have any kind of counterplay should be a banneable offense
---
I rolled 100 on the ZG raptor at lvl 60 with my guild.
---
We only ever saw one Elementium Reinforced Bulwark. I honestly forget what shield I had through BWL but I was hurting for a shield upgrade so bad that my guild eventually gave me the item for the AQ40 bug shield.
---
We used EPGP in wrath and it was great. The anti hoarding irked some people who wanted to game the system but it rewarded the ones who showed up every night and volunteered to help gear out our bench players via 10 man raids on their alts.
---
Ha, I'm just the same way as you and the other guy.  I always used the term Classic before because it just made sense to me and "Vanilla" sounded stupid, but just this year I've realized basically what The Lurker said.
---
Something a bit tedious like "Classic 2006" might work, but then some things about Classic might have been specific to 2005, so do you say "Classic 2005/6?"  But that could be confusing too with the /6, and "Classic 2005/2006" gets to be too long for a casual conversation term, so yeah, "Vanilla" it is, oh well.
---
To me, it's just like Damage Dealer &amp; DD to DPS and S&gt; &amp; B&gt; to WTS &amp; WTB.  I don't like the term DPS to refer to a role name and I can't understand why people would change from S&gt; and B&gt; (PST is also very slightly strange to me but I get that one), but at some point I just had to acquiesce to simply being able to communicate efficiently with people.
---
I've realized I'm old by now, lol.
---
And what rule book are you referring to here? One of the most popular vanilla PvP videos of all time showcases a mage polying+drinking like 10 times in one duel (Swifty Incredible Warrior Tricks).
---
There's a command in game that can be used to hide bones and bodies, turning them into bread. This funtion is usually already activated on Chinese clients.
---
Perhaps because the violencelevel is set to low in this video? (1 = less blood, 5 = a lot of blood)
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/CVar_violenceLevel
---
On my very first character I just finished the human starting zone and was walking out the gate to goldshire, and I accidentally held my left mouse button down and moved my camera. I didn't know that was how to rotate the camera so it was just stuck looking top-down at my character, I eventually gave up after trying to reset it and just started again thinking that I had ruined the camera permanently.  
---
I kept the 'Raider's' red mail armor well past its usefulness just because I liked the matching set, I think I got to redridge and finally caved in because I was getting almost one-shot by everything.  
---
I couldn't decide what class I wanted to play as a main, so I always ended up starting again by level 30, my brother tricked me and said if I make too many characters the monthly subscription price will increase.
---
A raid of people easily can. Polymorph if they drop down, fear them into a corner and rogues stun the fuck out of them. Or just start with stuns. It would take a large coordinated group to fuck it up. In which case it becomes a PvP incident like winterspring
---
Kitty druids generally put out the same dps as rogues in vanilla.
---
I will definitely level a warlock at some point just don't know if it will be my first or second toon. Ease of leveling, free first mount and ability to grind/make gold make it very attractive but the epic mount issue and the fact I've only ever raided/end gamed on a caster during wrath(warlock in icc) and always been melee otherwise makes me wonder if I want it to be my main.
---
You don't even need collusion for those behaviors to form. If tier pants drop /every/ week, people recognize it,  and they realize all you have to do is be a little patient.
---
Also you can tame Broken Tooth at that point, no? Or was that 42.
---
Yeah some people are going to try to avoid streamer servers, I’m the opposite. I look forward to them.
---
"Useless" is definitely the wrong word here. Less than desirable, maybe? I can't see them having zero value compared to an empty spot or an idiot rogue who blows up the raid or dies instantly.
---
"Dramatic" would be a good way to describe your approach to anything on this subreddit. 
---
But using 20sec boss fights in very early tiers as an example of why mana issues are *not the reason that these classes are exempt from raids is an extremely narrow minded analysis. 
---
The more likely culprit are the tropes perpetuated by people like you.
---
ngl this sub has been sperging out for the last 5+ hours about it so i'm gonna go out on a limb and say troll god x is absolutely KEKING himself right now
---
Link to that?
---
Is there videos from the tourney??? Inwas sleeping and i would love to watch the duels
---
CAN NOT FUCKING WAIT BOYS
---
A lot of people need to remember there was and probably iwll be a World/Global channel where LFG is usually asked, so let's hope that gets back into fashion.
---
I have no clue what the whole video is about because of only how far I am but it mind as well be huh?
---
I mean, I fucking loooved feral op as Hell when we got mangle as the 41 pt talent in the pre patch. Looking back and now trying to play feral at even 60 without it would be nothing less than disappointing and painful.
---
A fair amount will play both, especially at the start of the game because MC is a snorefest easily done in 1-2 hours. There also won't be any battlegrounds and world PvP definitely isn't for everyone. So you do your weekly MC and Ony, then jump into BFA for more raiding/PvP. The best part of vanilla imo is when BWL and ZG is the current content.
---
Of there are enough players, someone will get super lucky and already have Thunderfury within the first month (or at least both halves)
---
Had they planned for Deathwing to attack Stormwind since the launch of Vanilla?
---
While leveling, probably be best to all just go ret and just use tank/healing gear in instances.
---
ITT: Carebears
---
I was a clicker and keyboard turner from Vanilla to late BC.  Heck, went on to be in a top raiding guild in BC!  I haven't played much in a few years so rusty at it now.
---
I got taken to SM Library for the staff in my early 30s thinking it was a tanking weapon for feral druids. 
---
I disenchanted or sold EVERYTHING I got that I could not wear immediately.  Oh, the lost gear I got turned into vendor trash or enchanting mats that could have made me loads of gold. I didn't get my 40 riding skill until my guild bought it for me! 
---
Vanilla was fun and my noob adventures continued in BC.
---
Either that or they came up with the idea because someone remembered this quest conversation lmao 
---
Would be interesting either way I think
---
Classic newbie here.. What is DKP?
---
Will twinking be viable in classic?
---
Sounds like it is Drama Friday material. Up for a challenge? Send Preach the story.
---
New rank of lightning bolt and I think either earth shock or lightning shield. But also with that new lightning bolt you can spend enough points in elemental to reduce it down to 2.2s cast speed and you start actually feeling like an Ele shaman with elemental devastation and 36 yd range.
---
Its the level where everything comes together and Ele kill speed even then starts to dwarf enhance. Spam lightning bolt to victory.
---
&gt;  The downfall of Tauren hunters is against other hunters in PvP they (ally hunters) can stand in your dead zone but still range attack you.
---
Wrong.
---
A really quick example would be Onyxia. She has a larger hitbox and as such, you need to stand further back in order to shoot her. It's the same for taurens, on a smaller scale.
---
Check out this [neat resource](https://web.archive.org/web/20080319141926/http://tkasomething.com/deadzone.php)
---
&gt; However, a Night Elf Hunter and Tauren Hunter will always be in range to fire or melee each other at the exact same time, since both are using targeted abilities that take into account their combined displacement values.
---
I'm pretty sure I linked the same page to you earlier on the forums!
---
&gt;but then some things about Classic might have been specific to 2005, so do you say "Classic 2005/6?"
---
Wouldn't you have to say Vanilla 05 too then? How does that change anything? I'm pretty sure no person will assume that I mean the classic that's coming out soon when I say "in the original classic... ". You could even call the new version that's coming out Vanilla too, for example: "Hey did you know that Vanilla is coming out soon again? Yeah, they're releasing a Vanilla server option." Original classic just sounds superior to me.
---
You can’t even get it until phase 3 with BWL....
---
Druids are great all-round in PVE &amp; PVP. Here's a gear list if you are interested in playing Druid in vanilla. 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#
---
Yes but only after warlocks get deathcoil.
---
And that warlock was a scrub.
---
Venruki made it a lot harder than it had to be.
---
Thank you for the corrections, my bad I didn't know it was broken. 
---
Yea the streams are nice. Really nice to see the ones we've gotten recently. I posted it to see if anyone might be interested too.
---
 You don't even need collusion for those behaviors to form. If tier pants drop /every/ week, people recognize it, and they realize all you have to do is be a little patient to get the rarer stuff.
---
Hi, /u/HighoctaneXD
---
Yeah it would be funny because it took them 5 hours to use one command. You're an idiot.
---
I think my link was broken yes, my bad
---
When your fake internet girlfriend was named Rosalina and your friend was named Ross I was worrying this was going to take a turn for the catfish variety where it turned out you were wanking it to your buddy.
---
This was worse somehow.
---
Imagine only having 2-4 million people paying you 15 dollars a month. What a joke of a game.
---
I jest to point out most MMOs are happy to have 250k concernnet players, while people say wow is dead at 4 million.
---
He probably sees the futility of playing on a server with a tiny half life. All the effort disappears so might as well have fun for a few hours instead.
---
Yup, but what does undead have that isn’t roughly the same level of power?
---
I wouldn't describe BFA as stabilized.  People have been quitting in droves since December in my experience.  I'd bet they have been bleeding subs since then.
---
To you but value is relative and no reason to fault people for how they enjoy something.
---
[Poppycock.](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx) Take a look at the highest all-time DPS in any Raid from Druids compared to Rogues. The best Rogues on all pservers do 30+% more than the best DPS Druids.
---
Sure, a very good Feral Druid with a bunch of consumables could overtake an average or below average Rogue without consumables, but to say they put out the same DPS in similar conditions is silly.
---
*faaaaaaancy!*
---
Druids. Mediocre leveling tank and DPS in the same spec. Cat form has the best dance. And, you just run around shapeshifted 98% of the time so no one knows how lame your gear looks. Problem solved.
---
Which ever engineering stream allows you to teleport to tenaris, and cooking, since you can make the good stam food (monster omelet?)
---
You can absolutely brute force magmadar, bwl is a different story though.
---
You be looking mighty fine
---
I actually use this based off a quote from Reckful himself saying Snutz was and likely still is the most mechanically skilled WoW player ever.
---
playing through the classic beta now and at least at lower levels, pally seems so boring to level.
---
I was a keyboard player but clicked spells that weren’t bound to the standard keys (1-=).  My friends only found out when we were doing arenas on LAN at my house during TBC.  Our warrior saw me click bubble and freedom on my holy pally.  We were already at 2100 in S1.  He was pretty shocked and has never let me live it down.  I ended up binding everything and making glad in all three brackets, but I will forever be the noob pally clicking bubble.
---
Imagine the GM's taking 5 hours to type one in game command. Get a grip kid. If Blizzard stepped in the troll would of been moved in minutes.
---
Don't RP-PVP servers tend to be.. unpopular and dead? I like the idea a lot in theory, I just never liked it in practice. 
---
I want everyone to get the things they want, but I also hope the population isn't too fractured. I want it to feel like 2007 up in hurr.
---
Added another one. Its an old one but a mage confirmed  it was still bugged
---
Now that I look at it again, "original" is almost the same length as saying the year or years anyway and reads better, so uh, nevermind, just ended up sharing my own story then!
---
Big mac index is a real thing.
---
I have seen many guilds so far that want to go with loot council but at the same time are not overly progression oriented. Is this a red flag?
---
Axe specialisation also helps for warriors, but people have a tendency to over/under inflate its usefulness.
---
Dragon kill points. Its a system guilds use to manage loot. You get points for good attendance, prepping consumes etc, when an item drops you bid on it using dkp
---
Depending on what you're hoping to get from the experience you're fine playing whatever classes you want. Rolling with 3 pally's is going to slow down your gearing process at every level of the game, but if that's fine then there's nothing stopping you. 
---
Finding a raid that has a spot for 3 paladin buddies, though, could be tricky.
---
TY. Im leveling horde on Stonemaul right now just killing time.
---
Interrupting some retarded streamers bullshit is now faction griefing?   Holy shit..
---
It's been a long time since I have physically laughed at *any* meme...but this....this got a wholehearted chortle out of me.
---
My wife is watching Netflix in the other room and wants to know what's so funny.
---
My favorite was watching cdew absolutely CLAP people with windfury. His gap closing and spell knowledge was top notch. 
---
second was ziqo/vens control. can't wait to see what they'll do at 60.
---
Thank you...im leveling some horde on Stonemaul just killing time when I can and streaming it.
---
It's estimated to be around 2 mil NA/EU and 2 mil Asia. So around 4 mil worldwide.
---
waiting another 2 weeks for borderlands 3.
---
Own an xdrive and am alliance.
---
1. Yes it will be available the first Sunday after launch. The time will depend on what region your server is in.
---
2. Yes the quest rewards (fishing pole and trinket) are available. You only get to choose one, so get the pole and then try to win again for the trinket.
---
3. No, there’s no fishing level requirement on the pools.
---
Spend the 6 days getting as high level as you can do you can survive STV and then have at it. Make sure to set your hearth to Booty Bay.
---
less people would be watching if they were able to play the game.
---
Wow, right on, ty. Ele is one of the specs I think I want to play. I remember getting crit by chain lightning in BGs with my headphones on, and it's loud as fuck and I feel like I'm getting wrecked. Now I wanna be that guy lol.
---
My guild's main tank was a feral druid during vanilla. There are some fights that they can't main tank 100% but druids get more armor &amp; more health than prot warriors so outside of those few fights there is no reason to prioritise a warrior over druid.
---
I bought an acer nitro 5 with a i7 8750h 16gb ram and a 1060 6gb video card. Runs retail just fine so i guess it will run classic even better
---
to add to these hypotheticals, in the next part of the quest a gnome says sarcastically "what do you mean, what am I doing? I'm waiting for the next Dark Portal to open, what the heck do you think I'm doing?" I suppose that could be insinuating nothing but after that deathwing comment I'm reading everything with more scrutiny.
---
sotp dots
---
I was a horde warlock who capped snowfall a lot in TBC before the reinforcement change. I got some fun PMs.
---
Warrior, paladin, demon hunter are cake. Start with easy and work up
---
Nothing. All games are boring until I get classic
---
This cant be real LMAO
---
yep, could go to google and just find a pic of a random geared 60 and say it's yours lol
---
 don't  work on new client. Around 1min

---
I'll be glad to have #showtooltip back. years of playing on private servers, it has been rough trying to find a good macro image in the hundreds of irrelevant ones.
---
Warriors are the best tanks in Vanilla hands down.
---
Visual clutter mostly.  Especially on a Mage you can fill up your hotbars really quick with lots of little things like this (portals, trinkets, potions, random gadgets).  I personally had this style of macro for Frostbolt, and a slightly different one for Arcane Explosion and Blizzard that changed ranks based on if you were in combat or not - mostly to try and get Rogues out of stealth in PVP.
---
That is just why it is fun, since if it was great the first time, it might be the second, perhaps even better as you have experience.
---
I tried it on my shitty i5u with 750m dell laptop and it was fine on high 1080 60fps, so you could definitely go pretty cheap if you wanted.
---
shouldn't that be directed to the person spending 5 hours for their own self benefit, just trying to annoy others?
---
This is my favorite thing about wow back in the day. No cross realm play. Difficult to reroll. So if you fucked up, EVERYBODY knew who you were and treated you accordingly. Rip storm kid aman thul in BC
---
I played from vanilla to now and there were no servers in Aus until 2 weeks before WoD, was perfectly playable but you'll struggle to find people online at the same time as you
---
PvE frost and PvP frost are different animals entirely, not to mention if youre AP Frost.
---
Why?  Bullshit macros to have pets auto kill totems is cancer.
---
Who are you to decide what another person should do with their time?
---
Mage won, finals was mage v lock. Shaman got third.
---
&gt;Now, just find a guild of 39 people that agree with that.
---
Yep, that's the tricky bit. Almost assuredly one of those 39 will have a perfectly capable prot warrior friend who is willing to tank it, so people will have to provide some serious reasons why they should risk wipes just so someone can tank as a big puppy or whatever it is druids do.
---
I healed during vanilla &amp; i remember it pretty clearly, i remember the huge spikes in damage that 1 shot tanks regardless of them being druids or warriors. 
---
This was common until the tank greatly out geared the encounter. It is also why during vanilla healers prioritised int over things like +healing because on some encounters you had to straight up overheal the tanks on boss animations because if you didn't they would get a random 1 shot.
---
To me I like support/utility. So probably thinking Mage/Priest.  
---
Have capped both, enjoyed Priest a lot from BC-Legion. Classic played Shaman, loved it a lot also. I like the cloth armor a bit more, as well as staves. Going the boring route with Humans. Know they're not as great in PvP(Alliance) but eh, it'll be enjoying to play even so.

making an argument in this case has no purpose.  No one needs to prove being disruptive to others just to benefit yourself is poor behavior.  Let alone a lack of self control.
---
If you're concerned with difficulty druid is definitely the way to go. Your rotation is just maul and swipe with about 4 utility spells.  
---
Compared to warrior with about 5 abilities for rotation and 10 utility spells it's much easier.  
---
The cool thing about druid is you can shift to throw heals/innervate/rebirth sometimes but it's rare that's really useful in a 5 man and almost never in a raid if you're MT - you really just sit in bear and press 2 buttons.
---
who cares about streamer garbage
---
I mean you could technically feed the enemy kills in a BG. Making your teams chances lower and the others higher.
---
eh, if the parry for tanks makes it so they have 10% less threat or so, and warriors are riding threatcap, but others aren't, then warriors do 10% less dmg and the gap between other dps decreases for actual boss dmg, not theoretical max dps.
---
If you want to tank as a feral, it works fine. Take all the bear talents  past the 2nd tier, you’re golden. Make groups, run instances, disregard haters. Late leveling game (ST-BRD) gets tougher on everyone. You might consider grabbing a rogue or shaman to help on interrupts. 
---
Lolcat is still lolcat—for soloing.
---
Wouldn't people still need to farm multiple, though? Wipes will be a common thing for a lot of guilds.
---
BFA had 3.4 million sales in first 24 hours.
---
This is one of my main concerns.  Economies will play out different because people know what’s coming.

They almost should tweak some stuff to throw off any major planning.

No point arguing over this concept, here's a quick video i found that correlates with the experiences i had with feral druids during vanilla WoW.

Man you’re brutal, you never mentioned kiting bosses to your cities in any of your posts until [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bw0jlr/tipsout_duel_tournament/epurvao/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) brought it up.
---
Dragons are NPCs, if they are making it hard on the players because they’re being kited to cities then you can simply leave the city and go somewhere else until the dragon is killed by other players.
---
Real player harassment, and faction on faction harassment, such as jumping on dueling characters is a breach of the TOS, regardless of if it’s being streamed or not, and players have been banned for things like this in the past.
---
Yeah. It's a strange thing. To see how big that name got
---
I wouldn't personally put it in so strong a term as "red flag."
---
Most loot councils will be run fairly.  But it might be a caution to watch for other signs of favoritism.
---
Mostly, I'd ask what the policy is and what the loot council is looking for when assigning loot.  Then keep an eye out for behavior that runs counter to that plan.
---
For 40 mount skinning.

For epic mount- depends on what you want to do but herb and alchemy will make good money.

Yea just find the rogues that’s stealthing and polymorph them. Good idea.

Do it! One of the best things about Classic is answering the call when the filthy Horde nolifers invade Redridge. Best thing is that these griefers are always spectacularly bad at the game, I guess that's why they gank lowbies, but it means I can easily dispatch of them even with my meagre PvP skills.
---
They didnt mention specifically, but theyve been doing pre downloads for xpacs for a while now, so I dont think classic will be any different.

He was standing on competitors and their totems as well.  You don't buy it because you obviously weren't fucking watching.

world pvp — warlock
---
There’s a weekly thread in the sidebar for posts like these. Please keep them there.
---
The problem with that is that raid attendance will drop when players have all they need from a lower tier. We had that problem and had to remove seperate dkp tiers.
---
Your cousin looks like someone who takes 4 hours to complete RFC.
---
Right, as one person I'll just come shit in your bed tonight.  Is that okay with you?  You won't get mad will you?
---
You could tank if you heal until aQ gear and then once a warrior gets naxx gear your healing again.
---
Do it.
---
Ele is unique in that its the only healer that can do really good instance DPs, heal, and tank specifically caster mobs really well with its shields, interupts, grounding and resist totems.
---
Also, an armored caster than can heal and provide huge burst damage in PvP is pretty clutch. In large scale wpvp, you can sit back and just dump chain lightning and purges.
---
If thats your opinion you should quit wow.   
---
Blizzard's plots, acting, dialogue, etc. is hackneyed, full of tropes, and with seemingly logical and rational actors doing entirely irrational and illogical things. 
---
I like their world building, they do a fantastic job of that. But Blizzard does a terrible job of "Showing not telling" with their exposition.

That said, I am excited to see what Sebastian Stepian (formerly of CD Projekt Red) does as Blizzards new Creative lead.

I doubt you’d have to fight too hard for it, even if it is an awesome name. What class is it gonna be?
---
Both lucky and unlucky. The day before TBC released we ran MC one last time for the memories, and a binding of the windseeker dropped, no one wanted it, I was a hunter so I didn’t speak up initially but after seeing it would be wasted they gave it to me. 
---
Lucky: I got a binding on my hunter
---
Unlucky: TBC came out the next day and I never tried to farm the other half, or do the quest. Mostly because everyone was too busy pushing through new content.
---
It was a beta event and the community in general thinks this guy is a dumbass and should be at least kicked out of beta.  This isn't real classic.  Real classic you have reputation on a server and the community can more or less exile you.  That's not really possible on beta.
---
What’s your point here?
---
Warriors and mages.
---
Join the RP server.

I think it will do better than bfa

It's really the only way to minimize the occurrence of homosexual slurs. It's rather unfortunate, but it's the one place you will have the majority of people that are mature, and it's kind of in the rules of an RP Realm.
---
Even if you could bubble hearth, it would DQ you since you would leave the duel area.
---
being a human being comes with responsibility. If you don't think so, then why can't I just step on you?
---
As the Druid, Druid tanking is easier, Maul, Swipe spam, occasional Faerie Fire and Demo Roar. You take more damage so its a bit harder on the healer.
---
Okay... avoid the PVP server. It seems (on the outside) to be attracting the sweaty MAGA crowd.
---
Even better!
---
Because someone trolled a group/event? Or because people complained about it? I’m not sure the context you are trying to convey here. Not that it matters because people trolled events and people complained long before streamers existed.
---
He’s the worst
---
Now that you mention it...
---
I’m sorry you have to endure any of this abuse, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up for Classic. Private servers are way more toxic than Vanilla ever was and Retail isn’t much better except a few things Blizzard doesn’t condone. And since voice chat will be on the Realm discord, it’ll be up to a few non-Blizzard moderators to police anything. 
---
That being said, you’ll certainly be able to find a guild that doesn’t give a shit about your sexuality or voice. Those will be the people you play with the most and they’re the ones that will hear you.
---
Don’t let Barrens Chat discourage you from finding the real community within guilds.
---
Spirit was functionally useless on Shammy and Pally healers (I can't remember druids) in Vanilla as priests have a talent (I think it was a talent) that gave them X% of out of combat regen to happen in combat.
---
Shaman and paladins didn't have this talent so sprit didn't do a whole lot in combat for them
---
Actually I think trolls will be in for a rude awakening.  They are going to actually be held accountable for their shitty behavior but actual servers will have communities that they have to answer to.
---
I think you'll be fine. Dont bring this up in Barren Chat because it's Barren Chat. But I know in Pserver scene, there were guilds promoting / looking for LGBTQ players or advertising full inclusiveness friendly guild.
---
With that said - Humans are humans and I may need you to remove that rose tainted glasses just in case. As I said - Barren chat can and will be ruthless. Expect lots of slurs, homophobic slurs, tons of political or hot topic discussion and trolls will go out of their way to push people button. Barren chat can be so fucking awesome and so horrible. It will probably traumatize you if you get involved into barren chat. So careful with that is all.
---
"My comment got ignored for being shitty somewhere, better make a new thread linking to it"
---
They are just really hard to play well, in all their specs. Well I guess boomkin isn't hard, it's just impossible. I've seen resto druids perform exceptionally well and good druids are crucial for some fights. Also by reserving the innervates for the priests you are basically cutting their mana in half. It's the same reason why people claim mages do double the warlock damage. It's all based on actual vanilla experiences where mages got all the gear and power infuses while the warlocks often couldn't even use their optimal specs and spells.
---
There have always been, and there will always be toxicity in any game. Find a group that is chill, and you'll feel comfy going on voice chat. I personally had an old guildmate who turned out to be gay, but like it didn't really change anything about him. He was always the same guy to us, it never mattered that he likes to fuck dudes.
---
You need 2 or 3 depending on coding and if you use SW:P first one is shadow weaving second is SW:P and third and here I'm not 100% sure mindflay
---
Good Alliance Warlocks are harder to find than good Mages\*
---
It holds a lot less true for Horde.
---
Stream Sniping I believe is actually against TOS if I recall correctly.
---
&gt;  In pvp unless you're gonna go oom by the end of the encounter you'd benefit more from doing that extra bit of damage 
---
Do a Battleground instead of 1v1 and you'll understand the importance of rank 1 nova pretty quickly.
---
To be fair, Despite the fact that it was released as it was and was as it was for years. 
---
the flipped version looks....more appropriate. The sword flipped as it was in classic wouldve been a lot more unweildly to use.
---
I wouldnt be suprised if the vanilla version was incorrect and whats on live was what had beeen intended all along.
---
That said, it looks "cooler" the original way.
---
try both very different playstyle
---
They did dumbass.   Funny how people not watching it are chiming it.  Fuck off.
---
Can a full rotation be macro? Like a rogue doing one thing after the other with 1 button?
---
It’s a weird cycle.
---
In 2006 if they had a poll for flying mounts, it would have been voted 100% to 0%.
---
Flying mounts were so fucking hyped, everybody wanted them.  Walk for 3 fucking years and then you’ll understand.
---
Same with LFG system.  Spend your entire 4 hour play session in trade chat looking for group and you’ll hate the natural formation.
---
Vanilla into BC into Wrath, can be the perfect trilogy a video game series has ever been.  Maybe 9 to 18 months between expansions.  Then run the trilogy like seasons.  Restart them after Wrath.  This will give us the perfect time loop to spend the rest of our lives.
---
Delete it, it will ruin the Community.
---
What happen to them? I only watched Snutz's matches and i didnt see them at the final.

Can anyone tell me why the tauren has a 'n' shaped neck and his hump goes 3 feet up and down?

Sounds like politics.
---
Hahah, thanks for the tip! I was actually thinking PvE might be nicer, so I might stick to it in Classic. 
---
RP servers actually look like a load of fun, but it's just not quite my thing!
---
My laptop barely handles BFA on minimum settings but Classic on minimum was fine.
---
I like this idea of a two way point spending system. A low fixed cost and an optional 50% of total points way for when you really want something.
---
i dunno. my account was hacked and when i came back, i had a ton of gold + ores. seemed like they kept all the items to keep me alive while using my character as a miner. maybe if an account doesn't have a high gathering profession, they just sell the items and transfer the gold?
---
? Do you think GMs just spectate players all the time and don't act until enough players bitch. Or do you think Gms are alerted when a significant number of players report a player for griefing ? Hard to do one command to stop a griefer when you don't know the griefers exists.
---
Also where the fuck are you pulling 5 hours? It took 20 mintues tops. Go suck a dick pussy.
---
Realm first cook in Wrath was a big deal.
---
Classic ≠ Vanilla ≠ normal progression
---
Don't you think the item introduce in 1.12.1 patch will make older raid completely trivial? We are talking months if not years before phase 5 and 6 to get content with a little challenge no?
---
Shadow priest higher than combat rogue? I don't believe it.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433646958
---
Again, no it doesn't.
---
Well Pom/Pyro for mage with trinkets.  Warrior is just intercept--&gt;MS, maybe heroic strike if they're not dead?  Warriors get silly, because the better their gear is the more rage they generate.  So you give a warrior Might of Menethil or Dark Edge of Insanity with good T2.5 gear they will steamroll.
---
Eh... it's not like they expect you to constantly be in character. There'll be some guilds that will but for the most part it's just a PVE server with more Lore Nerds. In my personal experience.
---
I think you're totally right, and I'll try to keep my expectations realistic. Hearing a slur or two won't ruin the game for me, but it definitely would be nicer without.
---
And yeah, Barrens Chat is a mixed bag haha. There's good and bad everywhere!
---
I bet 50% of the player base has quit since BFA launch, I wouldnt doubt BFA numbers being down in the 1.2-1.8 million range. Lower than the first few months of vanilla wow.
---
More useful for what?
---
I too watched the dueling tournament.
---
They weren't that rare. First guild had 'too many warriors' which actually worked out better than fine. 2nd had three dudes spamming ms until the normalization patch and then we had 4-6 furies from there on out.  I don't know what these massive buffs you're referring to are, they got buffed when bt was made useful in pve but that was bwl patch and they got buffed again when 19% hard dw hit cap was removed. They got buffs in other patches just by blizz fixing things that were broken but 1.6 was the only patch they got talent points refunded as far as I remember.
---
Cheers man. There's toxicity in any game, but there's good people too. I don't doubt I'll find a good guild!
---
Cheers man!
---
I mean it was pretty fucking annoying and it was just beta, don’t really care if the trollgods got banned or teleported or whatever
---
Its BC the new characters models are genuinely awful.
---
I don’t know about August but this year is a really busy one. Fire Emblem, Animal Crossing and Pokemon. Any one of those I can put 100’s hours into and now Classic is coming too. Eep!
---
I got into the beta.
---
Bug? It was a feature
---
You could have the other faction act as guards, at least on PvP servers. Just have a rogue or two ready to gank whatever troll comes near. Also for actual Classic, these people will have their reputation to think about. Nobody will crash an event like this on their mains, so it will be lowbies and those are easily removed.
---
Here's a post from Blizzard:
---
"For example, in original WoW, items were added to give players a way to quickly prepare for Ahn’Qiraj without having to spend months in Molten Core and Blackwing Lair."
---
Don't you think 1.12.1 will make MC completely trivial?
---
I heard an unverified rumor the classic realms will be named things that have become memes related to classic, such as Mankrik’s Wife or Leeroy Jenkins.
---
So (2/3)^22 since you can multiply the exponents from (2/3)*(2/3) being (2/3)^2
---
Since we don't know the numbers of BfA in the first place, I'm going to make up some numbers based on my experience.
---
BfA launch subs: 8 Mill
---
Current BfA subs: 2-3 Mill
---
What is the hype behind Classic? Well, I can't speak for everyone, but I think it's pretty telling when there are more people (100k+) were watching Asmongold clear Deadmines than WoW E-sports or World First races.
---
Classic launch subs: 6-7 Mill
---
1 months: 8-9 Mill
---
3 months: stabilizing somewhere around 7-8 Mill
---
There is a major chance it may be bigger too. Classic is a game that 99% of the WoW fanbase wants to play. I for sure know that I already took out two weeks so I can play on launch with my bros, and that the very first session will last 20 hours. We already placed orders in the nearest restaurants, so that our food will arrive precisely 45 minutes before launch (it took us some time to convince them though). If it is not there in the last 45 minutes, we are not paying. Meanwhile one brother will do the wetlands run, the other will run down to elwynn forest while I rush to Gurubashi to loot the chest for some quick gold. There will be nothing and noone that will be able to interfere with out plans.
---
For my two cents - most of my alts are going to be on the PVE realm.
---
ya they should just put a 2004 option in the video setting for people who want the vanilla graphics
---
Gathering professions are your best bet.
---
* Mining is more time consuming to do since you have to do multiple hits per node. Nice that it's used by multiple professions, also Arcane Crystal market is a big money maker in early endgame.
---
* Herb not quite as strong early levels, but insane end game gold maker. Best bet for long term gold imo.
---
* Skinning, easiest to level and weakest money maker of the 3 imo. The benefit is that the other two have competing tracking so this works in combination with one of the other two well if you're going gathering only. Some endgame leathers can be good money makers, but you'll be competing quite a few skinners. Look up Devilsaur Mafia to see what I'm talking about. Also, a nice benefit is that you have to go the least out of your way with this one if you want to level fast.
---
Enchanting can be nice if you get lucky, but I didn't find it that worthwhile. It requires a good amount of effort to get the rare patterns to learn the best enchants, if you do get them before anyone else though you can make bank.
---
Streamers are the only ones that have enough of a following to organize events like this, and every time someone "gets int he way", their horde of followers will mass report people.
---
Complicado, tbm to juntando dinheiro pra comprar um pc o hype pro clássico é gigante.
---
Professions are irrelevant, it's a guild effort. If you don't have full backing of your guild, you shouldn't expect to ring the gong.
---
More hardcore guilds will help their members farm the questline even after the gates open, as the rewards are pretty damn sweet for healers.
---
F
---
Isn’t it still like this on retail as long as your character isn’t boosted?
---
How was this able to happen? Did someone manage to get on another layer?
---
What a stupid inaccurate argument.  There's all kinds of things people aren't allowed to do with their time. You think this is your universe or some shit?  You are a peon living many levels within something, with which your body and mind are the only things that are yours, and that isn't even fully yours to do whatever you want.

If you think someone can do whatever they want, then I or anyone can do whatever we want.  And you are food.

He is such an amazing guy. Wonderful streamer and so respectful. His casting is always so enjoyable, nice to see him on the other side of things after recent events.
---
Trollgodx whispered Sony and said a gm teleported him to Wintergrasp.
---
The “Devilsaur Mafia” was a private server thing because the code allowed polymorphing an already tagged mob.
---
He is not Blizzard and cannot confirm if someone is banned.
---
reminds of that video of some random dude dancing at an event. one by one people joined him until there was a whole crowd
---
This is the best way to deal with it for sure.
---
Sorry just felt like like a retarded comment deserved a retarded response. Both changing layer and outright banning a player would be a single command.
---
I played hunter in vanilla and plan on playing mage this time so you are like the opposite of me lol
---
They said they were taking out addons like Decursive, which is 0 effort, vs this which at least requires some effort. I'd hope they aren't lumping those two together, and haven't seen anything that'd lead me to believe they are.
---
Run dungeons and quest in groups. Fill your friendlist with engaging and friendly players and tell them that you did this. At max level look at your tab and find the guild where most of tose players are in. /w them and ask to join. Write application where they will endorse you. Never join a guild that recruits in general chat.

No, it's not anger. It's irrational, pathetic smugness over *what initials to call a fucking video game dungeon*. If you're throwing around the word retarded over that, you need to look in the mirror.
---
Plus, you are factually incorrect. Some servers abbreviated Deadmines VC from day 1 in vanilla. You just need to believe otherwise because for some bizarre reason you've made the fact that you abbreviate Deadmines "DM" part of your ego.
---
Warlocks are never popular compared to mages. I know some polls here show them quite high, but consistently throughout vanilla, throughout a decade of private servers, warlocks are always a rare sight, especially on Alliance. So if you want a very unique class the the warlock is a good bet. I would say though that the hybrids paladin, druid and shaman are far more unique than the warlock is. There's so much stuff you can do with those classes. 
---
Mages are just glass cannons who conjure water and provide portals.
---
I read people didnt like him because he low rolled on some good gear in a raid in retail and and somebody else rolled higher and he cried and screamed until the raid leader gave him the item and totally fucked over the other dude...it was like soda poppin warglaive on YouTube or something....I could care less never really watched him but that's why I heard he gets hate

I'm surprised that after all the talk about the fear fuck-ups higher rank players aren't cognizant of being near the edge of the duel arena

What’s your point? I’m not saying the Druid he lost to wasn’t skilled. Just that Venruki got fortunate matchups in the bracket by not having to play a Druid.
---
Two types of undead mobs appear:
---
* lvl 8-10 mobs near capital cities
---
* lvl ~58-60 mobs in specific zones that are "under attack"
---
I don't think the lvl 8-10 mobs do much.
---
The lvl 58-60 mobs can be farmed for drops, which can be used to buy some items, the most notable IMO being the sharpening stones that give AP against undead mobs and the mana oil that increases spell damage against undead mobs. These are pretty useful for raiders inside Naxxramas.
---
I don't think you'll see a horde of mobs invading capital cities, that was stuff that only for the Wrath launch event.
---
Dumb question but are we going to be able to change character order on the select screen like we can in retail? If not my insanity is going to have to determine the order of my bank alt creation now, please god let us reorder them, I don't care if it's a change.
---
Stream sniping was allowed in Starcraft II where it allowed a much bigger advantage. I doubt Blizzard is even going to acknowledge stream sniping in WoW. Besides, the only way to know someone is sniping is if they admit to it.
---
bruh.
---
I can't help it if people took it that way. I can't make people read it the way I mean it.
---
So you have your running ratio for all players in guild but all players also have guild rank (eg Initiate, Warrior, Veteran) which would all have different ep, gear, and attendance requirements. All ranks would get prio on loot over initiates and other ranks would get ratios weighted slightly more with increasing rank.

yeah my irl bed is the same as an open world mmo, fucking delusional lmao?
---
Glorious. Absolutely glorious.
---
Venruki did play out of his mind, don’t want to take anything away from him, but imo it did seem like snutz misplayed a lot.
---
I think it as a name that started with an F. Like a small 3 letter name. She had one video with a druid sitting on top of her in cat form to show that she could actually lose sometimes.
---
Think they meant level as damage the respec to tank or healer.
---
I don't have an active sub to check, but i think the main difference is the blank canvas vs clearly defined zones on the map. This version just generates so much curiosity.
---
What makes you say that?
---
To top dps is my real test. To kill Ragnaros is my cause.
---
I guess therapy didn't go well today, bud?
---
He could have made a macro for it  which was demonstrated by Cdew on stream. (not going to find clip, find it yourself)
---
That is just stupid. There is even a quest involved to unlock it. But then they allow grenades and bandages? lol
---
Or I provided literal server-wide comparisons of the best geared players on all pservers, and it categorically demonstrates that in every tier of raiding, the best Rogues simply mathematically do more damage than the best Ferals, no matter how much effort the Ferals are putting in. Comparing one guy in non-test conditions without knowing the gear of his companions means nothing compared to years-long crowdsourced DPS meter aggregates across multiple servers of all Ferals and all Rogues.
---
Feral Druids, in the aggregate, always do less damage than Rogues. One Feral may well perform well in his one raid depending on the competence and gear level of his raid partners. But just as you can find random videos of extremely well-geared Ret Paladins doing adequate DPS in Naxx, you can find random videos of extremely well-geared anyone being adequate in a selective environment while still being an extreme outlier across the board.
---
I mean, it was a bit more than just polymorphing a target...
---
My bad. Forgot that concepts like melee weaving are new to most rands.
---
Is it really worth it to level as enhance. 
---
You can get cheap big aoe totems and improved searing totem and just stab things with a flametongue dagger right?
---
Spent 6 years as a mage main.  Don’t know if I want to experience it all again.
---
Might go Rogue.  But never main healer or tanked.  So holy priest and prot warrior is on the table.
---
Not have the melee go in because it's an aoe pack and they'll just melt. Just have your tank go in and get some threat before your casters blow up the imps.
---
yeah... I feel like thats because the community in retail is dead... you group without talking and never see people again. In vanilla you want to help bad players get better because they effect whether you progress or not. Chances are you will see them again and you will want them to be better the next time you see them.
---
the only person who’s crazed about anything here is you being incredibly anti-streamer...
---
Sure the guy was annoying, but all these autistic posts trying to say it was griefing is even more annoying.
---
Been watching too much Skallagrim and Shadiversity I suppose, but there's no way that the "original" version of Zin'rokh is supposed to be correct, the design actually makes a certain sort of weird sense in the corrected version (it is like a sword + axe that can hook your opponent or his weapon), but almost no sense in the original version.
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this. See you out there.
---
Join a guild and play with them. I can't imagine guildies being that rude to people in their own domain. Guilds mean something in Classic, they have a reputation that is based on their members. We already have a rule in our guild, once the streams go live we try and act civilised. So no carelessly throwing around words like nigger, faggot, chink etc. 
---
Even though I use the word "gay" quite a lot to describe things in a usually negative manner, I wouldn't do it in front of someone who actually is gay. That's just common sense to me and common sense is a requirement in most good guilds.
---
But that’s what stopped any competing group from being able to tag and kill the mob. You could have an entire guild trying to farm the leather and one same-faction mage of the mafia would fuck you.
---
I never claimed to be elite. I'm not saying that I am.
---
https://i.imgur.com/HAWNJu9.png doesn't this say bonus damage?
---
oOoo OOo
---
Exactly. Besides, at the beginning of the duel everyone, horde and alliance, were standing way too close in mulgore, and so they went to the barrens. On both sides you had people staying back and being respectful spectators, and plenty of people standing way too close on both horde and alliance and making targeting messy.
---
Honestly, without being able to count and just eyeballing it, it seems like roughly 80ish percent of people can behave themselves but that 20 percent just don't, and it didn't appear to be any different for either faction. People are shitheads for reasons far more deep than what faction they play.
---
It's not you, it's this sub. I tell you. I don't recall it being this bad a few months back.
---
Lol. You're horde dont lie to me
---
That's not the point. I'm not refuting the fact that it's still the biggest MMO out there, but it lost between 60%-80% of its players over the years. Which is pretty damn bad.
---
WoW isnt even Blizzard main source of income anymore, it's Hearthstone...
---
If you are Swedish it's going to suck because our currency blows these days.
---
If everyone advertised for their guild like this, how do you think that would impact on the reddit overall? It’s in the wrong area, there is an existing post to list this in. You not moving it yourself is arrogant.
---
You must be new to WoW if you think streamers came up with stuff like this.
---
I watched some of these.  Tipsout and his friend really really really do not understand classic wow.
---
This was in TBC: I did 96 runs of heroic slave pens without ever getting the trinket from the last boss. (Quagmirran's eye)
---
Streamer servers mean a lot of people. A lot of people means cheap economy, more people for groups, and more people to kill in world pvp.
---
I'm sorry but there doesn't seem to be anything even remotely related to what you're talking about in the rules. Rule 7 is about re-posting and this is the first time I've even posted in this subreddit at all. There is also no pinned post talking about "LFG Monday" where guild recruitment happens. So again i'll wait for a moderator, but thanks for your input.

&gt; Never understand how 15 dollars a month is too much for basically unlimited replayability. 
---
Well Blizz has dropped the ball with some of their expansions pretty hard.
---
Siege of Orgrimmar (patch 5.4 - September 10, 2013) --&gt; Warlords of Draenor (November 13, 2014) = 14 months of last patch
---
Hellfire Citadel (patch 6.2 - June 23, 2013) --&gt; Legion (August 30, 2016) = 14 months of last patch
---
Even better way to look at it, SoO came out September 10th, 2013. Emerald Nightmare September 20th, 2016. That's 3 raid tiers in over 3 years. So I can definetily understand atleast some of the complaints directed at Blizz when it comes to lack of content. Then you got something like PoE that comes with a fresh new league every few months, updates regularly, brings out new content, uniques etc. and is essentially free to play. Like technically you can play it 100% f2p, but anyone who gets seriously more into it goes for the various QoL things like the extra/special stash tabs etc. but even then you aare pretty much set with the cost less than one wow expansion.
---
Sure different games and different genres, but just saying that not all the "free to play stuff" today is shit, and on the flipside I wouldn't say Blizz has "deserved"  the full price of their subs during long periods of each of their last few expansions. The 14 months long HFC bullshit happened so soon after the SoO tier dragging on aswell, where they specially said how they want to do things X way so Y things wont happen and how they wouldn't end up with another year long raid tier after what happened with MoP. Result? Expansion with only  2 tiers total and 14 months long raid to end the expansion.
---
Unlimited replayability, sure... if you enjoy playing same content that long I guess?
---
never heard of it before, also raised christian haha.
---
Mage players downvoting Lol, the class is for sure one of the easiest to perform well on. This subreddit generally doesn’t care about accuracy though most of the people on here have no clue about the game but still feel the need to act like they do
---
Sure. You can use:
---
/castsequence spell1, spell2, spell3
---
There is a good tutorial here:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/MACRO_castsequence
---
But i'd advise against it for attacking. The main reason is RESISTS. The macro works great if every spell hits but when the mob resists, you're in trouble, or at least your sequence is now off.
---
If however, you want to use it for a series of buffs, great, it's perfect for that.
---
Hah! That would be funny if true :)
---
The engi bonus for ease of profession levelling and escape artist are both stronger racials than the int one.
---
That’s if he doesn’t want to play or pay for anything, i’d recommend the second option I gave. A lot more fun
---
Make it an invitational and not live, they could prerecord footage and then all play it live on their steams anyway. if nobody knows when or where it is they cant grief.
---
Yes, reflexive insults to dismiss those who challenge you are sure to show everyone that you are not, in fact, a sad, pathetic asshole whose self-worth relies on what he calls fucking dungeons from a 15-year-old video games.
---
The other racial is far better, escape artist. One of the best racials in the game.
---
This is just wrong. Ganking is not griefing.
---
&gt; I know some polls here show them quite high, but consistently throughout vanilla, throughout a decade of private servers, warlocks are always a rare sight,
---
Up through modern WoW too. At least before the last few expansions (where I have data), they were the least played class.
---
Those servers will have so many layers. After phase 2 we will see 1-2 hours queue time and free transfert.
---
I remember my first time in Winterspring seeing the mount. I stopped questing to work on it.
---
Resto shaman is one of the specs where you can legitimately spend all your points in 1 tree and have none of them feel wasted.
---
I hope you find the perfect fit for what you’re wanting out of classic! As a soon to be Guild leader I personally wouldn’t tolerate things like homophobia, racism or sexism... I know it exists out there, especially on the internet, but there are also a lot of good people out there.
---
 Good luck, Man!
---
Each server economy is already going to be trashed because of the layering, Chinese business is going to be booming during the first phase.
---
I really don’t mind cause I live in Cali and I’m tired of playing classic on EU private servers, so layering is just a small price to pay for good ping, but still, pretending like China isn’t going to stockpile mats using layering during phase one is just wishful thinking and so any changes would be moot.
---
rolling on NA servers cos of "larger playerbase" is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Oce will have servers around the same player size as NA, just less of them.
---
Unless you work night shifts and want an off peak Oce time guild, you're gonna have higher ping and less players to play with online.
---
Fucking carebear
---
Please don't create LFR/G for classic.
---
I never played Vanilla. My plan is to roll a Human Warrior but I heard Warrior are brutal at leveling. Will the grind be worth it for? Thanks!
---
He didn't get banned I believe. He was just online a bit ago.
---
I’m actually glad this post is still up because it shows everyone what a god awful leader this guy would be.
---
“I know I’m new here and didn’t take the time to use the search bar and I know you guys are just trying to tell me how things are done here but FUCK YOU I do what I want.”
---
Probably a good thing he’s rolling PVE.
---
 You can easily get a rough estimate of the subscriber counts if you know how to do basic math and use websites parsing data with the armory API.
---
There's about 7000 guilds that have cleared Heroic Crucible, excluding China. 12% of the active playerbase has the Feat of Strength for clearing Heroic Crucible. If you make a rough estimate that 30 players per guild on average have killed the boss (max raid size, bench; casuals this far into the raid, etc. This number is probably fairly accurate) and you don't even include all the people that pug it, you're looking at 1.8 million active subs in NA/EU without China. If you include pugs, then you're probably looking at 2 million or more. TLDR; The sub count is probably in the 4-5 million range.
---
As other user said, dragon kill points.  It is a system to make "fair" loot distribution.  There is no personal loot in vanilla, only master loot and rolling.  
---
Typically you get points whenever gear drops in a raid that you are at, and when you accumulate enough points you can bid or buy drops when they occur.  
---
Some guilds would give points instead just for attending a raid, or for other things that contribute such as donating of materials to the guild.
---
Give it time, after 4 months most douchers will be gone, they'll still exist but won't be as overwhelming. 
---
Also why we need blizzard to say what their plan is when we are months into classic and population hasn't decreased... layering forever?
---
This post is why WoW was easy. Even when it came out. EASY.
---
All those people that were kids playing WoW, that was me on UO. I sucked, I got camped, I got killed, I got good became a PK, and god damn it was glorious.
---
Maybe don't use a terrible browser like firefox?
---
Not true lmao
---
Oh, boy. Fucking rekt me, mate. I guess I clearly am the irrationally upset one here.
---
That trinket is special, in that it doesn't incur a 30 sec cooldown when equipped.
---
epic mount wont take more than 15 hours of farming, sub 10 once diremaul comes out. Rest wont really progress your gear because not a single patch content after 1.12  helps the casual players, everything is tied to raiding.
---
Venruki blowing up since accepting classic in his heart
---
He never blocked anyone dueling. How is standing on someone a bannable offense? 
---
The duelers still hit eachother. There would still be tab targeting or macros to hit totems.
---
I wonder why no gm stepped in over the 5 hours this guy was trolling for? Hmmmm.
---
Real answer, streaming or guild leader, because you are going to need a small army of helpers to have a chance.
---
The semi finals were dueled at the other end of the region. I was just the first spectator to follow when the grand finals were moved to this side.
---
Did you see that early match lock vs mage? There was like 4 different comebacks in that single duel.
---
You did, I didn’t catch the link on the forums, went back and checked. Actually have seen that before knew it immediately once I saw the layout. Makes more sense.
---
I agree tea should be allowed 100%
---
Mage
---
You are correct. When GoT came out years later I was like oh shit that's where the name came from. I remembered her said it was from a book but God knows I forgot the name of it at the time.
---
Alt time
---
If they follow the original timeframe then yes -- a couple of years.  
---
They could either increase the speed of the Phase releases or push them back longer though, so it's not set in stone anywhere .
---
It's funny how adamant the #nochanges crowd is, especially since you bring up RuneScape. Aka the case study that inspired Classic, which was almost *dead* a few months after release because the game was static. And once they started patching the game, it suddenly became more popular than ever.
---
But not for Classic. Nope. Static state, subscriber numbers be damned.
---
&gt;PvP servers will be dominated by Horde
---
Not in vanilla, and not in a single private server.
---
Horde only took over in bc with blood elves.
---
You’re delusional if you think people only care about the griefers because of streamers.
---
You mean 1.5 hours. It'd be 2 hours of he didn't have that sweet arse sword.
---
That warlock is a top 4 warlock
---
Yes
---
What was the patch where 'mana' became 'energy'
---
People have been banned for this before, regardless of if it happened to a streamer or not. It’s a clear violation of the TOS and especially considering that was a beta server the suspension is definitely well-deserved.
---
The reason no gm stepped in is probably because it was 5pm on a Sunday and believe it or not people have lives my man, nice try though.
---
Druid has it easier leveling. In end game as a druid you will not just tank. You will most likely also heal and dps at times.  Warriors have almost every single advantage over a druid. The one we excel at is threat generation.  
---
As a warrior unless you're the first or second tank in guild you won't be the main tank.  That means you may find yourself playing second fiddle or fury.  If you don't mind that more power to you as warriors can wreck people in PvP with a pocket healer.   Druid tanking is simpler rotation wise than warrior.   If you want a class that will be easy to level and rather simple to play at 60 I'd go druid.  Mastering a druid is a different story.  If you don't mind the grind that is warrior leveling and either crossing fingers for a MT role or leading your own guild then warrior is for you.
---
I am and will be what I have been since Vanilla. A feral druid, but this time I'll keep a healing off set.   Good luck with your choice!
---
Most people *probably* wouldn't crash an event like this on their main. But are you willing to risk that they won't when there's a neck-and-neck match that determines whether the players get either a $500 prize or a $1200 prize? I think having a trollgodx might be better than having that risk, but I'm not sure. Maybe it depends on how many known trolls there are on your server though.
---
Also, I think you may be slightly underestimating the power of level 1 trolls, even after they've been identified, because corpse running over and over to get to places is an option. Let's think of all the ways a level 1 could have fucked up the duel tournament today if it was a cross faction duel tournament in a contested zone:
---
Interrupting drinking and eating, doing a few melee attacks to cause spell pushback, and killing totems is all I can come up with for now, but even those things seem very impactful to me.
---
You could probably avoid this by making sure you're starting duels far away from the trolls' corpses, but I think it's still worth mentioning because it's not as simple as just "having guards" (I'm sure you realize that, but I just want to flesh everything out because I think it's an interesting topic).
---
Found this old screenshot dated December 11, 2005. I think I was fighting a gnoll while I got booted out to the login screen.
---
Metagaming the various guilds' DKP systems in vanilla was a (free!) secondary game I got to play while raiding.
---
thottbot
---
why would you submit a reply like this? like, what made you think that in the first place and then think it would make a good post?
---
Except if you need threat fast during quick clears.
---
I read this as alcoholic for like 2 whole minutes... Very different vibe lol
---
Wolf is not a Gnoll, there is a difference!
---
Spoilers?
---
Westfall really does have the best looking nights.
---
Thanks. This moment really brought everything together. All in all, a great event to watch.
---
I love those things. I always used my Belkin n52te back in the day and if you map movement to the thumbstick you've literally got all the buttons you'll ever need.
---
ummm lolcat isn't lolcat still. You're stuck 10+ years in the past. Look up Shendo.  No. they don't surpass rogues or warriors on charts , but it's viable enough for a druid to dps especially when not tanking or healing.
---
If you don't like the streamer culture, that's fine. However, there is absolutely no defending those players actions. 
---
They were literally only there to ruin other peoples harmless fun. No one wants to play with people like that.
---
I would assume it’s actually because the change in rating of the game over the years. Didn’t it start as T for Teen, and now it’s E for Everyone?
---
Umm, you can tank in MC, but hey what do people that research more than  you know right....
---
Actually they could “gasp” do internal testing or hire a third arty just for raid and 60 content. And they could “gasp” make sure professionals they hire sign a waiver saying they will not play wow for x amount of time. Yeah I know a company hiring testers and making them sign an agreement it’s a new thing in this day and age, but it would make people playing actually consider it a huge gesture of good will to the community that people go in blind for end game content
---
I never said they can do whatever they want. 
---
Indeed people are free to spend their time whichever way they'd like to though, wether legally or illegally. 
---
You're insanely angry that someone wanted to spend their own free time on a game though. And that's just autistic.
---
Well, you obviously enjoyed it when you first played so many years ago. There's really no reason to not play just because you've now learned that using keybinds is a more efficient way to play. 
---
You don't have to play optimally. Just have fun my dude! Nostalgia doesn't care if you keyboard turn :)
---
Give us the Blood Code, Blizzard!!
---
Hey all!

---
One committed player looking for a guild to play with for the entirety of my classic run. The most important thing for me is the guild raid times fitting my schedule. I can guaranteed raid 2 days per week (3 might be possible for blocks 1 &amp; 2 depending on specifics), but different blocks of time are available on different days. The blocks are all weekdays as I travel too much on the weekends to be regularly available.
---
Block 1: Tu/We/Th/Fr: 7AM-ish - 10AM-ish EST / 13:00-ish - 16:00-ish CEST / 21:00-ish - 24:00-ish AEST
---
Block 2: Mo/Tu/We/Th: 3PM-ish - 7PM-ish EST / 21:00-ish - 01:00-ish CEST / Next Day 05:00-ish - 09:00-ish AEST
---
Block 3: Tu/We/Th: 8PM-ish - 11PM-ish EST / Next Day 02:00-ish - 05:00-ish CEST / Next Day 10:00-ish - 13:00-ish AEST
---
All the other basic info I am flexible on, but my highest to lowest priority list is as follows:
---
Guild Priorities: 1. Raiding, 2. PvP, 3. Social Experience, 4. RP
---
Faction: Alliance
---
Guild Attitude: Semi-Hardcore
---
Class Preference: 1. Priest, 2. Mage, 3. Paladin, 4. Warrior
---
Loot System: 1. Loot Council, 2. EPGP, 3. DKP, 4. SK/Roll
---
Server Type: PvP
---
Region: NA
---
About Me: I started on WoW mid-vanilla and took my time to get to 60 but was still able to raid MC, ZG, and AQ20 as a mage before BC dropped. I continued through Kara, ZA, Gruul's, Mag's, and SSC in BC before needing to quit. I came back for WotLK as a hunter and did the Vault, New Naxx, Sanctum, and EoE. Stopped playing MMOs for a few until SW:TOR came out and there I lead raids through Eternity Vault, Karagga's Palace, and Explosive Conflict as both DPS (Imperial Agent/Sniper) and Heals (Bounty Hunter/Mercenary).
---
My goal for Classic is to experience all the content I missed while being able to appreciate the game more now that I'm less of a no0b. This includes desiring to play a more supporting role rather than DPS. I took plenty of time levelling my mage and paladin back in the day, so this time I intend to be 60 no more than 3 months after launch, with 2 months being the fastest I could reasonably do it.  
---
Personally, other keywords for me include: Tabletop Roleplaying Games, Board Games, Rock Climbing, Travelling, History, the MCU, and most big name Sci-Fi/Fantasy properties.
---
Thanks for reading and hope to join you!
---
\- 
---
TL;DR: The perfect guild for me is from any region but focuses on raids from 7AM-ish - 10AM-ish EST (GMT-4) or 3PM-ish - 7PM-ish EST (GMT-4) two days per week which aren't weekends, is Alliance, and has room for a Priest. I am committed to getting to 60 reasonably quickly and clearing content with experience as a raider and raid leader.
---
But.
---
We want this to happen
---
True. However, a good heal team can do fine with a druid tank.  Some fights are not clearly optimal for a druid tank like Huhran where warrior CDs are awesome.
---
If you look closely, you can see McConnell tea bagging his kill
---
Most people, going from replies, mention specific loot drops as their luckiest point in wow while for me, it was "all the friends I made along the way". Specifically, a socially awkward teenager randomly getting invited to guilds that then decided to go hardcore progression, which in turn meant they needed a couple of main tanks, leading to me getting asked to mt for a couple of years with all of the responsibility that comes with it, all while being a loser in school. Still remember specific peoples character names, aswell as weird, funny, strange, fantastic, frustrating, annoying situations that, for some reason, to this day, are things I think back on when I compare my experience in new and modern games. It was a hell of a ride and I cant wait to go back as retail is nothing like that experience.
---
It's true they're emotes but they're also "words" that are spoken phonetically by the twitch community all the time. Not like that's criminal or anything; people can have their dumb fun however they like, but I swear I can feel my brain cells dying when I hear people speak this way out loud.
---
That was a change in later patches, somewhere around WotLK or Cata. The trinket underwent many buffs and nerfs. You used to not be able to use it under the surface and it used to barely give you any swim speed increase at all. We’ll probably have the old shitty version.
---
Did you do it to the same people for 4 straight hours?
---
Since even vanilla, blizzard typically puts a lot of weight on frequency/duration when it comes to harassment. Steal tags on mobs for a few minutes to troll and that’s just part of the game. Do it for 3+ hours straight and blizzard will give you a temporary ban under general harassment.
---
Used to have a friend who played UO and say "PK will rise", was it a common saying back in the game? Or just coincidence?
---
What a terrible night to have a curse
---
I had a similar LC-based progression guild in BC and the system was so much smoother than DKP. For our guild specifically, we had more of a multi-tiered decision-making process, where we'd decide priority/order within the class and then arbitrate between classes for multi-class items.
---
e.g.
---
* Paladin A might get priority on getting full T5
---
* Paladin B gets priority on the healing mace from Vashj
---
* Paladin C gets priority on rings/trinkets.
---
* Paladin D gets priority on PVP and off-spec gear.
---
Well, how would it work in Vanilla? I don't think it should be changed just because someone could take advantage of it. Props if they were prepared enough to take advantage.
---
You're just parroting yourself now. Your claims have no validation either.
---
I mean it took over 5 years of development, so a 6.5 hr run time is a little low for covering the whole game.
---
Coming from UO as well, this is how I have always felt. A game world doesn't feel like a world unless it is survival of the fittest. Part of having a community is dealing with the bad along with the good.
---
Somewhere along the way, everything has been labeled "toxic" or "griefing", limiting your gameplay options and limiting the social experiences of the players.
---
We were born in the toxicity, molded by it. Making games riskless hugboxes has killed a lot of modern titles for me.
---
.....
---
Blades in that general design (curving forward like a sickle) exist in real life. Examples include the khopesh and the falx. If you ignore the fact that Zin'rokh is ridicilously big in every possible dimension, the basic shape isn't entirely unreasonable.
---
Well, I think Blizzard is kind of the official source on their quests. It’s not like they had to rewrite any of them for Classic. What you see is what you get. Thottbot says one thing, ClassicDB says another, Wowhead says another, Wowhead Classic says another. Blizzard says 30.
---
So everyone is subject to some guy trying to distract them during duels so no one had any advantages or disadvantages therefore there is no problem.  Getting banned because your pixels intersected with someone else’s pixels too much sounds fucking stupid.   I actually find it hilarious how upset people get over this.  I think Im gonna do this at Asmongolds tournament.

😂😂😂😂

## Revelations - Alliance NA PVE - Semi-Hardcore Raiding Guild wants YOU! At official Launch!
---
Greetings fellow Classic Wow Community!
---
**Revelations** is looking to form a fully fledged raiding guild at the official launch of WoW Classic with the ultimate aim of raid progression and clearing on an NA PVE server as Alliance. It will be a semi-hardcore group raiding on the weekends Friday, Saturday and Sometimes Sunday with estimated start times at 10 pm CST until 2 am CST every raid day (subject to change). The guild will start by leveling and gearing up together via dungeons and quests. Helping to collect the necessary patterns to create pre-BiS raid ready people to venture into the Molten Core and Black Wing Lair.
---
The guild is fresh and most of the limited and highly sought after roles are still available. Main Tank and Raid leader will be covered by myself and I encourage anyone interested to stop by our discord and fill out an application or to ask more questions there via Discord by DMing me. I am also looking for experienced/veteran players to fill leadership roles within the guild so veteran players, as well as new players, are encouraged to apply.

Currently, loot is planned on being distributed via a hybrid loot council system but may be subject to change in the future before raiding begins.

You’re delusional if you think sitting on totems and jumping around is griefing.
---
I played horde on Lightning's Blade for years. Mostly in &lt;Killing Um All&gt; in vanilla. Troll rogue, Avex. Totally remember Lost Chapter, only alliance group i liked.
---
Yes, you are bad.
---
No matter what happens, just know that any absent minded heckler or pure asshole is going to be the minority. I haven’t seen any homophobic talk in private servers that I can remember, so I’m hoping you’ll feel welcomed and what not. 
---
Can’t speak for anyone else, but I’ll definitely have your back
---
Didn't realize hearthstone made that much money, that's wild if its true. Also I'm sorry for being overly feisty, between whiskey and a few idiots I'm dealing with irl my mood is a little off.
---
Except the tournament still went on, and he didn't have any effect on the outcome. So he didn't really ruin it.
---
The meat should be at 59
---
Because Blizzard wants to create a version of Classic that's as close to the original as possible, which would also include that mechanic.
---
What's OCE?
---
terrible example
---
The effort it takes to level a warrior is often exaggerated especially if you talent correctly and keep food on you. The payoff is arguably the highest DPS, great in PvP and the only realistic option for tanking.
---
I never made any claims? You seem to be confused or trolling, I don’t know if you want me to cite the Blizzard TOS to you or something but the fact that the dude got banned is pretty telling haha.
---
Overall you got me to respond so I give you a 3/10, enjoy your night bro.
---
Improved Ambush 45% crit chance coupled with 40% from remorseless attacks killing blow means you can have over 90% ambush crit rate with daggers. This is nice for tearing through lots of enemies a few levels lower than you as your ambush will be bringing them to about half to start the fight. The only problem is mobs turn a lot and distract has a 30 second cooldown.

Once a troll always a troll. He will make himself known in time.
---
I hate that he screams a lot like retarded, back day he wasn't like that, he was more serious and professional.
---
Hold on. I'm not so sure we should be thrilled about it being that easy. Surely you had to prove your identity in some way? What were the questions? When my account was hacked in TBC, I had to send in a scan of my ID card.
---
the mage couldnt do much since i crit 2k vit cold blood eviscerate and stuns/ poisons did the rest

Dread Lord Kylus &lt;Fallen Lords&gt; (pacific) signing in!

I had relatively the same mmo ride as you with a couple others thrown in (DAoC/EVE online).
---
It's pretty amazing how the genre has changed.  I'm really hoping for a turn-around with classic.  I would very much like to go back even farther.  As you know, Classic WoW was by far and away the easiest MMO on the market at that time.  However it was a nice mix of leveling speed and reward for skillful playing.   I'd still rather have more pain involved though, it's just not dangerous enough.
---
I still have my EVE account but I've always been more into fantasy than spaceships however I love the wild west nature of EVE.

---
You could become rich beyond your imagination by simply using your brain to trick your enemy.
---
It is a risk of course, which is why I kinda like having open world competitions like that. You can also of course alternate between different locations between duels and have a delay on the stream, or not stream at all. Let people show up and watch it live instead of through Twitch. I loved all the farsight spells or whatever they are called from the shamans watching the match.
---
Maybe something to do with the scrapped dragon isles.
---
&gt; Targetting hostile totems doesn't work: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433646958
---
Saw this in another thread and didn't see it in the list. I'd add it manually but on my phone rn :D
---
On day one do /join world, this will let you monitor the guilds that are recruiting during leveling.  The most important thing to do is get to 60 as fast as possible to you can be apart of their first MC run.
---
Nothing is ruined. Let's halt the fire.
---
&gt; But loving streamsniping and getting some sort of thrill out of ruining someones day so much that they quit playing is something else.
---
r/eve would be a *wonderful* place for you to hang out at.
---
Suck my butt I shit on u big boi
---
I wonder what would cause someone to do this, is it for attention? Upvotes?
---
Unlikely. That's re-opening a can of worms that eventually led to retail sucking massive ass, which led to the demand for Classic, which led us to where we are right now.
---
Insanely angry, and autistic  What the hell even is that?  If you're not going to even try to be accurate or right, what points are you trying to make? You talk like an imbecile.
---
You're just fucking wrong.  That's great you think someone can spend their time whichever they want.  Except they actually can't.  SO WTF?
---
You're literally trying to argue semantics of a word, and still completely fucking wrong.  I can't tell them what to do with their time, you're right.  But I can list plenty of things they cannot do with it, which is just the fucking same as saying how they CAN'T spend their time.  This is the biggest waste of keystrokes I've ever used.  Please use your brain, the childish one using words like autistic and insanely angry to describe a person.
---
yes very uncharacteristic of snutz since he's usually on point too
---
No dungeon changes are listed as “dungeon nerfs” in the patch notes however every change to mobs from elite to normal is in the patch notes.
---
WC and SM weren’t mentioned so... time to remove your left nut.
---
Wrong game
---
Thank you, thank you, and great advice. Will set my hearth to booty bay %100 now. In the name of maxing out fishing alchemy and herbalism asap. Profit inc...

Not having ublock origin lol

---
/e laughs in druid
---
It's more op than on live because on live all classes PvP trinkets break stun.
---
More mages dafranM
---
It sounds to me like he made it better though.  Seeing a bunch of tryhard losers cry and rage about a bipedal cow strafing and jumping around on their pixels is fucking hilarious.
---
one of the coolest names for a weapon imo
---
All RP-pvp servers died in retail, the only reason people convinced themselves they want it now is because they were told they weren’t going to have it.
---
Quite the attention seeker
---
I'd love to watch a boring tournament where I'm just forcing myself to sit through every agonizing duel between skilled players having excit- I mean dreadfully boring battles. I really just want to see a bunch of people run at each other and kill each other in that familiar and typical fashion.
---
How anyone could ever want a break from the constant wpvp to see skilled duels in a tournament is just incomprehensible.
---
World pvp is fun to watch and take part in but seriously, it was fun to watch some of those prolonged duels that came right down to the last hit.
---
griefing is literally in the ToS since Vanilla
---
For some reason I got very nostalgic about the double Dawn's Edge on hunter setup. Is that a Dwarven Hand Cannon too?
---
I hope they find some way to limit farming methods such as this, but I don't believe it will have too much of a negative impact if it's left as is.
---
More gold in circulation drives up AH prices on highly contested or valuable items, but common items will still stay roughly the same.
---
Farming items to vendor normally will yield less purchasing power, but farming items and selling them on AH will end up giving you more.
---
It could also mean people spending more gold on money sinks such as respecs, more expensive consumables (bullets/arrows, food/water etc.), extra mounts, alts etc.
---
Eventually we'll reach an equilibrium because no matter how much gold is in circulation, limited items ends up gaining value equal to the gold influx on the server. 
---
Early on farmers "abusing" methods such as solo dungeon farming will have a very strong purchasing power, but eventually it will normalize. After a while the only people who will suffer is players who earns most of their gold from vendoring or not using AH at all.
---
Bottom line is, if you're broke af and the gold circulation is high, train herb/mining/fishing, grind cloth, farm for twink items or farm quest items you can sell on AH. 
---
If the gold circulation is low, grind mobs for vendor trash, purchase mats and craft items, solo dungeon farm, sell tank runs/reserved item runs, look for ways to corner the market on niche items.
---
It’s 30% but the boars are scattered across the entire zone.  Like side mobs you kill on the way to a quest.
---
Then they should have the event in the arena.
---
Fuck yeah!
---
Alchemy isn’t really all that profitable until some essences become commonplace and you have the transmute recipe, and even then it’s not going to beat out Skinning in terms of raw gold per hour. Most guilds have an alchemist and the raw herbs almost always sell for more than the finished products.
---
I will not forget Trollgodx and Trollgody😁
---
&gt;twinks
---
Are people planning on twinking for BGs again eventually? 19 WSG is where I spent probably a third of my WoW career.
---
Dps is easiest. Tanking second. Healing is hardest. The funness of these roles is subjective.
---
&gt; Personally I never stopped or moved on from playing WoW, it simply disappeared on me. It evolved into something I didn't recognize.
---
I've never seen it put that way, but that's so gd accurate.
---
Is the trinket useful while leveling at all? I imagine it's tough to pass up the best fishing pole in the game.
---
Ganking on a PVP server is 'playing the game' and there is nothing wrong with that. 
---
But corpse camping lowbies is being a dick
---
I’ve been on a plane all day and following this in this subreddit has been spectacular.
---
Thank you all for being so envious of people who make millions playing games online so much that you’d spend an entire day making posts like this to defend the actions of one dude who spent an entire Sunday slamming his spacebar looking at pixels and ruining other people’s fun because it’s his “right” to be a dick. 
---
And before you reply stating you’re not envious make sure you delete all those posts/comments you guys make promoting your own 100 follower streams because when you don’t it makes it more sad than comical, especially when I see some of you are grown ass men.
---
the differences is way more than 7%. Ret does 1/4 of a warrior dps in similar gear
---
Do you have an fishing advatage at 300 opposed to 1? Or do they have equal chances of catching the same required fish.
---
wintergrasp... what a fucking turd
---
Pffft if you don't want that happening hold the event in the arena so you can kill him other let him have his fun. This is an mmorpg not some esports crap.
---
Doesn’t seem like he ever played original wow.
---
Not sacrificing the void in time is a pretty rookie level mistake.
---
Hunter is great with no gear it has:
---
* a whole talent tree dedicated to the pet
---
* epic weapon quest line testing your skill
---
* multiple defensive tools to deal with all classes in bg's - mana drain and knockback for casters, dot's for rogues, traps for melee
---
* most farming options so you can afford profession / BoE gear
---
The most fun is probably tanking. Some dps classes love rogue can be a little fun but most dps rotations are very boring. I always prefer playing a healer but it's not very fun.
---
Bonus for the streamers.
---
there's going to be 16 debuff slots at the beginning of Classic, so, you don't need to worry about that.
---
to OP: shadow is good in PvP and once guilds start getting toward AQ40/Naxx, they'll want at least one to buff Warlock damage with Shadow Weaving. so, if you can find a guild, you'll be able to get in as the token Shadow Priest.
---
What game is it then? Considering, classic wow isn't out yet only beta. And technically, the only tank available, would be the warrior. While druids were just ots. But hey. I guess fuck me for giving advice on learning to tank
---
Tipsout did a great series overall discussing dps at each tier.

That doesn't matter wow is an mmorpg not some esports crap game.
---
Are you wanting to know which is most fun, most challenging or both?
---
I can play a decent warrior but you might suck balls with warrior.
---
Depends on you baby, most fun is up to what you find enjoyable... people liked house of cards, I didn't.
---
In what way is it not true? Do you know what "optimal" means? Fishing can be a great way to make gold, but it's far from the best.
---
&gt;Get a grip lol!
---
also... viper sting
---
Okay sorry
---
I made a really low production video of my experiences with uo, daoc, and vanilla-wotlk. I’m not a content creator so I’m not plugging anything but your post reminded me of it so if anyone’s interested here were my experiences with these games. The quality isn’t great but I’m working on it. Was my first edited video and I put it together in a day. 
---
https://youtu.be/dpWVmuG_sxE
---
I'm going to eat you for breakfast and waffle stomp you down the drain when we meet in STV old man ;)
---
But alliance having full raid groups camping cities and world quests in retail isn’t griefing lol ok
---
Keep in mind that there will be a tendency towards skewed statistics on the subreddit. I think it's a fair assumption that people spending their free time reading / responding to polls here are more diehard classic fans, and therefore (in my opinion) more likely to be confident selecting less popular classes.
---
Hope they fix Hunter bugs before release. Scatter dring with trap hurts a lot.
---
Tbh i'm not sure why OP is min maxing and crunching numbers so much on raids that are as easy as lfr
---
&gt; Streamers are the only ones that have enough of a following to organize events like this
---
no...? people organized shit like this all the time and people that interrupted or trolled/griefed events like this were put on a shitlist. it just doesn't matter right now 'cuz it's a beta.
---
I once sold a scroll or something for 150k. Dude thought he was buying a house.
---
Also fuck FL. Jk, cool to see another pacific player though.
---
As much as replying to comments on Reddit and providing no valid additions to the discussion in hopes that you can get a reply to fulfill the void of attention that you lack in real life?
---
I sure hope not.
---
Don’t worry you don’t have to downvote this one too, I’m gonna delete it in a couple minutes.
---
Who are you to judge what someone considers something worth quitting over? You guys and your high horses in these threads man. So insane. The guy even said it’s been a decade, couldn’t remember. And then you quip back with “guess you weren’t even invested!” Maybe he was hardcore as hell and really liked that each faction had their own specialty class. Kind of like....um idk, WOW CLASSIC/VANILLA. Gtfo with your bitchy smiley face.
---
Give me Clique and Tidy Plates.
---
Tanking with colour indicating threat status and being able to mouse over cast to taunt etc is a godsend.
---
I'm looking forward to Classic but I'm going to miss the addons I became accustomed to in BC/Wrath/Cata.
---
I'm half tempted to learn Lua...
---
People think stuff like this DIDN'T happen in classic? I remember people standing on my fishing bobbers while fishing up deviate fishes, lol. I just kindly said "fuck off" and if they didn't, I move spots or log off and they eventually got bored and stopped. 
---
From what I hear (I wasn't there so I don't really know) but it didn't have any effect on the outcome of the duels, it was just a tad annoying?
---
As of right now I was intending on going frost mage as my first main and the profitable aoe grinds don't tend to have many skinnable mobs except DME. Maybe if i end up playing hunter or warrior I'll go skinning.
---
on what?  Be real.
---
It is. Except, you know if you make an orc and zen to uc, get the flight path then zep to gromgol and get the flight path you can now fly the length of EK. It even shows you your missing fp’s along the way.
---
Also retail has portal that can take you everywhere. 
---
For roughly 1/2 the game walking and flight paths are your transport.
---
Literally hell though I mean undeads everywhere, water is poison seems and a demon actually lives there.
---
There is an heirloom item that gives you a lot of the flight paths in Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor
---
So my only problem with this macro, and I’ve seen it everywhere over the years. Couldn’t I just bind another action bar slot to the shift modifier version, then put rank 1 frostbolt there, or whatever else? What I’m trying to say is, I can bind a second slot to the shift modified version, then I can see both icons of what for example “1” does as well as “shift + 1”. Using a shift modifier macro means I can’t see the icon and doesn’t seem to give me any real benefit over just manually binding another slot right? The only benefit I can see is you use 1 less action bar slot, but I’ve never run out of action bar space so yeah..
---
It hurt so much to see that
---
I double checked, it seems I was a little bit hasty on that comment. WoW is still Blizzard's most profitable game. So I take that back.
---
entire mmo genre is dying. replaced by faster paced games like fortnite lol apex pubg. Its a whole different gaming culture, people want to have fun immediately not 12 hours grond later
---
That's surprising as Blizzard is known for a 0 tolerance approach to cheaters. Back in the day my brother lent his WC3 account to a supposed friend, and that friend started cheating, causing his account to be irreversibly banned.
---
Hmm yummy fishes swimming in green bile.
---
I am 99.99% sure even when you hit 300 fishing, when you have +fishing gear it improves your odds further.
---
Casual boomers are going to be the main population of this game. A lot of us were kids when wow came out. 15 years later were invested in other stuff. To shit on someone for not knowing what race had a specific class in an expansion of a game they used to play is pathetic. Be gone douchebag, no one likes you.
---
Would you rather have that money go to twitch? I dont understand. He spent time and money organising this tournament that 100k+ people enjoyed, and you're pissed that he's uploading it for free on only youtube ?
---
rip
---
You came from that culture, but that isn't Vanilla-culture. You will get a reputation and nobody will trust you in Trade or General chat. You might be able to continue scamming people by whispering tho...
---
Maybe they have more security for current accounts. Its kind of hard to know all that info about a 13 year old account.
---
Ammo system is fine until you get to raiding and 'need' the engineer crafted ammo.
---
Just top up your ammo bag whenever you head into town, the pet happiness thing is only annoying for the first 30 min or so, eventually your 'bond' grows and it requires less and less food to keep it happy.
---
Hunter has little downtime, with decent gear, no downtime, just mend pet and auto attack one mob after another.
---
Druid is pretty easy, but the time investment/effort required is pretty high if you intend to be an active raider.
---
After having played it myself I won't disrecommend feral tank to anybody, but beware ahead of time that feral tank requires a lot of effort in classic.
---
It is pretty easy to play though since you only have two buttons, maul and swipe.
---
Apparently I’m wrong. The fishing level requirement was removed in patch 3.3.
---
You need 130 fishing minimum to fish the pools and 225 to make sure no fish get away. Lures will get you up there.
---
Oddly, that's also how I feel about your post.
---
My exp for raiding; DPS has the most fun. Tanks and Healers have to focus on UI to much. However there are more healers then tanks. If you want to find a group every time you want to do something be a warrior tank. If you are willing to wait 10-15 mins be any healer. If you are ok with spamming lfg for 30 mons be a dps.
---
Note: If you want to be a non warrior tank be ready to only group with guild members who trust you and are willing to take things slower to let you tank.
---
Thanks
---
Fireball?
---
i'd be surprised if Classic eclipsed several hundred thousand people playing. i'm expecting Classic to eventually "settle" at around a hundred thousand people.
---
So much this...
---
You do know that ignoring is account wide, while this doesn't solve everything it sure helps because there is an easy check to see if that character is ignored, if they are, deductive reasoning should kick in.
---
But what if blizzard forgot about the blood animation since they for some reason in their reference client have defaulted violence level to 2 or even to 0? Without noticing that's a feature? :O
---
Wrath baby
---
It had, in one duet priest could not target tremor because troll was sitting on it.
---
I updated my post after further research into changes to the tournament while looking at changes to the trinket. You do need a certain fishing skill.
---
I will do that, thanks!
---
As someone who uses the razer naga, it's significantly easier to use than you seem to be imagining. It's pretty easy to press the correct button, you don't have to look (nor should you with a keyboard anyway), there's no margin of error since it's easy to press the right button. You also have many more practical key bindings since there's 12 convenient buttons plus all the modifier combinations of those all on one thumb (so you still have your keyboard available). You can cast spells while moving (sometimes you can't on a keyboard. For example, moving forward and pressing 2 is pretty hard)
---
You're considering group dynamic, which is certainly important and it's one of the things that is making my decision harder.
---
Only played Vanilla WoW briefly, but Hunter will definitely be my main this time around, for a few big reasons
---
1) Fastest solo levelers on a fresh server
---
2) Great in all forms of PVP
---
3) Looks. Not only do I like their tiersets, especially tier3, but they actually use them because they're BiS unlike other class specs.
---
4) Easy to pickup, difficult to master. I want a class that keeps me engaged, and has a high skill ceiling.
---
Downsides is they aren't so hot in raids, and they don't scale as well at the very late game, but honestly that's going to take a long time to get there anyway. 
---
Second class will be one that scales really well with gear, so most likely a Warlock or maybe a Warrior.
---
All of them will be fun and I plan to eventually get to all 3. 
---
Hardest, probably tank just because if you screw up, everyone is going to know. Any other role screws up, not as easy to know. Also you are leading, so you need to know the dungeon routes and often how to safely pull and what to cc. Most repair costs, most need of consumables.
---
You are correct but at the same time I find it very exciting. Silverpine forest... I don't knos it was just great I love it.
---
The amount of times you’ll say “damn I wish I had that buggy trinket that didn’t really do anything until after TBC” are few and far between versus “damn, I wish I had the rarest and strongest fishing pole in the game”.
---
Still a bit torn on what to play. High on the list is a Paladin, and I’ll be leveling with a Warrior and a Hunter as well. I want to play Ret primarily but I don’t mind helping off heal/buff/provide general utility as well when needed. I know most rets are laughed at but I think if I do those things while also providing some dps it should be doable right? I’m not planning on being the best but I will be playing casually doing dungeons, pvp and raiding when possible. Is this a feasible plan? I’m willing to put in the work to make myself good while still providing utility as well. Also side questions in regards to this, would I be able to provide the off healing/utility and all that while wearing ideally plate or leather/mail? I don’t like the idea of having to wear cloth as a Paladin. And is there a decent build to run to be able to do this at a decent level? Ideally with few respecs as possible. 
---
Alternatively I’d play Mage, granted I know there will be a lot of those around. I suppose downtime while leveling will be higher but getting into raids would be easier. The play style seems cool but sort of boring at times plus the squishy-ness is always a factor for me as I might be alone at times as well. Don’t know if this would work better for leveling versus a Paladin with a warrior/hunter or not.
---
Why is group leveling so bad?
---
Me and my fiancé and thinking of playing warrior/priest and leveling together. We figured it would be faster then solo?
---
In my experience the only bosses that really make life difficult for feral tanks are KT, Sapphiron, 4H, C'thun and Ouro. Should also mention mind control bosses such as Hakkar who force you to shift out of form and waste your mana which can become a problem if the fight goes long, which is really only an issue if you're in a bad PUG group or something like that.
---
UO/Eve veteran here as well. Not sure what your point is here, but I guess by Blizzard "caving in to the carebears" you mean something about them banning people for running with mats or excessive targeted PvP griefing? So here's my two cents on the matter, because this happens to be a matter I have Hot Opinions on.
---
PK, scams, backstabbing, awoxing, all that jazz stops being interesting when everyone does it. A metaphor I like for this is something along the lines of a game of sheep and wolves where everyone wants to be a wolf.
---
Sandbox MMOs of old worked solely because of a constant stream of new blood flowing into the games (and the genre in general). When people stop being clueless and the majority playerbase starts playing optimally, they fall apart without exception. UO, with its less refined empire building systems, turns into battle royale game with extra steps. Eve Online turns into a risk-averse blue donut with sprinkles of BR gameplay. Neither are interesting, and neither are what made me fall in love with the genre in the first place.
---
I do not miss them and truly believe that this type of MMO is forever dead and the only way forward for it is for the basic formula to change in some way -- which, sadly, does not appear to be happening, given all the attempted Kickstarter UO reboots that are dead on arrival. Or I should say that I *do* miss them, but what I miss about them really was a product of its time, and even if the exact game mechanics from back then were replicated now it would not be the same in the slightest (unlike Classic WoW).
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
In the context of WoW, it's a *good* thing that scamming (eg. running with enchanting mats or selling door unlocks and then not unlocking the door) is straight up against the ToS. Sandbox MMOs show where this leads when taken to its logical extreme: it eventually winds up reducing the total player interaction in the game as people stop trusting strangers altogether. Interacting with strangers is an integral part of MMOs, and many UO/Eve style games lose this by making players only interact with their guild/corp.
---
Banning people for going way too far with PvP actions is a *good* thing too. The way this rule was enforced was perfectly reasonable, and basically only ever applied to singling out a single player and following them around wherever they went (including across zones) for extended periods of time with the express purpose of griefing them. Find something better to with your time.
---
Fun is subjective and depends on many factors. 
---
A player who wants consistent results from his character can have great fun with a paladin healer and despise the RNG jumps of a shaman healer. 
---
Another who likes RNG and cooldown-based mechanics will enjoy rogue's cooldown-based abilities but not derive any fun from mage's 1-button rotation.
---
An altruistic shaman has no problem being last in the dps metric if his Anihilator increases the whole raid DPS but another one will ignore anyone else in favor of his own performance.
---
They could get rid of him just for being an ass. IT is beta.
---
Oh definitely, but you can't really blame that on anyone. Seren got fucked over by someone interfering. I don't really know what could be done about the fear rng when it comes to duels. I also agree that Soda would have won with how the brackets ended up.
---
I wasn’t aware being human came with the responsibility to NEVER under any circumstances have the pixels of your character on the beta of a remake of a 15 year old game intersect with or stay excessively close to the pixels of someone elses character in that game while they are dueling.
---
Go ahead and post some more pseudo-philosophical garbage about being a “peon living many levels within something else” and comparing fucking with humorless losers in the beta of a 15 year old game to actual suffering.  Its great cringe material.
---
I mean yeah alliance cities are great but undercity just has that level of excitment. You feel really small and an outcast. For some reason it appeals to me.
---
People stealing my nodes and mob tags detracts from my enjoyment. So does people ganking me. 
---
In fact so does people in my groups being shit. 
---
Should those all be bannable offenses?
---
I'm sure being banned would detract from that taurens enjoyment. If he was in fact banned should the gm who banned him be banned?
---
Best way to make money while leveling up is to ignore professions completely and just level faster. Higher level mobs and quests give more gold.
---
Go herb and mining then. You can make a macro to swap between their tracking spells (or shhhh use AHK). It’s really not hard to gather mining nodes without tracking once you get good gatherer data and learn the routes.
---
That's what DW fury tanks are perfect for.
---
Sure, but it still sucks that Seren didn't get to fight at full power.
---
My opinion is melee dps is most fun. Range dps stands still to much where as melee is required to move around a lot. Tank and healers focus to much on UI for my liking. 
---
That is my opinion. I played holy pally through bwl and while it is a lot of ui there is a lot of decision making you have to do and making the wrong choice could cause a wipe.
---
The old client I can just start up had the lighting correct tho. Lighting is client side.
---
Dude, keep on keeping on, don't let people deter you from playing the game your way, you may get haters on the realm you are on but such in the life of a known ganker, corpse camper, etc. That's where most of the guild vs guild stuff originated from anyways, one person gets camped, calls guildy, they camp, etc, until most of the guild is there.
---
Keep on brother, that is sometimes the spark that is needed to ignite the community.
---
Nice! I like the second macro for the rank 1 frostbolt modifier. Will help reduce clutter on the UI.
---
Yup, at one time, every expansion was filled with leveling alts. Had a max of every class. Also did both factions but not all classes. 
---
The three legendary weapons per toon burned me out and took a year off. Only just came back. And got the second to max rolled up.
---
How do you grief on a PVE server?
---
You can spend your time how you like. Problem?
---
Rather it be posting on Reddit or playing games. No one cares that you exist but the people you interact with on a daily basis. And even then they probably still don't care.
---
Yes thanks again for doing the research for us. At least 130 seems very doable in the first 5 days even if you're only playing 2-5 hours a day.
---
Agreed. I'm 99% sure he would've beat Snutz there if he wasn't feared out. Druid stomps mage and he already beat a priest earlier in the tourney, so I think he had the whole thing in the bag if not for that fear. I don't even watch him it's just a feelsbad moment
---
You can't target a totem with a macro?
---
Don't drink and raid.
---
AH, mailbox, bank.
---
No.
---
Tanking Is soooooo boring i legit had ass aids and a deformed spine after tanking we for just 3 hours God it was boring just sitting there auto attacking
---
Apparently not in vanilla.
---
btw can you fly directly from TB to Sunrock in 1.12?
---
Same. I don't have any desire in other games. I've played too much FPS/Moba/BR and shitty Korean mmorpgs. Classic might be my last played game.
---
It WAS huge though. What snutz claimed about polymorph was incorrect, since he was on the last DR and would have been immune right after. Venruki would only have been able to poly for 5 seconds at most.
---
The fuzzy doggo portal
---
Same faction could of mind controlled them and due to spell batching, have a player of the opposing faction cast a spell on him (higher ranking) but before the spell hits he could release mind control.
---
Oh you sweet summer child lol
---
I didn't say you were mad or upset. Just delusional, immature and pathetic.
---
Responding "u mad" is even more of a confirming self-own in that respect than more insults would have been.
---
You saw the parry post right? That'll affect warriors more than druids. To each their own with what their guild brings, but I'll putting out more threat than any warrior tank can hope.
---
Yeah and you can even read it on your phone! What a time to be alive.
---
As a rule, spells (mana) don't auto upgrade and just give additional ranks while abilities (rage,energy) do automatically upgrade. It wouldn't be wrong to say that spells only began upgrading post Classic because Warriors are definitely not using "spells".
---
I always judged how much fun someone had in a raid by how quickly they logged off after we were done, especially during wipe fests.
---
The tank(s) always logged off without even hearthing.
---
The healers hearthed but as soon as they got asked to do any dungeon, they logged off.
---
The DPS stayed on and played some more.
---
Dwarf ia the only race for hunters.
---
Nobody gives a fuck about your personal story of griefing and abusing people.
---
There's enough toxic mother fuckers for us to deal with in our real lives. I don't want or need to deal with you people while I'm at home enjoying my hobby of choice.
---
And hey thanks for the downvote too.
---
Ah, my bad. That sucks. In that case, I'd probably go for the rod first then.
---
It's raid viable but it's just okay. They have next to no aoe which is a big downside because a large portion of classic raiding is clearing trash where cleave effects like whirlwind and blade flurry make a huge impact.
---
I've played both cat and bear. Cat is okay, it's raid viable but that's about it.
---
That's literally my experience... I was 11 years old hahahaha. But I'm having a really hard time deciding between a prot warrior or a holy priest. (I Mained a warrior for 10 years and I'm a beast when it comes to tanking)
---
Tanking.  Dpsing second.  Never healed in Vanilla.
---
The purpose of this macro was just to make your life easier as you buy new spell ranks. There are ~9 ranks of your primary spells. Having to replace your tool bars each time you buy new ranks for your spells is a pain. This makes it easy to set it once and never touch it again.
---
The [mod: shift] was just to show you how you could do more with it. What you want to do with it is up to you.
---
Classic is not meant to have fun.
---
They aren’t his pixels.  You don’t think being around other people has any responsibilities?   People type pixels when they type.  Does that mean they can type any word they want?  You think you can just break something down to be meaningless?  That’s not how life works.
---
I would say don’t let what someone else rolls rule out a class. I just know my bud is a great hunter so I don’t feel the need to be one with him being one. Also he would show me up.
---
Yes, but you won't be a high level meaning anything there probably onehits you.
---
it still doesn't work. If its an 80/20 split or something like that, it doesn't matter how many total player there are or how many stacks you make. you can have 8 million horde and 2 million alliance on a server and have 2,000 layers with 5,000 players each, and only 800 of the 2000 layers could be made 50/50 with the rest being 100/0. 
---
You could mess around a little, and you could get 60/40 balance to half (1000) of the layers and 100/0 on the other 1000. So you can do 70/30 which you could do on 1333 layers with 667 layers having 100/0, or you can do 80/20 which works on every layer... but that just brings you to the start. Do you see the problem? 
---
It's impossible to have a good amount of layers balanced unless it naturally is pretty balanced, and even if its close to balanced naturally and you did a 50/50 split on some layers, there would be a few that would be dicked over and in the end would be better to just have them all slightly imbalanced instead. layering is not the answer to fixing balance issues. A system to get you to transfer servers would work, or if they built it into the character creator to not allow creating more horde/alliance if said faction starts getting popular. Obviously both of those options are not good.
---
I  think this may be a good idea. I do "plan" on using mage for farming/pve and leveling a warrior to 60 for pvp. But my plans have changed about once every week for the past 18 months who knows what I'll end up playing by the time launch rolls around.
---
Finals wasn't less populated  the horde attacked the alliance players when the moves to prevent people from following as best as they could.
---
Ganking and corpse camping is fine. But scamming people and ninjalooting is not. Btw I played WoW back in Vanilla young padawan
---
Not me
---
Worth it-from memory a lot of people would just go in BRD and pickpocket the spectators in the arena making a decent profit.
---
And raid viable is ALL it has to be. If you're humping numbers that much you have some issues and need a doctor.
---
I wanted to ask about Pserver testing....but I'm not one to ever use them. In a situation like this, I feel like the only way to know is to play premade, geared 60's.
---
Venruki is such a class act...and both of them are unbelievably good at this game.  To be able to actively change your strategy so rapidly is something only top echelon players can do.  Great tournament and great championship match.  Cdew was awesome as well.
---
The only dangerous bosses in terms of damage are KT, Sapphiron, 4H, C'thun and Ouro.
---
And those bosses tend to shred Druids faster than they do Warriors.
---
I find tanking to be the most fun and most difficult, for a variety of reasons.
---
Most think tanking is just "holding aggro," but in reality it's a lot more about "knowing." You need to know every dungeon, every raid, every mob, every boss and every mechanic. And while knowing a lot is good, it's even better if you understand why you do the things you do (you might get told to do something, but never fully understand why). Why are you wearing that particular gear at that particular boss?  Why are you  taunting from the other tank? Why are you facing the boss that particular way?
---
Along with holding aggro and knowing things, you are often placed into a role of leadership - voluntarily or not - which also takes a certain amount of skill.
---
You get the idea.
---
Warlocks; Soulfire + Conflag double crit combo.  
---
Warrior; Right click with shaman nearby / MS + HS crit combo.  
---
There's definitely more, but quite a few classes can 100-0 you in about a global by naxx.
---
The time you wasted skinning a mob would be better spent leveling faster and grinding higher level mobs at a higher level.
---
There's 2 aspects at play here:
---
You don't absolutely need the mount at 40. 40 vs 43 is insignificant, you're not even half way to level 60 at that point.
---
The only way professions make money at server launch (in a significant amount, anyway) is through items that are turned in for quests. Specifically in the Badlands since at that point players have mounts and have a bit of gold to spend to level faster.
---
He is Canadian, so...
---
Yes, everyone has different opinions and right to express them.
---
also important for rogues cause it means you can kick a secondary target without losing your combo points on your current target
---
What does that matter or have to do with anything?
---
You sound like a fucking shit tank if that paragraph is something to judge by.
---
Absolutely worth it, you’ll end up with enough gold to buy your mount no problem and level your lock picking at the same time.
---
Factual and topical argument right there.
---
I am going to play Horde, so the boat from ratchet is pretty safe.
---
All is good. This just might be a situation where we have to meet in the middle. Yes they have lost an insane number of players, but that still makes them the most popular mmo today. Its crazy to say they have lost so much and are still number 1.
---
Man, with 10s of servers and multiple layers how many mafias do you think there will be? Devilsaur Mafias only work because pservers have 1 realm with no layers.
---
I remember early in the vanilla days Shadow Priests were considered the best 1v1 class...as people became more geared I believe warriors became the new juggernaut.
---
This brings up a good point.  I wonder if playing through Classic knowing what we're going into, if we'd see the foreshadowing for the following expansions more clearly.  Like, back then a lot of the lore and stories were just like, random filler stuff.  But it might make more sense now in a lot of ways.
---
The most fun and fair system I ever saw was straight out bidding gold on every item (starting at 40g), and then re-distributing the gold to everyone at the end of the raid.  Items would sometimes reach over 1000 gold, and everyone would cheer on for more bids.  At the end the pot was nearly five figures and those who didn't win anything got to bring home a fat purse.
---
The hosting guild kept BOEs and I'm sure would've kept incredibly rare drops.
---
This is for farm status, of course.  And it required a good community that would trust the hosting guild to pay out at the end of a run.  We all formed a line and waited patiently.
---
I think youre the only person ive heard of who missed out on WOTLK but played BC and Cata, what an unfortunate oreo filling to miss live.
---
I just watched four different videos from Vanilla, including the one you linked, and none of them reflect this. Also the editing in that Maydie video is borderline unwatchable, holy shit.
---
They were sitting by that tourney for no other reason than to cause trouble. There is no possible other explanation for their behavior than to inconvenience the players dueling. End of story.
---
I've settled on Horde. So I know that much. Class-wise, its hunter, rogue, warrior or shaman.
---
I dont like clothies, vanilla druids dont appeal, and that leaves me with the above.
---
I didn't mean getting there, I rather mean doing the actual fishing. With lots of competition you'll have to move around much so you'll either have to find some safe spaces or you'll lose a lot of time dying to mobs.

It's a different time, friend.

Players in WoW Classic won't be as blind, dumb and noobish as they were 15 years ago. There will be a guide for everything, an addon for everything, a BiS list for everything. You won't be able to capitalize on inexperienced, unknowledgeable or casual players nearly as well as it was back then.
---
In fact, you'll probably be the one getting steam rolled by younger players that simply have more time on their hands and better reflexes.
---
I will enjoy classic for the same reason I enjoyed it 15 years ago.  The community aspect and the world. I loved roleplaying, leveling, questing and making friends back then. It will be fun to have a sense of community enclosed on a server once again, instead of the cross-realm bullshit, phasing and dungeon finder crap we have today.
---
You think you know more than me, that’s your first mistake. Also by the time you could rank mc why would you. And what guild outside of the private server you played on had 1. Cmon do better
---
I swear to god I saw a picture on stream of trollgodx sitting alone, but idk, could be anything but I guarantee he wasn't banned
---
Old time rogue here. Pick pocket is worth it, but your team doesn't want to wait for you. It is a skill to be used on your own time, not when you are 5-10 manning lbrs or ubrs.
---
I settled on Horde, that was easy. I'm also in the one-character-cap boat, so whatever i roll will likely be it.
---
BIS belt for getting aqual quintessence before MC.
---
umm can you do the mobs in blasted lands that go immune or the totems? something like, i remember leveling weapon skill there.
---
So blizz shouldn't fix anything wrong in classic because they're blizzard and therefore it's right.
---
Im pretty sure walking, running, jumping and strafing are mechanics in the game known as World of Warcraft but what do I know? 🤷‍♂️
---
Tanking and healing have elevated responsibility in most group content from dps. 
---
Tanking is a role designed to succeed--generally. An equally geared tank (to his dps) should be able to maintain agro (that doesnt mean there arent mechanics that force the dps to go less big dick). 
---
Healing is sort of designed to be the failure point. Until people step out of bad, position the boss correctly, do mechanics correctly...people will die. To the naked eye you itll look like your (healers) fault. 
---
Both healing and tanking use a bunch of buttons in combat. 
---
DPS generally has less responsibilities in group content. Their rotations are typically 1-4 buttons. 
---
That said, despite working harder, having more responsilities and generally having more buttons to press than dps, it's dps players who get to feel stronger and stronger and stronger in the open world content. 
---
As a healer gets geared, he gets stam, int, spr, mp5 +healing....none of that does anything for his damaging spells except for the int which converts to crit and raw mana/regen that allows him to cast more until oom.
---
Tanks get more str and agi, but their item budgets are heavily weighted towards defensive stats and hit. So they dont see nearly the power gains a dps player does.
---
Ive played mage and priest in classic raids. Priest felt so much better when I was actually raiding--aka the reason i play the game--mage felt better at all other times.
---
The mobs in Blasted Lands is probably a good bet, they can't die. 
---
Although, they are around level 53 if I remember correctly, but that shouldn't affect procrates.
---
At 70 the ogre was great for leveling weapon skill as you didn't take hardly any damage and he went immune
---
If I recall correctly, you get poison materials from opening the lockboxes you get from pickpocketing.
---
Apparently the got ported away by DMs. Not sure though
---
Probably eso elsweyr
---
Thing is the game is open world and free for all, griefing a community event should never be met with a GM intervention unless it's run by or stated from Blizzard or any other person of power, or griefing by abusing bugs / hacking.
---
It was a dick move, I doubt many people disagree with that, but he had the same "right" to be where he was and do what he did as everyone who took part in the tournament.
---
If what he did was bad enough to warrant a ban they should rethink their stance on community events and add official areas dedicated to them.
---
The point of a Beta is to test the state of a product or service until it reaches a point where it's ready for release. Classic Beta seems to be more of a marketing move to generate hype than an actual beta, so you could argue that a GM intervention could be justified, but I think it would be in bad taste.
---
I'd love for Blizzard to host or allow players to organize community events without the possibility of griefing because this tournament was one of the best things that's happened in this game in a long time, imo. Dedicated community servers with participant/spectator character copies or new limited areas not accessible outside of events. An instanced verdion of Orgrimmar Arena could be a good spot for example.
---
I would like to tank in classic, if I can, and I'm about 90% certain I'm going to pick druid (maybe, \*maybe\* warrior).  
---
There are a lot of factors that you're going to want to consider, here. I'm currently on the fence myself between warrior and Druid, still leaning heavily, heavily toward druid. The versatility is fantastic, and you can both heal and tank (I'm talking endgame raids) with a Heart of the Wild spec, or you can very effectively tank or DPS with a full feral spec (including improved shred and Furor, omen of clarity as well). If you want to respec and then have a very satisfying, engaging PvP experience, you also can. Now, the same can be said for Warrior, but there's just so much you can fiddle around with on a Druid. Also, your best in slot items come from many different sources, as a Druid. You'll be cobbling it all together in a grand adventure across all of Azeroth.  
---
Obligatory: Warrior is the best tank in Classic. It's just true. More oh-shit buttons, and there's not a single encounter that you can't tank (Nefarian with his polymorph to cat form and Chromaggus with the power of Bronze dragonflight present problems for Druid tanks. Druids cannot dispel the sands of time because they cannot use consumables).  
---
Warriors also have a more engaging tanking experience and, quite honestly, this may be the thing that sways me to make a warrior tank. Simply put, you have more buttons to press. That being said, you're trading up to a more engaging tanking experience (Warrior) from a class that can do anything in the game very well (Druid), so your mileage may vary.  
---
Yes, when I say anything in the game, I mean anything in the game. Patchwerk is one of the bosses with the highest DPS check thresholds in the game and even then all you need to average is 500 dps (per dps player) to down him in the necessary time. You are more than capable of pulling that off in cat form. Healing of course is a druid strong suit--you can always heal, and you'll never have trouble convincing people that you can heal. Boomkin... well, I gotta tell you I haven't really considered it much. It may be able to reach DPS minimum thresholds or it may not (when considering, for instance, the dps added by a boomkin aura. And possibly with downranking starfires. I just don't know. I don't know enough to say)... which leaves tanking.
---
Druids can tank at every level of content. They are arguably better MC tanks because Warriors in entry level gear will simply have less mitigation and health than a druid. Onyxia, likewise... she hits like a wet paper towel and druids will just arguably be better-geared. In BWL they have a tougher time (see: Nefarian and Chromaggus comment, plus they don't really gain a gear spike, here), but they make nice off tanks and pick up again very nicely with AQ gear.  
---
Druids. Can. Progression. Tank. Naxx. No, not just Patchwerk. They can progression tank all of the abomination quarter, for instance. Check this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alH2QXm8MM8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alH2QXm8MM8)  The esteemed fellow in question only has one item from Naxx. Admittedly, it's a big one... Ghoul Skin Tunic. But the point still stands.  
---
Druids will suffer crushing blows. There's nothing you can do about that. But their health pool is greater than that of a warrior, their threat ceiling potential is far higher, and, especially when you consider the fact that a warrior in threat gear isn't going to have \*nearly\* the mitigation that a druid will have while also barely competing in threat (whereas the druid will be able to pull of both at the same time, high mitigation and high threat, though not as high mitigation as a warrior at their peak)... the druid becomes much more interesting as a class, and as a potential replacement for the warrior. They can max threat while maintaining mitigation, is what I'm saying. Many healers have said that they do not mind healing a well-geared druid tank even in spite of the potential for crushing blows.  
---
And always remember the general rule that optimal is not the same as viable in Classic, and if anyone gives you guff for pointing that out, tell them that they've somehow forgotten that the reason we all want Classic in the first place is the fact that this 15 year old game will allow us to play in more varied and interesting ways than the one we have right now, where every class is basically the same with a different skin on it.  
---
God speed and good luck. If I think of anything else I'll DM you and also edit this comment for posterity.
---
No... but things like quests are just a row in a database, not complicating mechanics that can interfere with each other when porting over data into a new engine. Blizzard has the original data, the quests are all the same.
---
Ah, I just remember being able to target them in classic with a macro, I guess that's another little change they pushed into Classic 2.0
---
Anyone got a level 60 epic in the beta and disenchanted it? :) There are 1.9 fishing changes in the game so there are chances that 1.9 enchanting changes are also there.
---
Hunter is way superior to warlock for farming gold. Plus warlock you need to farm at least 40+ soulstones before raid (compared to mage). Mage &gt; warlock overall imo. 
---
Voidwalker is not strong in vanilla. Every 3-4 mobs is out of mana and you need to summon another one (rather than wait to recover its mana). And as said the soulstone mechanic is very annoying since you strangle for bagspace in vanilla...
---
Sunken Temple?! God I hated that. And no one ever did it!
---
Healing &gt; Tanking &gt; DPS 
---
As far as PvE goes anyway and its just my opinion. I've tried to play DPS classes, but I just kind of zone out. Even if I'm topping the DPS chart I don't feel like I'm making a big impact, and its just not stressful enough for me.
---
I prefer to heal. Its just so much more engaging to me. Especially when its threading the needle and there is so much incoming damage that someone could reasonably die.
---
Can we get a fucking sticky on this?, this is so much better than the shitty megathread.
---
As mentioned in this thread by another redditer, there was a set violence level console command from 0-5. I know I'd be the type of kid to set that to 5 the second I'd have found out. Maybe that's why the blood effect resonates with me so much?
---
Anywho, it looks like adjusting this is not possible from the beta client (though confirmation could be nice) - which would be a damn shame to me at least. 
---
The editing of Maydies video is edgy and as classic as it gets for the time X)
---
Yeah I'm not going to be one of those heroes that tries to make something mediocre more than it is. Nothing wrong with sticking to the meta.
---
For sure. I kinda feel like there's a difference in where in the world you live. Americans tend to have a lot more bills then Europeans for example. Being a teenager in northern Europe is probably economically easier then being a teen in America.
---
Pop a /startattack in before the cast and you'll Auto attack between spells.
---
But still were much slower leveler than other tbc classes :). I mean people can level as tanks and healers and enjoy it even if not efficient.
---
i think you could enchant anything couldn't you? so you could enchant melee with fiery weapon or crusader. but yeah you gotta keep doing it with a new weapon, casters dont matter asmuch.
---
It was a dueling tournament. In that context, its the definition of griefing, ya dingus.
---
first aid to get to 60 faster so you can make actual gold
---
Sure but I doubt they'd be able to bot mining for multiple expansions without being caught and banned.
---
Like I said before, get a grip. You're heading into a deep hole.
---
can we spoiler tag these please in the future?
---
&gt;Classic Beta seems to be more of a marketing move to generate hype than an actual beta
---
Dingdingding. That's what it is.
---
If I did that I'd spend my entire time inspecting Gods in Ironforge...
---
Yeah, snutz missed a couple of sacs, but it seemed like Venruki won because he played like a god, rather than that Snutz lost because he misplayed.
---
You just have no idea mate. There are people who simply DO NOT RAID. There are people who don't even know guides exist. It will take some people MONTHS of playing to get their epic mounts, not 15 hours. There will be people who will do dungeons for months until they get their T0 set completed. 
---
You have a skewed view of things because they aren't what you do. They aren't what I do either, but they are what most casual people do.
---
Most people don't raid. Just let that sink in.
---
Of course!
---
TZ Panda is trash. #disco
---
Why would he? It won't get him any views.
---
There is already 1700 people in the oceanic classic discord 3 months before launch. We will have enough people to fill a blizzlike population server don't worry.
---
I mean, the plan is to have no layers towards endgame. And I'm speaking to the spirit of it, people will corner the market and the best skins are only acquired from killing few mobs. There are far more herb and mining spawns so camping all of those spawns isn't as feasible as camping the view mob spawns for specific leathers.
---
Healing is easy, pretty hard to mess up IMO, and you don't have to min max your gear as much as a tank or DPS to be effective.
---
Not sure what you mean by streamer servers. I am not away of any sponsorships which give streamers specific servers. Even if they did I don't see the problem.
---
It really depends on your play style, how involved you want to be and the class you want to play. Also are you talking about the classes in a 5man environment or a raid? I personally find DPS to be most enjoyable. There are classes that are more involved and require a rotation to pump out the most damage-for example hunters will require you to weave in Aimed shot and Multi shot at the right time to avoid autoshot clipping.
---
Please explain this hole.  I kinda think you’re narrow minded
---
Healing is most fun to me. DPS I find boring so I really only dps in any game on alts when I want something relaxing and solo.
---
Just use a dueling buddy.
---
You know why you should roll on a streamer server? Those servers are going to have the highest and most active populations. That said, if you are looking to get like rank 14 or any server firsts, don't roll on a streamers server cause you will never achieve either of those unless you straight just play more than them.
---
That’s great for your guild man. If you are being completely honest about your main tank being a feral Druid then I know 100% you never made it through BWL. 
---
Nothing wrong with that - but pretending some of these specs are 100% viable (like a main tank Druid - ofc I’m assuming you mean he was your main tank through all encounters yes?) is absolutely laughable. 
---
You can certainly get away with a lot in MC/Ony. You really could. No doubt about it. But at BWL - that went out the window.
---
It's not his add-on and that add-on uses a version of the guide that was made for TBC.
---
Tank is definitely the hardest. Usually you are the only one who have to worry about boss mechanics and if you goof or if RNG is bad you wipe the raid. So not only do you have the most involved rotation of all classes in vanilla, but you also have to be on your toes and react to when things inevitably go horribly wrong. While pushing out as much threat as possible. A decent tank can stand still and push out good threat while keeping their defensives up, but if something unexpected happens they will usually freeze and blame everyone else for the wipe instead of trying to fix the situation. A good tank can prevent a wipe when shit hits the fan. 
---
As for roles I like it's mostly dps as tanking is too hard and healing usually just breaks down into sniping eachother's heals.
---
yeah I realized this and my edit was too slow, sorry.
---
Spoiler but sure
---
Can't upvote enough
---
Yeah but healing classics are still pretty good at stalling, even late in to vanilla.  When dps increases so does healing so that renew/pw:s match the dps.
---
Yup you’re right. Fond memories of crusader on my warrior alt at level 30 with the whirlwind axe. Fun times :D
---
it's pretty good to level lockpicking and also gets you some healing pots and some other stuff. 
---
It's not much gold but everything adds up.  Also trying to pickpocket everyone as non-sub is cancer.
---
Its absolutely worth it!  
---
While leveling its a nice additional income and as stated earlier a great way to get lockboxes.
---
Warriors are intensely satisfying to hit 60 on and play well, but you pay in equal measure for the privilege. 
---
As long as you don't hold yourself to the standard of other, more efficient levelers, you'll have a good time. Come prepared, take your time, bring friends. I was a super casual warrior until late TBC and it was the best.
---
What, a spanner is not a good replacement for Cleave?
---
Fear does not path you off an edge.  If you get very very close to an edge and then you move even half an inch you will fall though.
---
Too many questions right? Well if do A, then I have to consider B, which impacts C and equals D. 
---
My thoughts so far started like yours; I have to consider my time and commitments and the capacity that lets me have. I've sorted my faction (Horde, because I played Ally in Vanilla and want to see the other side). From there it gets fuzzy...
---
I absolutely 100% agree with this. I really do. I vividly remember how bad of a player I was back then compared to today and I was still in the upper half of our guild performance wise.  You really could carry a significant amount of useless players through raiding until BWL and beyond. 
---
My point of contention has very little to do with that though - nor am I advocating for one side or the other. 
---
What I am advocating for is a serious look at a self reflection for some of these people that actively choose to play sub optimal specs that hinder their groups overall performance for whatever reason. Whether it’s just more fun for them, they are trolling and that’s fun for them, or whatever reason it is. It’s okay to do that. I’m all for that. 
---
I just also want to emphasize that any raid leader can tell them to pound sand for unique yet equally selfish reasons (min max only whatever the fuck) and they have no right to get butthurt about that. 
---
The key here is choice. And just as any player has the right to pick whatever spec they want to play - every raid leader has the right to refuse their bullshit as well.
---
I almost went into a private Vanilla server but didn't like it (I started as paladin and had a horrible time of it), later on after Classics announcement I ended up trying out a private WOTLK server as a mage and had a much better of it (mainly because of the not being a pally thing) but I decided to not keep up with it because of the looming classic, and feeling like I would get used to the newer systems that WOTLK had right before not being able to use them. I would probably have found WOTLK eventually without classic being announced and played it to death (or boredom).
---
I'm pretty sure they need to get a new rating for classic as it's basically a new game
---
I'm undecided whether or not I'm going to put my main on a streamer server, but I'm at least going to have an alt on one for the simple fact of participating in some of these events.
---
nope, unless there was an update since then:

See @kredes comment.

As I've stated before... I don't mind streaming and actually enjoy it.
---
I just don't like that Blizzard took action for something the community should have.

You have to realize that griefing is literally built into Vanilla.  If you don't think that guilds would grief each other over world dragons, azuregos and kazzak, you're crazy.   If you think you won't have someone screw up your quest you're nuts.  Some quests even have anti-griefing mechanisms built in if they really want to protect the player.   The priest's Benediction quest comes to mind.     
---
The fact that there are mechanisms in place to prevent griefing when they see fit, means that they don't care about griefing.   There's no "moral high ground" about this.  If the ability exists, it's do able.  I used to use my horde priest to mind control people my friends didn't like on alliance so they could kill them.  
---
People used to use gnomish mindcontrol cap and pop all your cooldowns while you're questing.   As an alliance priest, I would mind control throw people off the IF dueling spot and they'd die and take durability loss.   We'd mind control people into the lava in BRM in spots where they can't make it out without dying at least twice and suffer durability.  We'd sit out there and do this while waiting for our raids.  To other guilds going to their raids.  
---
Griefing is a part of the game.  Sure it's a dick move in some cases, but it goes around and comes around.  If you dish it out, you'll eventually get it.  I got griefed plenty of times.  Almost done with an escort quest and getting ganked right before completion.  Or being snuck up on so I can't win my fight with my creep anymore, so I die and take durability.     
---
We'd sabotage world dragons all the time.  Go out and trigger events  and wipe the raid of people trying to do it.  You can grief your own faction in these situations.  Guild officers would literally tell you to go.  Sometimes you'd get asked to go help defend another raid from the opposing faction.  You'd team up, this week you defend them, next week they defend you.  Then you get nudes of my guild officer's gf in our guild and we're out the griefing you, fighting the horde and trying to get the dragon for ourselves.    
---
It's WARcraft.
---
Don't care what other people say, don't care about the meta top tier min max. Play what you will enjoy. It's your money and time.
---
Plus there's other character slots. Make an alt later.
---
Bruh I've raided naxx as a Druid. Yes, in a lot of fights, Druids get outhealed by priests / paladins simply because their toolkit is better. The thing is druids actually outperform all healers on certain fights or at least compete for top spot. Its not so clear cut. Even then, healing meters are from from everything, any competent healer will tell you that. Someone has to decurse, and 1 Druid doing the majority of it is actually more beneficial to the raids overall dps than mages stopping damage. 
---
In a perfect world, B rez shouldnt even be needed, however talented MOTW is still a great buff as is Faerie Fire, not to mention having an interupt + stun and emergency Taunt. A good druid has a ton of utility, even as a healer. In an ideal raid, I would be our guilds only druid. 1 Druid being able to hot the entire raid without worry for overwriting anything or having his swiftmends sniped by a team mate is truly a wonderful thing.
---
I didn;t check that myself, someone said it. But honestly man, the priest that lost was because of the troll not because he didn't have a macro. Even if it would work, how are you suppose to think about it ahead of time? It's a 1v1, not 1v1+trollgodx. Anyone trying to defend this idiot that ruined big community event is a moron.
---
Tibia was more Hardcore than Ultima Online and came out before Ultima Online.
---
You dont know the true pain of old-school MMORPG.
---
It's only dying because there are no good MMOs around.
---
My hunter had his Azure Silk Belt in his bags from level 40 when my friend made it till I quit the game. 15% swim speed op
---
Yeah the solo play and downtime considerations are legit.
---
Something I havent even considered much tbh..... I'll add them to my list.
---
Powershifting macro for druids, especially feral.
---
He has to be the biggest idiot for someone who claims to know what he is talking about.  The commentary was some of the worst commentary of all time.  There were a lot of really interesting things that some of these players were doing and the commentators had no idea it was happening.
---
He spent money organizing this event?
---
Anyone know if Corrupted Ashbringer will be featured in Classic? I recall the devs thought it was a mistake to have implemented it.
---
I wanted to throw up when he stopped the first duel betwen Ven and Snutz
---
Ironically, this might be a reason to join a streamer guild. They generally can't tolerate such talk because, well, it's their job on the line.
---
There is definitely something wrong, a warrior should not wield a hunter weapon!
---
Zin'phallic Destroyer of Uteri.
---
Where have the customers gone though?
---
If the sum of MMO players today is less than wow at its height...Blizzard hasnt lost customers so much as people have moved on.
---
Entertainment like video games is fleeting and fickle.
---
Very few people are willing to make a single game their "main" for 15 years. Very few people who are just getting into games decide to make a game thats 15 years old with 100,000,000s of played hours their "main"...the assumption is they are behind...too late, whatever.
---
I suppose what Im saying is WOW was not only a good game, but it came about at a time in internet history where there wasnt  anything else. 
---
Today every game genre has the capacity to be "massively multiplayer online". Everyone can find their own little niche game that does exactly what they want.
---
Further, when wow came out Facebook nor Youtube nor twitch nor xyz existed.   
---
Hundreds of thousands of people who played wow originally absolutely hated leveling, grinding, farming, raids, pvp. They played cause their friends did, cause they could talk to strangers. 
---
It was the way a lot of people experienced the internet.
---
Personally I find tanking to be the most difficult simply due to how bullshit rng threat can be sometimes. Tanking as a whole especially during progression gear levels just feels like I’m trying to manage chaos. Unlucky parry strings and the boss just bursts the fuck out of me can be stressful as fuck.
---
Healing seems very whack a mole to me. 
---
And yes dps is def the easiest. 
---
But I’m biased so take that with a grain of salt lol
---
&gt;So, it's not really hypocritical, 
---
Yes it absolutley is. You are asking for A change of one class, nut no other. You don't want to be true to a patch, but pick and chose among multiple patches. That is distorting the game.
---
&gt;I am talking about a small change
---
So do all the other people in their dozens of pointless threads when called out for their hypocrisy "Chill dude it's just ONE SMALL CHANGE".
---
"One small change!" has amlost become a meme at this point. If all these "small changes" together were come to pass, we would basically end up at retail, with less content.
---
&gt;Tons of people play what's OP. It will be NOTHING like Vanilla.
---
This is not an argument in your favor. You cannot delete knowledge, no matter what you change. If your goal is to "balance everything" to not have anything that's OP (according to your perception), you end up at retail.
---
Very good considerations. I've got my choices narrowed down to about 4 classes, so I might take the above and do some searching to see if there are any red flags.
---
Ultima Online was easy compared to Tibia. WoW is a joke for a true MMORPG player like me.
---
Honestly? I’ve never raided in a guild larger than 20 people, but /roll with some loot council influences goes a long way. Maybe it’s cuz my guild were a buncha gamblers who always did gold rolls for fun between pulls, but no fucking loot drama EVER occurred outside of personal loot titanforging no trading bullshit in legion by using a system of something along the lines of “you want the tier? Cool, who else wants the tier, who is it the biggest upgrade for, 3 people get the same upgrade from it? Roll that shit”
---
Venruki played it well.  It is hard to beat a well played warlock, and Snutz is a solid warlock.  When Venrucki was playing a warrior, he didn't mention him csing the warrior to keep in combat and other shit like that.  It was just sad.
---
Found the carebear trammy!
---
It's a gnoll hunter and his wolf from near crossroads.
---
Don't forget the Hydrocane. Being able to breathe underwater is a big leveling advantage on a pvp server
---
Sitting there auto attacking?  Lol what?  What were you tanking?  The critters outside?
---
/spit increased your dmg by 1% according to rogues.
---
What's the problem with Ouro? 
---
We always have a feral tank (and a prot paladin tank) and the main hurdles I've seen are tank swap fights. Not only do druids lack one taunt compared to warriors, but their threat is also way above and beyond a warrior, as long as they are getting hit. They are really bad as second tanks because they just can't get the rage up to use their abilities. So if they tank first the second tank can't keep aggro even if the druid does nothing, and if the warrior goes in first the druid can't get aggro as a second tank. On bosses like Vael and Huhuran we always send in the bear first, although recently the paladin goes in first on Huhuran because of his bubble.
---
no way cdew would have lost against seren even without the griefers or the reset, I mean look at how he obliterated claak in the bo5 for 3rd place
---
&gt; but a lot of people 
---
You are a minority. A tiny, and vocal minority. Yes, I am speaking for everyone, because you are so few, you don't matter.
---
&gt;with the top druid on the private servers
---
PServer kiddies don't matter either.
---
There was a prize pool for 1 2 and 3 place. Think it was like 1800 total. Not sure where the money came from but thought tips was putting it up himself.

I'm doing skinning/leatherworking -&gt; mining/engineering for my troll hunter. Get my devilsaur gear and cash without node competition, then the real value items for endgame.
---
Alt mage is going tailoring/enchanting.
---
The stun resist is amazing. If you’re playing a class that doesn’t have a stun escape you should definitely consider Orc.
---
Yes, so what?
---
You cannot combat existing knowledge. If your plan is to change the game until the current knowledge about it is no longer accurate, then congratulations, you destroyed the game.
---
This is exactly why I am going back to classic and gonna no life. In classic you build ur own life and friends great read man. Got me wanting to do this now. I remember the people I payed back kindness in classic and it pays dividends in future needs.
---
Yep, they got banned. What a way to lose beta classic.
---
Really makes me wonder how much of the story they had planned from the beginning wowee
---
"*I eat toxicity for breakfast and shit out radioactive sticks of dynamite. Fear my badassery*."
---
I wonder how all you dudes look like in real life, I can only imagine the glowing pale beta-ness of you all.
---
xD thanks, that was my morning laugh =)
---
You are right, but it's not #vanilla, its #nochange.
---
In what order do I watch??
---
Yes? And whats tour point?
---
I was the noob. I mined for a bit in UO until I got owned. Went to EQ. Rolled a wood elf druid. Was hooked the in the first 5 minutes when I fell off the platforms of Kelethin. I thought there would be an invisible wall to hold me back. First time I experienced the concept of falling damage  Went to a pvp server. Got mind controlled - loss of control for minutes. Got myself Corpse camped by a high elf mage named Ryld. Yeah, I still remember his name. Lost everything. When you die in pvp the opponent can loot an item. Eventually fumbled my way to Max level. EQ2 and wow came out about the same time. I chose poorly in going EQ2. My RL friends got me to change back to wow. I rode on thier coat tails as an alt in raids and through wotlk. Played various MMOs. Came back to wow several times. Been going strong on wow for 2-3 years now. Avid pet collector/vengeance DH.  My retail guild just disbanded. Messaged my old RL friends from vanilla. Hoping they will join me back for classic. My time here in wow is far from over. See you in classic.
---
I really recommend it! I'm having the most fun in retail that I've had in a really long time playing this way.  Always pay it forward!
---
2k usd for this tournament, and he also organised tournaments with cash rewards during the demo a few months back.
---
Go full fabulous and get double mace
---
His name is familiar, wasn't he like a top mage in arena?
---
I no longer have my copy, as a lot of my stuff from then got thrown out while moving, but yes, I do think the booklet was black and white as well.
---
Wasn't uncommon btw.
---
True, but companies dont work on "we were at the  right place at the right time and now we aren't" for a company that once made a billion a month they should have been able to figure out how to maintain or reproduce that. 
---
My argument is they figured out how to maintain the worlds most popular MMO. Which is a huge achievement. 
---
The opposing arguement is they didn't figure out how to maintain their own success. Which is a huge failure as well.
---
Just do 2 swords white swing damage is what kills shit once you get 2 really good swords around 36ish I believe that you can use till 60 basically
---
I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't be on the loot table in naxx.
---
I'm not talking about vanilla, i'm talking about #nochange. If you look at the patches from release till 1.12 its rather #shittonofchanges ;)
---
Such a ruthless and fun game that was!
---
I once scammed a guy without his even knowing for about a month or so. Through a strange chain of events I literally won the game at one point without even cheating!
---
Asshole kept killing me while I was mining so I formed a plan.    I spent a week or so training up hiding skill as well as carpentry (different story).
---
I stayed hidden for probably a week to find his general routes and eventually found out where he lived. *rubs hands together*
---
So step one made a box.  On that box was a purple potion (for quite some time they were more powerful than master alchy pots).  I got completely naked and filled up that box with animal hides (overweight).
---
I hid and layed that box down near his normal route and fairly close to his house.   He was always decked out in Gold or Black GM armor and super cocky so I figured he would take the bait.   I had the box just slightly poking out from a rock so as to look like someone was trying to hide it.
---
At first he picked it up but since it was so heavy he couldnt move.  He very well could have ran home and taken off his gear but he was a cat.
---
BLAM -  Oh shit he didn't quite die..  took him down about 3/4 health and he ran off.   I was still hidden so I re-trapped it.  He came back at 1/2 health and BLAM!  Dead. 
---
Now here's the fun part.  I searched his corpse and among a ton of reagents and GM gold plate/Vanq sword he also had a key.   Yeap.. I also had a key mold on me so instead of looting his shit right there (which was worth more than anything I owned) I made a copy of his key hoping it was his house key.
---
I was not dissapointed.     For weeks I would slip in his house and snag a little something something.  A piece of GM armor here, a vanq weapon there.   After a couple months when his chests were all loaded up from his victims I called in some friends and we sacked that house dry.
---
It was pretty epic really.  Never really had that type of experience or pure adrenaline flow ever.
---
(carpenter story)   I also used to find small clear patches in the woods and build random bed, chairs, and of course chests.  All arranged as if someones house depleted.   Trapped the hell outta the chests and same deal, just hide and wait.    I was able to buy a keep with those weird traps.
---
God I miss that game.
---
I don't think too many are directly defending him, I know some are at least wondering what the big uproar is about since a lot of us were not there or watching, at all. 
---
As for the macro thing, people used totem stomping macros in classic all the time in 1v1 situations, I just didn't know they removed it or never implemented it, I know being a shaman in classic meant your totems were pretty much gone in a second or two of laying them.
---
But yea, sucks what he did, maybe when the servers roll out for sure people will learn to just disregard them, and it being the same faction is a pretty big problem too, I do know that much.
---
Trimera represent.
---
Mmos now dont delete your character if you die too much. THAT was the risk of pvp in tibia.
---
That was like 4 years ago

---
Quin's VOD is probably the best one to watch, he was switching between streams to watch duels from their PoV, almost everyone else watch spectating from 3rd person PoV
---
That's a good idea!
---
I play BfA. I'll be playing Classic. Two different games for two different moods. We're allowed to like and play both. The whole us vs them mentality is silly. I imagine many players will be like me. That's the whole point of the dual sub.
---
That was beautiful, I cried a little bit. Thank you OP!
---
Probably winning the skinning roll vs 3 other Skinner's on the beast in ubrs and getting pristine hide of the beast:) and also getting almost all my feral bis in on bwl the run.
---
Yes, I do enjoy a challenge and having to prep for fights etc. So maybe youre right. Thanks for your input.
---
I can play it on my 7 year old zenbook if I turn down the graphics to minimum, I get a solid 60 FPS from it then. I think it's like a 640M or 650M or something like that in it.
---
I doubt I'll run fine in raids or large PvP battles but for general questing it's fine.
---
It matters because you're a fascist.
---
Also, I was in FL very early when they weren't all assholes. 
---
We had rules of not killing mounts, offering free passage if they joined the cause, etc.  All that fun roleplay murderer/road blocks/ robin hood type stuff instead of just randomly killing noobs.
---
 Before that I was an anti-pk, can't remember the guild name.. Crimson something.
---
Enrage phase, hello?
---
That sounds lame as fuck. Imagine the UO in the context of streamers. Puke.
---
Keep in mind that to get a Fishing Skill of 225, you need only be level 20. This is very doable in the first week, and likely won’t have a disadvantage to those with mounts. Mainly because if anybody has a mount that first week their priorities probably weren’t in Fishing, and therefore won’t be competing. Week two might be different.
---
Russian roulette.
---
Here's Defcamp impressions on dungeon difficulty:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL3vco2zy98
---
Majority of veteran player understand that you need progressive itemisation or the content will be trivial.
---
Yeah, it's hard =( Was Rogue main in vanilla and I loved it. But wanna try something new and Druid feels fun and versitile. But then my GF suggested I play druid as alt since it's so easy to solo one.
---
But I'm quite confident on Shaman now, since it's the complete opposite on how you play Rogue. So I'll be playing a new faction as a completely different class this time around =)
---
I love kicking people in the nuts, why is my way of having fun wrong?
---
When you're comparing ret vs. other DPS, I think it's important to note, it's not just about "being the best." Ret ***literally*** does 1/3rd the damage of the other classes. You might be tolerated in a raid, but you will never 'really' earn your spot. The raid would always be better off if you were anything else or anyone else.  
---
You can still do it, sure.
---
I found an epic once.
---
It was a Taran Icebreaker.
---
To be fair to your younger self: leveling warrior takes forever even if you know what you're doing.
---
If you don't want to contribute to the team and leech gear while doing barely any DPS at all you should go moonkin.
---
Well, in vanilla you don't have to choose between healing, bear and cat so I don't even know what the drama is about.
---
Need to tank? Bear. Need to PvE? Cat. Need to support/heal? Neither.
---
Isn't the entire point of Druids is that they're jack of all trades?
---
Idfk, but that's basically all tanks do lmao
---
I was thinking about a mouse over party invite macro. Great to have when someone kills the mob you've waited 5 mins for. It's not really combat related, but would be very handy in classic.
---
Thanks for your input! Yes, I read somewhere on here that I need to get a 2h weapon, put talents in arms and get a swingtimer addon. Haha, seems waaay more difficult than current wow where I can just run around like a god (i mean i get health regen after every kill wtf).
---
First and foremost stop masturbating to porn or WoW. It’s an “unnatural” and unrealistic setting. Your rage boner needs to know that when a naked female is around it should be happy-not a blood elf. You likely need professional help. Anyway, basically stop your current behaviors and try to engage in the real thing. Find a partner who is understanding. I’d also quit WoW, sounds like you cannot moderate your behavior. Who knows, maybe you’ll be able to play again one day on a more casual basis :)
---
jellybean was extremely close to winning against venruki, might even have if it wasn't for flagged alliance players being around the duel  
---
Bean got clapped by cdew though
---
Agreed completely. Times have changed, and the behavior that OP seems to exalt doesn't really have a place in modern Classic WoW. Anyone who tries to play like this is just going to end up ostracized since people are both less tolerant of that behavior and less susceptible to it nowadays.
---
Blizz GMs work in an office with 24 hour staff coverage all days.
---
Not even close dude, in wrath it was about 5 hours per level smashing quests and dungeons, and in retail last week i went from 70-75 in an hour and a half after winning 1 bg and finishing 2 new dungeons.
---
Take care of those! While I never found them quite as fun as many other boardgames, they're worth quite a bit if in good condition. You're probably looking at $400 there, easy.
---
The *Burning Crusade* and *Shadow of War* expansions for *World of Warcraft: The Board Game* fix a lot of the problems, mainly adding variety to the questing. There's also a "Frozen Throne" expansion for *Warcraft: The Board Game* but I've never played it.
---
Damn son that is quite the catch. I got a free boat once. That was cool. Just running on my way to cove. Saw a corpse decaying picked up the key on it, figured only thing worth value. 
---
After finishing up my hunting at the orc fort I passed by a boat that was locked. Figured what the hell worth a shot. Sure as shit that dude’s boat was mine now.
---
Tanking and Tanking.  Though I have to note that tanking is exhausting.   I'd relax by questing with my hunter.
---
this is dope, thanks
---
You said my memory of it is not 100% correct but there is a 100% correct client to check. What's YOUR point?
---
“Idfk” 
---
Sounds about right.
---
Was it on a PvP server? What if an alliance started attacking, would that be ok?
---
I have crazy nostalgia for ultima online... I feel like ive found that level of intensity is Rust. But if yer not into fps i might not speak to you here.
---
everything about him is annoying, his accent, his little whiny voice, him saying classic is bad and then jumping on the popular train? Wow. Guess that's whats great about twitch, you can follow those you want and ignore the bad ones.
---
Very much this.
---
The issue is less of fun, than it is of stress.  Stress wears you out even when you're having fun.  I loved tanking to death in Vanilla, but I could only spend about 1/3 of the time tanking than I could DPSing before I need a long break.
---
Yeah I watched one duel on tips stream and then just went to Perp cause it was aids.
---
Then its not about nostalgia anymore, besides even then you wont be checking it constantly to see if your memory is correct.
---
You are just arguing for the sake of arguing with literally no point.
---
GMs should just ban this dude in an instant. It is a beta, i imagine they can drop anyone without any explanation.
---
I agree that maybe on live people would not do it cause they would get an idiot label and not get any invites around the server.
---
Still this event is unique cause all the streamers and multi glads were playing on the same realm which will likely not be the case on live. So someone ruining such a unique even has to really be a d.
---
I think it would be nice to have a tournament realm, where everyone would be able to copy their char just for the sake of participating in tournament and being able to face people from different realms. It would allow for creating such events in the future.
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure there is actually a clause that states that you playing the game, even how you mention above isn't bannable even if it impeads another players experience.
---
I am pretty sure that the exact opposite is true, Blizzard reserves the right to ban anyone for any or no reason at any time.
---
I'm not pissed it's just lame to take the vod down. People do watch those. Not everyone can catch it live. I did, but a lot of people wouldn't have and vods offer a spoiler free way to watch afterwards.
---
I don’t disagree with the general tone of your response at all. Blizzard had messed up. But 15 dollars is nothing. That’s like one full priced movie ticket. 
---
And while I agree with your poe example. Developing content in Poe is far cheaper and a far smaller scale than for something like wow. And it’s not like the additions are crazy substantial outside of a few leagues and updates. The additions and mechanics are pretty minor a lot of leagues. 
---
But poe being a good example of f2p is the exception. There aren’t a lot of high quality games out there with respectful monetization in the f2p arena. And I haven’t seen an mmo that is f2p that doesn’t ruin some aspects of the experience basically forcing you to pay which takes away from the experience. 
---
But there are endless achievements and random things you could stay busy doing if you wanted even when the raid tier is old. It’s just a matter of whether the content currently available is worth it. BFA wasn’t worth it to me so I unsubbed but I still think 15 a month is totally acceptable.
---
First of all your classic priest example.. Many classes is not an over the top experience if you only look at what buttons you press. But you have the buffs, the heals and ccs and so on. It's a collective effort. Every class matters as a small cog. Together. Compared to retail where everyone is a God and their rotation is a minigame.
---
Second your example of retail is maximum lvl hard-core dungeon. You can't compare that to the classic dungeons overall. In classic almost every dungeon needs some cc. In retail it's Diablo.
---
And more spells to spam does not necessarily equals harder or more fun.
---
Uh no dude.  Servers can not hold level 1 alts accountable for standing on your pixels.
---
Honest question: Why do you have to sound gay? Can’t you talk like a normal man?
---
You mean high skill floor, smh.
---
I had a few friends in FL not all were assholes but definitely went downhill later. One of my FL buddies Fritz, man we would wreck shit. Loved hunting with him.
---
The best part about being a PK was you never really had to go too high in murder count. Once you went Red everyone attacked you so it was free kills basically.
---
I remember griefing in MajorMUD and looting the entire corpse of players - all their items equipped or none.
---
There were items that were limited to only one in existence. Or just 5. Many were class specific. These were kept on alts and only very rarely did a player deck themselves out in BiS gear and when they did, their entire guild was with them (usually decked out) in full force. This is when the real PvP would start.
---
We'd run protection rackets: give us x gold each week and you are granted safe harbor. Etc.
---
Thanks for the post, ah the memories!
---
Spellbreak and Rocket League lol
---
You’re a dimbass
---
Why didn't they re-play the duel then?
---
I'm quite confident the "story" in WoW was very well established up until atleast Cataclysm. That's why the story in the expansions up until then is quite decent.  After that, stuff is so random.
---
Laptop with a i5 7300hq and gtx 1050. 
---
Max settings and shadows on high. 
---
Around 70-95 fps on beta. 
---
Gonna need to lower some settings for raids tho.
---
Pissing off streamers is a bannable offense.
---
Then hunter is not for you. Hunter is a utility class.
---
If you want too dps go rogue or warr. Mage too but not till aq and beyond.
---
&gt;their horde of followers will mass report people.
---
Mass report people?
---
Warriors are basically grueling for 2 reasons. The first is they're heavily gear dependent, so unless you get lucky with weapons, your damage will start to crawl every 8-10 levels or so. The second reason is because in PVP you're food for anyone who comes across you. But maybe you'll play on a PVE realm. :)
---
Tournament realms did exist, you got pre-made characters like ptr and such, not sure if they still do but they used to, could earn the vanquished title, was fun
---
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not, but in case you are:
---
There's a thing called talent trees. To be a competent tank, a Druid needs to spec into the Feral tree. To be a not-so-competent DPS, a Druid needs to spec into the Feral tree. To be a healer, a Druid needs to spec into the Restoration tree. The gear required for a healer is totally different than a Feral Druid, but even if they had two sets of gear, they'd still need the right spec. So no, a Resto Druid can't just decide to suddenly be a good tank in the middle of a raid. They'd need to respec.
---
So fun.  So random!
---
All you really needed were the balls to go get it!
---
dual firey enchants that'll run you about 60g my man, you had some cash or knew a guy.
---
Don't get me started on the crusader enchants for 300-500g in wsg 10-19 bracket... sheesh. good times
---
It's got an MPAA logo and everything.
---
So blizz should delete all their data when some old website has it written down otherwise?
---
I suppose they just want to understand if they're missing something.
---
He just means whatever server they pick.
---
Professions probably won't help you out. I guess skinning could make the bug-farm easier.
---
This make so much sense. I wondered why mop and wod felt so off lore wise.
---
You my friend will get the true classic wow experience as an Australian, expect  200-300 ping.   
---
really the difference between a high and a low ping is VERY noticeable sure we all played at 300-400 ping in vanilla(shitter netcode back then) But none of the top guilds were from Australia, despite us having really good players, ping held us back, but then once Oceanic hosted servers came out, many of the top oceanic guilds shot up in rankings, been able to dodge stuff on the ground or get off a clutch heal/ability etc much easier with low ping.   
---
And PVP lag with the spellbatching/5 tick rate is going to be really noticeable for you. Sure you prob wont run into a popular streamer if you one of those players who likes to hang off their dicks. but you wont be spending your life hearing your melee character say:"im out of range, i cant do that right now, not enough rage, target too tar away, our of range, out of range."  
---
If you work or goto school regular hours, defiantly roll on an oceanic server. My guild was the only oceanic guild on an american server, but we stayed there for too long, as soon as server transfers opened, We transferred to Jubithos we could finally get some new recruits and got the server first twin emps kill. the guild imploded in naxx, but hey, it was easy to find another guild.   
---
Ive played PVP and MMO's for years i have alot of USA friends from planetside 1 and planetside 2, id love to play MMOs with them and other games again, but ping is just too important, on an american planetside 2 server im 70Kills per hour. puts me in about the 90th percentile id say, on an Australia server, im 120kills per hour, puts me as world first(humble brag) difference is night and day.
---
I don't expect it to been that much.
---
First of all, nowadays everybody knows what awaits them. It's not like they roll paladin and expect to tank in raids.
---
And then, Warrior isn't as slow in leveling as people think, he just needs food, bandages, pots, everything he can get and ofc a proper Rotation. Warrior just don't want to Miss out on that hamstring to min-max their effiency. But even for those who aren't min-maxing, having food, pots and bandages alone let's u be way faster.
---
blizzard also should have banned the funeral crashers. they were trying to make content! leave them alone!
---
What does that do to the tanks? I just notice the popcorn spawning everywhere. I'm not a tank obviously.
---
I think druids need a lot of macros in general, to cancel shapeshifting in order to cast spells afaik. I could be 100% wrong, but I heard that the powershift macro shouldn't work in Classic if they have the Legion versions of macros, but my mind is hazy.
---
Min maxing is a serious issue.
---
Do you have a link to this?
---
Raids -almost never- turn away healers, especially non-druid hybrids.
---
You are correct. Its only worth downrank when you get a certain amount of +healing and that wont happen until max level or thereabout.
---
Beware you will get pulled from stealth with resists but yeah this is how to do it. Add pickpocket to every ability via macro.
---
I hear a lot of people saying it is on the 8.0 client though is there direct evidence of this? Could be a 7.X with backported security and bug fixes. I think 7.x did not have multithreading where as 8.x did that is one way to check I guess what they are basing the classic client off (can't check myself don't have beta).
---
He was
---
I imagine it's much more true that it's harder for horde to find good alliance warlocks than good mages, actually
---
The bigger hook facing towards the ground might make more sense, since it will be easier to use it against armor.
---
All rogue reagents, Fadeleaf and swiftthistle included.
---
&gt; It’s already being extremely hyped up on Twitch and within the gaming community in general. 
---
The thing about gaming communities is that they hype a lot of things, but don't actually play it as much when they get it.
---
that's only because the totem's belong to cdew. u can't macro hostile totems
---
5/5 MoD are my first 5 points on rogue always!
---
Taking up a slot on your bars for no reason at all. In retail vanilla you needed to do this to anchor the macro:ed function but with the new classic API (ever since TBC really) all you need to do is /startattack in every ability.
---
tldr: Make a macro for every ability and include /startattack - it will reduce alot of unessecary headache.
---
I am glad this happened so people realize the problems that streamers will create. So funny to watch people try to rationalize how this was griefing.
---
Calling for the person to get banned, get a grip you fucking stream cancer crybabies.
---
"they were griefing 100k people"
---
No, they weren't, at best they were disturbing 100 people, streams and people that watch them were not affected by this and are not part of what happened in a small section of the world.
---
Your argument is that detracting from others enjoyment is against the TOS, yet there are plenty of in-game activities that detract from people's enjoyment that you have no problem with.
---
Damn. Good to see he's still grinding it out. Awesome.
---
Ah yes, the classic customer support guarantee that one poor intern will be there on Sunday to buffer the phone queue time.
---
When Ouro enrages he needs to be tanked by Warriors with shield wall rotations or else you get deleted in 2 hits. If nobody's tanking Ouro he throws boulders at the raid for 6k damage every 2 seconds or so.
---
Druids are mega awful on Ouro because they can't switch to caster and activate barkskin.
---
??? I played for 3 years straight on private servers and the different lighting in Classic makes the game feel different. It's not about nostalgia and I don't need to check constantly. I feel like you just want to be right
---
As if no one on twitch ever finds it funny when streamers get mad at something in a game.
---
I think you greatly overestimate the effect talents have on your skills. What is the actual, measurable difference in heal power between a full specced and not specced resto druids - 15%? 20%, maybe.
---
Gear is a given, but you don't just "accidentally" stumble into a 40-man raid while picking herbs in your PvE gear.
---
Eh... bunch of milk drinkers in here.
---
Counter-calling. He'll get knocked out first round.
---
You, among many others have finally convinced me to give him a view. - But seeing that I am from EU, when does he stream?
---
If the macros include /script then it's likely vanilla 1.12.1 macro:s that also requires additional addons to work. These will NOT work in classic due to the newer macro-API.
---
Huh, does Azure Silk Belt stack with Hook of the Master Angler? Gotta get that maximum swim speed.
---
Sunday probably means at least 3 teams of about 12 GMs in the Austin office alone. They most likely just didn't care about pvp griefing rather than being understaffed.
---
Druids are fine but they can’t wield thunderfury. Case closed.
---
Could it be the tbc prepatch?
---
Selling your account was big money back then.  I got $1k in BC with only pvp gear/glad title.  In vanilla with really good pve gear it was even more.  If you had rare items, like this tabard, it probably sold really well.
---
Do you think Cpt, Steezy, or Payo represent all private server players?
---
I’m playing perfectly fine  on a i7-920, Radeon HD4890 and 12 GB ram.
---
All from 2009/2010, granted it was pretty high end back in the day.
---
The whole reason you have been "fighting" for classic is so you can demand things be given to you so you don't miss out?
---
This entitled attitude is the root of what killed wow.
---
I guess I am an alcoholic myself, then.
---
Oh well, guess I will play shaman..no wait a warrior
---
Continue getting angry Mr fascist. Nobody wants you in this community.
---
Actually the cleave icon exists in the macro iconography. Execute however does not for some reason I never figured out why.
---
Im pretty aure they are called spells in game regardless
---
&gt;I watched some of these.  Tipsout and his friend really really really do not understand classic wow.  This was some of the worst commentary ever.
---
Ummm, his "friend" is a rank 14 rogue on multiple private servers and is known for being one of the most skillful and analytical players within Classic WoW.
---
Learn your class bud
---
No thanks
---
Are you sure that isn't because of the fact that the key ring was hidden until you recieved your first key?
---
&gt; so did everyone else and their mother by how active those servers are at the moment.
---
Ain't that the truth... I too started randomly to scratch the itch casually, and it's funny how literally every mob of quest spawn is getting spawn camped. Hogger probably has PTSD at this point as there is like 20 people standing on his spawn point every time.   
---
&gt;  Lowbie ganking is incredibly common on the pvp servers    
---
Not my experience so far.
---
DFH was a pioneer for a while. I miss the ancient ales, and stuff like Festina Peche though.
---
So get 5 points in Master of deception... Got it! :D
---
This is better than the megathread in basically every way. Well done!
---
Well he's shit then.  Rank 14 means nothing.  In retail, we had a rank 14 nelf rogue that literally got it by camping GYs in AV.  I have played a lot of private servers in top guilds.  He was better than Tipsout, but frankly, not by a ton.
---
Except they didn't get banned. A GM simply ported them to Winterspring.
---
I more or less stopped playing MMORPGs after I quit WoW in Cataclysm.    
---
So I'd be doing the same thing I've doing since then - various single player stuff, and fighting games for the multiplayer competition.
---
Why would you cast rank 1 versions of any of those spells?
---
lol :O
---
They've been 2 for $5 for a long time here. They've been that price as long as I can remember in NJ. Same with BK doing the Whopper 2 for $6.
---
This is a bad mechanic
---
So much gatekeeping and edgelord cringe here. The game can be different things to different people. OP really can’t see his own double standard?
---
Oh great, you were a a ganker and scammer, good for you. Doesn’t mean that’s how other people want to play the game and it’s dumb to judge them for it.
---
Rules will always be created when people take shit too far. That’s kinda how civilization works in general.
---
Was really happy to see Venruki win, I honestly thought warlocks countered mages hard in classic.
---
I don't doubt it
---
Last time I ever logged out of my Vanilla WoW main was in WOTLK, he was wearing all of his WOTLK Naxx Tier gear. Recovered him a few months ago found him in a cata zone I didnt recognize since I never played Cata and he was  maxxed out on herbalism and some other profession.
---
Account was stolen and used as a gold farming dumby for years it seemed.
---
ye, if you wanna see the  absolute brutality of getting fucked over, play d2 HC back in the day. People teleporting to your position and 1 shotting you, getting that ear and taking off to the next poor sucker.
---
Except Asmongolds version will probably be completely different. 
---
Less focus on pure skill and more focus on an epic viewing experience.
---
&gt; the plan is to have no layers towards endgame
---
Yeah, the point where layers are disabled is the point prices for the pre-bis items will be reasonable because there's not much demand.
---
&gt; There are far more herb and mining spawns so camping all of those spawns isn't as feasible as camping the few mob spawns for specific leathers.
---
Yeah, the mobs are rare but you also have alot of hours where people won't farm them. You can't have cross-faction groups on all layers 24/7.
---
Just watch perplexity instead next time.  It was kinda sad to see that the main commentator had below 1k views the whole time.
---
Pservers will feel different than vanilla and classic anyway as they are not the same.
---
How so (I honestly don't know, I was a dedicated PvPer from launch to early Cata).
---
Nice way to skip a level 30 timbermaw hold run.
---
I'd rather see mechanics put in place to enable trusting interactions, where reasonable. E.G. the ability to disenchant from the trade window and have the mats go directly into the customer's inventory. The kinds of things that you would expect a real world and real economy to find a solution to.
---
But outside of that, it should all be fair game. An anarchic war of all against all is not how any real society actually functions, but there are always scammers and grifters and sociopaths.
---
Retail hivemind inc
---
If bitching about loot is the decider between good and bad, 99% of WoW players would be considered assholes.
---
Is this an actual topic?
---
It's pretty hilarious to read these douchebags pat themselves on the back for being "hardcore" for scamming and griefing people.
---
98 kills on the MCbosses able to drop Mana Igniting Cord before I saw one
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/user/Purp1exity](https://www.youtube.com/user/Purp1exity)  educate yourself. He is an amazing player throughout WoW and a high level arena player. You understand this entire tournament was put together by the community and all work was voluntary. I believe this is his first time ever casting a tournament. Seems weird that two of the best WoW players Snutz and Venruki both applauded him for his casting at the end of the tournament.
---
Possibly an unpopular opinion, but I actually appreciate that you don't need the connecting flight points in modern WoW. Yeah, it's more immersive if you need to unlock the full chain, but I'm willing to make certain concessions to facilitate gameplay.
---
This is actually 200 iq I can't even fathom
---
!RemindMe 77 days
---
reality is even if there were rp pvp servers they would propably go the same way as before. name policy will not be enforced and pvp players leeching the ambience, grieving the "lol rp nups" would ruin it again. just look at the threads it is doomed to fail. Only solution is gm manpower and strict enforcment without tolerance.
---
This is proof that anyone who says there are no stupid questions is wrong
---
Pretty sure the rank 14 account on our server was played by like 3 different people at the time.  It was all just a competition for who had the most free time.
---
warrior preist may well be, but be prepared to get your grind on. 
---
I was doing this with a friend as a priest and his smite kept ripping agro of my 1h warrior, which means i had no rage and could do fuckall to the mob, the other issue was that with lower kill XP per mob, we were always under the recommended zone/area level which meant we had to grind more and there is no bonus XP from duoing.
---
had no idea China was that big of the playerbase, very interesting.
---
You're weird.
---
The fuck kinda detective work is this lmao
---
I recovered mine and it was an insane process. The gm was asking me my character names and guild names. He actually said "It was a hail mary". I got my warrior and lock to level 70 once bc came out, so, no karma for me. Im just gonna be happy im playing my original account when classic comes out.
---
OG Jeffery did a cast from his own stream, he's a much better caster. 
---
Agree on the good organization, but Tips just isnt the cameraman for these things.
---
Not sure of trolling or serious /insert fry.gif  
---
Private server players deserve to be better?... ?? ?
---
Not demanding it, I want a chance at it. I want a chance at the ZG mounts, I want a chance at finishing the Shifting Sands questline. I want a chance at all these things I joined too late to experience or see. It is the same reason people are asking about putting the unarmored mounts like the Ivory Raptor in, people want a shot at the content they missed, they are hoping for a second chance at it. Why is me asking for some way to get the CE pets in a reasonable way any different from people asking for the Ivory Raptor?
---
Snutz was lucky he won against Chance to start with imo.
---
If Chance wasn't feared outside the duelling area he would have won.
---
The 3th duel they started he didnt have some of his important cd's. (dragon trinket, sprint,  pvp trinket??) + snutz his 15 min cooldown was ready again while he didn't have that in the 2th duel.
---
Imagine having such a shit life that you need to annoy tournament players to feel like you belong
---
No it was all ruined. They had to stop the event and it was all just ruined. JFC is everyone on this sub a child?
---
Wow got things right by creating hard coded faction rivalries for people to use for their agression.  After wow got care bearish, I switched over to eve online for a couple of years.  I hated so much of it.  Everyone was gunning for you, PvP was a game of cat and mouse instead of combat and control, PvE was so lame, death was huge fucking pain in the ass that you were encouraged to run rather than fight unless you had an overwhelming advantage, thus limiting PvP content, etc.
---
The only part of eve I really enjoyed was Faction war, where 2 factions sides duked it out for control of a series of systems which did eventually result in one faction winning everything and being supreme for a while. 
---
Each had their own lore, reasons for fighting, insults for the other side, etc.  Guilds (corps in eve terms) were still important and you developed rivalries with people on your side and on the other side, but your real hardcore aggression was always directed the enemy faction.
---
Do you speak for everybody too?  You’re wrong with every comment you make, so why do you continue to make them?  Are you stubborn or stupid?
---
This, 90% of what he wanks off about in the first 3 paragraphs never existed in wow or was punished by gms.
---
WoW was the carebear MMO. Mob tagging, no death penalty, sanctuaries, PvE servers, instances PvP, a PvP ladder that actively discouraged griefing npcs, GM's banning for scamming. 
---
WoW took off because people who played it didn't leave after 10 minutes because they got fucked in the ass by some high-level neckbeards for the entire starting experience.
---
Well, the portals take you to all the expansion hubs. Without them, it'd be pretty shit to get anywhere because there's so many continents now.
---
Yeah I’m sure there’s tons of support tickets raining into Blizzard HQ right now with all of their successful products booming.
---
There is a place in vanilla called Deathwing's Lair in Hyjal I believe, so probably.
---
Retail players play easy classes that's why Cx
---
If you think a Resto Druid is going to get *any* Feral gear before every single Rogue, Hunter, and Fury Warrior in the raid, think again. Maybe they'll manage to scrounge a proper set of non-set gear a year in.
---
And no, I don't "greatly overestimate" the effect, nor do competent raid guilds. If a guild found out that a "Resto" Druid was secretly specced into Feral just to save on respec costs, they'd deserve a gkick. And if a properly specced Resto Druid just decided to switch into Feral in the middle of a raid for no apparent reason even if they had a gear set, they'd deserve at least a sanction. It's like arguing that a Shadowpriest simply needs to drop Shadowform to heal as well as a Holy Priest. If specs didn't matter, progression-minded people wouldn't enforce the good ones.
---
It's also absolute horseshit, 90% of what he talks about never existed in vanilla.
---
I could swore it was someone else....
---
I had no idea the division 2 even released. Will check out
---
Thank you for spoiling the outcome of the tournament... I didn't have time to watch the semi finals and finals...
---
If you do ZERO quests, it's 16,339 same-level mob kills to level 60.
---
Assuming you can skin half of them, it only adds ~3.5 hours to your total leveling time.
---
In exchange, you get AT MINIMUM (because some mobs drop more than 1 skin and the drop rate for the next tier overlaps):
---
* ~612 Ruined Leather Scraps
---
* ~900 Light Leather
---
* ~1545 Medium Leather
---
* ~1610 Heavy Leather
---
* ~3195 Thick Leather
---
* ~309 Rugged Leather
---
If you do nothing but vendor all these items, it comes out to 144g 95s 34c.
---
That's roughly 42 gold per hour.
---
Skinning is absolutely worth it.
---
Soft, milk drinkers, the lot of em.
---
I would’ve loved to play an actual hardcore against these people.
---
Probably, once they get older they'll realize video games are just games.
---
Yeah sorry you're right. There's only one guy working Sundays. I apologize for being so blind. Actually I bet there's only 6 employees total.
---
If you do some of the quest in silithus you will see lots of references to a cataclysmic event that will change the world as we see it.
---
I sound the way I sound, and — not that I want to — that’s pretty hard to change! 
---
I’d question why I should have to change the way I speak in favour of what is considered normal to not receive abuse. Not to mention that gay men *are* normal men!
---
Mop was in the lore aswell if you read the questlines
---
Layering.
---
GM teleported them to Winterspring
---
I would have fun if this is the uproar it caused. People who “grief” or troll. Don’t have fun in the act necessarily it’s fun knowing that the guy on the other wide of the screen is as butt hurt as this sub.
---
5 hours?
---
There's a guy (60 rogue) on a pserver that camped the entrance to RFD so no alliance could enter. He ganked me and my group for 4 hours and other said he'd been there every day for over two weeks.
---
Someone has been watching the duel yesterday 😂
---
Detracting from others is not against the TOS you nonce, but harassing players and same faction griefing is, I’m not gonna highlight it for you, but he did get banned for it and definitely deserved it.
---
I’d like to hear some in-game activities that detract from peoples enjoyment though, because I guarantee most of them are nothing more than straw mans that you’ll pull out to support your narrative.
---
I'm saying the tier looks like trash.
---
You're asking for things like unique pets that are unobtainable in the original vanilla wow game apart from thigns like a collectors edition?
---
This is no different to people saying "I never got to see Illidan in Black Temple" leading to huge nerfs and then eventually LFR. This mindset killed wow.
---
I would say having a p2w mechanic is a loss to those who dont want to spend money.
---
I farmed this piece of shit mount for months until I got it. Fuck that shit, never again.
---
I used sword MH and dagger OH. Did I do it wrong?
---
Just fight in a contested zone and get a guild from the other side to provide security.   During vanilla we had a few interfaction dueling contests down in STV and both sides provided security against greifers.
---
You only get pulled out of stealth from the mob hitting you. The macro *should* be fast enough to still get your opener.
---
Resilience will fix it
---
Perplexity is a god-tier rogue and pserver vet, I'm surprised to hear that about his commentary. Got any examples?
---
no thats fine
---
Red = dead was my mantra in WoW and it stems from my battle hardened soul in UO.
---
It will also be my mantra in Classic, unless I do roll Druid cause I’ll be RP’ing and won’t kill or attack another Druid/Shaman.
---
Respect brother.
---
He wasn't wrong, but he was just saying stuff to say stuff.  The worst was when Tipsout was saying things.  I have never heard of Perplexity and played a lot of private servers.
---
There are definitely "OP" classes at 30 due to half the rest missing way more important spells/talents/etc.
---
Was fun to watch though.
---
You're going to lose 1v1's to warlocks and shadow priests as a hunter much more than to mages. 
---
I played a hunter to rank 14 in vanilla.
---
Awesome.
---
Stupidest title I’ve read all day
---
Shouldn’t or at least I recall getting pulled out from resists.
---
&gt; private server players deserve to be better
---
The problem is pservers are nothing like classic, to the point it's like playing another game. Some values are wrong by 200%.
---
I never found warrior leveling all that hard.  My 2 previous classes before a warrior was Fire Mage and a Druid before they where buffed. A warrior by contrast was a walk in the park.
---
Whoever is better deserves to win
---
And here is a quote from your PServer Hero:
---
"I realize that these Values, specifically elite-mob damage, are likely correct, and Vanilla-like:" [Timestamp 26:05 in your linked Video](https://youtu.be/XL3vco2zy98?t=1565)
---
Get this into your head already:  
---
We want **CLASSIC**!  
---
Not __Classic+__, not _"Classic Mythic"_, not _"Classic optimized for self-styled Elite players"_, not _"Classic but with XYZ"_.
---
We want a game that is as close to the original, as technically possible and logistically feasible.
---
And that includes the fact, that most of the content wasn't mechanically challenging. Yes, classic is, mechanically, a very simple game. But other than some people, I have no problem with admitting, that I enjoy such simple games, where time played is more important than mechanical prowess.
---
If you are looking for a purely mechanical challenge, then Retail is your game. That's not a diss towards you, I am not using the "go back to retail!" as the childish insult it has become. **Retail WoWs PvE content at higher difficulty is, and always has been EXCELLENT.** It's the best in the industry, hands down, and it easily beats everything Classic WoW will offer you on a mechanical level.
---
-----
---
Maybe, just maybe, try to see things like this:
---
If the core principle of Classic, in this true-to-vanilla form, is a success, then MAYBE Blizzard will take notice. MAYBE they will realize, that a game that requires social play, has closed communities, is based largely on time investment, that doesn't frontload content to everyone, is a good thing, (and an exploitable market niche).
---
And MAYBE, they will design new games based on a mixture, combining the best of both worlds: The undeniable mechanical prowess of Retail, and the Feel and Ideology of Vanilla.
---
Maybe it's just me being idealistic, but I think, instead of fighting amongst each other, and trying to ruin each others experience by having our cake and not letting anyone else have a bite, that is the goal we should stand behind: A better and bigger cake we all can enjoy.
---
You're not going to tank as a hunter.
---
As opposed to the horrendous male night elf animations? Fucker looks like a damn Quaker with those body shakes and that spastic fist pump.
---
Just a rogue killing druid flag carriers...the whole video.  Is this supposed to be good?
---
i see, i never really played a tank in TBC and i didn't get super far into vanilla. thank you for the help :)
---
Are you the fucker who was being in the way? Either way, fuck off.
---
I remember in retail going up against a druid rank 14 who held rank 14 longer than anyone because it was played by multiple people.  Guy was trash tier.  I was downranking heals on our flag carrier, because he didn't deal any damage.
---
yes
---
op tried to make sure noone will find his armory  
---
plot twist: he wasn't even born when vanilla was live, read down below for his armory
---
That's a possibility that cannot be avoided. I'm talking about ones that can.

Ehh, should have looked at your comment history before choosing to engage. Have a good one man!
---
We must have this back again!

---
....classic
---
I'm a high level arena player.  Multi glad, rank 1 player.
---
Why would they take out decursive? It’s what most people used back in vanilla. Thats one of the oldest addons out there.
---
I don't understand what you are addressing with your comment.
---
The videos now are showing a window of time that isn't accurate to 2004, fixing the window so that it looks like the 2004 version, would make it look like the 2004 version. Unless you are claiming the timing is the same, and we can see it more due to lower latency and better hardware, well then we just have to keep the same tolerances artificially, this entire game is going to be Battle for Azeroth gear putting on the most convincing show possible that it is Classic WoW. For all we know, mobs are going to respawn through shards, all that matters is what we see.
---
Interesting.  Not sure what you saw from my comment history, but I'm assuming you suck at the game.
---
Good point, i actually missed that part.
---
Then I guess warlock... no thats still not it huh?
---
Hmm I'm starting to think op would be happier in retai WoW...
---
Wait a minute! He can go druid! Just go feral and switch out to heal and then back to cat or bear and mash away! 
---
Ha thats gotta be it! :)
---
exactly, the people who say this guy doesn't deserve a ban and that "this is part of the classic experience!" don't get it.
---
If this was a normal server then the community would absolutely ream this guy's ass and he'd be blacklisted from everything to the point where he'd have to change servers/rename characters etc. He'll if this guy's btag was found out, he'd probably have to make a new account to keep playing.
---
Problem is exactly like you say, the community can't hold him accountable so gm intervention is/was absolutely necessary.
---
I was so impressed at how level-headed most of the players were with this fuck doing his crap for HOURS.
---
No it’s just pretty funny how you sounded confident knowing there were a certain number of GMs working at a specific time versus realizing the fact that the people who *actually* make the big time decisions at Blizzard are definitely not working on Sunday at 5PM and no lower level employee is going to risk their ass banning a beta-flagged account for something as controversial as this and risk losing their job.
---
This took about 30 seconds to realize and understand, and now that we know that he was banned and there is proof on sodas stream that he was then we can pretty much assume that this is the case,
---
Not as unlikely as you would think.   
---
I had my account "stolen" at some point (it was right when wow accounts had to be merged into battle.net accounts, this is relevant).     
---
And by stolen I mean I was taking a break for a few months, and a friend I had on MSN messaged me saying that I wasn't replying to him in-game. It obviously wasn't me, so I rushed to see what the fuck was up.    
---
My account password had not been changed, but the account e-mail had been changed to some bizarre random jumble of letters and numbers, so I could not change the password anymore (because I needed access to that e-mail).     
---
In a stroke of brilliance (but mostly desperation), I initiated the battle.net merge procedure, and it worked just fine, I had my account back with my own password (now changed), and an extra 2 months of gametime the thief had addedd via the gametime card.
---
Let the man dream, seems fun anyway
---
I completely agree, just because you were good on a private server doesn't mean you're good on classic servers like a lot of private server players seem to think. The pool of eligible players is much smaller and the most competitive PvP players probably don't seek out private servers for their PvP fix.

Ok. I would suggest not supporting a company that does that. It's only logical for you to leave the server and not pay for a sub when it goes live. Why would you support something you dont agree with? It's the right thing to do.
---
This tournament literally showcased the best of what streamers bring to Classic and somehow people are trying to spin this into a negative to fit their narrative. It’s really pathetic and sad tbh. What an empty, angry and paranoid life to live
---
It's not gonna hurt that they set a certain amount of hours for this, they arent gonna find bugs every hour of the day. You care more about this then the actual devs do.
---
I was just doing this quest a few hours ago and thinking about the same thing.  
---
Also Tyrion Lannister reference.
---
The tourney was great, the interference was great, the faction tension was great, the GM response was great, ALL of it. The only thing that wasn't great was people crying like little babies about getting people banned. This is the game, warts and all. If a GM wants to step in an port people away, that's hilarious, but banned? Get out of here.
---
Hey thanks I know what my class role is, I don't expect to burden other people with this just my friends for fun, looking for answers to those questions and general tips. Just trying to have fun.
---
Do you have the slightest idea of how streamers act in certain cases? Ever heard of lvl1 nude runs? Stop commending hypocrisy and double standards.
---
If you're supporting the ban in this case, you're signing off the right to question most bans in the future all together. It's like free speech. But hey, it's pretty clear that none of you remember what it was like in Vanilla. "we want no changes" my ass
---
Muahahhahahhahahhah! Get rekked VideoRAM :D
---
Yeah, simply having aggro never breaks stealth, it's the attack that does it. But being that close to a mob means they'll almost immediately attack you. But Pickpocket isn't on the GCD, so your opener should have a chance to get off first.
---
This was a huge meme in the way-back days.
---
Ah I see, I just haven't noticed our bear taking significantly more damage on Ouro. Enrage is so hectic that I just pump out as many heals and shields as possible.
---
Actually exploring the world?!  A concept only is diehard wow players have really accomplished !
---
Rank 1*
---
So what if 200,001 were watching him troll on a stream?
---
So Pickpocketing levels lock picking? Good to Know!
---
At this point I’m convinced that its blizzard sending in players to make posts about how things are off compared to the old original vanilla servers because it always comes up as something that was already in the game it’s like this isn’t surprising give that warrior wind fury and it’ll go twice as fast how is this surprising?!
---
&gt;How does Distracting Strike work exactly in 1.12? Some sources say it is a Mocking Blow esque taunt. Others say it gives 600 flat threat.
---
It's a flat threat attack.  Doesn't scale with gear.
---
I know that having aggro doesn’t. I just remember being pulled on every failed pickpocket even if I sapped em first.
---
There were all druid raids back in the day.
---
I haven't subbed to or played any official MMO's for more than a month since 2010-2011 because I haven't enjoyed any of them to warrant the time sink, or none of them made me want to put in the time to put it another way.
---
I've probably logged over 100 days played on vanilla/tbc/wrath servers in the same time period, if not more. The players aren't gone, they just don't find the options very appealing.
---
I was a rank 13 druid, no need for 14 as it wasn't worth it for the stats, was awesome fun. PvE I raided as a feral spec healer and did really well, just need to spec right.
---
I’ve thought that it would be really cool for the starting classic cinematic to show your character getting killed, having a dream that clips through all the current expansions, and ends with a priest resurrecting you and you realizing that all the expansions were like nightmares that got progressively worse.
---
Lvl 30 duelling is pretty silly. It's fun to do when there's nothing else to do but don't read into it too much. I mean lvl 60 duelling is pretty silly, lvl 30 duelling is just plain dumb (but is something fun to do at least on a 30 cap server).
---
Easier said than done, especially if you get jumped on. Once a frost mage starts hugging you to death it's really hard to get away because of all the slows and roots, and in that situation you can get blitzed very fast.
---
Why not inside with Air Conditioning. Fuck the heat man I live in a desert. It’s hot in the winter.
---
It was removed for a reason. The old API is more powerful and enabled too much automation. It 100% will not be restored to the original 1.X state, given how many more people will abuse it now in ways that Blizzard didn't want you doing even in Vanilla.
---
I don't think you're going to win. The 12 year olds are out in force today and they don't seem to understand anything other than streamer good anything against streamer bad.
---
There's already a working beta update for Clique and Tidy Plates is not the only nameplate addon with aggro indication. :-) Check out [https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/) for more.

---
I dont get why people say chance would have won. Snutz went 2-0 against him, so even if chance won the 2nd dual, he would have had CD anymore for the 3rd one, and would have lost it just as he lost the last game. It would just have been a 2-1 instead of 2-0, or am i missing something?
---
I'm gonna disagree, the original looks absolutely brutal for chopping. There many historical examples of swords that are curved inward for that express purpose, the [Kopis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopis) and [Falcata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcata) to name a couple. And Zin'rokh was seemingly intended to be that direction as evidenced by the fact that the bevel is much more pronounced on the inward side.
---
The skill ceiling for tanks is really high in vanilla. Everything from using consumables (ranging from buffs to offensive ones like grenades/OOI) to having multiple sets of gear tailored to different situations.
---
Also taking on responsibility makes it much more rewarding.
---
Does this reference the amazing SCAT man video?
---
I see, in that case, do you think it's good to use at the beginning of a pull?
---
Good lord. You are the cringiest dude I have ever met. 
---
Congrats on being an asshole in a video game, I guess?
---
[If this was harry potter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeBpIdOrlzU)

There was no traditional mouseover in vanilla afaik.
---
There were, however, workarounds that basically acted like it, but I'm not sure whether you could keep CPs on your target as a rogue that way.
---

---
No, low skill floor.

---
With enough words you're putting in my mouth you can write a book!
---
This fascist is quite the attention seeker!
---
&gt; That's just an absurd argument that doesn't address the topic at hand
---
It is precisely to your point, and you clearly cannot counter it. They can bundle as many things as they want into the subscription, but nothing beyond WoW Classic gives me any value.
---
You could make your same exact argument for a Blizzard Subscription that included every Blizzard game for 100$/month. "You're getting more than ever before and it's your own fault if you don't want to play them. It's not a cafeteria!" Do you see how your argument is nonsensical?
---
It's the very same exploitative tactic that cable companies use when they bundle a million useless channels with the one you actually watch just to extort more money out of you.
---
Fair point.
---
The funeral in Vanilla was pretty damn douchy as well--not banned for it.
---
Streamers have been doing massive "lvl1 naked runs" disrupting/griefing other players on a much more severe level than one fucking Tauren, even causing server crashes--no bans for it.
---
There were literal recepies for how to stunlock and prolong the annoyance for world PvP instead of killing them off-- not banned for it.
---
Corpse camping were a literal way to act out revenge on players, people did it every day in Vanilla - - not banned for it.
---
I can go on and on here, and even point out that the tournament ended up being arranged in a bugzone, that they had to wallclip to get into, clearly an exploit, and no one bat's an eye? Why? "it's beta, they're testing bugs"? Show me one guy streaming who reported that bug then. ONE GUY. Please show me.
---
I'd rather argue that godtrollx was testing bugs, the bugs where classic gets filled with salty entitled streamers who don't have the insight to realize that a lot of their streaming career is consisting of doing similar things that they are screaming "BAN Him" for right now. Hypocrites.
---
High effort content right there. Good form!
---
I might explore the wonders of the outside world. Or play some league of legends wich Ive been doing for way to long against my will because there is no good game to play.
---
Gl weaving melee and ranged attacks in raids. Let me know how that works out for you
---
You are a warlock, just kill them both.
---
First off he wasn't banned. I didn't watch this tournament or know any of these streamers but a quick search on the forums confirms he was just ported by a GM. Secondly, he should not be banned for this and there have been much worse trolls than this back in vanilla. The ruined funeral comes to mind.
---
streamer drama.
---
Zzz
---
On retail, I use OPie for everything shapeshift related (it's a customizable radial menu) which works great but it seems there's no information yet of OPie is ported to classic. :-/
---
That's great for most people. But for me $180/year (or whatever) for a 15 year-old game is just nowhere near good enough.
---
It is beta, they can ban anyone on beta because it is privilege to be there. Also a big even like that is a showcase for many people what the game is like. 
---
Now imagine they showcase something like fishing and it would be a big deal, like "look at this cool thing we are implementing". There is a 100k people watching how they showcase fishing and how will it work only to have 1 trollgod keep sitting on the fishing float(or whatever it is called). It is just an analogy but it is pretty much the same.
---
Would also be really cool to see diffrent dueling locations.
---
And on every cd that you can if you plan on tanking. GL in your endeavor and may god have mercy on your friends, those poor saps.
---
Oh don't worry, here in Finland it's the same.

Late August is cold rain, hail, cold fog, and sometimes early snow up here.

I can relate to this. I'm even making a pro/con's list on Male or Female chars, and which animation is better.

Keep with the stupid comments.  It’s easy to speak nonsense over and over.
---
No, I'd use aimshot-&gt;Distracting shot. That was my goto for kiting in Vanilla if I had time before the pull.
---
I remember getting "The Explorer" during Lich King...one of the few good uses of the Achivement system.
---
Not sure if trolling or serious.
---
So what MMOs will you be playing instead?
---
Haha im exactly the opposite. Love the game and do not gove a damn about all the bullshit analysis or strawpolls what class we should roll. Just play the game. Nice try tho
---
It doesn't, but you get junkboxes from mobs that you open via lockpicking.
---
Yes MoD is a must for any spec imho. It’s great for PvP and for scouting/CCing and picking pockets in PvE.
---
Exactly!
---
My first thoughts reading this were - until they made Trammel and ruined things.
---
Not sure what the OPs idea was with the post, but at least I got some nice nostalgic memories.

Heater on? Ill just close my computer room door and let the computers and monitor heat the room right up.

So what you're saying is, you did take damage?

I love you both

Ah nice. Rogue just stepped up on the ladder in my head which class I should play :D

---
In addition, I would note that Skinning comes online much much faster because you don't have to wait for auction houses, and can actually BENEFIT from a crowded server where you are fighting over real estate (you get to skin your own tags and a lot of the time, other peoples, whereas that purely hurts herbalism. 
---
The ease of coming online is espeically important for gold starved starting classes, like my beloved human warrior. Between throwing weapon proficiency, a weapon to throw, 5 2 handed weapon proficiencies, the mail chest you won't get from quest rewards unless you go to loch modan, or the chain gloves you don't want to  rely on the collector's gold schedule quest to get at level ~10.... there's a lot of stuff to buy. Especially if hamstring kiting doesn't work in wow classic and you have to face tank every mob.
---
In short, money every time you hit goldshire  is much more impactful than money tomorrow, when you check the auction house. 
---
And beyond that, Skinning is very easy on bag space, because if you start running out of space you can just stop skinning, there will always be more mobs... and it also lets you completely clear your bags out every time you hit a vendor, instead of having 1 malachite, 2 tin ore, and 5 copper ore that are not worth mailing but you don't want to vendor. 
---
I tried leveling a warrior to 12 without skinning, and dear god was it painful, just to how little money I had, and how Desperately lacking my gear was up to westfall. 
---
It doesn't seem like a lot, but if you just grind levels 5-7 on wolves and boars, when you are still powerful enough to kill stuff easily (due to rend not being massively underleveled yet), that's like 150 mobs, which is like 15 silver in skinning mats. 15 silver is a LOT for a level 7 warrior on a fresh account. Specifically, it's enough to purchase a gladius and staff proficiency.
---
I think they might have responded with what they look forward to play. Myself I answered holy paladin, because I want to be a healer. That said I will level as retribution.
---
Well of course.

Yea but with classic? I can't imagine that would stress your average system enough for it to put out all that much heat.
---
Attacking someone's character does nothing for your argument, and just makes you look stupid. (Hey Mr Trump!)
---
I dunno. It just doesn't seem as cosy.
---
I think I am undervaluing aimed shot, since I can't use it while actually tanking. But that does sound like the highest possible pull threat.
---
Wait.. what’s in this reference to?
---
Are you sure? It was very standard back in the day, raiding would be very different without it.
---
Show me the official bluepost, or something directly from blizzard stating that this BETA (I don't think you realize what beta means in gaming terms) was actually a PR event. Show me that post explaining that when you join THIS beta, there's going to be different rules than any other beta. I don't give two flying fucks about what it is being treated as, or what you can theorize it to be, I want actual official evidence.
---
If not, then your reply is a moo point.
---
And let's for the fun of it, assume this beta is an official pr event. How do you think a game company feels about their official promoters actively exploiting bugs, seeking out wallclipping, and so on, live on stream... Without even as much as a single report? Why aren't you answering this? I said it previously as well, but you've conveniently missed that part of my post. Cherry picking much?
---
The best tree for levelling is combat though.
---
get back in the healer boat, druid boi
---
See, I was a shaman main vanilla lol,
---
At first I wanted to kinda "relive" things but I couldn't make up my mind. Skipping the whole "hunter -&gt; warlock" step I went through, I'm pretty sure I've settled on playing a healer again. I think I've ruled out druid, but I'm totally stuck between Shaman, Priest and Pally.
---
I think I like the *idea* of Pally the most since I've never really played alliance and they're the "mirror" of shaman, so it'd be a new but similar experience I think, with all the buffs and stuff. But I recall that leveling them is torture, especially if you don't have friends. 
---
So I'll probably roll a Pally first and ragequit when I get nowhere and then just make a priest or shaman lol. So it really comes down to new experience vs nostalgia for me I guess.
---
This'll probably sound silly, but this has actually been super helpful for me. I couldn't really decide on what I was going to do before, but explaining it to someone has kinda helped. So thanks.
---
Maybe it will be a wake up call to some
---
I'm quite sure the overall story of MoP wasn't planned from launch, but ofc pandaren have been a mythical and fun race since Wc3 with some quests about them or referencing them since vanilla.
---
Yeah bud really toxic for someone to corpse camp a trammy like you
---
who... who has said this? I've been on the subreddits for classic fairly regularly for a while and never seen anyone make that kind of claim
---
The same can be said about the people that cock ride the streamers, they want everything to be perfect or they will start crying about TOS and the 100k people which don't really matter in this context, talk about pathetic and sad.
---
HUH!
---
What the fuck did I just read
---
instead of playing the faction everyone else is on she forces you to pick
---
yep....*sips*... sounds like a wife
---
?????  I thought he had a way better idea of what was going on than tips and probably 99% of the people watching and really didn't miss much.  Can you elaborate more on what he could've done better?
---
This is also ignoring cross faction collusion which is against the spirit of vanilla. Blizzard went out of their way to nix it in vanilla, we can expect them to do the same in Classic.
---
I think Devilsaur Mafia will remain a pserver thing.

ITT: people who love E-Sport vs people who hate E-Sport arguing over two little children
---
I forgot, your build doesn't have aimshot.  Use multishot-&gt;DS.  Not as good as aimshot, but with a good weapon it's not bad.
---
That doesn't make any sense what so ever, considering druid is one of the top 3 levelers in the game, and mage has tools to escape bad situations or even kite certain elites.  
---
Yea, even back when the game came out, people had already known that warrior was at quite the leveling disadvantage in regards to time spent.
---
I'm hoping it puts off any potential crybabies. Stick to Anthem, or something, where you're barely allowed to interact with other people.
---

---

---
&gt; Yeah, the point where layers are disabled is the point prices for the pre-bis items will be reasonable because there's not much demand. 
---
From what I've read, Blizz has said they are thinking weeks, not months, for merging layers currently. There's still gonna be a lot of people looking for pre-bis in the first month or two.
---
If layers stick around I can see your point, but the current plan isn't set to have that happen.
---
While i Agree. Lock are actually just fine. They are 4th dps by a bit at start (but they scale where they still are 4th but often catch up to the pack. 
---
Now hunters start strong, but scale a total of 30% from MC to Naxx. End up &lt;75% of mage and warrior dps. 
---
And no one else does near even hunter damage (a GREAT power shifting cat can do a  bit more than the other hybrids). So all others are stuck at healing only. That is just bad design.  Hunters prob should do a small bit more 5-10% end game and at least a single dps spec for hybrids should hit like 65%, verses many are at &lt;50%.  Druids should be tank viable (just add like 2 (?, think that would do it) more leather items with defense on it). Warriors will still be top but at least a druid could do it without being much worse.
---
Lets look at our hybrid buddies. 
---
Feral adds 3% melee crit. that doesn't equal a total of 13% damage for each of its member who also now have to be warriors or rogues. Its main uses is off tank, and to give just the tank group 3% melee crit for more threat (consider one for this reason alone). 
---
Boomkins are add 3% spell crit to group (any group with 100% crit damage casters) arguably more dps given than feral but no option to off tank. Still inveterate, Brez, and off healing can be a thing.  Odd can do damage but cost too much mana.  There is a secret to Boomkins also. They actually do damage, if you pot, rune, and down rank. You'll see them in classic. Is it the top four dps no. But it beats out everything but hunter and adds a nice amount to locks and mages.
---
Shamans are SoL. Their totems are all given by resto. Enh is low dps like real low, hanging out with ret low. Elemental dps is better but way too oom.
---
The madder someone gets the more fun it it to gank him. That is lesson 1 against bullying in elementry school.
---
Ah, that makes more sense.
---
Gz to him, he really is a great player.
---
Horrible event to try and watch though, couldn't watch more than 10 minutes with tipsout lackluster commentary and involuntary jumping around.
---
Let's just put it this way:
---
Who, What, How, Where you are in real life, matters less than nothing to me.
---
To me you are your character. I will call you by your ingame Moniker. To me you are not Andy, Chris, or Jamal, you are "Taskalor, the Dwarf Paladin" or whatever you play. And I won't be \*\*\*, I will be "Cadrazk, the Warlock". We know each other because we ventured into Scholomance together and shared blood and sweat defeating Darkmaster Gandling.
---
That is part of the feel of classic for me.
---
Streamer drama? I think that is just affecting the people watching it.
---
Modern UO (and UO-likes) is pretty much just the MMORPG equivalent of PUBG. You run around with a bunch of groupies trying to find a smaller fish to gank. Everyone uses maximum cost efficient items, most people only ever do PvE content in order to get gold so they can deathmatch later, and all the fun and adventure has been optimized out of the game.
---
So yes, it would be absolutely insufferable in modern streamer culture. Sandbox PvP MMOs will never return to their old glory. Their mechanics are simply not resistant enough to players "solving" the game, and the solution to this is viewed by many as being antithetical to the game (because it would involve removing the players' freedom to play it like a big deathmatch).
---
In a way, these games evolved from traditional MMORPGs into DayZ, which then evolved into battle royale games... I really do love this parallel, not least because I'm sure it makes many of the more fanatical UO players seethe.
---
You won't be able to hold threat with your melee attacks. Your dps friends will pull aggro a lot, even from your pets. You can try it - good luck!
---
Active, as in cancer cells spreading through the body, all you're going to see is LULW and POG

There was proof early he was just moved, lmfao

---
Also, never in the history of WoW has anyone needed a CEO's decision to suspend a player. At worst they'd need a senior (supervisor) and they weren't comfortable they'd talk to a lead GM which would have the same hours as their team.
---
Maybe you should use those 30 seconds you talked about and ask yourself why they'd need a higher up's permission to perform a day to day task.
---
Your first sentence is hilarious for personal reasons that you'd never believe me on so I won't say. :)
---
Its only streamers
---
ahahhahaha can relate
---
Chance shouldve won that snutz game. And I think chance was the best player out there. So yeah
---
Hold up. Don't mouse over macros in vanilla still swap targets for a moment? Meaning you still lose combo points? 
---
Cause if thats not how it is now thats a gret buff to rogues.
---
Yeah that’d be sweet, and if they just randomly did it with no announcement that would be awesome too
---
Blizzard never admitted they lost any data. They said the challenge of making Classic was translating the original Vanilla data they had into something that would work on their new engine and server architecture. Now you're just making shit up.
---
Swifty was smart for creating the in-combat charge macro in vanilla. Which gave him a competitive edge. This was addressed by Blizzard as “a good use of in game mechanics.”
---
I'm just saying, you implied that warriors were everywhere in vanilla throughout its lifetime but they were WAY more common in 1.12 and servers that opened after 1.10 in general. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if something like 20% of the level 60s in classic are warriors, if not more.
---
Tab targeting or macros are hard huh? Especially for these top level pvpers. Hard concepts.
---
This post is so true it deserves an award =)
---
Same faction griefing is not the same thing as wPvP. If someone is ganking you and camping you, there is a PvP solution.
---
There isn't really a solution for someone on your faction griefing you besides reporting them. Its literally why the report function exists at all.
---
Before WoW was released, most people discussed just these expansions before they were even announced. The comeback of Deathwing, Illidan and Outlands, Lich King etc. Because they were such big events or characters, all of them being kind of cliff hangers of their own since Wc3.
---
Even if the story wasn't written in stone or complete, I'm 100% sure they had an overall idea and the plotlines finished.
---
Warriors are never a good 1v1 class, yeah you can beat some rogues and enhs if you outgear but in a vacuum it's the worst duel class.
---
Anyone know if server transfers will be a thing? 
---
Right now im living abroad for the next year, and i want to roll on the local servers. Any idea if i could transfer to NA when i move back? I wouldnt mind paying a fee. Thanks!
---
Druid does have some really good class quests, then again, I think almost every class in vanilla has at least one awesome class quest in their experience.
---
I mean, it is [possible](https://youtu.be/cmhVQLfSrUo) ... Just not recommended.
---
Cheeky.
---
One of them got screwed by scatter shotting an alliance bystander instead of his oppononent.
---
Do I download classic addons on the twitch app?
---
Not sure about berserker rage yet because beta warriors don't have it, but they can be blinked out of like a stun..
---
Why do you use such stupid language to describe my behavior?  Do you know what a fascist is?   You just use words to sound a certain way, and it demonstrates your lack of intelligence.  Good night.  Your brain kind of sucks, which is too bad because the brain is the best thing a human has going for it.  You’ve degraded to a troll, and lost long ago.  Exemplifying a sore loser.
---
Feel for Sodapoppin. Would have had a good chance to win the entire thing had his final duel not been interrupted by being feared out of the duel area
---
Well, you weren't "sapping them first" in Vanilla because without the deep Sub talent "Improved Sap", Sap always pulls you out of stealth. And even with the talent, you still have a 10% chance of being pulled out of stealth.
---
Yeah, you’re thinking the opposite; oh well.
---
Only 16.3 k samelevel mobskill till max level. That is less than I expected.
---
Why do this idiots get beta invites?
---
This is kind of how it works in retail. they added this curreny called titan residum, you could get this currency by scrapping azerite gear at a certain ilvl. But you couldn’t stockpile items aquired pre to this Patch to get this currency, only obtained azerite gear after the Patch hit could reward you with titan residum.
---
I can’t see why Blizz couldn’t do this with disenchanting.
---
Let me reiterate that:
---
Everyone and his grandmother STARTED playing a warrior long before 1.12, because by that point, everyone had been pounded into the ground by an MS warri with good gear at least once.
---
How many of these hopefuls made it to 60, I cannot say.
---
Its not a incap. Its a stun wich breaks on damage if not mistaken. Classic is weird and I love it.
---
I somehow read "alcoholic" and because of his struggles he couldn't decide on what to play...
---
Where can I watch this?
---
you're correct but people just say slow MH cause usually the correlation means more dmg. i dont think anybody would purposefully go for a weaker, slower weapon. even for hemo
---
I think your missing my point, the only thing I'm wondering is what actual fact would have made chance win 2 games in a row. He would have won the one if he didn't get feared, OK, but he would have lost the other one exactly the same he did during the rematch...
---
It was 1-1 after first two games, 3rd game was the one chance went all in on cds (Dragonling, NS, Trinket) 
---
[vod of fear](https://youtu.be/lhaHKbXjTCQ?t=740)
---
Yeah no one has ever said this
---
Hey man, it’s a game, and if people enjoy roleplaying or whatever then that’s cool too
---
If you want to be the chad druid then just do it m8
---
Don’t listen to the “No, you can’t do it” comments. If your guild is supportive enough you can pull of some crazy shit. Spell powered warriors, poison spec’ed rogues with nature spell dmg, arcane powered hunters, holy dps priests+retr paladin combo, everything can work up to half of AQ40 and he’ll... even up to naxx (we had a spell powered warrior who did 1.1k dps at Sapphiron). 
---
As for hunter tanking ... our guild used one into Onyxia and some bosses in MC when we speed running those at end of vanilla wow. It is viable and possible but you will need a shit tons of consumables and a raid composition that will support your dreams. Dwarf hunters for fear ward, dedicated 2 priest healers on you and a guild to pass you some tanking items. 
---
I was fortunate enough to keep contacts with my old guildies and everyone will return to have a weird ride, as none will be playing in a conventional way. We aim to support as a main tank a paladin who had that dream from back in vanilla.
---
Hunters can't tank.  IF you want to tank as a hunter you're better off with your pet doing the tanking because they can tank some 5 man stuff if you outlevel it.
---
I thought Snutz went 2-0, my bad then.
---
Couldn't you just have the duels in a contested zone where there was only one entrance to the area and have a police force stand inbetween to kill any trolls trying to enter?
---
RABBLE!
---
“Normal man”..? Cmon dude.
---
rip goodboy points :(
---
"Anyone can tank, not everyone should." It's true.
---
I've seen this video before, but it's not from the hunters perspective, information (except about the players reputation) has been difficult for me to find.
---
&gt;That doesn't make any sense what so ever, considering druid is one of the top 3 levelers in the game,
---
Druids were shit levelers in early vanilla wow.  They were buffed later on.
---
&gt; and mage has tools to escape bad situations or even kite certain elites.
---
Yes, frost mages are amazing kiters.  I on the other hand was leveling a fire mage as my first toon and was busy doing stupid shit like trying to kite around elites 5 levels above my toon, or opening with pyroblast on boss fights with a pally tank and dying all the fucking time for it.  
---
&gt;Yea, even back when the game came out, people had already known that warrior was at quite the leveling disadvantage in regards to time spent.
---
Leveling a warrior is hard when you don't know how to do it.  It's easy if follow the correct path: Fight only green level mobs, level alchy/herbing for endless HP pots that you work into your rotation, and use cleave/multi-strike on multiple mobs to increase leveling speed.  I certainly leveled much faster on a warrior than I did on a druid or mage.  I found the class to be engaging, PvP friendly, and lots of fun to level.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=399
---
Maybe hit level cap and actually play the game then.
---
Or if you were on k3 then sucks to suck
---
I dont necessarily disagree with you but the 'private server people' aren't invited to the beta so who knows
---
Your values are way off, if you skin and vendor at the rugged leather level you get 40g/h - 40g per hour of skinning, mind you. For lower level leathers it lower, obviously. You can read the below post for some info.
---
TLDR: It's not worth to skin while leveling.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a1vrt6/on_skinning_for_gold_while_leveling/
---
Its actually super logical to take it down. Be patient and check out tips’ youtube.
---
A WoW style strictly enforced (ie. can't attack members of your own faction, can't have most friendly interactions with members of the opposing faction) faction system is actually really good from a game design perspective.
---
It ensures you will always have lots of reds to PvP with, but it also ensures that you will always have lots of strangers you can have non-antagonistic interactions with. This fixes one of the main problems I have with sandbox PvP games, which is that aside from combat you basically never interact with anyone outside of your guild.
---
I played Eve Online for years and I can count on one hand the number of times I had a non-antagonistic random interaction with a stranger in that game. Think inviting a passer-by to a party in WoW and doing a couple of quests with them. That never happens in Eve or any game like it, because chances are every passer-by you invite will be plotting with their corpmates on Teamspeak how best to kill you.
---
Not all gay people have it but the ones that have gay voice arent doing it conciously. There isn't a point in your life where you decide oh i'm gonna talk girly now.
---
Most people aren't going to be acting spergs like Asmond and Soda's chat. There will be that handful like there was in the dueling tourney today. If you noticed, it was like 5 people out of a couple hundred. A small % of the players there. It is highly doubtful that any of those players will even play the game long enough to get to 60 either. Of the ones that do get 60, they wont really be affecting your gameplay unless you are directly associated with the streamers activities. So I wouldn't worry about catching cancer.
---
Why do they deserve to be better? Do you think these retail players that get rank one gladiator every season and win Blizzcon or other big tournaments don't put in as much work to become good players?
---
Just because they regret doing something, doesn't mean it won't be in classic. 
---
See also: The honor system.
---
I'll try to get footage for you the next time I run around pickpocketing and get resisted, but until then, you can just take my word for it that it doesn't happen.
---
Yeah I'm noticing that with my melee attacks I just go OOM before I can build any solid threat. They're not very strong.
---
Is there auto-loot in vanilla options?
---
Abilities like Sinister Strike function purely off Weapon Damage, not DPS. In most cases, two weapons of similar ilvl will have a similar DPS, however the "slower" weapon variant has a higher Top End Damage, and benefits much more from such abilities.
---
The hypothetical 1H Sword you mention would very likely be much higher in ilvl and Level Requirement, for your arguments sake, yes the hypothetical would be better.
---
TL:DR - Slower Main Hands = Better synergy with rogue abilities compared similar weapons of same ilvl.
---
You understand that competing at high level pvp is another way of testing bugs as well, right? So narrow minded. These dudes have been farming dungeons and testing skills/abilities and spell batching server tech out constantly for the whole beta, but the excessive sodium levels in your blood is blinding you from that fact.
---
Vanilla, no.
---
Classic, yes.
---
it’s not a buff? always been like that.
---
Interesting. And good to know.
---
It sucks to be spoiled but I would guess you were downvoted as you did it to yourself really. Not a good idea to come here when theres a 100% chance it would be talked about. Should have waited.
---
We won’t really find out for a while.. all the multiglad retail guys rolled horde, while the pserver guys ended up alliance. So no opportunity to see any 1v1’s in a controlled environment yet. Next week I assume we will see the pserver guys clean up in the alliance duel tourney.
---
I would love to see a duel series with venruki vs perplexity. Would be some incredible matches no doubt.. hopefully it’s something we get to see eventually.
---
So they had everything for patch 1.12, which means they had everything we'll be playing.
---
Thanks for the proof.
---
This is something you just pulled out of your ass.
---
You gotta understand dps numbers in vanilla. 2% dps less or more won't be game changer tho. Just play whatever you enjoy most. Remember there are no barbers/transmo.
---
Can we all just take a second, and appreciate the beauty of this incredibly cool video?
---
Your guild sounds fun. I have never heard of a spell power warrior, I'll have to look that one up.
---
Any ally going to Onyxia will value that belt.
---
“more dps? give me sec and let me just shift up to rank 8 frostbolt here.”
---
Perplexity casting was excellent but yeah tips missed so much stuff.
---
Yeah I chuckled a bit when the release date was announced. Classic "summer" hehe. I guess it's still summer somewhere, and it sounds better than Classic Fall.
---
Works amazing for a lot of bossfights. That’s exactly where it’s coming from.
---
Nor should you ever have to change anything to appeal to straight people or “normal men” 🙄. That was a really ignorant question. 
---
I wouldnt worry too much op. Those youre in voice with will likely be guildies and such. The game will be full of “edgy” teenagers  and toxic people but bad experiences should be few and far between. Hopefully if you do find bad encounters you can still enjoy Azeroth and report if any harassment occurs.
---
Make sure you update the game every time before you start driving
---
Outswimming guards in BB
---
Perplexity was casting, moo is on better,tribe is,uhd is lolll
---
"Oooh bitch all these rules!!!"
---
I would literally die laughing if he said this during the raid leaders boss strategy
---
So you came on the classic wow reddit before you saw it? More fool you, dude
---
All I can do is base it off how it currently is, I'm not even going to try and predict what's going to happen when it comes to classic 2.0, too many emotions and hype.
---
I don't think anybody thinks pserver players are somehow better at dueling than retail players (Well maybe pserver dudes thinks). Farming devilsaur leather for 10 years in a row doesn't make them somehow superior at the game.
---
He's saying it takes 3 seconds to skin a mob. Maybe in Vanilla it does because there's no autoloot, but in Classic there is, so it's just 1.5 seconds.
---
That brings his estimate to 46 to 60 gold per hour, which is right in my estimate.
---
So you came on the classic wow reddit before you watched it? Bad move, dude
---
I wish.  Blizzard won't let me in.
---
No thistle tea? Didn’t see any paladins. Banned?
---
Slower 2H also work better with the internal Windfury CD for Enhancement Shamans as well.
---
Druid banned or layered when he played claak it was seren.
---
Circa 200k twitch viewers
---
Sure have at it bro:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUXdcrSbIho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUXdcrSbIho)
---
It’s true I watched some guys overview of classes in vanilla and on almost every single class hed say they were “easy to learn, hard to master”. People say it so much about every class.
---
Most of what I'm hoping to do is level 60 dungeons, so the pet won't be useful by then. However with Intimidation and growl I might be using both myself and my pet to tank, tag team style. Pet Tanking is boring, I guess I could eyes of the beast and pretend I'm a druid.
---
My all time favourite would be Phytoblade - a sword that require Herbalism to be able to equip it.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=2263
---
I think it would have been far better if all continents had zeppelin/boats like Northrend. It's fast enough while keeping this feeling of travelling to another place. 
---
I know that they made portals much "cheaper" in modern WoW lore to fit with gameplay but the world does feel smaller to me with portals.
---
Note: I mean instant mage portals, not the Dark Portal which is obviously different.
---
I actually disagree here.  I would never be a prick to anyone in real life cause that’s just not me. But being able to frustrate someone over a video game gives a weird sense of satisfaction. I suppose because it’s just a game
---
"I wouldnt mind paying a fee" - Activision hears you loud and clear xD
---
Definitely not banned
---
That's what I figured. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people are actually gearing for slower weapons specifically based on hearing the "slow MH fast OH" thing.
---
You are thinking about it incorrectly. Check this video out, it explains it:

Hi, /u/Dontfrown
---
Chat is going so fast that no one will ever know that I dont have a gag reflex but unfortunately have never sucked a cock
---
I do understand that! Yeah I actually know what you mean, like some kind of pirate city where lots of things are happening underground and in hidden places ? Thinking about it, I think I'd put it that way for my view: You're venturing out into the world to get stronger and fight the enemies of the world, and when you come back to the city you wanna feel like you're safe. For me it's the place where heroes roam around attending certain business, crafting armors, resting and partying. I like having that take place in a safe place where you feel like relaxing and meeting your friends at the inn !
---
i live in Scotland, the weather changes it's mind every hour, it was sunny when i got up, it was blowing a gale and now it's pissing down...at least it's warm enough that it won't snow, but staying in playing classic sounds good.
---
That was basically my point.
---
Except the grenades are slightly worse, everyone can use a potion regardless of whether or not you have alchemy. Only engineers can use grenades.
---
It's 100% fine if everyone knows the rules in advance but in a normal duel it would be just as weird to use a grenade as it would be to use a free action pot, or a shadow protection pot etc.
---
Ven actually had tab issue as well, not sure it was super impactful though
---
Why do you want to play Balance in PvE?
---
And they're all alliance
---
It's funny, in Eve online I was jumped by a ganker in a PvE outfitted farming ship while in the middle of being shot at by tons of mobs.  I'd always hated the run away when someone pops in local mentality, so I decided to see what would happen.  I managed to kill the person who trapped me, and came pretty damn close to escaping 5 ships he cynoed in(I was about 5km away from getting out of their warp jammer)  I thought it was a fine fight.  
---
My nullsec guild kicked me because I'd fucked up their win/loss ratio in terms of isk for the monthly with the loss.  I didn't care about the money, I'd already made 5 times that much from casual farming.  I was happy for the content, but win/loss isk ratio was all that mattered to the guild, not fun fights.
---
IIRC it was not planned, but MoP had the advantage of being an absolutely fresh slate that was completely outside the storyline of Warcraft really. I think it shows that the writers had a huge chance to get creative, use some great Eastern inspiration, and write original stories. The only thing that was clunky was the tie-ins to the greater WoW story sometimes to wrap up the expac. It's great because they didn't have the burden of Warcraft I/II/III stories to be true to.
---
Please tell me there's a way to tie the soundeffects volume to your pedal as well
---
I'd like to know if the lvl 50 class quests are in at launch too
---
That has nothing to do with what he said tho
---
Oh you're right, my mistake. I was thinking about it incorrectly.
---
Looks nice dude, for every one person who complains about it, imagine how many will actually use it.
---
Keep it up
---
Yup, it is, but it's nothing compared to the higher levels. There's a reason it's estimated it will take 6 months to reach level 60, if you are casual and only play a couple hours a week.
---
Forget managing 40 people :D
---
Simply getting TWO people to click on my fuckin summoning portal and not move for a second was harder than any of the fights.
---
Marvelous.
---
No probs.  Hwy is your autism debilitating or can you like get a job and socialize?
---
totally agree here
---
This is probably the most excited he’s been in wow in a really long time.. and he’s probably been rank 1 every season for years and dabbled in some mythic raiding and high keystones.
---
Ah, the ol' "you proved me wrong, so I'm just going to insult you now" gambit. Let's see how it plays out.
---
Hmm, does that stack with Aquatic Form I wonder.
---
You actially believe that? Look at their screenshot. This is lfd
---
Well rank 1 CC is an instant slow. Rank 1 blizz a cheap aoe slow. Rank 1 buffs are good against shamans to trick them to dispell which is a good trade manawise.
---
Can see enemy flag carrier in warsong gultch 
---
Zone text on Classic beta is not coloured. 
---
Take Elewyn forest for example, you finish the premilnery quests and head to Goldshire. When you reach Goldshire the text that pops up in the middle of your screen should be green like the colour of the zone represented in the top right mini-map. Instead on the Classic beta the text is white but mini-map is green.
---
(Sams goes for hostile areas: red and neutral:yellow)
---
So I did provide 1) the original account's login credentials, 2) the original account's e-mail address, and 3) my last name was part of the original account's name, so it was a further point of connection between my primary account (which is registered to my name) and the original account. 
---
Now, mind you that recovering the original account's login credentials and email was a pain because it was linked to a 14 year old yahoo e-mail, but by some grace of god I managed to backtrack through over a decade of e-mail addresses and managed to log into and recover the yahoo email, which was still active, which let me log into the original account. From there, recovering the characters and merging it with my primary was easy.
---
Lolol thank you
---
&gt;What are you going to do with 4 hunters man?
---
This killed me. I have a friend who does this shit and he always has multiple alts of the same class AND race. Nick, what the hell do you need 3 warriors and 3 mages for?
---
Why do Private server players deserve to be better? Thats like saying I bet 100 dollars and someone bet 10 so I deserve to win. If they were better they would have won. That being said, idk why so many people are making a big deal over a lvl 30 dueling tourney. This probably will never happen again unless blizzard doesn't raise the lvl cap soon.
---
It was never almost. The guy is true to his word.
---
Ffxiv, gw2, rust, killing floor 2, the same things I play along with retail and play alongside classic when it's out.
---
Gotta diversify
---
Well, to be fair, chances are wether wouldn't have been "summer-ish" even if they released it Mid-July or something like that. Maybe to the Folks in Kings Landing (Helsinki), but up here, summer is usually a few days between the cold of Spring, and the Cold of Autumn :D
---
&gt;Nobody thought that Mages would make it very far.
---
huh? frost mages are one of the top pvp specs in the game, and when you take a skilled player like venruki behind one it wasn't really a suprise he would make it far.
---
Spreading word that someone is a griefer, thereby preventing them from meaningfully doing any group content on the server.
---
Seren would have got waxed by Chuck regardless, Shaman counter spriest at that level.
---
Snowflakes not conditioned for real classic
---
Makes it even easier to abuse the system, because now I can not just scam the other classes, I can screw over my buddies in the same class as well by bidding behind their back.
---
Private server
---
Tbf, if you had all the time in the world you could do a league and have everyone duel everyone with a point total to determine the winner.
---
 Incapacitate differs from Stun in that Incapacitate effects always break on damage, while Stun effects don't.
---
Minimal effort: standing your tauren or mount on a mailbox....
---
He did it the whole fucking tournament. Mistakes happen.
---
Seren kited into the crowd &amp; would have got crushed eventually. The amount of autos chuck put into him means his WF proc really weren't that out of the ordinary tbh
---
That’s some next level griefing. I have always wondered if someone could get someone black listed when they are actually completely innocent.
---
If you try to DPS in raids as a Druid, yes, you will regret not being a Hunter, Mage, Rogue, Warlock, or Warrior.
---
If you try to Tank in raids as Druid, yes, you will regret not being a Warrior.
---
If you try to Heal in raids as a Druid, yes, you will regret not being a Paladin, Priest, or Shaman.
---
Druids have a place in PVP, especially premade BGs and especially especially WSG. They were mediocre in end-game PVE at everything compared to other classes and in some areas, downright awful. You bring one buff (of the Wild) and two spells to a raid (Innervate and BRez), that's really it.
---
you still have sheep, frost nova, blink, iceblock, coc and more at lvl 30, the class is still solid at those levels.
---
If he won the one he was feared out of that was it done, that would have made it 2-1. And that series was best of 3.
---
Yeah that's far more plausible than 'just putting in a ticket'.
---
Oh yeh, forgot about that simple yet effective one
---
I only ran UBRS once in Vanilla. Got a felstriker on my rogue.
---
In aq the red mount dropped off the first mob and I rolled 100.
---
I mean it's just the way people are now, I'm glad he did it, and there will be more people and probably way worse
---
14 years, and some people still don't know this?

Camera is now clippped inside the Joker and his mount, and you can click the mailbox. Works no matter how many jokers there are.
---
Well, that's the whole point of the Twilight Hammer Clan, the reasons why they exist: they want to induce a cataclysm and give new life to the Old Gods. So it's not strange to find in quests involving them hint of a cataclysm
---
&gt; blizzard clearly took action to stop him
---
There is no evidence to support this claim.
---
He didn't get super lucky, it didn't proc unnaturally
---
Xaryu lost to Ebn, not Soda
---
the 'exists', 'enemy' and 'friendly' clause goes hand in hand with mouseover imo. Makes for some nice utility macros, specially for decursing, when you've got a priority of mouseover &gt; target &gt; self
---
Well...to recover the account and get it merged, I just had to put in a ticket. Because I could provide Blizz with the credentials it was easy and they did everything else. I could see people having some problems when they don't even remember the account credentials. But even then it's worth a shot, Blizz support was incredibly helpful and patient.
---
Casual boomers WILL NOT make up a population of this game because boomers are out mowing their law while checking the stock market from their iPhone. Sorry you're so upset that I called out a guy who is either lying or an idiot. :D
---
I always make those hurt/help type macro's, for instance on my priest I put shadow word pain and renew on the same button. And smite/heal. Super useful.
---
I already had one of each class in legion, so when allied races were added i had no choice but to level doubles. It's not that bad considering each spec is in a way a separate subclass on its own. Melee surival hunter doesn't really feel like the same class as a marksman, feral vs balance druid etc.
---
My favorite foreshadowing is the end of this little horde chain:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1391](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1391)
---
When you give the drink to the human spy he says: "I believe the Forsaken are misleading the allies of the Horde.... wait... I feel so... dizzy..." then dies.
---
He was foreshadowing the whole Putricide mess in WOTLK. Simply amazing
---
I mean as a player Esfand isn't even in the same stratosphere as Ven. Cool guy though
---
You realize the whole thing wouldn't have happened without him? I also can't watch him but I still had his stream open on the side at the end for the ads
---
If perplexity is a rogue he just instantly lose vs ven, especially at lvl 30, dunno what wins between mage or rogue at 60.
---
/startattack
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
The latter 3 will get you ignored, blacklisted and excluded from meaningful content, post-haste.  
---
So you're griefing yourself doing that more than anyone else, doing those.
---
Cross faction of course, it's a free for all :D
---
One of my personal favorites is killing off someones warlock/hunter pet, and watch them get murdered by the mobs :P
---
What happened exactly? I’m out of the loop on this one
---
Don't let OP deceive you. You can even MT if you put enough effort in gearing and know what you're doing (just like any tank should). OP is just on crusade against druids and made a post full of half lies. Druids take more damage but it doesn't make them unviable. Parry chance causes more boss hits but it doesn't affect just druids (warrior tanks have faster attack speed in general so they would be taking more hits than druids). Bad rng one shots druids but yet again it doesn't, druids have more hp so they can survive those unlikely events and any competent healers would heal the damage before it is too late
---
They should have sent multiple 3-person squads to different parts of Azeroth and summoned the duelists + two spectators right before each match. people wouldn’t be able to watch in game, but they would also be unable to grief.
---
OSRS died off quickly without fresh content because OSRS has all content avaliable you just have to go and grind the lvls and do it.
---
With Classic WoW phases the game will remain fresh for close to 2 years before a content drought will make the player base dwindle. 2 years of Classic is plenty of time to overtake Retail in players.
---
&gt;These streamers were the lead voices in the "no changes, warts and all"
---
There is no hypocrisy here. You'd have some kind of argument if this weren't a beta to test the game. It's not hypocritical to move an abuse element from the test server. It's a privilege to be there and you can lose that privilege.
---
He had to fund tourny. People get so entitled at the free content they are watching
---
totem stomp macros don't work in this client the same way they don't work on live. it's a non classic change
---
you can also tab target flagged players even when you're not flagged, of which there were many in that crowd
---
neither of these would have been needed if the duel area wasnt so scuffed
---
Was on my front page, title should have been "congrats to the winner of the beta dual tournament" with the winner in text.
---
Why are people downvoting you? You are not wrong...
---
I don’t really get the hate for the achievement system. It’s completely meaningless internet points and banners. 
---
The only ways it’s a detriment is if you can’t pug as easilly cause you can’t link AOTc....but pugging raids is the antithesis of classic wow, in many ways. If you are a pro classic wow type mmo player, then a pug should be beyond reproach. You should be in a guild. 
---
And if you’re hardcore, as many here claim to be. You should have no qualms slumming it out in shit tier guilds for a couple of tiers as you work to get better tier clears. IF you finish the raid 2 weeks before aotc goes away, you’re bad n paper. And a top 20 us guild won’t even give you a look. But a US 200 might. So you play that tier with them, now you app to a top 50. Work that tier. Onto the next...
---
Today, aotc doesn’t even mean that much. It’s all based on your io score for pugs. And guilds look at a whole lot more than the date you killed /were carried to a kill of a boss, in their trial process.
---
I hit 99% gpu usage on a 2080 ti running wow classic stress test client at 6880x2880 120hz.
---
If you need the heat crank up the resolution and OC!
---
What are you tier 3 subbed to this guy? Mod? Just another white knight? If he can't remember then he should do some research or not comment at all. He clearly wasn't hardcore or invested because he would remember something as simple as class/race combos. Maybe if you have such a gripe with this subreddit you should stop browsing it. xP
---
Then why were they allowed to stay in a clearly wallclipped reached location, without even filing a single report?
---
I know. But granates are the exeption.
---
It's a DQ to leave a duel...
---
exploring the world was half the fun back then. It still will be in a way, i mean when i think about it, i levelled dozens of characters in the post cata azeroth, but only a couple before that. I barely remember most of it anymore.
---
&gt;The dude **healthstoned** midtanking
---
I think it's a perfectly normal thing to do.
---
Maybe you mean hearthstoned ? ;-)
---
Hydrocane and azure silk belt gang. Poor man’s Druid.
---
it's a joke...
---
ORB OF DECEPTION
---
Isn't SS normalized?
---
Still somewhat annoying 3specisly if they all overlap.
---
Looting has some delay to it, and you have to first loot the mob, then skin it and then loot the skinning result. 3 seconds is probably not too far off.
---
Again different era. 50g pe hour guides are rampant and detailed whereas in 2005 vanilla guides were sparse and telling people to grind the worst things like furbog fo pittance
---
 I have no doubt vast majorit of people wont raid, this is why classic wont succeed months dowb the line
---
Then explain to me the mechanics that removed him, and only him from that location? And no, that's not how layering works, that's how sharing works. Which isn't a feuture in classic wow.
---
keyring was a drop
---
He's not R14.
---
I think the amount of effort that went into this shitpost is what makes it so great
---
I’m playing a private server while watching a lot of classic streams and I haven’t noticed this. There are definitely certain abilities that have a blood effect though, but not all. I’ll take a look tomorrow and see if I’m just not paying attention to it.
---
GM with spellstaff and didn't bother to buy the chest piece? This is the pre-TBC welfare epics.
---
Have a constant rain of fire at the entrance to fuck off any rogue rogues.
---
And if you play a Hunter, Rogue, Mage, Warlock, Warrior, Paladin, Priest or Shaman, when what you actually WANTED to play was a Druid, you will regret it every time you log in, look at your character, or use your character.
---
This mindset is just so absolutely ignorant and absurd, completely drawn from the "Super-Hyper-MinMax-Everything" attitude of wannabe-proplayers out of the private server scene, it's laughable.
---
Classic WoW is not enjoyable because you minmax. It's enjoyable because it's a great game that caters to classic RPG elements, including class fantasy and class identity.
---
I played Vanilla, from start to finish. We had several dps druids in our raid. They enjoyed what they were doing. We enjoyed them as players and companions. Go take that "OMFG THIS DOES NOT PERFORM OPTIMALLY!!!!!!!!" attitude and put it somewhere it fits nicely.
---
Thanks for answering my question /s
---
So THAT's why there's no half decent names to pick from anymore ...
---
There was a 3rd place match Cdew won that so wasn't tied for 3rd.
---
Name a few then if you don't mind?
---
&gt;Of course, you really wouldn't want to vendor everything, at least not once you get to Heavy Leather, but unless you're going for a world record, adding Skinning to your speedrun is absolutely worth it. I can't imagine it's worth it trying to AH any leather the first few days and that adds time.
---
With very limited bag and bank space I'd actually suggest vendoring all leather till rugged if your leveling hard right at launch.
---
Oh I absolutely agree. what I was getting at is that I would expect someone to ruin the outcome of an event like this on reddit, whether intentionally or accidentally
---
Snutz one of the best players ever but some shitter on here thinks he can critique him. Shadowbolting in a duel LUL
---
did the GMs do anything about the taurens?
---
&gt; Do mouseover macros even work in classic?
---
Why wouldn't they? I healed mouseover in vanilla.
---
not a bug apparently
---
entire mmo genre is dying, studios have stopped mmo developments. There arent mmo game out there because the genre is being overshadowed by others. 
---
Gaming culture revolution have came swift and hard over past decade.
---
He mentioned the 2k were coming from somewhere but he couldn't say, so I doubt it's from his pocket. He kept hitting the ad button so "people couldn't see where they are dueling or what they are discussing".
---
Because he probably believes so himself since his viewers and especially the invite to the Classic summit reinforced that thought.
---
Hi, /u/SpiralRavine
---
Portals help, but there's just so many tools that do the same task. On retail, I have a ring that ports me to the port of Dazar'alor, a 20 minute hearth that takes me to The Great Seal, a Dalaran hearthstone, and a cloak that ports me to Orgrimmar. In retail you have JUST the hearthstone, and it has a 1 HOUR cooldown. With the amount of tools you have on live, it's almost TOO easy to get from one place to another.
---
If the opposing faction would crash a tourney - you can still fight back and there's nothing but player honor/respect that goes into play for such an event. If the opposing faction wants to be assholes that's their prerogative. Even if the intent is to ruin something, it is a PvP server and that's a risk existing for anything. There was a memorial for a player that had passed away, formerly a member in a horde guild that took place during vanilla. For which I think an alliance guild raided and killed most everyone who was attending - the alliance guild was not punished because they didn't break any ToS rules.
---
Even if a streamer would be whining, it's the risk they take for playing on a PvP server.
---
However, using the same faction where players cannot make them go away the player vs player agency is gone. Especially in this case when they even relocated to try solving the issue - they still persisted. Think many would be glad if they were banned.
---
Wat
---
&gt; And the raids are fairly easy compared to current standards 
---
Yeah but mana management isn't.
---
If you watch the stream from tips out yesterday, you'll see this Tauren trying to troll the player created duelling tournament by bodyblocking shaman totems, and trying to bodyblock the duellers. Streamers like sodapopin and asmongold threw a fit over this, despite themselves hosting huge event solely for the purpose of disrupting RP events and such with a horde of lvl1 naked gnomes, even causing server crashes and actively trying to cause players to DC because of lag caused by the sheer amount of player activity on one screen.
---
And your aware no one sent a report or a report on behalf of the people there? Streamers are really important to the beta because they are recording all their experiences.
---
Went my entire wow vanilla career from start to end of it without a single epic drop on all my characters (3), until i started raiding, and then after having raided MC and BWL and having them on farm and having cleared them what seemed dozens of times, i never saw a single Nightslayer Cover drop. (Played a rogue)
---
First off you are way too invested if you are getting upset over what happened and what resulted.
---
&gt;Streamers have been doing massive "lvl1 naked runs" disrupting/griefing other players on a much more severe level than one fucking Tauren, even causing server crashes--no bans for it.
---
What are they to do? Quest and talk to every npc to look for bugs and then stop playing? Did every single streamer take part in this? The whole streamer vs everyone is blow out of proportion for a game that was released 15 years ago. Considering I don't know what they did here, and for how long I wouldn't be able to give an opinion.
---
&gt;There were literal recepies for how to stunlock and prolong the annoyance for world PvP instead of killing them off-- not banned for it.
---
World pvp against the enemy faction is not what happened today, nor should anything against the opposing faction should ever be bannable...  only things that are abusing exploits or 3rd party software. 
---
Anything goes when it comes to open world pvp... roll a PvE server. 
---
&gt;Corpse camping were a literal way to act out revenge on players, people did it every day in Vanilla - - not banned for it.
---
Open world pvp.
---
&gt;I can go on and on here, and even point out that the tournament ended up being arranged in a bugzone, that they had to wallclip to get into, clearly an exploit, and no one bat's an eye? Why? "it's beta, they're testing bugs"? Show me one guy streaming who reported that bug then. ONE GUY. Please show me.
---
Do you mean the wall clip that was in the game in Vanilla? How about the one to get under Stormwind? Or on top of org? Those were in the game and they added character to the Vanilla EXPERIENCE.
---
If someone doesn't want that experience - 
---
They. Play. B.F.A.
---
At no point did blizzard come out and say "alright guys we came up with the idea to do Classic because we think it would be a great idea to revisit where we started."
---
No, the player demanded it blizzard actually followed through.
---
Those outside of the map areas do not affect your gameplay so you shouldn't be upset about it. If it was game breaking it would be fixed... it's not a bug to be tested and reported.
---
&gt;I'd rather argue that godtrollx was testing bugs, the bugs where classic gets filled with salty entitled streamers who don't have the insight to realize that a lot of their streaming career is consisting of doing similar things that they are screaming "BAN Him" for right now. Hypocrites.
---
I guess this is a nice attempt to prove the hypocrisy here... the guy harassing people during a planned and publicly streamed event wouldn't have been any different if it was a private and non streamed event. 
---
The fact that he was intentionally interfering for hours on end is what makes it griefing - if he was on alliance and did the same thing it wouldn't have been. There is a reason he did it on an alt and not his main.
---
Pretending that the majority of streamers are ignorant to what Vanilla was and what Classic will be is ignorance on your part... They played Vanilla, they did the same well clips, made the same WSG jumps, did world pvp the same way they did back then.
---
If you are trying to say that anyone participating in a closed beta (where they got hand picked invited to) is supposed to be only looking for bugs and nothing else, that just comes off as jealously... simply due to the fact that blizzard could have held the closed beta private without allowing streamers to broadcast.
---
You and everyone else that are fighting tooth and nail about streamers need to get over it - it's not a new game, the content is not new, your characters won't be original - stop putting such an importance on small details.
---
Oh and don't grief!
---
Dude ! As someone who is currently leveling a rogue on private servers, this is huge thank you!

---
It was too high then and it's too high now
---
I hope not, that would fuck up the economy really hard
---
That one was foreshadowing for sure. The Dark Portal has been a huge part of WoW since WC2.
---
I love absolute shitters on here critiquing the best players to ever play the game.
---
Play on OCE servers man, they will be very high pop due to scarcity and we have been waiting for low ping Vanilla for years - why waste it?
---
It WILL be epic and because it will NOT have any of the things you want to be implemented.
---
BFA is available to purchase and play.
---
Not sure if this is fake or not but apparently he got [teleported](https://i.imgur.com/EmEzrCQ.jpg) away. Blizzard do state in their ToS they they will act if they see play behavior inappropriate.
---
Locks don't have counterspell and death coil at this level, harder to lock the mage down.
---
The only thing I can guarantee you will regret, is logging into the game, looking at your character, and using your character, if you WANTED to play a druid, but picked something else because someone on the internet told you it's not the mathematically ideal thing to do.
---
Discussions about this have been poisoned by the PServer Kiddies, wannabes who pretend to be pro because they figured out the mathamatically optimal ways to play a 14 year old game by playing it to death for 14 years (wow, what an accomplishment).
---
Classic is about class fantasy, class identity, and being perfectly imperfect.  
---
**If you want to play a Druid, play a Druid!**
---
now this is some quality shitposting. GJ
---
Druids, like democracies, don’t attack eachother.
---
just made a [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bw7ye0/a_guide_to_samefaction_griefing_creative_ways_to/) about it :)
---
Horde &amp; no thistle
---
Ha I love it when people get griefed! Yeah nothing should have happened to that guy. He didn’t break any game rules at all
---
Was this a jab at retail or classic, or both?
---
haha yeah u got him good
---
I found that video and watched it. I was expecting to hate on soda for it but actually he didn’t do anything wrong there. Wairglaives are significantly better for rouges than warriors. No serious guild has ever given glaives to a warrior unless the warrior sucked some serious dick or all the rouges already had them. He screamed like an Autist about it, but he was correct. It was absurd that the warrior was even rolling on it.
---
It happened to me in Wrath. Some guy got butthurt that he lost the roll on the mount. Ended up having to race/name change.
---
Just FAP a lot.
---
For those wondering, you don't mind control *inside* Booty Bay because the guards will automatically attack you. You mind control from the boat, as it's leaving, and throw the victim off the boat before the loading screen so they have to swim back.
---
Other good ones:
---
1. Ssummoning an Inferno or Doomguard and releasing it in lowbie areas. 
---
2. Killing flight masters.
---
3. Going into world or trade chat and yelling Kazzak/Azuregos is up!
---
4. Filling someone's bags with Heavy Leather Balls.
---
I'm pretty bad at committing to a class, but here's how I attempt it:
---
1. Try to accept that picking a class means missing out on content. That's just the way it is. It sucks, but it's also really cool and forces commitment to a certain identity in the world.
---
2. Try to formulate some criteria. For me:
---
- try something new
---
- relatively easy to gear as imma be casual
---
- pick a race/class/spec combo that speaks to me
---
- I prefer utility and support over dps / healing meters
---
But then I fantasize about picking other classes, because I have to do something until the end of august
---
have u been in their streams? it's pretty rampant
---
not at that stage of the game.  
---
SL and coil make a huge difference. also the higher tier gear give locks very high stamina.  
---
up until T1 gear mages have no major problems against locks.
---
I saw somewhere that transfers were given out during vanilla for players to balance out factions and also for low pop servers. 
---
I wasnt playing back in the day to know this first hand, but can anyone confirm or deny this?
---
Not that I necessarily disagree, but what big name private server players were invited to this tournament? Payo?
---
These macros won't work on a private server because there is no autoloot.
---
Tanking is the hardest, dps is the easiest, healer has too much variance. If both of those two roles are occupied by bad players, its hands down the hardest. 
---
DPS has the lowest floor but a high ceiling. If you are the type of guy who can blink nova, sprint stun, distract, fear/recklessness in addition to the bare minimum of I make things dead, it can be harder.
---
Fun is when you aren't wiping, that's not class dependent.
---
Tips made the rules so they were bound to be dumb
---
Well, you understand what an exploit is right? Had they gone down there, reported/recorded that the bug exists, and then left it wouldn't have been that important, but they stayed there to exploit the difficulty of reaching that spot, and hosting tournaments there. Even summoning players there.
---
You do know that this is a bannable offense, and was shut down on way more often than "dueling griefing" was in Vanilla, right?
---
That’s a big list! Nice one definitely gonna save that
---
I thought this was about the lighting. Sure whatever
---
see it a lot in the streams
---
If you aren't a druid/shaman/lock/pally it is very worth it early in the servers life. It vendors well and having a guarenteed mount at 40 improves leveling speed.
---
This quest spawned [my favorite WoW forum thread of all time](https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=121810)
---
good times
---
It's an odd thing, but I cope by realizing ruminating over it does nothing to progress my own life.
---
I intend to lose sleep when classic launches, this is the better time - where we are free of wanting to constantly play.
---
Don't hope to get a beta invite - be glad you don't have the opportunity to spend/waste more time than we already are going to come August 26/27 :)
---
Mail it to an alt and let it sit in the mailbox for 30 days.
---
At least you're sure not to get agro !
---
I have done this on Mailboxes with 15+ mounted Taurens on top. I never had any problem clicking it.
---
It's definitely better if you don't play the beta.... Your progress gets deleted anyway and you get the full experience once the game launches =) hang in there its not even 3 month anymore
---
Venruki is dope!! Damn that was fun to watch today.. even more stoked for classic!! H Y P E
---
It's a huge part of vanilla, and people know this, especially the streamers present (like sodapopin and asmongold), as they themselves have on several occasions hosted events like this in a much bigger scale, disrupting RP events and so on. But God forbid it should happen to them.
---
Oh wow his in game griefing actually cost you real life money. That’s incredible
---
Uh oh, I hope you don't get mass reported for sharing what people were capable of in Vanilla!
---
I read it all. Much appreciated read man! Keep on keeping on!
---
Intercontinental transfers are **not** an option on live and classic, and 99,9% sure will never be.
---
When the open up transfers, it's only realm transfer in the **same region.**
---
It wouldn't make sense in modern wow, with scaling and all that, but back then it wasn't much of an issue. I mean it's not like you could skip pivotal zones like barrens or ashenvale anyway. And even if you did, you still had to go through that zone to go the next, so why not pick the flight path on your way.
---
God I hate you sooooo much :D
---
Yes,it counts as botting under the new ToS. Glad it's removed,maked raiding raiding marginally more difficult
---
I see. Thank you!
---
I'll probably just roll on NA then.
---
Yes, we need this.
---
But muh CoMmUnItY!
---
Let this guide be a lesson on what to expect, and there will probably be a few other things that people will think of, too.
---
I used to get on my orc hunter and go to Westfall, where the boars were by the questing hub. I would tame a boar and control it, then a lowbie would come attack it not thinking twice and it would flag them for pvp, then I'll just concussive shot them until they headed back to the guards, then kill them.
---
Can someone link me to a vod of the tournament?
---
Yes I'm aware of that. Hence my confusion as to why berserker rage breaks nades on Nost core pservers.
---
Im gonna vendor everything until i get to Heavy leather, mail it to my alt and see how much gold i have at 40. If selling some gets me a mount, its being sold.
---
Otherwise i let it sit.
---
You people are sick.
---
Be careful OP... If a streamer sees this they might cry on stream and demand that blizzard execute you're entire family.
---
First looting the mob doesn't count towards skinning time, you were going to do that anyway.
---
In Classic, when you skin a mob, you automatically loot it (assuming you have the auto-loot option enabled).
---
In my analysis, we're only killing and skinning mobs at your level, so it rarely if ever fails.
---
Am I the only one who barely heard about this venruki guy like 2 weeks ago? Yet everyone is saying he’s been popular for a long time. Then again I’m not really into pvp
---
It really seems that you are still mixing up the beta and actual release. Doesn't matter what was bannable offense in Vanilla, this is Classic beta. That ToS does not apply here.
---
WOW changed because they got greedy and didn't believe they were capable of failing.
---
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/42673
---
Yes it is
---
That was the case yes, but with our knowledge nowadays this could be abused easily. But then again layering is in the game aswell which will get abused just as heavily... so it shouldnt matter anymore
---
Yes, please make more of these posts. Teach me the ways! I'm what's known as a clicker soooo I really need the help. Especially since I wanna go hard in WoW Classic PvP. I seem to always have trouble trying to click so many keys and move at the same time.
---
It depends on multiple factors, you can even make it work with a fast weapon setup although unusual, if you raid uses arthas &amp; hemorrage you can dish out some insane numbers even with an unusual build
---
Whose "their"?
---
No idea. OSRS seems to have been a catalyst for their decision in making Classic (paired with the whole Nostalrius thing as well). It seems likely that they would look toward the system used by them at some point.
---
Not to mention the devs flat out acknowledged this as a possibility.
---
Can confirm. I moved a gnome rogue to a low-pop server, then never played her again because it was a low-pop server.

1. Go to Swamp of sorrows as a Warlock

2. Let your pet attack the Slime Mob tha infects it with a 4 minute posion-nova debuff (ticks once every 15sec IIRC)
---
3. Dismiss the pet **THIS EFFECTIVELY STORES THE DEBUFF. IT WON'T TICK DOWN WHILE THE PET IS IN THE NETHER**
---
4. Kill the slime

5. Go to a starting area
---
6. Summon your pet
---
7. Follow new players
---
8. Boom! :D
---
Different in the fact that you might have to target the person you're cleansing/decursing/dispelling instead of basically slamming a button and having an addon do all the work. The macro and addon shit you could do in vanilla was insane, like you could string a whole rotation into one button practically. 
---
It's still gonna be easy to raid with mouseover and other macros, it just won't be as automated.
---
That’s a good one
---
Only 1 Pserver player competed in the tournament.
---
&gt;In Vanilla especially, there's a massive amount of content showing how this specific type of griefing was not enforced, and this was a huge part of the vanilla experience. Funeral disruptions, corpse camping, vengeance ganking etc etc.
---
Its not the same thing. Blizzards stance is that if there is a PvP solution to a PvP problem, its not against their ToS. The Funeral thing was people engaging in open PvP in a contested zone on a PvP server. People need to stop acting like this and same faction griefing are the same thing. Its literally why the report function exists at all.
---
This one guy was trying to derail an event that was being broadcasted to more than 100k people. Obviously Blizzard is going to intervene. Same faction griefing was never allowed btw. It was always against the rules whether some people get away with it or not.
---
I get that this subreddit has a hate-boner for streamers, but its getting really old having it slapped in my face 30 times a day when I browse here.
---
It’s the exact same game.
---
great guide. after seeing how easily triggered /r/classicwow is, just from that one sperg streamsniping the duel tourney out of like a 100k total viewers, i'll be sure to make use of this in its fullest
---
And a beta should not be about hosting community events, but play testing for bugs and glitches. But that's another story.
---
He's been around for years and is very well known on the PvP scene. He's a good guy
---
Nope, mouse over in vanilla targeted the other mob/player, executed the action and then retargeted your original target. Making you lose combo points in the process.
---
It's a huge buff to rogues since you can kick or blind others without dropping your Combo points.
---
Again this is the beta so what was ok in the vanilla game is completely different. You don't want people to exploit the base game but exploiting a beta is mostly the point.
---
This is exactly what I predicted aswell.
---
Holy shit I gotta save this one. That’s so creative
---
In ToS Blizzard says what is acceptable behavior is determined by players reports and Blizzard's decision. So Blizzard decided what he did was not cool and moved him away from the area.
---
The devil is on the details.
---
And you are literally ignoring the arguments I make. Streamers like sodapopin and asmongold, in retail, has on several occasions hosted huge parties to actively disrupt RP events, which is actually a bannable offense on RP servers. Nothing happens to them. So tell me this, why should something happen to trollgodx, when he does the same, but only as 1 person?
---
&gt;You might find yourself just attacking anybody out in the world because hey, they might have awful gear or hey, they might have awesome gear who knows, won't find out until I punch 'em.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; It created that atmosphere of danger, which contributed to the overall feeling of the danger the world presented considering there are at all times any number of frighteningly powerful players roaming about.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That feeling is completely gone when you can't identify the strength of a player at a glance.
---
See, I understand your point but this is where I actually disagree. I don't think you SHOULD be able to just tell that someone is more or less powerful than you just by looking at them. 
---
I find there's MORE elements of danger when you can't just tell and make mistakes or take risks. That's more immersive to me. I don't know who on the street is going to be a martial arts master, have pepper spray, have a gun, or a glass jaw and a bum knee. It takes all the mystery out when you look at someone and know exactly what bosses they've farmed and what all their stats are because you know their set's code. 
---
You know what happened to me in vanilla as a druid? I got ganked in STV by a terrifying level 60 rogue who always wore the Wild Heart set I was still desperately farming from UBRS for cosmetic purposes (I'd outleveled it). It was more memorable to me to have this rogue wearing MY class set kick my ass (and everyone else's - he was TERRYFING). 
---
A lot of people misjudged him because of it! Downplaying your strength is a valid tactic in war.
---
I would be mad AF as a buyer
---
I was always one of those guys who liked to spec in all three trees to give my character different good abilities for leveling. That was the joy of classic. Different talents could be mixed and matched to accommodate a varying play style. I'd like to vote, but don't fit in any of the columns.
---
Wow what a horrible way to determine acceptable behaviour.  Imagine if you and your friends decided to report someone who didn’t deserve it
---
Welcome to classic, this is why he said "you think you do, but you dont"
---
You seem like you'd be a real fun guy at parties.
---
They will. That’s why nobody wanted to invite them so it would be fair.
---
Back in the day I would spam Detect Magic on an enemy as a mage in a goblin town. It puts a 2 minute debuff on them and an animation on their character in similar to Dispel Magic. For whatever reason, guards did not attack and I would spam the ability on enemies to annoy them. As soon as they did anything in retaliation, goblin guards would aggro and kill them.
---
Relink pls?
---
&gt; Hunter, Mage, Rogue, Warlock, or Warrior
---
One of these things is not like the other.
---
who the fuck cares, you don't like it? get over it, its a game run by a company who will listen to the content creators that brough literally 100k+ views on their beta realm fucking lvl 30 duel tournament, if they want to just make a dick teleport away to help it, which it didn't because when he was teleported it was already hours into the tournament they can. 
---
If that person wants to troll then he can, soda said "i would respect the troll a lot more if he used his actual characters name" I agree with that, do I want them banned, no, would I want them to be ported away phased, killed whatever yeh theyre fucking annoying me. get over it
---
I mean, you can see the grenades on their trajectory, I'm pretty sure they just didn't hit. It's just hard to predict movement with the cast time + travel time...
---
Ohh okay sorry, I read this spell literally minutes before going to sleep. I usually get lazy and just skim mostly when I'm sleepy, my bad. My memory only begins at around WoTLK but I thought they auto-replace each other when you purchase a new skill, unless that began in TBC/WoTLK and not Vanilla?
---
Yeah, several people said they witnessed this live. So that's clearly blizzard interfering. And considering how blizz has never interfered when the streamers and tons of viewers go on RP servers to grief RP events, which isn't allowed on RP servers, then it becomes special treatment and favouring.
---
No they are called abilities.
---
A progressive 1.12 private server would also essentially be a frankenpatch though, wouldn't it?
---
item 24 on my list is "post pro-griefing content on /r/classicwow" ;)
---
remember raiding in vanilla and going through so many mana pots as well as using my manag gem constantly and still ending the fight oom
---
1. As a rogue, build several http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=4384
---
2. Go to an enemy factions starting area
---
3. Release the beast
---
4. Watch new players blow up
---
Especially effective as a horde rogue against Dun Morogh, because it blends in so well with the surroundings
---
Pretty sure it's always been that way, 10 seconds was the time and if you were feared you just smashed your keyboard in frustration for a while
---
None of us have a good grasp of how layering works. But what we do have is a response from Blizzard after one of the Community Developers was contacted during the tournament and that was "there's nothing we can do".
---
&gt;1. These streamers were the lead voices in the "no changes, warts and all" situation, but now they can't handle it? I don't think I need to go into details about how streamers like asmond and sodapopin have repeatedly disrupted RP events on several occasions on a way more massive scale. Why is it not ok when it happens to them? Are they above the the rest of us?
---
Can't handle what? Someone griefing? People griefing 15 years ago also got dealt with. Were they all just? Probably not... but they did get dealt with.
---
As far as the events they have personally disrupted we would have to see what the situation was and how long it lasted. 
---
There is a difference in griefing for minutes and griefing for hours.
---
&gt;2. In Vanilla especially, there's a massive amount of content showing how this specific type of griefing was not enforced, and this was a huge part of the vanilla experience. Funeral disruptions, corpse camping, vengeance ganking etc etc.
---
How many were same faction? Were they done on PvE or pvp servers? 
---
Again - no two situations are the same. You can not have a black and white outlook on these things... which is exactly why blizzard gets to pick an choose the rules for their game.
---
&gt;3. If you're going to sit on your pedestal and criticise others, why can they themselves then exploit game bugs like wallclipping? "Well it's beta, they have to test it" ok, show me a clip of any of them reporting this bug then.
---
This is simple. Blizzard knows well clips exist, if they were game breaking they would be fixed. They may be fixed in retail - which that option to go play that exists with the same $15 sub - wall clipping was a part of Vanilla and added charachter to the experience. (Getting under storming or on top of Org was fun)
---
The beta could have been private and not streamable - blizzard decides what is a bug and what is not.
---
&gt;4. If you're going to excuse all this by saying that blizz didn't ban him, so it's fine, then you're digging your own grave. Blizzard clearly intervened by "layering" only him out of the situation. Layering doesn't work with individuals, that's sharding, which isn't a feuture in wow classic, so some tailoring was clearly being done.
---
Irrelevant what they did with him - it's not only their game, it's their invite only closed beta...
---
No. The files indicate it's closer to a 8.x.x client. The Lua API is a different story altogether - from examinations of the code being used it is as stated above.
---
How does TBC 1-70 leveling speed compare to vanilla 1-60?
---
To each his own circlejerk
---
Two more:
---
1. Going into world or trade chat and yelling Kazzak/Azuregos is up!
---
2. Filling someone's bags with Heavy Leather Balls.
---
Except if they were doing that because the Chinese use the same client, why is the spark when you hit targets at the very least not there because that would also be on the Chinese client
---
None. There are many more things than MMOs competing for people's free time these days.
---
It's not great at all, but it's what I keep hearing recommended for testing out classes at 60.
---
Then explain to me how what trollgodx did was reason enough to teleport him away, but when streamers disrupt RP on retail RP servers, its completely OK?
---
Pretty much any boss that is reasonably approachable for melees over the majority of the fight. Patchwerk for example.
---
How dare you blizzard imply that all scotsmen are 4 feet tall and drunk all the time and that all native americans are actually bipedal cows!  This makes me mildly uncomfortable because im a left wing sheltered suburban loser with a white guilt complex and “educated” in critical theory!
---
Hey at least trolls built some nice cities, cant really say much for Haiti...
---
If you mean that Hunters also lack decent DPS, then yes.
---
my biggest fear with the possible 1.13+ content is that it will have none of that stuff, so even if they will otherwise try to stay faithful to the old school design, it will still be closer to tbc/wrath than vanilla.
---
Just adding time to the leveling process. Works if your worried about profit over efficiency.
---
Isnt it possible to prevent this? lets say europeans could only log into Eu servers, america into us and chinese/korea into their servers?
---
Mage if it's good.
---
Make a Hunter, buy a bunch of BOE rare/epics, and run around spamming Raptor strike/Wing clip with Aspect of the Pack on in BGs.
---
Kinda. They "normalised" instant attacks like SS around halfway through Vanilla, but this mostly just means that fast and slow weapons get the same level of benefit from attack power buffs.
---
Pre-normalisation, not only did slow weapons have a better baseline for instant attacks, they also scaled far better with buffs (a weapon half as fast as another got twice the damage bonus from attack power, which then made instant attacks scale even better.)
---
So slow/high damage weapons are still generally better, but the difference is not as stark as before.
---
But my authentic classic experience will be affected and I won't be able to share any special moments with my favorite entertainer if someone attempts to do this, I better start reporting people for griefing before the mass of drones that are suffering from this behavior are unable to enjoy themselves and the entertainer feels affected by the way people are playing the game.
---
It would be cool if the vids were in order.
---
Hard to answer because leveling rates were adjusted over that period of time.   
---
But if you know what you're doing and you're focused, it takes around \~150 hours to reach 60. (You can do it in \~80 on a hunter. Add +50 hours if you're playing a warrior on a PVP realm.)
---
Wow changed because people cried about wanting change, all that human nature stuff, hindsight is 20/20, blah blah.
---
Fair criticism, but let me disagree with you a little bit.
---
I think the casters were absolutely amazing, 11/10. First of all, their attitude and energy and how well-spoken they were: they made the tournament feel very fluent and enjoyable.
---
Second, you have to understand the interface is not there to catch EVERY MINOR DETAIL plus this is a lvl 30 dueling meta that literally nobody knows anything about, not even the players who got the furthest in the tournament.
---
Examples: Soda never tried manual crowd pummeler, said he probably can win with it versus warlocks and priests BUT DIDN'T KNOW. Other top pros didn't think Venruki could win against Snutz, and most duels were different to each other because they did not wait for cooldowns to keep this timely. Therefore, in one duel a player could have mechanical whelp or X weapon or an use-item, and next duel not.
---
I think the casters adapted and were able to see the big picture and break the action down to the viewers, who, most of us, didn't know the fuck is going on most of the time. (I repeat, not even many pros knew)
---
Second part of your criticism like groundings / frostbolt fireblast being interpreted as a frostbolt crit is mostly just UI things and happened a handful of cases.
---
I'll say it's not cool to interrupt some high quality dueling going on for sure, but at the same time you make a good point.
---
I don't follow streamers at all, but I'm well aware of the hypocrisy some have along with a sense of entitlement and ego.
---
If what you say is true about them interrupting others enjoyment in RPing, then they can't really be crying about their parade being fucked with either.
---
Though it could be argued that it's a beta and fresh eyes, so to speak, are on it right now to see. Potential customers etc. If a GM was in the crowd and didn't care for the trolling during the phase and event, b what can ya do.
---
In classic retail it could be hold more weight in what happened, but then again, we all know big streamers get away with more shit and is why I'll try my hardest to steer clear from their choice servers.
---
The only people that should care about adding *maybe* an hour to your total leveling time from 1 to 60 are Joana and the rest of the record seekers.
---
Rogue and mage are highest DPS (in raids) bigtime tho.
---
Nicee!  We gotta try that when classic is online! Why aren't you in our file though?
---
Right now is better, but back in the day I had to save up for months so I could afford 2 month game time card. Also, remember when you had to buy each expansion individually? If you just starting out, depending when, you needed to buy the vanilla game (for comparison, it was around 30% of minimum wage in my country at the time), then TBC and then WoTLK. Everyone were preordering collectors editions and I was like "okay, a few more months saving and I think I will be able to afford regular edition of the game".
---
I was half kidding but yeah you technically can see your class at 60 with blue gear, but that server has pay to win with donations for gold which u can buy naxx gear with
---
I did a bg in there and go crit for 2500 by a chain lightning ele shaman with naxx set lmao but yeah you get to play and see your class at 60 it's just incredibly unrealistic so I wouldn't recommend basing a decision on your performance on retrowow
---
When they supposedly did these events, was it against their own faction? Did they do it for hours on end? Did they get reported? Did anything come of those reports?
---
Not sure why we pretend that people don't get favorited and given more of a leash than others. That's life... blizzard has the final say, and objectively speaking - if shroud gets paid XX amount of money to play a game - he will have a special relationship with the team behind the game.
---
Why does that matter here? Because you and I play this game but not the game shroud is playing?
---
Have you seen those orc warriors from classic? They have upside down curved swords.
---
Because it is beta. Still having problem with that concept?
---
"You may not use language that could be offensive or vulgar to others." I'm guessing you saw how soda was acting during the stream?
---
It's worth it in early classic until you have your mount atleast. Everyone will be competing for herb's/ore and without going out of your way to farm them you'll just fall behind whilst levelling. The extra loot to vendor is worth the extra few seconds for that bit more copper/silver etc.
---
&gt; I liked being able to look at other players and know what content they had completed, because of the items they had.
---
But isn't this still the case? For instance, pre darkmoon faire recolors, if you saw me wearing Feralheart you knew that I'd farmed all of the Wild Heart set from dungeons in vanilla and that I'd then done the insanely long "upgrade" chain to convert it. That's more moot now, since they added the Darkmoon Faire items...
---
I guess I don't understand how transmog diminishes that. I go back to do low level quests all the time to get items for transmog. If not for transmog, a lot of really cool stuff I had for ages would never really see the light of day and I like seeing stuff I or others have.
---
I still get whispers asking me about XYZ pieces I wear on characters from ages ago that they never saw because maybe they played in later expansions or a different class at the time or didn't farm a boss enough to see it drop.
---
Or anyone trying to level early. The servers will be a zoo and you could shave a dozen hours off the process by not wasting one early.
---
Why does everyone continue to claim it's running off a legion client then?
---
I'm not saying you're wrong btw just curious why I've heard that about the client, not only in this sub but from some streamers like cdew and ven who know wow pretty well
---
I was **obsessed** trying to get all of those FP's! It was good fun.
---
&gt;But muh CoMmUnItY!
---
People talking about "community" tend to forget that humans, by and large, are arseholes when given the chance, and that the fact that there are arseholes is a component of social interactions as well =)
---
If you mean that Druids lack decent HPS, then yes. But we have to bring them for MotW, Bres, Innervate.
---
It feels like lighting up a bonfire in DS after you get thru blighttown. Feels so rewarding.
---
This is pure gold =)
---
Oh, don't forget to only buy using cod and never actually buy it, so it sits in the nether for a long time, you can have the players send you gold to unlock it, if they want of course.
---
So what's this all about?
---
I vaguely remember hearing something about how Blizzard plans expansion concepts 3-4 xpacs in advance. 
---
Can’t corroborate it though.
---
This is I think a good compromise. New players won't have twenty grand to blow on maps, and people leveling their eleventeenth alt won't hafta walk a route they've done a dozen times already.
---
Anyone from UO Zulu Hotel servers? Those were the bomb.
---
Procs from sword specialization or hand of justice aren't normalized, so for example if you have 1400 attack power, difference between 2.70 and 2.10 normal swings is 60 damage.
---
This? https://itemization.info/
---
It's like english, they set rules but not everything follows them.
---
Lol, none of them are blizzard representatives, blizzard did not host any of this, so it doesn't matter at all how many people were watching. If a streamer has 600k views on retail, and is actively cheating, they'll still boot his ass. So how many people were watching is a straight up moo point.
---
First of all no. There were that many viewers, yes. But 32 players at most got inconvenienced. Not 100k. 
---
Ddossing is done outside of the world, so that should be banned. 16 people not being able to click something is nothing. And if that was a thing, every tauren in vanilla would have been banned for mounting on mailboxes so you can't collect mail. And I even think that's worse then running around in the middle of a duel.
---
True, I don't think MoP was bad. But WoW stopped being "World of.. Warcraft" with that expansion and started being some kind of superpower villains vs heroes megasuper cool stuff.
---
MoP as an off expansion for fun and going back to some real lore would be great, but it's just been downhill since.
---
Yes, they are in.
---
Exactly, not even that, but fun is very subjective, plus, some people only learn from experience so this will actually help
---
Don't those stats partially depend on spell-power? (Sorry, it's been a few years since I've played my warlock.)
---
No, people will just corpse run and wait in ghost to rez right when they want to mess with the duel. No way to stop that.
---
Hi, /u/BIue_scholar
---
Low effort troll post.
---
Well, Shaman vs Paladin is easy. Which faction do you want to play / which faction will your friends play?
---
For just healing, Priest is a lot more fun really. Not just spamming 1 heal. I'd suggest that tbh
---
&gt;Lol, none of them are blizzard representatives, blizzard did not host any of this, so it doesn't matter at all how many people were watchin
---
The entire beta is one giant advertisment hype generator. It 100% matters to Blizzard.
---
Er, I swear this only happened with rend, deep wounds and maybe rupture/rip. I do not remember any bloodmist particles from anything else. I just want the phatty crit sounds back. Smashing someone with a mace hearing that big, crit boom is so satisfying.
---
VPNs are a thing
---
Because no 2 situations are the same - and without you providing specific evidence, the arguement and comparison holds no weight... I'm not saying you are wrong or lying, I just can't speak on why it's okay for them to do it because I haven't seen the videos where they do it.
---
On top of that, blizzard hand selected certain people to be invited to their closed beta. If you think they won't have favorites you are lying to yourself.
---
Trollgodx didn't come out on his main to troll, he didn't stop after being asked to stop. Someone intentionally griefing a public even is able to be reported.
---
Immediately after they get reported THAT'S where my opinion and your opinion ENDS. We go as far as reporting what we see as griefing, cheating etc... blizzard gets to decide who gets the benefit of the doubt and who gets to be removed from the situation. 
---
Trollgod guy was there for hours- it wasn't as if blizzard was watching this event and saying "hmm that guy is interrupting a popular event that is being streamed let's take care of him"
---
He was reported on a closed beta with people streaming what was happening to over 100k people... they found out and made a decision.
---
Life isn't fair.
---
You don't have to bring them for MotW, just have an alt sit at the raid entrance.
---
You also don't need them for Brez because no one dies.
---
Innervate, yeah, sort of. But 2 good healers is better than 1.5 healers and an extra half mana bar.
---
fine =/= good
---
depends how much faster out of the gate than the majority of people you are.. granted there will be dungeon groups running constantly so you could just do dungeon quest chains to 30 pretty quickly
---
Haha, you're basically advocating for that streamers should float above the rest, excusing unprofessional behaviour from a multi-million company, and special treatment for certain customers. These are things companies have been sued over, and in many cases, lost severely. Grow up.
---
Games ToS is much more strict nowadays and blizzard does enforce it more. He was clearly griefing and he got dealt with.
---
Not wanding my ass off
---
22(b) People who play with all sounds **hate** the tram flute. Mods have literally been made to block it. If you play alliance, get the flute and then bind it to your primary abilities (heroic strike, greater heal, etc.)
---
If you are making your third+ alt you probably have some guildies ready to summon you to a distant fp..
---
Fairly certain it's to poke fun at the private server people that learned on a broken version of wow and are upset when their "skills" don't translate. Private server players vs classic players will be an interesting storyline that plays out.
---
Druid healers are good, you literally don't know what your talking about lol
---
Which is why I only suggesting mailing leather at Heavy...
---
If you love the class, go for it. There's a long running stigma against Druids and how bad they are percieved to be. 
---
While it's true that balance isn't great PvE DPS, the hybrid Balance/Resto PvP specs are incredibly adaptive and engaging to play, and really begin coming into their own level from Phase 2 and onward. 
---
Using this spec you're still capable of healing dungeons and raids extremely well.
---
And this is a big deal because...?
---
Yes, Blizzard protected the streamers event from interference. On purpose. You know why? **BECAUSE THEY ARE A COMPANY MARKETING A PRODUCT.** Streamers, like it or not, are part of that marketing strategy. And Classic, right now, is in it's key marketing phase.
---
Game goes live, no one will give a shit if you interfere, gank, troll, grief or whatever else comes to your mind.
---
Pretty sure we have a different definition of early.
---
I made friends with a gold farmer back in classic by saying "Ni Hao". He played 2 mages and AoE farmed mostly ZG Crocs and Stratholme service entrance in really shitty gear.
---
[Mages and rogues - lowest supply](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/018/489/nick-young-confused-face-300x256-nqlyaa.jpg)
---
Im searching every posts and guide about druid tanks cuz i wanna know my stuff before Classic release, but generally it seems that hardcore players dont like druid tanks in MT raids cuz of the bigger strain on the healers. 
---
However i dont plan to main tank in AQ40 or Naxx, was just curious if i could at least help out in like MC, BWL (ZG ive learned should be fine, theres even fights where a druid is stronger because polymorph immunity)
---
&gt;There is a difference in griefing for minutes and griefing for hours.
---
They seemed very relaxed and even justified griefing people in WSG by farming them for hours without finishing the game, so tell me when exactly is it acceptable to do this? Only when it benefits then.
---
I also find it laughable that the justification now is that the beta has a different TOS therefore it was acceptable to remove someone that was affecting their event by simultaneously exploiting the terrain to hold such event, this is why people continue to point out the privilege that these people have.
---
do these still work? i know they said they were not bringing back the 1 button rotation as they are not doable in the version of the API they are using
---

---
It wasn't even layering, it was a straight up teleport. But hey, nice try with the ignorance card. There's several sources explaining how layering works. Just because you don't know how to find info, doesn't mean no one knows.
---
Feel sorry for blizzard- they fuck us all over with layering and it potentially being in the game for several months - yet this is what the "community" focuses on.
---
it will be fully possible with layering, some people memorized the pathing and can do the 1-12 rush in under 5 hours, aslong as you can get out of the starting zone in 4ish hours and stay on until 30, you will be so far ahead of 95% of the players that no one can get in your way in the world, once you clear that gap its super easy to stay ahead  
---
the hardest part of speed running on a fresh server is 1-10 then 56-57 (plaguelands) the rest of the game is pretty easy on a fresh server (the plaguelands are so bad, if anything will ruin a speed run its that segment)
---
Trolling a community event isn’t really worth a ban.
---
i laugh so hard when this happend.
---
When you put yourself in the perspective of the Alliance Player,he must have been like alright fuck this shit.
---
“Stream sniping” is not griefing. If you are stupid enough to broadcast your position, you will have to take the consequences.
---
No, im advocating that no one is special the company is the one that runs things and its their choice
---
Not sure if this will be in Classic, but for a while, you could mind control people out of WSG by running them into the BG portal next to their graveyard. They'd get ejected from the match AND get a deserter buff for leaving.
---
Decursive was broken during vanilla towards the end of the timeline.  Somewhere after 1.10.
---
Source: played a mage, used decursive until they broke it.  Then used a much less automated version.
---
Absolutely, Demi. I’ve already met many people who are waiting for Classic just for twinking
---
Everybody saw it, they reported it because it was affecting them even if it was not breaking any rules.
---
Unrelated question, what does "gate-keep discussion" mean?
---
&gt; First looting the mob doesn't count towards skinning time, you were going to do that anyway.
---
No, but the looting delay also applies to the skin you loot from the body after skinning it. Though I'm not sure if it has much practical effect when multiple items are present.
---
Also, auto-loot has existed in the game since patch 1.9, so all private servers have it.
---
Oh nice, another person talking out of his ass. Everyone else, just move along, no valid arguments here.
---
r/hydrohomies
---
Ah, so patchwerk... that's it?
---
You are bad.
---
There was surprisingly little loot drama when I raided up to BWL on pserver in 2017 for this reason. There's a website which states which are council items and which are free roll.
---
Often the council items will go to a roll between eligible members, other times they're pre allocated. About as fair as you're gonna get and while it might benefit key guild figures, well, so do most DKP models.
---
Can you show me example of RP event on a Beta where streamers interfere with RP events?
---
I can agree with no interference but I would like to point out that Blizzard can do whatever they want.
---
"Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions."
---
If he was reported enough and GMs decided to act because it did not promote an enjoyable environment - that's entirely a Blizzard decision.
---
Druid has a lower skill cap than warrior but a higher level of preparation. They're comparable tanks, with warriors edging out on some fights, while you edge out on threat based fights.
---
Thank you.
---
I’d go to a public library/McDonald’s for the updates. As long as the game latency is below 300ms, it might be worth the effort.
---
Maybe they should get over it and realize that they cannot control the game world and that this was part of the vanilla experience, the community part of the game also involves dealing with annoying people.
---
&gt; To be fair, mages are relatively easy in classic,
---
this comment here officer
---
Depends on your talent setup. If you spec ret early, yeah, it kind of sucks, but if you start with 11 points in holy and quest for Varigan's Fist ASAP  (and by doing it you do a handful of dungeons, netting you more gear on top of a level 30 quality weapon at level 20) you should hit your mid 20s in full stride and zoom to 35 so you can hit Reckoning. With sitcrit working with spell batching, it's 2h reckoning from there on out. 
---
Early levels fucking blow, but from about 20 onward its smooth sailing. Really not as bad as people say.
---
You can heal in your hybrid build though, but the absolute majority of people I've known rerolled other class or leveled up a second character eventually. "Jack of all trades - master of none" is not for everyone once you realize the price you pay for this deal.
---
I loved it. Only gripe was giving things like mounts etc.
---
Hi, /u/absolutezero010
---
I'm an advocate for playing druid even though in vanilla I only had a druid alt. My least favourite thing about druids is they only have a rez on a 30 min timer.
---
Kinda annoying if you want to solo heal 5 mans.
---
Slow weapon = best weapon. Part of the reason has to do with extra swings you can get from trinkets, riposte, windfury, etc. Part of the reason is ability damage (like Sinister Strike) is partially determined by the top-end of your weapon.
---
As I have said previously (and got shot down for), Beta is not done in this fashion for bug testing, but as a marketing tool.
---
If you wanna test for bugs, you do an open beta, or widespread beta.
---
If you wanna market your product, you make it a limited access thing, and ensure to get as many popular streamers inside as possible.
---
except most researchers today dont believe the kopesh was held with its false edge as a cutting implement. in fact the ones found that were sharpened were only sharpened on the outer curve... this is one of those sword myths that just wont seem to die.
---
Their mana is not an issue when using consumes. They just have no spell pen talents and poor scaling so they end up getting more resists than other casters. Not quite as bad as an elemental shaman in PvE, but fairly bad.
---
its fully doable, memorizing the pathing of the starting quests is key, and for horde the 1-20 grind is pretty linear, the issue you will encounter on launch is that the optimal pathing for barrens will bring you back to lower level areas multiple times for chains, and by the second or third visit the place is going to be swarming with players  
---
but if they dont fix layering issues, it can easily be exploited by a bank alt parked in a major city or the starting zone, just pop in and out of layers until you find a fresh one then hop back on the main ( /who barrens or whatever to see if its overpopulated and keep spawning new layers)
---
Fortunately for you retail already had all this excitement available for you to enjoy it.
---
Yeah yeah I know that this was some low quality bait.
---
Do warlocks need to resummon their pets after death? 
---
I.e. will I need to resummon a pet every time I die in a battleground?
---
Does your character get deleted or you can just continue when classic drops?
---
They couldn't since the area is uncontested. With that being said, Venruki did sheep an alliance by mistake which made him PvP flagged. But alliance didn't disrupt.
---
Source for this information?
---
It's so nice to hear some more transmog love. I got in a rabbit hole cause hearing people against transmog is totally new to me. I came to the game an RPer first. I liked the idea of customizing MY character.
---
I made the point just earlier today that I feel MORE immersed when my character looks like what I imagine them, when I spend time and effort getting an outfit/weapon/mount/pet combo just right so I can identify with them more.
---
For instance, my druid in vanilla - moose antlers, mage armor, priest armor, rogue armor, and the lava dredger. I didn't feel super powerful, I was just wearing whatever was the best drop I got when competing against others. 
---
My druid now - has an identity. She worships Malorne and when the Malorne set out I was OVER THE MOON. I have a tree staff she uses from Ulduar and I love the white fawn pet I can use on her now.
---
There's all sorts of reasons transmog can work. Why can't my character just say "look, this is a sentimental outfit for me can you reforge/craft this thing to be more powerful but look like this thing i actually care about?"
---
I have 10 druids and each has a completely different feel thanks to transmog! My former orange haired troll druid who had the claws of shirvallah weretiger form and lots of bones/hide/orange gear. My flame druid who wears burning and red pieces and uses the Staghelm firecat form. My Malorne druid in all whites who turns into stars and uses Stag form for a mount. My blue Talon druid who uses blue rogue leathers, twin daggers, and a blue magetower cat form. My brown and red tauren bear druid who is a defender of her people and full of Horde pride. My polar/arctic themed tauren in whites and greys and heavy pelts.
---
Without transmog, most of them would all be in the exact same gear with the same weapons looking like a factory assembly line.
---
Transmog means people actually look different now, especially in a game that for a long time had very few races and each races have very limited amounts of customization as it is. People complain about older things no longer being valid because they're outdated, but transmog means armor is ALWAYS valid because it can ALWAYS be used. There's so many druid sets I hate and so many old pieces of gear I love...and so many old pieces of gear that didn't have matching pieces that I can match now with NEWER pieces to come up with new combinations!
---
I still wear my Naxx Dreamwalker set. To me, it was the epitome of everything my first emerald druid was. It was elegant and so clean with the gold and green and white. Thanks to transmog, after she worked so so hard to get it...I never have to take it off.
---
&gt; Whoever is better deserves to win
---
&gt;They seemed very relaxed and even justified griefing people in WSG by farming them for hours without finishing the game, so tell me when exactly is it acceptable to do this? Only when it benefits then.
---
Irrelevant, classic didn't have timers - current wow does. Within the rules of Vanilla WSG could take hours - this is not the same and people either need to learn the difference of just cry in a corner for eternity.
---
&gt;I also find it laughable that the justification now is that the beta has a different TOS therefore it was acceptable to remove someone that was affecting their event by simultaneously exploiting the terrain to hold such event, this is why people continue to point out the privilege that these people have.
---
There was no mention of a different TOS - I said and will say it again, maybe you'll understand this time. This is a closed beta. That blizzard invited specific people to. That in itself is fucking favoritism. To thinn that the favoritism wouldn't extend beyond the invite is nobody's fault but your own.
---
Not saying it's okay and I'm not saying it belongs to be ignored when Classic is actually live - what I'm saying and will continue to say is - after you report something - that's the end of the story.
---
Blizzard gets to decide what does and doesn't happen in their game. If they want to give asmongold 10,000 gold at level one on Ausgust 26th - they are allowed to do that.
---
To think it needs to be or should be fair is being self righteous and partially delusional.
---
If you don't think ninja gets special treatment or shroud or doc... hello!
---
You have to be special kind of stupid if you don't understand that betas are there to benefit the product and the company. Who the hell would have beta stage just to have people doing actions that don't benefit thr reasoning behind beta.
---
Asmon and 90% of streamers are drama creating wastes. Dont give them one second of attention or the cancer will only grow.
---
enjoy getting shadowban for your inconsiderate coment  
---
community come together to do some nice event, almost 200k views on twitch, and you defend this troll?
---
Now that's just false. https://wow.gamepedia.com/Keyring
---
Can you give an example of this macro for poly?
---
TBC made 1-60 faster. Vanilla feels slower but more focused.
---
That part where Blazer kills the guy attempting to rape the female mage in Part 3 is the most incredible moment for me -- aside from the training scene with Blazer/Mograine and the final battle. That music that plays... holy shit.
---
oh my god, this is epic and evil... To get the flute you have to not turn in the quest right?
---
That explains it. I’m just not a PvP guy, I’ve been hearing his name a lot since classic beta, guess I’ll look him up
---

---
I could find these all day. And before you say "speedrunning doesn't matter" it is literally the ONLY thing left for Hardcore players in Classic WoW. The content's all been done, there's nothing to overcome but besting times and meters.
---
It will be in classic. However it wont be in for a while since its a weapon from Naxx. So a very late stage/phase item.
---
You can always go play on a private server just to experience what you are missing, it would not be a complete representation of the game but it should get you close to satisfy what you are craving.
---
I would wait so that when classic is available for everyone you are able to enjoy to its fullest.
---
He was asking for 50g to stop. Maybe he thought he could make some gold.
---
Apparently done in 11 days /played. Lol.
---
this only applies to unskilled hunters/players in general  
---
hunters can kite mobs, and aslong as they know how their autoshots work, they can mow down a mob before it even gets too close, locks have to cast then lose cast time when they take inevitable hits
---
Yeah, I completely agree. I think retail is way too portal reliant. It makes sense for some places like Outland and Deepholm, but they shouldnt completely invalidate zeppelins/trams.
---
Can't find the Blizzard post giving out the exact info, but it has been said that they will get new names.  
---
I doubt they will get names as 'Leeroy' and 'Mankrik'. That's not blizzlike.
---
Nothing like telling people what to enjoy =P Besides which, i already have. I enjoyed legion due to the pvp, haven't enjoyed the pve for almost a decade though. Legion had actual competitive integrity, bfa threw it out the window - meaning the story is the only thing left that i actually enjoyed, and obviously it alone is not enough to carry the game. I left a few months into BFA, as much because just about all my friends were quitting as because of the issues they neglected to fix - rampant trinket abuse, deliberately obscured and faulty gearing system, poor class design.  
---
Did not know that last part, that certainly is exciting. CD projekt red is about as good as it gets in this industry - though they have their faults 2, sad to say, like grossly overworking their employees to the point of abuse. It may be the standard of the industry to do so at this point, and many will defend them because they like their game.
---
In raids, you'll need to be a healer, or a very dedicated tank. Damage isn't a serious option.  
---
Druid healing kind of sucks (compared to others) until naxx, and even then. But you make up for it with utility like innervate, battlerez, etc. Personally, I find playing druid healing particularly boring because their heal is so slow. It's like playing wack-a-mole with a weighted mallot.  
---
Having said all that, druids do dominate in PVP. Talented druids are one of the best flag runners, and essential to WSG. You'll never, ever have a hard time finding a group for PVP. If you're any good, people will literally swarm to you.
---
If you don't see where he's coming from, you're too stupid to bother explaining further.  Hot tip for ya.
---
I imagine this works better than most systems when you have organized guild leadership. But I feel like this has a much larger time commitment to maintaining it than other DKP systems. Especially once you're managing 3 tiers of loot across multiple raid groups in larger guilds.
---
I'd be hesitant to go this route in a more casual guild.
---
Yepp, i find it unbelieveable that people don't understand this simple fact. Betas are there for a reason. Company wants something when they have betas. If there are actions that don't benefit the goals of the beta they will react.
---
I am a complete classic noob so I only had the streamer commentary to go from. But I didn't hear a single one mention mage as a top contender honestly.
---
You are so fragile dude.
---
Theres no shame in learning from better players bud. you’ll eventually get there.
---
Regardless, the khopesh isn't the only blade with a forwards curve.
---
that tauren douche thout it was fun to destroy an nice comunity event with irl money prizes....   
---
probably he is a bully irl also, i only hope he got banned not just from beta, but from retail also
---
You'll regret any class you play if you care about being the best more than having fun.
---
Heal or don't - just understand why you won't be invited to certain things and don't take it personal.
---
Well there you go. For the people who want to play an MMO, this is great value to them.
---
Warriors are literally the best class overall in the game. Highest end game dps, best tanks. And they are monsters in premade BG PvP. They can be annoying to level solo and they are not very good in duels unless you play the correct race with the correct items. So I'd say it's worth it. And if you put in the time to get good and geared as a tank. Well, you'll be treated like royalty.
---
Yes, the main majority of these interruptions were on the same factions, considering most RP takes place in major cities and faction towns with guards, a bunch of lvl1 alts wouldn't be able to do much harm to the opposite faction. The time span of this varied, but yes, and if there's a time limit on how long you are allowed to do this, then that needs to be stated.
---
I can bet you that they got reported, I've spent years on RP servers, and if there's one thing you can be certain of, it's that trolling on this scale will be reported by several people. Disrupting RP events is something RPers don't take kindly to, and blizz has stated themselves that this isn't acceptable. No, nothing came of them, the major streamers just continued on without even being booted.
---
People defidently get favorited, but that isn't a freaking excuse for a multimillion company to do this, companies have been taken out of business by class action lawsuits for less. The fact that you argue like we should just accept this is frightening. 
---
When streamers gets payed to play games, the company is announcing that it's an official thing, an event of sorts. Blizzard has done no such thing, and trollgodx represents wow beta just as much as sodapopin.
---
Aah killing a hunter's pet is a classic. I played a undead rogue on a pserver and ganking lowbies can get stale after a while. 
---
So what i did was sap the hunter, kill his pet then go into stealth before the sap broke. Cue watching the the hunter freak out for bit before running off. At which point i stalk him and do the same thing if he tries to resummon his precious companion.
---
Mouse over in general is good for healers 
---
Never understood why so many get healing mods when this simple tweak for healing macros is all you need.
---
Maybe even a new continent and flying mounts
---
Just heal in PvE and respec into the fun feral charge pvp build afterwards. You probably won't have much spellpower until the later patches. I would love to see how mad mages and warlocks get if you got your paws on any good spellpower raid drops :) if your guild let you bid on them of course.
---
Overall -- don't get tricked into thinking you can play a deep balance druid in a raid and not be dead weight.
---
I appreciate the tips. I've leveled several 60's in vanilla, and I usually get my mount around 47-49.
---
 perplexity was casting this? Whelp I wish i knew, I was watching from the duelers perspectives(I had ven's and snuts streams open side by side ect.). Would have been legit to watch him cast it though!
---
That’s a real bummer. My guild used to have two gay men and I still drink coffee and go out with them from time to time. We had a great time and they contribute a lot to my vanilla guild’s culture as diversity empowered our gaming experience. They both returning for classic .
---
You’ll need to find/choose that one guild which does not tolerate discrimination and guildies do not look down and frown on others.
---
I wish you good luck on your classic endeavours!
---
So... Because... It's beta... Asmongold has a free card to violate TOS on retail? Yes, I'm having problems understanding your point. Please elaborate without leaving parts out from the arguments.
---
If you zerg to 30 in less than 24 hours after launch, which is entirely possible, you're not going to have a problem with other people. And you're saying vendor all versus mail all as if mailing all takes more than a few seconds longer.
---
This is the best way. Blizzard knows what they want to achieve with beta. They know what actions are beneficial for the beta and what is just stupid assholes doing stupid asshole stuff.
---
Then how is trollgodx any different from asmongold? Blizzard gave them both access, equal playing field.
---
healing.
---
while PvE isn't too interesting, unless things start getting hectic, in PvP, there's a hellva lot that you need to pay attention to, especially as a healer. it's a careful balance between using mana, healing, removing buffs/debuffs, applying crowd control and with how tight resources generally are in Classic/Vanilla, it means if you end up wasting unnecessary casts, you'll find yourself behind the curve *quick*. 
---
you're also the prime target of... pretty much everyone, so, you better pray you know how to survive and heal at the same time.
---
Dragon Killing Points. A way for people to gain currency from killing raid bosses that they can spend on loot. People often think that DKP is a system to distribute fairly. Whilst this is true to an extent, its mostly a way of dangling a carrot on a stick infront of people to make sure they log in on raid nights.
---
deleted, none of blizzard's betas have retained characters after the beta is done
---
But doing asshole stuff is part of the game. They shouldn’t need godly blizzard intervention
---
How? Since you cant crate horde and ally on same pvp server in Classic
---
Not to mention NMP said the same thing during tourney start and Soda corrected him that they deliberately fucked with Asmon's world events.
---
Welcome to the reason DKP is always a better bet.
---
On a new server launch the best way to get ahead with regard to everything is to level fast and make alot of gold. The importance of gold can NOT be understated.
---
I actually dreamt I get into beta last night and it was awesome. Classic is taking over my brain.
---
Doesn't exactly matter if he didn't do it in-game.
---
After that it all went down =/ I want an official wotlk server so bad... Guess I should be grateful that we get classic at least =)
---
Well dont know what to say about that but frost mages are always strong in pvp and they get their ice block at lvl 30 which is huge compared to for example, shadow priests who dont have their shadowform yet or warriors and their MS.
---
/run c=CastSpellByName s="Polymorph(Rank 4)" if UnitExists("mouseover") then TargetUnit("mouseover") c(s) TargetLastTarget() else c(s) end
---
You’re here.
---
You are still mixing up stuff. Retail ToS doesn't have anything to do with Beta. Your comparison between live service and beta id totally borderline retarded. You need to understand that concept before you start whining. If you can't understand the reason(s) why company might want to have beta and why they have the right to decide what actions are beneficial for the goals of the beta and what aren't you need to start educating yourself a little bit.
---
that's included in the post, but I listed it under fear instead of MC :)
---
if you want the beta just to know what the game feels like go play on a private server to get the closest experience you can prior to classic launch, if you want beta to try and find bugs then just hope that someone else is as dedicated as you are and are doing all they can to find the bugs and report them.
---
there is no point getting worked up hoping to get in beta at all, i check every day and if i get in i will do all i can to bug find if i don't its no big loss i played back in vanilla so the nostalgia is real but i have waited this long for them to release a classic server i can wait 3 more months
---
I live next door in northern Ireland m8. Our summer was on a Wednesday this year they already missed it.
---
lol is there a subreddit for everything ?
---
Id say in a couple years they will probably release TBC and then wrath bro.. be patient and lets hope for the best 😉
---
this is great and i never knew about it because i play horde!
---
Yeah he should just facetank and dps race them. Definitely the mages strength!
---
Honestly I think druid actually has less build variety when it comes to raiding.
---
If you're gonna raid as hotw or cat spec, you can't expect to generate nearly as much threat as a pure bear tank. You also won't have leader of the pack with the standard hotw spec.
---
At that point, it's really hard to justify a druid tank when you can just have one of your fury warriors tank.
---
Hi GoodRecipie,
---
I can see that you've already got a ton of replies, so I'm not sure if you will see this, but I'm in a position to offer a bit of a unique perspective because I've leveled a horde druid to 60 on private servers, and I'm currently leveling an ally druid on the same server.
---
I'm definitely going to be playing a druid in classic. For me now, it's just a case of whether I play alliance or horde. There are two things that you have to accept before or at least *while* playing a druid.
---
The first is that having an unreliable rez as a healer is a big buzzkill. If you choose to heal when doing dungeons, people will (quite understandably) put you on a lower priority than other healers. This is because you can't rez more than 1 person every 30 minutes. It is a big hit to morale when you're doing Sunken Temple, doing the trash pack before the final boss and in a moment of lag, your tank dies. Your rez is on CD and he now has to walk all the way back. It sucks. That's the first main problem with playing a druid. That feeling of "well fuck. if they brought a different healer..."
---
The second is that you will be the subject of a lot of hate. People will tell you that "all your specs are suboptimal. why play a feral cat when you can play a rogue..."... "you need crowd pummeler for feral to even step outside of memespecland..." and repeat for all your other forms and specs. The fact is that druid is a perfect blend of everything that leads to incredibly fulfilling gameplay. Depending on the toxicity of the region (this subreddit is deeply toxic), it might be better or worse. The toxicity actually almost caused me to re-roll around level 52.
---
However! Provided that you're willing to accept the above two points, I can tell you about all the positives that you can expect as a druid, and there are a LOT.
---
Druid is the only class in the game where you can fulfill all four ingame roles through different spec setups (tank, healer, melee DPs, ranged DPs). Let's say that you've committed to being a boomkin at 60, but you're starting to get bored. You're feeling a bit regretful (this could apply to any spec- not descriminating) that you chose ranged DPs. You want to get in close to the enemy like a rogue. Fantastic - Let's start doing dungeons and getting some gear together to make that happen! It's a very good idea to setup your group in such a way that you have no rogues though, if you want no competition on the gear.
---
Just sitting around in Orgrimmar and fancy a bit of excitement? Throw on your feral gear and stealth into Stormwind! My personal favourite area was the long hall in the throne-room or the library. Stealth gives you nearly everything a rogue has, except you also have a self-heal. This allows you to do stealth-chest runs too.
---
I'll conclude with perhaps the biggest 'boon' of playing a druid. The game is entirely yours. You decide exactly what you want to do. I can't tell you how many times I've managed to solo a group quest because noone was online in the area, just by abusing bear form/heals/roots. Perhaps my most satisfying moment was proving others wrong that a druid can also AoE farm.
---
On private servers, it was commonly said that there are only 2-3 classes (mages, warlock and priest, say) that can solo the lashers in DM:E for money. But I constructed my own spec, and managed to find a way to farm the lashers as a druid! (specing into extra damage thorns, armour, moonkin form, etc) That's how I bought my epic mount!
---
If you have any questions for me about druids or the process, let me know and I'll be happy to answer.
---
Look at it from the perspective of a guild/raid leader, would you bring someone that is only able to provide below average heals/DPS? 
---
If you are able to understand that not everyone will be OK with your proposition, then feel free to roll any class and spec into any role that fits YOUR style of playing.
---
Having said that, I would 100% advise you to go with a Druid, it would be very difficult, regardless of the role you want to play, that any groups will not benefit from you, roll what you will enjoy and not what other people feel that is enjoyable.
---
Discovered him during classic beta, sad that I only found out about him recently.
---
The first part sucks - it's unfortunate that blizzard chose to not do anything about it at the time.
---
&gt;People defidently get favorited, but that isn't a freaking excuse for a multimillion company to do this, companies have been taken out of business by class action lawsuits for less. The fact that you argue like we should just accept this is frightening. 
---
Nepotism exists. If nepotism is capable of existing at Amazon - that proves it is capable of existing anywhere. 
---
I can't get behind the thinking that "companies have been taken out of business for less"
---
Comparing what happens within a video game that you accept a Terms of Service to when logging in... to a real world company being disciplined for playing favorites is actually wild.
---
I hope we never live in a world where those 2 things are remotely comparable. 
---
When people say it's just a game - this is the prime example.
---
Letting something like this affect you is not healthy. You can be bothered by it, report it and then keep reporting it. Just because it's reported doesn't mean anything will happen... every single day in BFA there are the same characters in voldun taking part in what is clearly a botting caravan. Everytime I saw it, I reported each character as much as I could... it was destroying the economy and still does.
---
Am I upset that those bots are still going? Sure am... but it doesn't bother me to my core because I'm playing blizzards game and they chose to do nothing about those bots.
---
This is exactly the same.
---
That would be hilarious ! You are correct. If the weapons you compare are on the same level, then slower weapons swing for much higher dmg.
---
BUT also there are some other merits for slower weapons, as you get a larger window to move around 2.8seconds vs 1.3seconds to run back at your target), easier to anticipate your windfury/procs
---
the beta is already a huge succes, so great to experience everyone coming together and just having fun.
---
Yay! That's almost enough to fill half of a single medium population realm on Retail! /s
---
If the subscriber count on here is a measure of success for WoW Classic, then WoW Classic is fucking doomed.
---
If you are team naxx forever leave everything unmarked except the last option
---
Oh, sure, not to say this is the only solution--you could also hire a mage to port you somewhere, for example. I think it's a good balance of convenience and exploration is all.
---
If no one is special to blizz, then why the difference in treatment? That's literally what special treatment is.
---
Really fun to watch. I just feel like they should have set a time limit per duel. What's the point of having a rule that specifically prohibits to delay a fight for cds when there are players doing exactly that? 
---
I also hope for the next tournaments they will ask support to Blizzard, you couldn't really see the fight with those trolls jumping on players, and they altered the result in one occasion by sitting on the totems.
---
I don't see what's wrong with wanting a re-release of the CE.
---
This type of post is banned from the subreddit until Phase 3.
---
The only choice.
---
Quick look over the post history shows OP posting in the_donald and talking about erectile dysfunction. Always nice to see expectations confirmed.
---
They tried to get someone banned from jumping and standing in locations that were inconvenient to certain entertainers.
---
&gt;When streamers gets payed to play games, the company is announcing that it's an official thing, an event of sorts. Blizzard has done no such thing, and trollgodx represents wow beta just as much as sodapopin.
---
Sorry forgot to mention this part -
---
Partnerships and favoritism are 2 different things and should be treated as such.
---
They do represent equal amounts - they don't have the same relationships with blizzard employees though. That's what matters...
---
- have a better relationship with your boss? More likely to get promoted as long as the criteria of work is met.
---
To expect equality in a video game is misguided.
---
Yes, never complete that quest. Eternal flute! (Same thing furbolg illusions. Alliance shouldn't complete that quest so you can keep your furbolg costumes.)
---
No, and I'm not the one excluding this to only beta. I'm saying streamers are notoriously known for doing this on retail, on actual RP servers.
---
Exactly, it is part of the game, not beta. Not sure if you know but beta is not the live service and goals for that differ from the release. If thereis actions in the beta that are not beneficial for the goals of the beta ofc company will interfere.
---
Most people dont use reddit

I'm not the one reporting people for "interrupting my duelling". Explain to me how I am the fragile one here

&gt;Holding the WSG flag hostage forever

And to think... they have flags being shown on the map when that WAS NOT in vanilla... yet people crying that a griefers was dealt with by the owners of the game.

link please? :)
---
Read through all this and there isnt even a point at the end. 4/10 points for cringe comedy
---
That is why i would like to know from a tester :) to use as cross refference from private servers and classic since something does not add up when looking at private server stats and by that i reffer to all. :)

Well, according to that bald vanilla dev dude that streams, it seems like they had at least 2-3 times the content planned for launch. They had to cut a lot of shit in order to release at a decent schedule, but it looks like these guys sat down and went fucking nuts with the lore. So while I wouldn't be surprised if they loosely had some lore being planned, like deathwing being released one day as an example, it may have been something that was intended as just a raid rather than an entire expansion premise that reshapes Azeroth. They probably thought about adding Arthus into the game, but didn't map out Northrend or think of Ulduar yet etc.
---
The original WoW team really seemed to have a passion for the game and like it was really just a bunch of D&amp;D nerds building a world together. Not to insult the retail team and say that I know they don't have any passion, for all I know someone higher up could be stifling their creativity and it not be their fault, but it's clear the last few expansions in WoW have just had all the care, passion and risk-taking that made the original and first few expacks so fun drained out of it. It started before WoD, but that was definitely the biggest hit, imo.
---
I think the success and subsequent streamlining of WoW is actually what made it into the husk it is today and I imagine a lot of the vanilla devs are pretty depressed when they look at retail. I don't think retail is the worst thing ever like everyone else, I think it's designed for different people and following the course of modern gaming. I don't like it, but I also understand why they ended up going that way as such a huge business. It's really just a sad affair all around and I really hope Classic isn't just a one-off to appease the old fans. I really hope this starts something good and changes how WoW is fundamentally developed going forward.
---
&gt; If specs didn't matter, progression-minded people wouldn't enforce the good ones.
---
I didn't say they don't matter, and this is a circular argument. How do we know specs are important? Because people enforce them. Why do people enforce them? Because they're important...
---
Here is your gold award. You deserve it... Nearly died from laughing. 🌟
---
I'm addicted to classic and I can't even play it yet. Blizz need to release early. :)
---
was thinking the same, not a massive fan of streamers but this is the first i have heard of it on the beta, in live most streamers wont be on the RP servers they will be on the PVP ones and if you're complaining that your RP event was invaded on a PVP server the only thing i can say is don't play on a PVP server.
---
if they are deliberately going to an RP server with viewers, again something i have not seen in the past but could be, then they should suffer fully consequences of their actions as that is gerifing for the sake of it and not playing the game
---
I know this, but your example of SS doesn't make sense since its normalized. Extra attacks like sword spec and WF isn't, which is why slow weapons and using SS right after a white swing makes sense (since extra attacks resets swing timer).
---
More raid tiers is winning and rightfully so... just don't increase level cap ever.
---
Hey stop with the changes and the polls, where have you been when people wanted Classic to have the right to call for changes and ruin this for everybody ?
---
Take my updoot sir for having a big set of swingers

Are you sure about that?

How bout different specs on same classes? That makes more sense

I'll host an event with a money pool 10 times that size, an dthe goal is to grief you so much you delete your wow account. Because hey, viewers and money prizes makes any unfair treatment ok, right?
---
Jelly played great and so nearly beat Ven. He is a rank 1 on live so hugely skilled player.
---
I think you nailed it. Private server players have had less competition to push the limits to how fucking good fukn blizzcon champs get.
---
I literally don't care about private server data.
---
Im pulling my hair out bro its fucked hahah
---
Gonna play monoply andp maybe renew my sub for the first time since MOP.. see how we go

Hint: he has none.

He was literally /w people in the game, he threw an insane fit in game.

Yes. Meanwhile dragging Trump into completely unrelated topics is clearly a sign of you 200+ IQ.
---
That's the joy of killing warlock pets. Though I actually can't remember if hunter pets can lose happiness in PVP, anyone remember?
---
There were a few private server players in the tournament. Unfortunately, even though they have superior game knowledge, due to the smaller and less competitive community their mechanical skill wont even come close to a retail glad player.
---
BFA has 1.7 million subs, 25% are secondary accounts, so that's 1,275,000 unique players.
---
Their subreddit has 1,044,801 members.
---
Not looking good.
---
But with the intent he had when writing this. He clearly meant it as in "they were not participating in this tournament".
---
Travel form is the cutest thing in classic - 101% that makes dr00ds the best class &lt;3
---
The so called 'expansion' in reality just make the world shrink as old zones get abandoned while new zone will last until next expansion came out and it too will get abandoned.. 
---
the current state of retail WOW is like that , so sad , whole zones and worlds abandoned and empty , your achievement and hard earned gear from the zone get obsoleted by greens of the new expansion..
---
it is like running toward finish line but they kept moving the finish line ..
---
that is why classic will be great as it is maxxed at 60
---
&gt;I always had high hopes for Classic WoW, but now I'm starting to be amazed by the possibility, that this could become a far greater succes than anyone dared to imagine.
---
And nobody seems to care that blizzard hasn't shared their plans on LAYERING when populations DO NOT decline like they are expecting.
---
If blizzard remains silent on that - layering will kill the enjoyment of playing Classic.
---
Well, it really depends on the size of layers and how aggressive the respawn is. Doesn't take much being forced into grinding.¨
---
&gt; (the plaguelands are so bad, if anything will ruin a speed run its that segment)
---
What's so bad about the Plaguelands? Or are you talking about specific classes having trouble with it?
---
dreaming doesn't take people far
---
Oh I love the blank canvas. It’s like popping a sit every time you reveal a new zone.
---
there's an option for features from retail, though it's rather vague, it could also mean you want stuff like LFR
---
Are you actively playing the ignorance card right now, or just all natural? GRIEFING, AND ESPECIALLY ON RP SERVERS, IN RETAIL, IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF BLIZZARDS RETAIL TOS.
---
Having done some routing on the stress test (after it calmed down), skinning was *massively* helpful at the very start of the game for the extra silver for abilities, skills, tools and bags. Especially that last one. The sooner you can fill up your bag slots, the better, and privates have been dropping *way* too many 6slots at the start of the game.
---
As long as you understand, at the end of the day, Druids don't belong in Hardcore raids.

Yea I loved healing in vanilla. It was very straightforward but if you didnt pay attention the tank would get 1 shot out of nowhere.
---
Snap those DVDs
---
More content available but balancing very carefully the power creep attained from it. It's already bad enough with Naxxramas gear imagine introducing something more powerful.
---
Maybe some content to bridge BWL tier gear with late progression AQ40 and Naxx.

---
Classic WoW and Retail share the same subscription, and even with just 126k active players, an MMO is already profitable...and that is for MMOs that have huge development times and infrastructure setups, both of which Classic doesn't have.
---
Done!
---
😂😂 fucking stone age shit hey
---
Hey man, glad you're enjoying retail and not just bashing on it like most other people in this subreddit, people forget wow its huge and believe it or not they give you a lot of variety in how you can play.
---
i could care less about LFR. i just want to change my hair style and hair color.
---
If Mars gets terraformed, what changes would you like to see?
---
WTF I want that Ret Pally tree
---
I was undecided but since i know deep in my heart im gonna level 1 of each class again, im gonna toss a coin and call it a day
---
I just wish we got strictly no streaming allowed servers because at this rate they will do so much damage :(.
---
ofcourse a mage will beat a rogue 1v1 at lvl 30. The rogue doesn't even have preparation on that level, whereas the mage has cold snap. Furthermore without tidal skull and roket helm and improved sprint is borderline impossible to beat a frost/ elemental mage in 1v1 as a rogue
---
[Yes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvcn3i/some_ideas_on_how_they_could_add_new_content_to/epo18v2/?st=jwg46jkn&amp;sh=a0539f36)

Do you even crop, bro?

Yeah, they ported them both to Winterspring. Which is great! GMs having fun with the trolls is absolutely what happened in 2004. People got ported to time-out cells and random zones all the time. But *banning* them? Ridiculous. Hopefully they weren't actually banned.
---
On a new server launch the best way to get ahead with regard to everything is to level fast and make alot of gold. The importance of gold can NOT be understated. And to give yourself the best odds to go for the Shifting Sands follow the same thought process.
---
Exactly, retail ToS. Beta haves nothing to do with retail and therefore your crying about stuff that happened on beta and comparing the consequneces between them is pointless. Finally you got it! Good boy!
---
I don't understand that, you're just completely wrong but you're too dense to realize it. No one cares about private server data. No one cares that you played on private servers. Its not the same thing and you'll come to realize that when you actually get to play Classic WoW lol
---
Tell me, do you people wake up in the morning thinking: _"Right, what can I be troubled about today to ruin my day as much as possible?"_
---
You CAN report them, but you don't make the decision of what the outcome is.
---
Blizzard does ;)
---
Raided from day 1 until Naxx on a compaq pc as well with a 15" CRT eMachine monitor
---
They could've moved to a high lvl area, or a contested area and have the alliance kill the lvl 1's
---
You people, lol.
---
As of right now you will have the old system of PvP and PvE(Normal) servers. They will come up with new names for the servers. There wont be any RP servers at launch.
---
No, I'm critiquing a multi million dollar company's actions towards their customers on a public media platform to raise awareness and hopefully spark some sort of chain event that leads to changes, or a public statement from one of the parties.
---
Sub numbers aren't public so could you tell me where you got 1.7 mil from?
---
Thanks for the responses :) 
---
I think I'm going to play some Warcraft 1+2+3  to get hooked up on the lore moree
---
I personally think both situations would warrant being teleported away, just like if a tauren on a kodo somehow managed to block a mailbox/AH somehow for hours.  Griefing is griefing and should be remedied when possible.  That being said neither situation would call for a ban, suspension, etc IMO.  Beta server I would think is more closely monitored than retail though so I would expect a quicker response.
---
Hype train, heh
---
I thank. Will make gold teeth for me and me family. Jesture is apprecidated.
---
sure its class specific but still requires cooking skill so if food buffs was banned makes sense when you think about it.
---
I am leveling a rogue in classic. Was planning on mining/engi, but I'm not sure if I should go skinning so I can farm devilsaur at 60 for the gear. What's the best route to take?
---
Yeah at least OP's cousin knows what faction he wants to play, he's one step ahead of me.
---
i don't know why you bothered answering when you deliberately ignore what i'm writing.
---
how many movies are there with 10 man sfk? or pick any instance while leveling? why aren't those in abundance if, as you say, it was a common thing? you could do baron run with 10 man? ppl werent doing 10 mans because you couldn't do the instance quests in a raid and you wanted those rewards. 
---
where are the videos with tanks 2h tanking their way up to lvl 60 in battle stance with deathwish on? why aren't those in abundance if it was such a common thing?
---
mobs hit way harder 90% of vanilla. same as AV that was filled with npcs 90% of vanilla.
---
why is it so hard to accept that we are getting a nerfed version of the game? why do ppl go out of their way to fight against this when is clearly out there?
---
why is it so hard to accept that blizzard is hypocritical when is pushing the "game was hard back then and that led to friendships and good stories" while making the game piss easy?
---
no one said wiping was the norm even though that depend on how experienced your group was. what is debated is why would you make defensive stance, shields or cc in instances obsolete? no one is answering this. this was definitely not the norm. 
---
by pushing this meta you are promoting the brain dead "aoe them down" from retail. that's not what vanilla was about :)
---
Ok, retard. No offense though
---
CHOO CHOO 🚂
---
You can do a comparison with private server numbers, usually there are 2-3 major private servers available at the same time with the modified maximum population we are talking maybe 30-40k people that actively play on them.
---
Now that the game is sanctioned by Blizzard and it will get more publicity you might be looking at least at 50% increase in players, this is without counting the people that are already subscribed to retail who will inevitably try to play classic.
---
I think the game will be in a good position to sustain the existence of several servers which will make it a success for Blizzard.
---
Please do
---
Priest having more people play it then rogue doesn't sound right.
---
I'm going to take a guess here and assume a lot of people think they are going to roll shadow at 60 and expect to be PvP gods. Which you can be, once you get AQ40/Naxx gear while healing
---
Enjoys griefing and posts on T_D. A shocking discovery.
---
Anything that is viable in a raid scenario shouldn't have issues finding a guild to raid with. Warriors, mages and rogues usually fill out the raids.
---
Yes, "you people".
---
Because it seems to me, that there is a special breed of people, who forgot how to enjoy themselves in life, and instead seem to thrive on being miserable, annoyed, outraged or otherwise emotionally at the bottom of the barrel all the time.
---
And of course, in order to not feel so alone, they want everyone else to be miserable with them.
---
No, now you're strawmaning. I'm saying that it's wildly hypocritical by both blizzard and the streamer. And can you show me the beta specific TOS?
---
Of all these polls, I wish people would stop adding #nochanges as an option so we can see if thats off the table, then what their preferences are.
---
teh dude who raided the funeral got permanently banned and their accounts deleted, why is everyone claiming that omergerrd sum1 raided a ingame funeral so everything is fine forget to mention this?  
---
that tauren troll should get banned both from the test realm and from his retail game
---
Dont dog your OCE boys bro. This is our first chance at a good classic experience with low ms and there are tons of us.   
---
1800 members alone just in this discord, that's not even taking into account all the extra people that'll arrive on launch. More than enough for one big healthy server.  
---
 [https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H](https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H)
---
This is quite beautiful. Will definitely check some of those out.
---
Doesn't matter either, there's swear word protection built in the game and you can use the ignore function if you don't approve someone's language. Blizzard isn't the naughty word police and I doubt he was creating lvl 1 alts to circumvent ignores in order to continue harassing people or used any racist or homophobic language or there would be a r/livestreamfail post with 60k upvotes in the front page.
---
The best way to grief people in classic WoW is to play an enhancement, ret, or moonking.
---
I would like more vanilla-like content added to the game. Like what they’re doing with OSRS. Another interesting idea would be to start an alternate timeline after classic reaches its end and release new expansions in a new direction instead of going into TBC.
---
No, it is just you not understanding the concept of beta and the goals companies might want to achieve with it.
---
Now that's interesting. So you're saying that even if you put together a raid to protect the arena, you're expecting trolls in the community raid. Then you should accept that others will also troll, and not get angry when they do. And if trolling gets too you, vanilla might not be the game for you.
---
You're greifing everyone in every battleground you join. And everyone in your guild. And everyone you take loot from. Your very existence is grief.
---
those dudes agot perma banned
---
nice.. does the item dissapear if you abandon the quest or do you have to live with 18/20 quest slots? :P
---
Because you cant bind macros to just clicks.

(Or at least you couldnt when i wanted to do it)

Left click - Lifebloom

Shift Left - Rejuve etc.

For a tournament id rather watch class to class straight up rather than who landed their grenade or not but thats just me.
---
You're acting like they're the final say in everything. You know there's a reason for why they invest time and money into creating a TOS, right? It's because even they have to follow rules, they can't run around doing whatever the fuck they want in a game that we are subscribing to. You're acting like customers don't have any rights at all
---
Yikes dude. People will spend time how they want no matter what you think of them.
---
It's not if it will get updated its when and how, they could easily fill out the crypts of Kara into a little raid or world encounter.
---
Hunters are really easy to level and gear to an acceptable state. However since you said that you like healing. Consider Undead priest. Why undead? Well Shadow priests are already monsters in certain pvp cenarios and everything undead adds to the table just makes that even better. Will of the Forsaken, Cannibalize and the special Devouring Plague unique to undead priests. And priests are great healers as you already know.

---
It doesn't matter what the community thinks it only matters what Blizzard thinks. Real classic has untraceable alts as well...
---
Blizzard has done this since 2004. They used to port trolls away to distant zones and time-out cells all the time when they were excessively harassing people rather than banning them outright.
---
The ideas that either Blizzard should do nothing, or that Blizzard should ban the trolls, are both completely antithetical to Classic WoW. They handled it perfectly.
---
Whether or not they've failed to step in for certain RP events in retail, I don't know, because I have no interest in retail. All I know is what happened in vanilla is the same as what happened last night.
---
Actually, the lesson No. 1 against bullying in Primary School I learned, was take off my shoe, and hit the bully hard in the face with it. It's surprising how much damage even a scrawny weakling like I was, can do to an unsuspecting face using a blunt, solid object.
---
I was seen as kind of a psycho for the next 2 years, but never bullied again =)
---
This is my point exactly. I'm not excusing trollgodxs behaviour, I'm calling out unfair treatment.
---
But hey, I'm guessing you didn't play during cata release? There were a bunch of people mountblocking the flight trainer for an entire day.
---
Everything that involves world of warcraft the video game.
---
Yes.
---
Customers have the right to play fairly or not play at all
---
I don't sign in to fortnite and expect free vbucks because I logged 20 hours... if blizzard wants you or me gone... we are gone. 
---
I'm not saying they will abuse their power, because they owe it to their customers to be fair and just.
---
I mean, you could try not to insult others and not add a "lol" at the end of them
---
Tread lightly, it was hard... 
---
To get 39 other people to stay logged on and buffed
---
Why would he get banned? He wasn't breaking any rules and just because it was an event you liked doesn't make it more important than whatever stupidity was going through his head at the time.
---
How many people are supposed to be on a high-population server before a queue kicks in? 2,500?
---
Well that better be the case because if this shit happens in the Live version I would be disappointed
---
My point is pressing the macro while you're mouse is over a target is no different than that.
---
Agree, engineering should have been left out, especially since some of the items benefits some classes more than others.
---
Back in the day we had human paladin named Dan in our guild. Just Dan.
---
Wait seriously? Source?
---
That website is a bad metric. It only counts max-level players that have certain end-game accomplishments.
---
Retail has 1.275M unique subscriptions and their subreddit has 1.044M members - I'd say it's a pretty good metric.
---
Dude, you're strawmaning. I'm not arguing with you when you clearly can't argue on the point, and need to ignore things the opponent presents as arguments because you don't know how to address it.
---
In Vanilla it was 3seconds to skin once you got to Artisan level ([source](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Skinning)).
---
Why are you here then?
---
So what you say is git gut and be stronger than yhe ganker. That would also help.
---
Shadow priests are one of the best 1v1 classes in the game. Especially if you're playing Undead. Don't expect to dps as shadow in raids tho. Maybe every now and then but not as a rule.
---
He said in past streams that he had found sponsors.
---
&gt; That is the most succinct and straightforward way to understand this concept.
---
There's still a question how many Big Macs you could buy with your salary in 2004 vs 2019.
---
I am sorry to inform you but it is not me who is strawmanning.
---
&gt;If you don't have anything nice to say don't say it... right pah?
---
If you have something uncomfortable to say, that has a purpose in this world, like criticism, then say it.
---
Problem is, you don't want to contribute anything to the discussion. When you talk about layering, you don't discuss Pros and Cons, or make an argument. You just go _"LAYERING! SO BAAAAD! ALL RUINED!!"_, relying on the agreement of people like you to stand in for arguments.
---
And failing that, you go straight to completely absurd insults:
---
&gt;You layering apologist! 😂😂😂😂
---
You can put in as many smileys as you want, you are not making an argument, and you are not convincing anyone like this, except people who want to feel shit all the time as well.
---
But that suggests I should be seeing a 2.5 second cast now in the Beta and I'm not.
---
Not 100% true. Yeah it would make more sense and calling them spells is stupid but the game does it itself. They are spells as far as macros are concerned for instance. The game itself doesn't differentiate the 2. Yes costing mana is what determines if a spell can be downranked but as far as the game is concerned all abilities are spells. Its jus the name the game/engine uses. Would it make more sense to call them abilities? sure
---
I don't really know who you are talking about but I have been watching most of the APES guys streams and they have pretty much all said, when asked about it, that they may have a bit of a edge right now but all the skilled retail players will catch up VERY fast.
---
Ok, then I guess you'll react pretty strongly when streamers starts griefing in classic after release then, correct?
---
&gt;If you simply vendor all these items, you end up with 144g 95s 34c, which comes out to roughly 43 gold per hour.
---
This doesn't add up at all. Or am I stupid?
---
That's the flaw though (and I do thank you for taking the time to reply)
---
- their use of layering is to ensure a smooth launch where everyone gets to login and play, correct?
---
Not only do they want that, they want to not have to merge low populated (dead) servers like they had to for years before they implemented sharding.
---
It's not possible nor plausible for them to remove layering 3 months into Classic if  a server has 4 layers constant capped out on their 3-4k player limit.
---
So when a server or servers have 12k people playing on them, are we under the assumption they will merge all layers into 1 (which is their rough idea of what they are going to do) when "population dies down"
---
So launch will be playable but not phase 2?
---
keybind  your movement A and D buttons to "stare left right" and move you camera with mouse only, helps a lot for someone who does not use it this way
---
and get used to keybinds asap ;) 
---
from macros, very handy is line /stopcasting into counterspell for example
---
You've made me wanna resub to RP... Dwarf hunter who can only wear what he skins and crafts.
---
I'm sure addons will pop up along the way. Remember EPGP in TBC?
---
If you think that this only happens in the beta and it's strictly for publicity that Blizzard is caving to these entertainers you are in for a rude awakening.
---
Rebalancing Classes because some specs are just useless.
---
Then explain the reason for TOS being required by companies to provide then
---
Hi, /u/chestertons
---
"He's right here!"
---
made me giggle
---
So what you're saying is, the macro API we're using doesn't allow targeting totems. And it won't ever.
---
Stop troubling your head with such matters mkay.

Uhm no. Vael is exactly the fight where the Druid starts tanking. You will have 15 melee all using their adrenaline rush, trinkets, Death Wish etc. You need the threat from a Druid using MCP.
---
The whole point is that having a Druid lets you kill the boss before Burning Adrenaline kills the tank which means you save World Buffs.
---
Without cross-realm, scamming gets you locked out of shit. People remember your name, call you out and will even put you on lists and talk about you in forums. Scamming never worked (more than a few tries) in these games. 
---
He came here to validate his shitty behavior and brag as if any of us give a shit. He probably had a half-chub while he was writing this and smiling the entire time. Whatever gets him off, I guess.
---
Not really. I can talk like a gay guy if I want to. And yes, anatomically speaking that is.
---
i do like the bfa zones a ton tho. but yeah the old zones are only good for a questing experience solo or with friends. or farming mats or archaeology, or collecting pets. and maybe some other stuff.
---
&gt; WoW was the last stronghold of this type of behavior and culture...  
---
... when Blizzard began to cave to the carebears late into vanilla or beginning of TBC 
---
What on earth have you been smoking while on your "I'm such a badass"-buzz? WoW never had such a culture. Unless you're talking about the stuff people like Angwe did, which is nothing like what you're describing.
---
There's a reason gms say "there's nothing we can do, they don't violate TOS" time after time.
---
For tauren players... /tar arra
---
No, because after a wipe you dont have world buffs anymore. The threat from MCP wont be needed at that point.
---
Each has it's use, but it all boils down to conserving mana and using low rank spells when you need a certain effect but not thier dmg/ cant afford the cast time. R1 Fireballs is a quick dot for rogues, r1 manashield is the cheapest self buff you have and can protect your other buffs from dispels, R1 fireblast for instant totem clearing, AM for keeping targets in combat behind LoS, etc....
---
No idea why people downvote this, but any mage worth thier salt is going to have 50-60ish keybinds
---
&gt; Funny how the nochanges crowd suddenly gets uptight and wants GM  intervention when their streamer gods can't run a tourney uninterrupted 
---
Just wait till lvl 60 + content :D
---
One of us, one of us
---
There is plenty of people in oce that will play
---
Runecloth. So much runecloth. I became sick to death of runecloth. THAT was the only way you could get rep in vanilla for another race's mounts on your same faction besides doing quests.
---
I don't know what they'll change or not but do NOT make it a post end game goal. In vanilla, you didn't GET rep OR exp when you outleveled a quest and it turned grey.
---
You wanted another race's mount? Best way was to run over to their zone ASAP and beginning doing their racial zones, doing every single one and trying not to outlevel them in the process. The higher difficulty level it was to you, the more rep you got (though I think red still gave you very little, but orange/yellow were best). Turns grey? You just wasted your time and should move on.
---
Quests that gave +faction rep were also good to utilize. They really helped. Then you'd have different cloth turn ins, until the highest cloth - runecloth. Then you farm runecloth like a mad person and constantly turn in stacks of it to watch that bar move.
---
I spent almost all of my time in vanilla unlocking the faction mounts on all alliance races. I met my husband playing WoW and he devoted all of HIS time to helping me farm and turn in runecloth.
---
We used to joke my hands were stained PINK from the stuff in game.
---
We just celebrated our 7th wedding anniversary today, but we met 15 years ago. I still have nightmares about runecloth turn-ins.
---
Which translates to 10€ per month. That's cheap as shit and with the inflation (23%) the game is like half the price per month for EU compared to 2005.
---
As with everything regarding Classic WoW. People like to exaggerate everything, both good and bad. It is true that you want fewer Warlocks than lets say Warriors or Mages. But there are also fewer Warlock players. If you manage to get in to a guild and you do what you are supposed to. Well then there shouldnt be an issue at all.
---
You actually believe that screenshot? Look at the addon description. This is not lfd
---
I love his energy hahha
---
Thank you for this. Do you know/recall if we had the ability to "split" Nexus Crystals into Large Brills?
---
Classic 1.8?
---
&gt;Problem is, you don't want to contribute anything to the discussion. When you talk about layering, you don't discuss Pros and Cons, or make an argument. You just go "LAYERING! SO BAAAAD! ALL RUINED!!", relying on the agreement of people like you to stand in for arguments.
---
I've commented on it thoroughly and spoke my piece on potential solutions - hey when you meet someone at the store, do you know the knowledge or conversations they have had in the past? Or do you just call them emotionally empty?
---
&gt;You can put in as many smileys as you want, you are not making an argument, and you are not convincing anyone like this, except people who want to feel shit all the time as well.
---
Man you really have a vendetta against anyone who isn't as happy as you huh? But instead of reaching out a hand you rather walk on by. That makes sense in the land of rainbow though.
---
To not have a discussion and dismiss the possibility if one is all on you when you are the one seeking replies.
---
Unless you were only posting for feeling fuzzy.
---
You can abandon the quests. I havw the furbolg rod on my beta toon and an empty quest log.
---
When did i say this only happens in beta or said Blizzard do this for publicity? I said beta is not retail and comparing consequences for actions between is pointless and the reasoning for having beta differs a lot from live service.
---
Yes I understand. My point is you cant bind macros to clicks. Its fine if you just want to mouseover and press a key though.
---
Whats the point? Just watch it on stream it on stream. Its a better view and there is no chance you get in the way.
---
Not really true. They can hang in there given they are playing the correct race with the correct items. Alot of the items are already updated as the game will be based on the 1.12 patch. Look it up.
---
Eve online maybe the mmo for you then. The GM’s tolerate everything from scams to elaborate double crosses to long cons. There’s a complex economy to master and play, robust pvp, heck you couple play a bounty hunter if you do chose.
---
The so called “care bear” aspects of wow are called decent human behavior. My only complaint about wow is the lack of world pvp objectives that encourage healthy competition between the factions. TBC tried this and failed. The BG’s are too disconnected and end up feeling like any other MP game with multiple maps. But world bosses, killing griefers, or competition over grind spots should offer enough wpvp in Classic for me.
---
If your goal is to be an anti-social asshole than WoW probably isn’t the game for you. And good riddance. The shit you talk about ruins people’s games to such a degree they quit and the game dies. It’s only fun to you and honestly only seems they imo. It’s much more rewarding to cooperate and overcome.
---
That said Eve online exists. If that’s your cup of tea then okay. Just don’t delude yourself that allowing this toxic behavior would make WOW better. Vanilla became the king of mmos because they did it better than almost anyone else and cultivating a community was one of those things.
---
if they take the Oldschool Runescape way I want to see more raid tiers in the style of vanilla wow
---
Tirisfal looks quite nice when the sun’s out
---
Hey look, the conservative five choices I chose are also the top five results. Expect Blizz to use the top 10. It will suck,. no matter what they do.
---
And if you don't like it, play on a PvE realm. But don't complain when "allies are bodyblocking things, someone stop this griefing"
---
Damn.. thats pretty low.
---
I guess Alliance bank alts with tailoring have it good. Even a horde druid would have to level to lvl 14 before they could get any. Not very time efficient if your main goal is to rush to 60 still.
---
But if you are in no rush I guess a horde player will just have to lvl a druid alt.
---
Vendor prices:
---
* Ruined Leather Scraps = 7c
---
* Light Leather = 15c
---
* Medium Leather = 50c
---
* Heavy Leather = 1s 50c
---
* Thick Leather = 3s
---
* Rugged Leather = 5s
---
612*7+900*15+1545*50+1610*150+3195*300+309*500
---
That's 1449534 copper or 144g 95s 34c.
---
Skinning that many mobs will cost you 8169*1.5 seconds which is ~204 minutes or ~3.4 hours
---
So that's 42g 63s 33c per hour.
---
Then it's a bug that needs reporting.
---
There are several smart ways you can do this efficiently before raids etc. There are guides out there. Some nifty tricks and stuff. Look it up.
---
So their customers or employees are in full awareness of what is acceptable (dress code etc) and what is required (punctuality etc)
---
TOS isn't implemented to be a "gotcha" tool... it's to establish that the ones running the show have the final say.
---
You as the employee or customer are required to look through the TOS and either accept or decline them.
---
2,500 sounds fair.
---
Depending on how we get to lock in character names we might have the client by that eate
---
Only I thought that is a short film will come for real? **😂🤣**
---
That is definitely one theory. This launch is unlike any we've ever seen so I'd rather lose a couple gold and guarentee my place in the race past the pack.
---
If it’s “always been your favorite class” then why would anything people on reddit say change your mind about such a subjective matter
---
They could use Karazhan Crypts, Azshara Crater, Hyjal, Uldum, Grim Batol and Gilneas to create new raids, dungeons, zones and battlegrounds.
---
I don't think it should upset the balance too much though. Maybe one raid tier that's somewhere between Naxx and TBC Heroics in power level with two full raids in total.
---
Maybe a new 20 man raid that's a step up from AQ20. 
---
Maybe a few dungeons that add a few new blue items and relics that make meme specs a bit more viable. You can put a lot of stuff in a relic that can "fix" a spec.
---
Maybe a bunch of raids comparable to Naxx in power level but with completely horizontal progression. You could do this by adding resistance checks instead of gear checks. Your power level will stay roughly the same but your resistances will go up.
---
That’s a yikes from me...
---
Griefing and harassment is griefing and harassment regardless of who it is against...
---
If you think that it is acceptable I am pretty happy that you don’t have Beta access. Also, make sure you let us all know what server you play on so we can avoid you.
---
Debunked old News. And strangely enough, no proof for this claim by the WA develpers was ever shown.
---
I'm tilted. Didn't read mankirk anywhere on that.
---
You're using words you don't understand. API is Application Programming Interface.  
---
The API itself doesn't change, you still have access to the same /target commands. The WoW client just ignores totems when targeting through a macro command.   
---
These things are different. Allowing the client to target totems when calling the internet TargetEnemy() Lua function (whether through a macro or not) has no bearing whatsoever on returning to the old 1.12 macro API in which you could call most Lua functions in the client directly as they were still (almost) all unprotected.  
---
It has nothing to do with complex macros. You're confusing 2 entirely different things and you're just dead wrong.  
---
The question now remains: Is removing totem stomping a separate, deliberating decision? If yes, I'm all for it. If not, I'd prefer they keep it because otherwise totems are useless in PvP.
---
For the Devilsaur Mafia to work it requires Alliance and Horde colluding with eachother. This is bannable. I wouldn't worry. Will it be expensive? Yes. But I wouldn't worry about any real effective Mafia like lockdown.
---
You heard it from here first. Only macro you'll ever need.
---
/target caliph scorpidsting
---
That's a newer post, but its not a written rule still so it seems to just be up to the mods.
---
Though the difference is I'm not suggesting any specific content, just asking if people even want it.
---
Of course it’s griefing you moron...
---
How is it not?
---
I am not saying you are wrong at all, just that maybe mages were over looked. Shaman and warlock were the ones that the streamers were picking.
---
You should quotation that, "Sick duels for classic". Nothing compared to retail the skill cap is infinitely higher on there.
---
I'd argue that tbc did a much better job of class balancing for pve than vanilla with making more specs viable for many classes, but that means so very little for me when I don't even feel like doing the endgame tbc content.
---
This feels weird. Personally I dont think taking photos at a cemetarie is an OK thing to do.
---
But you are right, it looks like the W from Wow.
---
.
---
Your numbers are based off an already debunked piece of fake news, posted by the WA developers, who got their numbers from a buggy API that has since been patched.
---
That's 58 seconds per mob, not counting travel time.
---

If you want proper commentary and not Tip's bullshit:
---
og_jeffery did a thing

---
Milk drinker is better than a shit eater. 
---
Fuck out of here.
---
Farming dungeons for gold will be doable. However the /camp way of resetting dungeons fast does not work on the beta.
---
&gt;Hunters can't tank.
---
There have been guilds using a hunter tank for the lulz all the way through BWL on pservers. They can tank as they have high health, can generate decent threat, low-medium armor and huge dodge+parry. Not saying that they should :P 
---
It is the same as saying you can probably clear MC with 40 people all in blindfolds..
---
Literally go over your previous posts and that is what you said, but you know what, there is no point in arguing because your stance is very clear, whatever these people are doing is acceptable and their actions will most certainly won't translate to the game after the beta.
---
Yeah because they definitely don’t know about live-streams and the complications behind banning someone for something as controversial as stream-sniping. 
---
Each comment you make shows your true intelligence, and I’m sorry at the humor I poked in your original comment seemed to hurt your feelings to the point of going at me with personal insults, and then you leave a nice mysterious ending as if you’re somebody who knows “private” information and so you spend time browsing the “new” section on a niche subreddit to brag about it. I don’t know how you can’t see how hilarious your comments sound on top of the fact it’s clear as day to me that you’ve never worked a day in your life.
---
Enjoy algebra class tomorrow bud
---
I don't care what you did in the past, nor do I have to. Toward me, all you have shown are absurdly ridiculous insults, devaluating you as a conversational partner.
---
&gt;But instead of reaching out a hand you rather walk on by.
---
Me being happy, doesn't mean I am obligated to cheer you up.
---
Wrong. Feral tanks can main tank some bosses in Naxx better than Warriors. Feral dps can meet the damage requirement for Patchwerk while providing a crit buff to the top melee in the raid.
---
It's already implemented so why wouldn't it be?
---
If you have an active WoW subscription the game will show up in your launcher close to the release date. Most likley 12-13 august since its the date when we will be allowed to create characters to make sure we get the names we want. However the game wont go live until the 27th.
---
From a gold min/max point of view, which kinds of leather should I keep for selling later on the AH and why? Which content release phases would make me the most amount of gold out from which kind of leather?
---
No changes. You can balance everything in Bfa
---
I would like to see them saying "we can't ban him for it, but we can remove him from the area"
---
And we will have to agree to disagree about blizzard being able to impose a GM action. They take it case by case and at the end of the day they can do what they want.
---
If tomorrow morning sodapoppin logged in and it showed he was banned and requested additional information - they could give any reason they wanted to. He could then take them to court and lose because he accepted their TOS.
---
Now logically they wouldn't just ban him or some random player for no reason - or they would face backlash from their consumers.
---
My only argument from the beginning is that blizzard has the final say - the only thing you, I for anyone else can do is to report what you don't like and move on.
---
Not looking good for what?
---
100k players paying $15 per month for a game with three month "development" time by a small team, that you don't have to make any additional content for...
---
It just prints money.
---
The day WoW died for me, was the day I realized that it had become the norm in a heroic raid to not bother with mechanics but just kick the 5 lowest dps and the lowest healer and reinvite pugs until the boss in question was dead. I thought about the time when I finaly (after a million wipes) got Spine down as a druid healer with a priest partner (the fight they said only could be done with a resto shaman) and I felt that WoW had changed into something ugly and unfriendly, so I quit for good. Idk if Classic will change this attitude, but I am hoping it will.
---
are there VODs?  i'd like to see this
---
I understand it plenty, considering my education and profession.
---
You use commands through macros to interface with the client, that makes it an API.
---
The API was changed so those commands targeting totems would no longer function, that means the API was changed.
---
We're not returning to the old macro API, we're using Retail's macro API. So totem stomping is not going to happen.
---
Engineering isn't very useful while leveling, mostly a gold-sink and a luxury. Start with skinning/mining, drop one of them for engi when you're not hurting for gold.
---
its literally a lag to give people more reaction time who else than slow and bad pvp players want this
---
Shield slammed rogues who interrupted my slow ass grinding of twilight texts in Silithus.
---
Actually, I wasn't. The kid who was beating me up at the bus station was 2 years my senior, and also taller and stronger than me. He could've avoided the blow if he had paid attention and reacted in time, but I surprised him when he looked at a friend.
---
The lessons drawn from this:
---
* Everyone is dangerous, even if they don't look like it
---
* Never turn your back on an enemy, no matter how sure you are hes down
---
To be fair however, the guy is one of my neighbors today, our girlfriends are best friends, and we regularly have barbecue with each other. He still has a tiny scar on his nose however ;-)
---
This was debunked as false long ago
---
im not talking about the streamers themselves but more the people in the chat, often enough for me to notice it at least
---
Really? Why? Cemeteries are beautiful and interesting places. I’m not taking a selfie here with a peace sign. Just a photo of a font used on a 100 year old gravestone that looks like W from Warcraft series.
---
I bought my GF an Acer Nitro 5 with a sweet i5-8300H, 8GB memory, 256 SSD+1TB HDD, and GeForce GTX 1050 for under €750
---
99+ fps in all situations so far.
---
If you are super focused on pvp the general rule is that if your class of choice can be a gnome, then you go gnome. If your class cant be a gnome then you go dwarf. If your class cant be a dwarf well then its whatever. Horde side is all about Green ape and Undead.
---
It definetly counts as a stun, thats why orc are resisting them almost everytime, because of their 25% stunresist racial (which feels like 75% tbh)
---
&gt;Me being happy, doesn't mean I am obligated to cheer you up.
---
But calling people emotionally empty sure isn't helping the emotionally unstable... which I think by your logic is worsening the effect instead of actually being positive.
---
&gt;I don't care what you did in the past, nor do I have to. Toward me, all you have shown are absurdly ridiculous insults, devaluating you as a conversational partner.
---
I insulted YOU by saying we need to ask about layering.
---
Kay.
---
Don't like them fool you. r/HydroHomies is BFA. r/waterniggas is Classic.
---
So this would work if i have my blind macro bound to f for example, mouse over target and hit f and even though i have a different target the mouse over target is blinded?
---
What if i told you that T3 is allready better than HC from tbc dungeons and even karazhan?
---
Yeah, it's pretty hard when they dont work...
---
i'd put my money on the rogue if they get their opener, otherwise i'd say mage
---
Everyone no matter their goal should pick up double gathering professions at the start. Skinning + mining, skinning + herbalism. Later on you drop skinning for Alchemy as an example. Or whatever your profession of choice is.
---
It will change it, don't let the wannabe-l33t PServer Kiddos bother you. They will join, complain it's not l33t enough for them, and flock back to their basements and misconfigured shit servers no one but they themselves care about.
---
And here I'll be playing with integrated graphics
---
It was normalized in 1.8.
---
Oddly enough some abilities in 1.12 ARE normalized, like Paladin Seals for example.
---
Is there a support group for this? Because I gotta admit I think I also suffer from this affliction.
---
I think you should literally go over my posts and try to find a word publicity or claim that something doesn't happen in retail.
---
We will be allowed to log in and create characters on 12-13 to make sure we get the names we want. Probably around then.
---
More water would be a good start.
---
Yea I know maybe my feeling is wrong. But there are names etc on that stone wich makes it abit unconfertable to place online.
---
Its an amasing looking stobe tho and the sign does look like wow.
---
Thank you for the thorough and extensive input. For some time I never had a "main", I alternated between classes and somewhat envied people who were fans of a certain class. After some personal growth in life, and researching lore, the Druid class strongly resonated with me all along and I wasn't aware. I enjoy it, the skills, the versatility, and I aim to be good at it but most importantly have a good time. I guess all the criticism kind of put me in a limbo, and since I plan to PvE with friends being "rejected" because of a class I'm fond of seems harsh and unfair, although I won't label it as pure elitism since people want to clear stuff as much as the next person. What "setup" do you recommend? I was interested in being a caster, since I've mained feral in expansions like WotLK, but I heard the damage isn't that good, hence why I referenced "balance/resto".
---
number 15 is probably the funniest, specially in 2019 since people will play more hardcore and try to gather all the buffs, making them more vulnerable to this
---
Kevin Jordan?
---
There are tutorial videos out there along with entire subreddits dedicated to these servers. Google is your friend. Good luck!
---
Huh? Windfury Totem grants flat damage increase, so it's better on *faster* weapons(not to mention it triggers more on faster weapons)
---
No? I don't really care what streamers do personally, nor what people do to them. If your concern is that they're going to get special treatment in regards to griefing, I don't know why you think that, considering that the tournament was being trolled for *hours* before Blizz did anything. If streamers are doing the same thing for hours on end and not eventually getting a slap on the wrist for it, sure, I can see people being pissed. Is that what you're asking?
---
Never spec SL. Its bad in every situation outside of duels. Its even shit in other pvp situations like bgs. Also people laugh at you if you are SL specced. Since its a pretty broken spec with only one specific purpose.
---
we just used a zero sum dkp with fixed loot prices. it put peer pressure on hoarders as 39 other people would miss dkp if they didn't take an upgrades
---
guild took all boe and sold to pay for tank flasks and 20g worth of progression night repairs.
---
And I get escape artist too? Sign me up.
---
But it requires key presses. Some people like to click to cast.
---
I prefer the mouseover version, especially as I have way more beneficial spells than I could put on my mouse, but I can see the advantage, especially with those 100 button gamer mice.
---
*SPLUTCH!*
---
m8
---
Actually it’s a pretty apt analogy. I think there’s a place for a modern sandbox though where the world is actively cultivated and fought over in meaningful ways. Eq next was attempting something like this.
---
Horizontal scaling with at most soft power creep. Player buildings, art, machines (like Minecraft), weapons, tools, and spells. A robust economy that doesn’t stagnate maybe through breaking items or more robust repairs. A combination of pvp, pve, and fun/creative crafting.
---
It’s like a white whale. The balancing, the cost to make, and the talent and ingenuity to make sandbox systems that function in less toxic ways would be an enormous undertaking. It’s jsut not happening in the modern development environment that’s hyper focused on maximizing profits over any artist leeway. Also if you could make such a game with such replay ability it would be addictive as hell lol.
---
Crowfall has an interesting solution to the stagnation that occurs in sandbox games when day one guild becomes dominant, the playing space, the world is on a clock. While your character progress survives the world resets after a time thus beginning the fight for control all over again. Such a system could work or perhaps some sort of multidimensional hub where players travel to custom worlds could work as well?
---
esp gnomes!
---
Mining goes well with engineering. However, at the start you want mining + skinning when you level up. Just save your mining mats for when you drop skinning for engineering.
---
&gt;but the fact that there’s no “permanence” to your actions makes me not really care at all
---
Oh man, you are going to be absolutely livid when you realize that 50 years after you die no one will even remember you.
---
I guess I didn't see use outside of saving space for other things on the keyboard.
---
Generally I just run with macros saves me having to rely on a mod to do most of my healing.
---
And there the hope is lost, that the community will be better in classic  ;-)
---
In mage's favour but a good rogue will crush a bad mage and at the highest level one big rogue outplay can win them the duel too.
---
Tauren hunters are bad. Dont play a tauren hunter. For your own good.
---
In a 1v1 prepared Duel setting like we're talking about here, my money is heavily on the mage. He'll have Mana or Ice shield up to survive the Garrote silence, then blink and kite.
---
&gt; which I think by your logic is worsening the effect instead of actually being positive.
---
You confuse my desire to be happy, with your desire for _everyone else_ to be miserable with you.
---
I don't give a damn if you're happy or not.  
---
I enjoy my life. If you enjoy yours too, great.  
---
If you don't wanna enjoy yours, that's not my problem.
---
&gt;I insulted YOU by saying we need to ask about layering.
---
No, you insulted me by calling my a _"layering apologist"_, despite me not writing a single sentence about it.
---
&gt;If blizzard remains silent on that - layering will kill the enjoyment of playing Classic.
---
We don't even know what the population numbers will be. We don't even know how many servers there will be. We don't know what the population will look like in, say, late December. No, Blizzard do not need to talk about layering right now, any more than they did.
---
By your logic, Blizzard not talking about the potential for a [Vacuum-Decay-Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum), will kill the enjoyment of playing classic, because we could be swallowed by the end of the universe at any moment.
---
You should use one of those big red buzzer buttons from gameshows for combinations like this.
---
**False vacuum**
---
In quantum field theory, a false vacuum is a hypothetical vacuum that is somewhat, but not entirely, stable. It may last for a very long time in that state, and might eventually move to a more stable state. The most common suggestion of how such a change might happen is called bubble nucleation – if a small region of the universe by chance reached a more stable vacuum, this 'bubble' would spread.
---
A false vacuum may only exist at a local minimum of energy and is therefore not stable, in contrast to a true vacuum, which exists at a global minimum and is stable.

I hope I’m not in my moms basement in my late 40’s like this guy definitely is.
---
This is one hell of en excuse for respawn killing lowbies in STV lol
---
Judging from stress test, warrior rage regen is way better than pservers, making it easier to level than most people think, you will be fine.
---
BFA can have old models too. You just click the option
---
People found a way to make feral druids work on private servers. This wont  really be a thing in classic since the way bosses in classic parries makes warrior even better than they already were.
---
Oh, look, a guide on how to make players quit the game. Certainly useful, albeit a bit counter productive.
---
You can complain all you want about the interfering (and i agree with you that he wasn't breaking any rules) but fact of the matter is that it's Blizzard and they can do whatever they like because its their game.
---
Its the same with Twitter and censoring, theyre a private owned company so you can't use the free speech argument there either.
---
I know, but I also know that then they move ugly.
---
Every class in the game can gather gear that benefits them more or less in diffrent situations. Especially trinkets.
---
&gt;Note that this animation is purely client side, so private servers are a reliable source in this case.
---
That's what we thought about gnome sizes as well
---
Put a /follow as the first command and you have a winner there.
---
Damn is that the reason retail hits feel so bland?
---
Then why can't blizzard ban people if they don't directly violate the TOS?
---
i would like to see items &amp; abilities that where planned but didnt make it before TBC.
---
stuff like "Greater Holy Protection Potion", class abilities like "Curse of Idiocy", zone/raids that where made into raids for later expensions instead such as "mount Hyjal" or "Kharazan".
---
Keep in mind TBC wasn't planned when the game and these zones where originally designed, that was a choice blizzard later made to earn even more and make the expansions larger.
---
Can't believe I'm arguing with a software dev who still doesn't understand this.
---
An API isn't the actual implementation.  
---
Unless you have experience with multi-expansion creation of addons and internals of the WoW client (i.e. people who have reverse engineered vast amounts of functionality), just accept that you're wrong.   
---
Totem stomping was not a change in the macro API. It was a deliberate change to automated targeting functionality (of the underlying Lua functions of the /target macro). Bringing it back (which I don't want) has nothing to do with bringing back pre-2.0 macro API (i.e. just a bunch of Lua functions not being protected).  
---
You've proven from the start that in your mind, there are only 2 "macro systems", 1.12 where you can call any function in the client, except a few protected movement ones at the click of a button (you can still use /run UnitGUID('player') in 2.0 - 8.x) and allowing totem stomping, wich was only removed in patch 3.x would mean unprotected all previously protected Lua functions, making one button rotations possible again.  
---
If you are as educated as you claim to be, please do proper research and further educate yourself on the topic.
---
"Frankenpatch" is quantitative :) But yes, in a sense.
---
Gold is super important early on. I would run mining + skinning and then drop skinning at 60.
---
IIRC you could hide that attack button somewhere on a never used action bar and reference it in you macro, to not waste that precious space on a visible action bar.
---
Which is why many streamers are invited, including pokimane. Its free publicity. Thats how apex legends got big when they released their trailer same day it launched. What? You think poki will do lots of bug reports and testing?
---
Ditto. I'm much of of a, "I'll just do it 2-3 times." kind of person and I don't think that's the sort of drug to do that with. 
---
However, the idea of doing heroin and doing some Wailing Caverns does sound pretty appealing.
---
I might be an idiot for asking, but how are people already playing Classic? Lots of people saying they're "waiting" on the game, from what I'm seeing it looks like it's here now? (somehow?)
---
I started late on a private server launch, got caught in the pack. Somewhere I have a screenshot of myself standing around with 15 other people, waiting for a named Murloc to spawn. Horrible.  
---
But all you need to avoid that is time. I think if you put in 5-hour days for 3-4 days, you'll shoot in-front of enough people that 'the pack' wont slow you down. Don't need to be in the top 5%, just not back in the middle 50.
---
WoW Classic was announced 19 months ago and they made it clear in the presentation they'd been working at it for a while. 3 months development time is a piss poor estimate.
---
Names that died 1881, 1893 and 1920. I would agree with you if it was someone that died recently, but I think OP is safe here.
---
True, I should of cropped it better. This is a very old stone though in an abandon section, shame actually made me want to clean it up.
---
That's what I'm doing here, reporting what I don't like. There's little power in one person in a situation like this, but several others may have a greater impact, like you say.
---
Remember that this is not really true. Warriors are generally n1 in all of these. The reason mages get way better in AQ and Naxx is due to how all the mages work together to feed an ignite stack. You can look up how this works. @randyn1080
---
thanks for the advice will do
---
you're stupid
---
Yeah thats exactly how it works. Same macro for any class, just change the spell.
---
Deserve to be better? Well you're comparing a bunch of guys competing in a 10k players pool vs world champions and multi rank 1 pvper competing in a multi-millions players pool. 
---
Even if the vanilla Pserver top player are somewhat good, their skill and understanding of game mechanic is nowhere near those of retail top pvper
---
if anything this event shows why these " community games" doesnt work anymore, people were legit being called braindamaged and spergs or w/e else you want to call people in General chat cus they didnt care about the event, even people saying they will get blacklisted if they didnt  start caring. Im also pretty sure someone asked that if you didnt care about this event why were you even on the beta
---
Yes. And they have had several streams dedicated to griefing RPers previously. They even treat it like events. So it's not like it hasn't already happened.
---
Only casters have different usable spell ranks. Once you learn a new spell rank as a warrior or a rogue it just replaces the older version.
---
Toxicity makes the community less dull in my opinion.  It’s boring if everyone is playing hello kitty online adventure
---
Yes. And don’t whine about no changes. Dual spec is also something I’m glad they are adding.
---
connecting flight paths make the world larger
---
things that shrink the game world size are poor for the gameplay that makes classic what it is
---
a massive adventure in a huge world
---
Blizzard didn't think that far cuz MAH LAYERING!
---
It's pretty fucking accurate: https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acqhph/i_estimated_subscriber_numbers_using_google_trend/
---
I just went ahead and looked up my Twitch follow list. I was talking about Mark Kern specifically, but Kevin Jordan has been doing the same thing and also deserves a mention. Hearing their development tales is pretty interesting, they also have really good ideas about where Classic WoW should go in the future.
---
Thanks, saved me having to look it up. Pretty important part was left out.
---
The newbies still have to manually flag for pvp first to have this work right?
---
I remember being a little kid, watching my brother start out his WoW career with his night elf rogue. Teldrassil felt so unbelievably large.
---
Gathering professions, mostly.  Your damage will be hot garbage.  
---
Also, you probably don't want to level-up in a healing spec.
---
Same with warrior charge. If a warrior charges you while you're airborne, he'll end up at the position where you started jumping. Technically an exploit, but it was a pretty common thing to do against warriors.
---
Maybe. I should be able to put in 16 hour days for a week which is about what I might need. I'm leveling the worst class to level fast with so I'm going to be ahead of some classes but behind the quickest.
---
where was dual spec confirmed?
---
Holy shit. I'm pretty sure I know this dude.
---
Okay, how long did they grief for? All day or just a few hours? Did they get warned or banned? I also don't know if retail rules are different, I'm just here for Classic.
---
Those servers are the first to die once said Streamer gets bored and leaves/quits
---
Darkspear is a prime example of this
---
Considering that there is a subreddit about sbreddits people can't believe exist, I'd say: Yes there is.
---
r/wowthissubexists
---
Not sure why you are downvoted as it’s actually a sound idea. 
---
Instead of putting Blizz in and not knowing where the banning line is, have your own “police” for your own rules and punish in your own RP way. 
---
Also would look much more fun.
---
Can you make one for me 😃😄😃
---
&gt;And the prevailing theory is that while there does seem to be a lot of interest in Warrior, many will burn out on it fast when they start hitting some of those hell level ranges because Warrior is one of the longest and toughest to level solo.
---
Yes a lot will burn out, else we would have more than 30% of the server pop that would be warriors.
---
But hard as it is, warriors will still be the first class population wise, between 16 and 20%, it's in all the Vanilla, pserver census and polls here.
---
Why not those classes if I may ask? Planning on playing a druid like I, did, in wotl and was thinking of picking up skinning since lvling In mulgore and then barrens.. What would be the better profession in your opinion?
---
Your cousin looks like Nixxiom &gt;&lt;
---
with pvp disruptions there are pvp solutions. when your own faction is griefing you there's not much that can be done
---
Griefing is griefing, they never stated a time limit or anything. But yes, they do it for a few hours on end. Just like trollgodx only did it for a few hours.
---
Today I logged in and received mail from my gm telling me to show up to raids on time or Im kicked. So rewarding!!
---
Agreed. I find Soda's persona to be incredibly cringey (and even incredibly offensive at times), but he played a beast druid yesterday. Blew my mind the level of micro-managing and highly skilled play that was possible on a level 30 druid.
---
No those classes get either free mounts or similar. Since druids and shaman are already moving at 40% increased movespeed, they don't benefit as much from a mount as say a priest or warrior.
---
Never had a decent weapon or robes on my Lock. Despite progressing from MC to AQ40.
---
With warriors, I think there was the added curiosity that spells in your current stance bar auto-updated, but those hidden due to being in the other stance didn't update. At least I remember switching through all stances to get everything updated.
---
It was like 0.0001% players that got to down Kel Thuzad during Vanilla. I doubt there won’t be something new for most people.
---
Lol I was sure about mage for a long time but have now relapsed to druid!!
---
Well, personal opinion, I guess it worths it because it really matters how much gold do you have at level 40.  
---
I think without skinning, its nearly impossible to take the mount on that level, I really dunno what else you can grind while levelling to reach 100g in total.
---
After level 60, I agree, skinning is not the top prio.
---
I am also wondering this so please recommend another solution if skinning is not worthy for level 40 mount.
---
Unless the griefers are major streamers, in which case it seems to be completely fine. Oh, and the RP disruption almost always happens to the same faction.
---
Source for no RP servers at launch? No RP-PVP yes, but RP-PVE will be in there as far as all sources say.
---
That implies only getting it for the mount though right? Surely there are other benefits from skinning/leatherwork
---
Most likely they will offer free transfer to low pop realms
---
Ew wtf is up with the high poly anime weeb stuff?
---
Given his post history about erectile dysfunction, I think we can rule out any half-chubbery.
---
His own fault for relying on targetting rather than making a macro
---
Found two Lifestones (boe epic trinket) in the same day when grinding 58-60
---
&gt;You confuse my desire to be happy, with your desire for everyone else to be miserable with you.
---
&gt;I don't give a damn if you're happy or not.
---
I enjoy my life. If you enjoy yours too, great.
---
Yet you continue to conclude that I'm miseable and you are happy... sure seem interested in others happiness.
---
&gt;We don't even know what the population numbers will be. We don't even know how many servers there will be. We don't know what the population will look like in, say, late December. No, Blizzard do not need to talk about layering right now, any more than they did.
---
Hey let's all be ignorant to the fact that this isn't a brand new game, they don't have sub numbers or trends for that matter. Let's live in this hypothetical "anything can happen with classic, so why ask questions"
---
&gt;If we come to that bridge, we will find a way to cross it. Until we don't even know if the bridge exists, worrying about it is just stupid.
---
Ah you are upset that it was directly lined up with your original post, that makes much more sense now!
---
I'm sorry that not everyone is as fly by the seat of your pants as you are. 
---
I'm also sorry that anyone that has criticism or a question to something that's so obviously near and dear to your heart is automatically in the wrong. 
---
Have a fantastic and bubbly day ❤
---
you can do a few things:
---
* respec into a damage-dealing spec
---
* farm with someone
---
* equip damage-focused gear and farm in your healing spec
---
* make your money entirely through damage.
---
Sorry I don't know what's happening, there are high pop servers with 15k players? (In my experience, it becomes unplayable at \~6k.)
---
I would buy this if it were not for the fact that in retail there is no blood in the US client either. Even setting the Violencelevel to 5, the behaviour is exactly the same as the beta... expectable since classic is based off a Legion version of the game.
---
I'm telling you, unless they specifically go back and re-add it to the game, this will be missing from US live version of Classic too
---
Well it depends-you can still farm if you get creative enough (look up DM east druid farm) but the big way a lot of people came up with money was professions. Gathering profs such as herbalism will always be profitable especially when raiding takes off on the server. Fishing is massive as some fish are reagents for certain pots/flasks (flask of the titans, fire resistance pots, free action pots).
---
If you find yourself getting a rare pattern/recipe which is in demand then you can basically write your own cheque-on my old server for quite a while there was only a handful of people with the flask of the titans recipe so each flask would sell for ~100g at the very least.
---
If all else fails you can always level up an alt such as a hunter, spec BM and basically afk farm to your hearts content.
---
Just used your guest pass, thanks!
---
Nothing means nothing then
---
For sure man. Would be cool to meet some ingame again once Classic goes live.
---
It is the beta. Not all players have access to beta and it it only level 30 max right now. The full game will be released 27th of August.
---
Yes you can, it doesn't require any passing through other FPs
---
I don't want to get too into it, but this one is public knowledge:
---
To open the AQ gates, the server needs: 
---
* 160,000 Thick Leather (80k for each faction) 
---
* 180,000 Light Leather (Alliance)
---
* 110,000 Medium Leather (Alliance)
---
* 60,000 Heavy Leather (Horde)
---
* 60,000 Rugged Leather (Horde)
---
Retail servers will probably be capped, there is a lot of speculation about the number. Originals vanilla servers had 2.5k cap raised later at 3.5k and that's all we know atm
---
Yes but not in this context. The post is all about benefit vs speed and it would never benefit the speed of your leveling to do a crafting profession.
---
Video link? Please
---
I'm a healer myself and our guild swapped back and forth druid and warrior tank (on private servers) but healing a druid doesn't scare nor oom us if the raid stacks all world buffs possible. Play what you want and let ''hardcore'' crunch their numbers as much as they like - being hardcore doesn't necessarily make them any better than a casual but their egos might be fragile and prevent them accepting the truth. Vanilla is not hard especially if we start at 1.12.
---
Druid might not be optimal for everything but if guild wants to speedrun raids they'll take feral or fury tanks anyways. Progress is just a name for time gearing rest of the raid to overcome bosses and it won't take long.
---
They did. You just weren't paying attention.
---
This is one aspect of the sandbox games with full loot pvp that seems inescapable. It eventually becomes a game of cost efficiency and min/maxing risk only. For all the talk about high risk high reward that full loot brings it never plays out that way. Instead everyone takes manageable risks where you lose very little or only fights when victory is all but assured.
---
In that way it ends up being a lot like pvp in a game like wow. You risk some time and that’s about it. In wow you can put on your best gear and try to 3v1 or 5v2. The fact that there’s “nothing to lose” isn’t relevant, it just means you’ll take the risk and the reward is a sick adrenaline high when you pull it off.
---
I don’t need full loot pvp for that exhilarating gameplay. What does that but offer me grief and make getting cool gear pointless?
---
Allright thank you!
---
It will be slower than feral or shadow specs, but if you have fun that way go for it. I aim to level up as a protection warrior as I always did( from beta 2004 up to cataclysm). Ofc I will be running tons of dungeons cause I enjoy it, so my grinding will be kept to the bare minimum.
---
I want my tombstone say:
---
"Spirit Healer bugged, will be here for a while..."
---
And why wouldn't they be allowed to close somebodies account for not violating TOS?
---
Is this a contract that you have written up and read? Or is it a terms of service that at any point in time blizzard is allowed permanently close your account without notice?
---
Hahahah bullshit!!
---
Good on ya bro have fun
---
Thank you, makes much more sense now.
---
Also you could build quite the reputation through dungeons if you do awesome heals. People will remember you.
---
after hydrohomies I was expecting it
---
Not hyperbolizing.
---
He was playing an op class, thats the only reason he could get so high.
---
Venruki played it perfectly and still hardly won when snutz was making a mistake on top of a mistake on top of a mistake.
---
Sure.
---
Sounds fine to me then. Them being streamers is irrelevant, a guild or even several guilds can crash an RP event if it/they want(s) to. Sure, it's a bit of a grey area concerning time, my only comparison is how the game was in 2004-06. It was incredibly common to have people griefing a zone or player or group for hours, and then *eventually* Blizz might mess with the griefers if enough people complained, *maybe*, but didn't ban them for silly stuff like running on top of duels. Just like as far as we can tell the trollgod taurens were ported, not banned.
---
They frequently say that when people report issues to blizz,  where they say that they understand the problem, but since there is no clear violation of the TOS, they can't take any action towards said player.
---
&gt;This is exactly why I am going back to classic and gonna no life. In classic you build ur own life and friends
---
That sounds more like you need help.
---
All the WoW nerds would understand and salute you sir forever.
---
So it's okay to show a video of something that happened in the past, and get others (outsiders) to hop in game and report that person for something they weren't affected by?
---
If you didn't mean that, that's okay - it still stands that the only thing someone can do is report what they see to blizzard and don't expect the outcome to be what they seem reasonable.
---
LvL 30 duels omegaul. Much skill, true wow
---
It will be an awesome 15k player server, with a 1hr que and lots of world pvp!
---
Yeah but thats my issue. People will think hes the best warlock in classic, which he clearly isnt. Maybe in time he will get better.
---
Maybe you my friend, speak for yourself.
---
Yea I guess you are right.
---
i may just be really dumb but i would like that sword it would be nice for farming mobs and just doing everyday stuff. i understand it would be too good in raiding. but i think i would love it
---
There's dagger, fist weapons and maces specialization talent though :o
---
My guess is a big queue and offer of free realm transfers to some of the smaller servers.
---
Yeah, but actively disrupting RP events/interactions on RP servers are a violation of the server rules. This is one of the few reasons for why they even created RP servers.
---
This is an incredibly late reply because I was just looking up some stuff re. Spelladin.
---
If it doesn't work I'll just go holy, and many will just go deep ret instead regardless. I think most of us understand the DPS in the videos displayed is not the actual DPS you can come to expect while playing Paladin. Even if it's 1/2 or 3/4ths I'll be happy, because it'll work relatively well. Never able to compete with a warrior, but who cares?
---
Oof, but also that makes sense.
---
Yes, except that WoWiki page details the specific behaviour of this variable back in the day whereas nowhere we could see the actual size of gnomes
---
Or missing interrupting bandage on 5% mage and instead dotted him up and drained life. If it was just one missed sac, he wouldve won, as a lock should against the mage.
---
Does it make sense as an UD character to run to the orc starting zone for that sweet wolf mount or is it better to just grind it out at 60?
---
&gt;Brush up on your cross-faction language. Pro-tip: all alliance to horde messages can be sent from undead (gutterspeak) to alliance.
---
I don't get this one, can you explain it pls?
---
Questing at max level is not really necessary, unless you are really wanting to complete everything. There are a few group quests worth doing at 60, but not much more. As there are no daily/repeatable quests worth anything, you can stay a dps spec and finish the few quests you want before going into a healer spec.
---
As others mentioned, gathering professions is often the best for healers, or doing speed dungeon runs for righteous orbs, disenchanting materials and vendor trash
---
Well that would make sense as that's what happened in Vanilla, but I thought thats why they didn't want queues to begin with? So they didn't have to open more servers and then eventually merge dead servers.
---
Also having the option to transfer to a smaller pop server doesn't guarantee the 15k+ population of that's a popular server and new players want to play there.
---
Do we just lock that server and not allow new characters to be created?
---
Oh yea dude, if I was leveling a warrior, I'd get a stack of Red Bulls or whatever. Would be extremely punishing to fall behind.
---
That has nothing to do with my question lol
---
Hear hear for Jeffrey!! Great shout casting, very solid knowledge.
---
In what order would you go ? Combat, assassination then subtlety ?
---
Hopefully the people who are still fishing on their level 10, will be transferred away. Or maybe Blizz will do something right and not leave layering on longer than a week.
---
I mean, we know they can forget about little things... In my opinion they have overlooked this one, and will remain like that unless they're made aware of it by people with access to the beta
---
I don’t know the stats, but am 99% sure nothing effects warlock pets stats beyond talents, some specific gear and the orc racial command.
---
the fuck do you mean by "normies" the streamers that got beta are biggest normies on twitch
---
You don't seem to be very informed to say Blizzard is silent. They talked about it as they introduced it. Their solution is queues + free server transfers and new servers if necessary.
---
21. Refuse to cap the flag in wsg. There are some very good places to hide the flag (look them up), and in vanilla you don't appear on the map. You can stall games for dozens of additional minutes, depending on how good the enemy team is.
---
That's not true btw, you do appear in the map after a while. That was the WSG timer in vanilla.
---
No, not report that person, but have blizzard clearly address the reason for this seemingly favoritism of streamers, where they can violate retail TOS without any form of punishment, while they report one griefer and get blizz to personally interfere. Why are they seemingly above the TOS?
---
Hi, /u/MaltaDuDe
---
Well played.
---
ITT: clueless virgins.
---
In the picture is the ZG version of Zinrokh that was removed from the game, the archaeology version is flipped upside down. Source:have both.
---
No, it's not. People posted way different times for level speed due to regen values, mob health, mob damage, parry, dodge and resist chance, among others.
---
You can still do those quests at 60 for the rep, so no need to torment yourself with the run.
---
I don’t really understand macros in wow. Could you explain what a mouse over macro is??
---
Outland/the dark portal were in development for vanilla. BC in general, but it all got cut for time.
---
Honestly I'd be happy to pay 20 bucks a month to play classic wow especially if that meant the servers stay up and that let them create new level 60 content, and NOT EXPANDING IT TO TBC/WOTLK/etc..
---
again, why was it such a big deal a little while ago that blizzard forced you to walk through the expansion zones?  
---
this is exactly the same but for some reason it's being praised now? i honestly dont get the internet sometimes xD  
---
yes. it DOES feel rewarding, and more alive. and then ultimately, nostalgic.
---
No sorry, I should have added a bit more context. 
---
- at launch of Classic each server will have a hidden "layering" system that allows the "world region" of that server to be duplicated to allow more people to play on that server at launch.
---
- since launch usually starts with an over abundance if players "trying" out the game, blizzards plan is to close "merge" all layers into 1 core layer at or by the end of phase 1 of their content release schedule 
---
- so if you choose "Stormrage" for example and there are 7k people playing, there could potentially be up to 3 layers on that server since each layer is supposed to be very close to the Vanilla pop cap of 3-4 k players
---
- the best way I can explain the layers are "mini servers" that allow up to 3kish players to be on each layer... but are a under that "Stormrage" server.
---
I don’t entirely understand macros. Like why do I need a macro to cast a spell that I can already just cast as easily by pressing a button. I know I’m definitely missing something but I don’t get it. Could you explain the usefulness of macros?
---
let me in.. let me iuahgahauh
---
Nobodys day seems to have been ruined by his posts except yours lol
---
Goddamn you went weird real quick, and you started such a nice thread.
---
Hopefully layering will mitigate this to a certain extent.
---
No aircon in most of the EU, and here in England you barely even need it in summer.
---
Aq40 music: https://youtu.be/WWUHh9t7Tj0
---
You can’t go wrong with industrial drone and dark ambient music for raids and plague lands dungeons.
---
He is different becuase he is a retard. Ruining an event that spreads the word that classic is comming and can benefit the number of people interested in classic is just pure idiocy and being an asshole. On the other hand you have Asmon who you may like or not, but is hosting events that actually show how you can have fun in vanilla (community events, huge Wpvp battles, doing raids for World Bosses, etc. ). Can you see the difference? The only people whoch trollgod can encourage to play classic are people who see him and think "oh so you can be a retard in this game? That's something for me!".
---
There's 3 topics on the main page of this subreddit about it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bw3lph/world_of_warcraft_classic_duel_tournament_all/
---
Above link has all the matches, I won't spoil the winner.
---
Idk what to tell you, 90% of ppl will take skinning,  
---
It is good but you have to sell leather to general goods vendor.
---
Jewelcrafting wasn't in Classic though so you wouldn't have been able to get that item.
---
because those who wanted to down KT in vanilla enviroment havnt already done so on pserv
---
Fuck I can't wait to play again
---
Layering is at least phase 1 so first 2 months. Even if not having layers enables mafias (it won't), it would still be less impactful than on a pserver.
---
Yeah that's why they are implementing layering. So more than 1 cap is allowed to play on a server at launch.
---
What happens when a server still has 3 or 4 layers full of people and they remove layering? Does that entire 9k players have to then queue for the originally intended 2.5-3.5k cap?
---
Layering is the solution to let as many people play as possibly on any sever they want at launch.
---
Which is a positive thing - blizzard has said numerous times that they know layering goes against a Vanilla experience and that is why they will 100% remove layering by or at the end of phase 1.
---
Did you even read my post?

 Aussie Classic Guild  
---
Hey everyone, we're looking for more members for our Aussie Classic guild, we're going to go Alliance on a PvP server, obviously Oceanic servers if we get them. The ultimate goal is 40 man raids and PvP so class balance matters but we are not going to tell anyone what they have to play.  Raid nights will be Sunday and wednesday 7:30-10:30 AEST with 20 mans done over the weekend. With our raiding we're not going to be some hardcore guild aiming for server firsts or anything like that but we do plan on moving at a steady pace. People have jobs, families, social lives etc so we aren't about to crack the shits if someone cant make every raid. Raid loot will be DKP, it seems to be the fairest option. Other options can of course be looked at.  PvP is also something that a fair few of us enjoy and have had some success at in Vanilla and various expansions. So we will be looking at doing regular premade groups.  Regarding Officer/ Recruitment positions etc within the guild these are all up for grabs, be helpful and help promote the guild and you'll be one. Come check us out on discord if you're keen [https://discord.gg/uEMtvEt](https://discord.gg/uEMtvEt)
---
they'll do a guild wars 2 where they just render the 50 closest people to you. goodluck.
---
Players abusing system were always banned or inprison by GMs in every MMO even in vanilla WoW.
---
Fun fact. In Ultima Online RP server we had prison island and you have to mine 100K iron bars while being naked and surrounded by other trolls with stealing and pvp enabled. Because you were with same people on very small place for very long time it forced you to cooperate and form gangs and steal from newcomers. When you did escape you had your strength and mining skill max out. It was basically prison simulator and actually fun part of the game. It became so popular that it was later made into starting zone for new players.
---
Are they all going to be played by Venruki?
---
only title
---
I thought that too :o 
---
That and of course the damage increasing debuffs on the enemy the Imp is attacking...
---
But I never played Warlock so why am I even here? :D
---
There is no BfA subreddit. It's a wow subreddit that exists for many years. This classic subreddit is about a game that isn't even out yet. Your comparison doesn't make any sense. In 2013/2014 the wow subreddit had about the same amount of members as classicwow, but of course back then there weren't less wow subscriptions, quite the opposite.
---
They aren't allowed blood? Why is there so many chinese on the private servers then?
---
My only regret is  that there's no way to ensure that people who check no changes also don't check anyhing else, it's basically the 'none of the above' choice.
---
The picture he linked is a quarter of the screen, yet it's 564x663. Doubt it's a resolution from 2004/2005.
---
FTH
---
As if you needed another reason to NOT play Alliance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g_mZgdnfD0
---
Uhh, you got a source for that being an official rule? I've never heard of that. Not saying it's not true but I can't find a thing that says you will be punished for griefing RP events.
---
Rogue can get Preparation by 30
---
That is to assure and answer that report on that specific player.
---
That does not mean they can't ultimately choose to ban any player at any given time for any reason.
---
It's case by case and always will be.
---
&gt;He is the best warlock to ever play the game, much much better than any private server lock thats for sure.
---
I dont think people should pick their class based on a level 30 tournament.
---
Is there a source on this? These quests were added late in vanilla, so I wouldn’t expect them in phase 1 or 2
---
Imagine playing Vanilla on private servers for last 10 years and not even get into top 8 cause retail players destroyed you lol
---
That's not it at all. They are expecting a large number of tourists who will start but not stay with classic. Buy craming as many as they can in each server they hope to minimize the amount of population control they have to do later
---
Judging from some of the reactions, it's not so obvious after all. But it could be just because it's so early on, once people get tired of farming naxx maybe they'll change their tune.
---
Then please justify asmongold going into RP servers and directly violating TOS by griefing RP interactions.
---
&lt;**UNITY**\&gt; \[**OCEANIC**\] \[**Alliance**\] \[**PVP**\]
---
**Introduction**: We are an Australian based guild, with a few others around the world in our time zone. We welcome anyone who will be playing Classic Wow as an Alliance character. 
---
**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs](https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs)
---
**Realm** : Oceanic (realm TBA once the list is available)
---
**Realm Type**: PVP
---
**Faction**:  Alliance
---
**Region**: AUS - Oceanic
---
**Time zone**: Australian Eastern Daylight Time
---
**Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore
---
**Loot Rules**: Loot council.
---
**Raiding Times**:  Weekends and some week nights - Again not set in stone but more than likely 6pm-12pmish. At the moment there looks to be multiple raids due to numbers. We will not restrict classes until after launch
---
**Intention**: We prioritize raiding and dungeons, PVP is secondary but will still be promoted.
---
**What We Expect Of Members**: Standard Non-Harassment Rules.  Just try to be respectful of the guild, have fun but try not to bully.
---
\*You don't need to be a raider to join either, while some of us will be taking time off at launch from work, many of us promote a work life balance especially those with families (myself included). If you are interested in joining just pop in the channel and write to us or message me directly on Discord.
---
 My only regret is  that there's no way to ensure that people who check  no changes also don't check anyhing else, it's basically the 'none of  the above' choice.
---
Let's hope there is a queue system (which I prefer), but idk how you squeeze 15k players into a 2.5-4.5 server, especially if it's a popular server. There I'll be 7 hour queues, which again is preferable to layering.
---
Wheres the evidence that its nerfed? Ive shown the evidence that the beta has correct damage in the comment above.
---
Can someone test this?
---
Played on a private realm with \~9k people. (About four times the amount there should be.) Black lotus ran 110g each. Plaguebloom was 80g per stack. That's more than twice as expensive as it "should" be, players felt.   
---
Players were in such an uproar, server devs doubled the spawn rates of herbs. Know what happened to the price of lotus and plaguebloom in response? Nothing.   
---
The people who were farming herbs just hoarded them. Because after you've got your epic mount and a few hundred gold banked, gold is pretty irrelevant, but consumables aren't. The # of nodes will only support so many people. Don't know that multiplying the spawn rate even higher would help.
---
&gt;https://i.redd.it/za5hs503nyn11.png 
---
Blue post explaining in sufficient detail an example.
---
Nope =)
---
As soon as they attack the Sheep, they flag themselves, the sheep aggroes, and blows them to smithereens.
---
Well, in this game, asmongold can go in to RP events and disrupt them without any backlash. Explain the reasoning behind that please
---
Private servers are pretty cancer atm. People just troll and gank non-stop ever since the classic beta got released. And theres like 8000 people trying to quest in one area.
---
"Works amazing for a lot of bossfights" 
---
Names the least mechanically intensive boss in the entire game. LOL
---
wow
---
Nobody ever said this lol.
---
This is fantastic
---
That sword would be nice for doing transmog/mount runs in bfa
---
The poll not only asks 'what' but also 'if' you want new content. If you are team NAX FOREVER there's an option for no changes.
---
You have your spells on buttons. A macro is a way to make your own spell button that works the way you want. You can combine pet attack and return in one button for instance. You can make a button that casts Fear on your target, but if you have your mouse hovering on another target it'll cast fear on them without you needing to change targets. These are just two examples. GL, use google.
---
You don't make your point very clear in this post. From what I understand it's the "suck it up and deal with it" versus always having some higher authority to report abusers to. I can see the merit in this argument. As u/turdas highlighted, some things changed for the better. But as time went on I've noticed, not just Blizzard, but a lot of companies stepping in to solve problems for their players although its the players that should solve the problems themselves. 
---
A pretty good example I can think of for this behavior is League of Legends, a MOBA. There's certain characters that are just simple to use and can take over games if you can get the ball rolling on them. Great for carrying a game on your shoulders. The other side of the coin is that they're very simple to counter and shut down and they're nearly useless if they aren't massively ahead of everyone else in terms of experience and gold. And what do you know, next patch Riot steps in and nerfs the character because they've been stomping low ELOs too much. Well... okay. So how about the noobs getting better at the game instead of mama Riot stepping in to protect their children from bullies?
---
Times change. This isn't just about games anymore. I know people are much more willing to report someone to an authority, while in the past if someone was an asshole to you in the street you'd say "big fuckin' deal, they are an asshole" and moved on with your day. Is this change for the best? I don't know.
---
Which is an acceptable solution - do they stop characters from being created on that 15k server now?
---
But what about the "community" of that server that has been built since launch? Are they going to force thousands of players to join lower populated servers?
---
I'm not saying I have the answers, it's just interesting that blizzard has only stuck to "layering is temporary and will be gone by phase 2"
---
The how is really important :)
---
Best to leverage your usefulness for help. Being a healer is a straight up handicap for soloing but your very essential so that is a good tool to recruit help.
---
There is no source on this, but while the class quests were in 1.8, they were not part of the progression race like the DM items. Also, the instance they revolve around, Temple of A'tal Hakkar, was in from the beginning, so there is really no reason not to have them.
---
I don't get why so many people think beta chars will carry over. Like use your brain a bit man, there's so many logical reasons it won't be a thing.
---
Griefing is griefing, its not suddenly OK if it happens in RP servers. I'm on mobile, so trying to dig that up isn't something I can be bothered with right now. But that's basically the whole reason they created RP servers, so RPers could RP in piece.
---
that was fake
---
it was only a mess as retards wouldnt move and people were trolling by standing infront of duelers, but the actual duels were amazing. Venruki won and played outstandingly, the last duel was against Snutz and he won 3-1. Cdew placed 3rd. Sodapoppin would have won the whole thing but got unluckily feared out of a duel and he had to restart with no CD’s. He was devastated, felt so sorry for him with the effort he put into gearing his druid. 
---
It was an awesome event overall, some amazingly skilled players. Ziqo, Venruki, Soda, Snutz, Seren and Bbka were my favourites to watch. Cdew got far but it was mostly hos class being brokenly OP, he was one shotting people with windfury procs and basically iust frost shocking and auto attacking. Not taking anything away from him hes an awesome player but his class was retardedly overpowered in that tournament.
---
"people" in chat are dumb, like people in general.
---
Good players are GOOD players, and the difference is practice and experience. Good retail players will catch up.
---
As for bad players....well, they will be bad players no matter what.
---
If you go to any of the big APES streamer, you can see the rage everytime they lost WSG to soda's team consisting of venruki, snutz, ziqo and sonii etc. They have this idea that Multiple R1 and gladiators need to adapt to Vanilla WoW and that private server players have 15 years of experience playing it even though the later expansions have made WoW a more mechanically superior game.
---
Never seen anyone claim Macros are too complex. If someone does, he probably cant tie a shoelace.
---
Thanks man, Seemed cool i still have to watch the video. I think it needed a bit of support from blizz cos of other ppl messing around. I hope there will be more.
---
&gt; Let's live in this hypothetical "anything can happen with classic, so why ask questions"
---
You mean like you do when you conjure up problems that you don't know will exist in the future?
---
&gt;I'm also sorry that anyone that has criticism or a question
---
You have neither. You made a blanket statement about what blizzard has to do, otherwise XYZ will happen.
---
This conversation is at an end now, I will not be hearing from you again.
---
Why would I justify him? I don't watch him. I comment on his behaviour in the beta. If he does something like that on retail than he is an asshole too and you are free to report him or whatever you like to do. If he does violate TOS, he should be punished. What you are saying now is "he should not be punished because others are not being punished as well" and you should be saying " good that he got punished, others that violate TOS should be punished as well".
---
You could be like lv30 on a private server by now.
---
LOL, sure you did mate.
---
So 180,000 players. Definitely not the millions this sub keeps throwing around.
---
Quests and mobs give less rep if they're grey, the minimum is 20% of the normal
---
So yeah, better run, it's not bad with the Zeppelin
---
So the solution to splitting up players at the launch of classic was to implement layering so everyone could play with their friends and guilds... to then ultimately do what they did 15 years ago by 
---
- making more servers
---
- implenting a queue
---
- offering free transfers
---
I guess the only question to ask is - why not start with more server and implement a queue? To avoid dead servers after the first month?
---
Where would the 15k players on server (A) would be transferring to if none of the servers are dead after the first month because layering was implemented then merged into 1 layer.
---
Do players from server (a) now have to decide between sitting in a 7 hour queue or moving their entire guild to a new server with no established population?
---
eMeRGeNt GaMePlAy
---
RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE! BURN THE WITCH!
---
Same. Sucks we can't get it in retail since they nerfed even the food buff that gave us move speed. But I read up on the sword and it has a high proc rate. Great for mindless farming and it procs from specials too not just whites
---
But if RPing doesn't get preferential treatment then why bring it up in the first place? Not trying to be deliberately obtuse, I just don't understand the point you're trying to make. Like you said, griefing is griefing. It rarely gets people banned unless it's truly excessive. 
---
I remember RPing on SWC EU as a dwarf mountaineer waaay back in the day and you'd better believe some of our events got disrupted. Nobody got banned, and we didn't expect them to, we just told them to fuck off and relocated the event to somewhere it wouldn't be disrupted.
---
Yes, I should say that, but it's not applicable when blizzard does it this openly. There's youtube videos where he's doing this. Blizzard clearly doesn't step in, so the "others should be punished as well" step is long passed. At this point people should ask why the streamers are seemingly above TOS.
---
That is true... But there is some good examples of games where you actually Keep your Progress :P
---
But that usually aren't games where the Level matters a lot... So you are quite right
---
**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; [Alliance] EU [RP-PvP] English**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **RP-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.

As a 60 lock I used to farm these huge elite felguards elite in a region, can't remember the name of it at the moment. It was a place full of elite demons (succubus, etc). It was kinda hard and the only way to kill them was to keep them feared while applaying dots. One fail could mean death since they could two shot you. I got an epic Skullflame Shield and it basically made me rich. I still remember it because I was alone in the server at that time, my friends were on a pve server (where I also started playing wow) and I decided I wanted the full pvp experience. Becoming "rich" allowed me to give them money and a motivation to start a new character on my server. Shortly after these events, I got another drop.
---
My crown achievement was getting the ungoro crater fp at level 16
---
‘Asmond’, you see his name everywhere but still can’t spell it right, why?
---
The actual development required is ridiculous, compared to a full title however:
---
* No artwork, music, zone-, model-, questdesign to be done
---
* No balancing runs
---
* No intital infrastructure setup
---
* No CRM setup
---
Classic is essentially a full title, with the development cost of maybe a minor Content-Patch, or even less than that. As u/ZippoCat said, it just prints money.
---
It is honestly the dumbest of things to be pedantic about. When people are talking about spell ranks in classic they're talking about mana classes, not warrior and rogue abilities. No one says Warriors cast spells when simply conversing.
---
Bear is looking for an Alliance EU guild. 
---
Ready to farm MCPs and consumables in general, ready to go heal/decurse/cat if needed for progression/specific boss, aim for PvP exalteds and R10-12.
---
If your guild thinks that a good bear is a benefit but not a burden, message me.
---
Does interface have built in "item sets" so we can swap with 1 click? I remember it was added during wotlk, before that we had to resolve to add ons which were really wonky
---
And this, ladies and gentleman, is why Donald Trump is president.
---
Well, the fact that trollgodx actually was teleported away in this scenario should then be questioned.
---
I am at my wits' end. Seeking any help you can give!
---
I am trying to figure out what I want to play. For some context, I will be playing with my gf, who will be playing a healer (Priest or Shaman). We would like to casually raid with a hint of seriousness, and take part in WSG/BGs. With that in mind, I'm torn between Warrior and Druid.
---
I'll highlight my thoughts (good and bad) on each.
---
Warrior:
---
- Looks cool, fan of the aesthetics
---
- Nice option to tank dungeons with gf at 60, and play Fury in raids (Not looking to MT)
---
- Playstyle is more familiar to me (played Warrior for much of retail)
---
- Plate is expensive, gearing is expensive, everything expensive
---
- Warriors are looking to be the most played class according to surveys (Impact on raid spots?)
---
Druid:
---
- Healing in raids is appealing
---
- Druids looking to be one of the least played classes
---
- Easier to gear up throughout content (pre-raid, MC, BWL, etc)
---
- Travelform is pretty sweet
---
- Not a fan of Taurens, should gf decide to play Shaman and we go Horde
---
- New class + playstyle for me (Could be both a pro/con)
---
I guess it's also worth mentioning that I'm happy to both DPS or Heal in a raid setting. The problem could come down to 5 man settings, where my gf will be healing and I'll either be tanking or DPSing. As a Resto Druid, this could get expensive if I have to respec to Feral for tanking. As a Warrior, please correct me if I'm wrong but I believe I could tank as Fury.
---
Appreciate any tips and guidance you can give, thank you.
---
Because it is blizzards prerogative on every case by case issue.
---
They aren't running servers to (serve) every individual player. They are running servers to make money.
---
If the corporation that I work for donates to a corrupt charity, I have the right to complain to my company. They have the right to ignore me. I can then choose to stay there and accept that I'll never agree to their decisions... or I quit.
---
This isn't an argument of the morality of blizzard... it's the acceptance that we can do, nor demand anything from blizzard after reporting the issue.
---
ehhh sure. undeads have extended water breathing and warlocks can cast underwater breathing on anyone
---
it doesnt come up as often as you tihnk though. world pvp/pvp.
---
Lololol, thanks for that -
---
Free transfers, they've already addressed this issue in one of the interviews that came out of the Classic summit at Blizzard HQ.
---
Thats why I thought we ought to have clusters of separate servers. So they could be merged later on as needed, or not.
---
#  🔴 &lt;GRIND&gt; EU - HORDE - Hardcore - PvP Server 🔴

---
 If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch with us!
---
Yeah!!! I can feel it ahahaha
---
Well, no it doesn't. It's just a bonus included with Blizzard's much bigger revenue stream.
---
I have the same problem, even with retail.  
---
Technically, I could just play through every class and level them up, one by one, but I want the feeling of having a main, like, 'this is my first wow character', but I ruined this. Love the whole theme of monks, so currently 'leveling' an undead monk, but we'll see what happens.  
---
Hoping for a redemption with classic, but I can't decide, also knowing classes were different back then makes the decision even harder, and with no monks, I can't decide.  
---
Considering to play Rogue, Warrior, Shaman, Hunter or Warlock. Primarily considering rogue, since, next to monks, I love the theme of the class, but is it fun? And how is the survivability of the class? (not fan of being squishy squish)  
---
Any input would be appreciated.
---
Which is why I'm trying to raise awareness on this issue, and hopefully end up at a point where they have to address it.
---
try /r/wownoob, that is very helpfull subreddit for WoW game
---
If you don't by your spell, it is def possible to be at 90g for your mount (which is all that is needed. Knowing what to ah and having a mage friend helps. However, it's quite a bite harder on a fresh server.
---
Skinning just makes it so much simpler and allows you to spend some of that gold on spells, gear upgrade, etc.
---
We are **The Remains**, a semi-hardcore guild with experience in several MMORPG's. Looking to return to one of the first MMORPGs we played. TL:DR We are looking for progress, but that essential community feeling is just as important. **Playing Horde on EU PVP server**  
---
**What are the goals of The Remains?**  
---
    
---
**Primary goal** : Enjoy all content on a high level  
---
**We will accomplish that goal, by these sub-goals :**  
---
* Enjoying all aspects of the game  
---
* Become a friendly environment for our WoW members  
---
* Focus groups on different aspects of the game  
---
* Being part of a focus group, doesn't exclude you from other guild content or switching groups  
---
* Have a good reputation on the server because of who we are and what we stand for  
---
**What can we offer you?**  
---
* A nice and friendly environment to call your home  
---
* A teamspeak server to communicate with eachother  
---
* A discord server for discussing WoW or anything else you'd like  
---
* Site and forum to stay in contact outside of the game  
---
* Raiding times will be Tuesday and Thursday from 19:30 till 22:30 (CE(S)T) and possibly Sunday from 20:00 till 23:00. Other evenings we will organise things as well, which will be discussed at a later date  
---
* EPGP guild loot system  
---
     
---
**What do we want from you?**   
---
* Friendly and mature behaviour towards the guild and others   
---
* For hardcore players your commitment  
---
* For casual players your warmth and kindness  
---
**What are the pillars of The Remains?**  
---
* Being a close community  
---
* Work together to accomplish common goals   
---
* No mass recruiting, we recruit people with the same goals and attitude, not to become a zerg guild  
---
* Respect, to eachother, to others and from others to us

yep

My info comes from a data miner whose pulled apart the actual data files. Streamers are probably going on outdated information.
---
You can't target enemy tokens with /target on the beta. [proof](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433646958)
---
And let's say server (A) balloons to 12k players and after the tourists leave there are still 8k players.
---
Of those 8k players, some are okay with the queue since that's their home server... others take the transfer and leave.
---
Are we to believe that the classic population of servers will only go down and never remain at a high population?
---
The progressive itemisation I’m referring to is the unlocking of more dungeon blues as the phases go on. Many of the best dungeon blues on any preBiS list won’t be in the game at the start. Think Brigam Girdle from General Drakkisath. 
---
Did you not know? People have been using the same term to refer to this.
---
Makes me wondering how difficult it will be to 'get ahead of the pack' during phase one. Because presumably, if you rush to 30 and enter Desolace or whatever, you'll just find 40 people in that zone anyway. Right?
---
Since they've already said that they want to remove layering by phase 2 I expect them to have a cap in mind for phase 1 also.
---
Let's say they want to have a max population of 5k once layering gets removed they might have a projection of 50% of the pop either quitting or playing much more casually after the initial rush in phase 1 so they might put a total cap with layering at 12-15k or so.
---
I don't think they would ever force anyone to transfer but when people have been seeing a couple of hours of queue for a week or so a bunch of them will transfer volutairily.
---
lmao
---
Personally I'll be rolling a night elf priest for all kinds of mind control shadowmeld shenanigans
---
This is a tough one, if it's against ToS as some form of griefing, then f him.
---
But i'm also all for, basically "Freedom to play" even if it is borderline harassment.  I would never personally messed with a tournament for THAT long, because in the end, this was super beneficial for the game, and he only made it worse in a reality....
---
One a side note, I sort of expected the tournament to be somewhere in Org.  People were complaining about lag early on, not to mention alliance who could grief, stand in the way, accidentally cause someone to AOE and flagged them, I just couldn't understand a reason to have in such a public place, outside of making it feel more epic because alliance can watch
---
Blackfathom Deeps
---
The honor system will be introduced in phase 2, layering will be phased out before.
---
I’ve got to say the detail is amazballs 👍
---
They removed the fishing skill requirement for a fishing competition?
---
The only issue I have with them is that I constantly feel I could do better and end up restarting again and again. I've never even reached the endgame crisis in Stellaris.
---
I got to meet and chat for a min with Ven at Bilzzcon 2017 and I really enjoyed it. He's just like he is in his stream, chill.
---
Omg this is hilarious. Great job
---
Why? He probably got reported by every person at that tournament several times over, and Blizzard still let them do it for hours before they stepped in. I still don't get the point you're trying to make.
---
Might as well unbind those heals if you're not going to use them.
---
Or a lock, because tank.
---
&gt;You mean like you do when you conjure up problems that you don't know will exist in the future?
---
Because there isn't a 15 year history of the exact same things happening within the exact same company and game? 
---
&gt;This conversation is at an end now, I will not be hearing from you again.
---
Good for you, you've slain the dragon and conquered the nation! What a brute!
---
History says layering will kill the level of enjoyment by a huge margin - you refuse to look on what has happened and only anticipate your own cherry merry thoughts.
---
Are there any Alliance guilds planning to roll on a PVP server and using [Loot Lists](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/)?
---
Eventually, yes.

**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids.
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1.
---

I'm trying to raise awareness toward this favouring. If you don't see it at all, then that's fine. Hopefully someone else will.
---
It’s so unfair when football players win football matches.
---
Feel free to do all of this, but let me remind you that classic is about community, a locked community. If you're a dickhead, its going to hit you back in the end.
---
Team pvp, yes. Solo? Laughable.
---
Holy is the only viable spec in any content, but Holy can AoE farm diremaul plants with decent gear so your gold farming is nearly as good as a prot dmg reflect spec, ret cannot farm for shit.
---
Pair up with a warlock hunter or warrior in the world and just spam cleanse/heal/support their ass and you are unstoppable except when you face a real tryhard pvper where you actually need to step up your game.
---
IMO Paladin is a fun class but due to how basic they are you rely on gadgets to shine. Everyone loves a paladin in PvE so finding spots as a healer in raids will be a piece of cake. Early on it is more difficult to pvp as holy as you either farm early rankings for the pvp gear or wait till BWL where you can get t2 for pvp (t2 is decent for pve but cloth leather etc is usually better) as this is where you begin to get "real" plate spellpower gear.
---
Oh okay will have to look it up.
---
Wondering what % of players will free transfer to a server that has no established player base.
---
Also wonder if no new players will ever join classic after the first month and not join popular servers (increasing that population again)
---
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
---
People optimized their dps more than back then, if anything alliance makes it braindead easy because dps can not care about their threat. Not gonna say horde is weaker here.
---
Watch Stormx on youtube and be certain of your chad druid. 
---
I however am going paladin because i need that cleanse, that freedom, and those heal crits returning sweet sweet mana. 
---
And ofc meme spellpower spec eventually for the Lulz.
---
I think the Thunderbluff zeppelin was only added in wrath tbh.
---
No, that’s your dad.
---
Well that makes skinning a better choice. Both skills and mount helps you a lot on levelling.
---
Thanks for explanation .
---
Don't forget garrison hearth with the draenor hub (cant even remember their names...) portals a minute away
---
the perfect game doesnt exi...
---
A
---
It was on gamecube brah
---
Completely untrue
---
They technically do with layering - that's what they are, mirrors of eachother that work under the 1 umbrella of a server.
---
Their goal is to merge all (we don't know if that's going to be 2 layers per server or 7) layers down to 1 by the end of phase 1.
---
Would just like to know if our starting server in phase 2 will come with a 7 hour queue everyday or if we'll have to free transfer to a new server that has no established playerbase... which removes the entire build up from launch.
---
 Lets not instance everything like retail wow thanks
---
... How are they being favoured when they were trolled for hours on end, while hundreds of people reported them, and Blizz sat back and watched? Sure, *eventually* they ported two people away, after the damage was already done. I really don't understand where you're coming from.
---
Had to fix depths to deeps, sry.
---
Here is my strategy as a Shadow Priest:
---
1. Get Enchanting so you can built this first wand
---
2. Learn Herbs after I got my wand and forget enchanting
---
3. Get Tailoring to 300 and get the Robe at Strat
---
4. Sell some herbs if needed for gold, but keep the most
---
5. Learn Alchy after I got my robe and level it with the herbs I kept + farm a bit more when lvl 60 to get it to 300
---
Any thoughts or feedback? :)  took me a bit research and thinking to come up with that :D but I figured out Herbs/Alchy is the best for PVE raiding and money making in the end game. Of course you could start arguing about engineering, but I was never a big fan of it during vanilla.
---
1.12 one is the answer, without even reading your title.
---
Should be possible to check, afaik the specialization requires level 30.
---
Nothing? Who cares about a slight imbalance to the number of options?
---
Path of Exile, new league launches soon and will run for 3 months, the perfect tie-in to wow classic and actually an amazing ARPG.
---
saving this
---
I don't wanna start any drama but the whole tournament was kind of controversial and that might have been a bigger incentive to delete the "evidence".
---
Just a few things I recall off the top of my head:
---
* Various instances of players pre-bubbling or pre-hotting, which was against the rules. Tipsout completely ignored the chat asking him to look at the clip proving this.
---
* At least two players had buffs given to them by other classes that they did not tick off when the duel started. Again, Tipsout ignored the chat trying to link him evidence.
---
* Two trolls sabotaged 90% of the tournament by standing on top of the competitors on level 1 taurens, blocking their view of casting animations. In one instance a competitor claimed they even stood on top of totems, making them untargetable.
---
* Tipsout had a private conversation with one of the finalists (Venruki) before they dueled. It's not clear what was said specifically as he muted the stream, but it definitely had the vibe that some kind of shady deal was being made.
---
If this was just for fun, I wouldn't care, but in a tournament with $2,000 on the line, I feel like it should've been organized and monitored more professionally.
---
Number one on that list was me back in Vanilla, the day i got Doomguard i went to Westfall and in General " Need help summoning a friend! " Most people back then were always more than willing to help out and due to being new didn't know the difference between Portal of summoning and Doom pedestal, Infernal in the AH was a good chuckle also.
---
It was 100x more fun when i was the one sacrificed.
---
And that's great, but they don't have to address it if they choose not to.
---
There isn't a chance they will come out and say "we have better relationships with streamers and personalities so we give them the benefit of the doubt or extra response time"
---
And they will never go into why a player was banned because it's nobody's business
---
But I do applaud your diligence on getting the information out there.
---
If that is the case the early content should be boosted to reflect the correct difficulty.
---
I'm not going to continue a discussion with someone trying to set up strawmen
---
If only we were talking retail....  
---

---
Well Asmongold is hosting the alliance one sometime soon so you could watch that, and then id imagine the alliance champion will face Venruki. Should be fun!
---
It's the 30 minute CD 2 minute duration one that scales with your engineering level.
---
Because the same has happened in RP servers, and been made videos out of, advocating for this behaviour even more. And nothing happens. I can't argue that there were same amounts of reports, but I'm pretty damn sure there were many then as well. But the videos and advocating for that behaviour is much more inflicting than that one "tournament" troll
---
I assume he means they won’t add new items with fun stats, not that they’ll delete the old ones.
---
That was one of the most fun I’ve had watching a stream also RIP soda I felt really bad for him
---
Depends a lot on the server. There have been good ones and bad ones. :)

 **Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**  Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
**&lt;Hellion&gt; [EU][H][PVP] Hardcore light!**
---
**Introduction**
---
Hellion is a guild for people that want to be able to mix serious raiding with real life obligations. It's a guild for those of us that want to clear all content at a steady pace, but in a sensible and time efficient way. 
---
We are now looking for more players of high standard that know their class and play it well, prepares for raids in terms of consumables, pre raid bis gear, enchants and strategy. The goal is to form a tight roster of highly skilled and like minded players.
---
It's a big plus if you have experience from raiding in vanilla, but it's not a requirement.
---
= You can level to 60 somewhat fast and commit to a maximum of 3 raids a week, 3 hours per raid. Most likely Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00. 
---
= You know your class and play it well.
---
= You can think and act in stressfull situations. 
---
= You show up prepared to every raid. Strategy, consumables, pre raid bis gear and enchants.
---
= Willingness to build a positive reputation for the guild. You represent all of us when you wear the &lt;Hellion&gt; name. Act accordingly.
---
= You are a team orientated player, what's best for the team has priority over you. We gear the raid to progress. Be cool with a transparent loot council and realize that you will get your stuff faster if we kill stuff faster.
---
**We offer**
---
= Mature and experienced vanilla guild and raid management.
---
= An opportunity to clear all the raids in Classic without insane commitment requirements.
---
= Laid back atmosphere.
---
= New friendships that will hopefully last a lifetime!
---
**Raid schedule**
---
Most likely Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00.
---
If this resonates, please visit our discord for more information https://discord.gg/e5tzH2B
---
Exactly, there isn't a possibility of getting ahead unless they make it to where each zone is a separate layer... which is what we currently have in BFA and that's sharding.
---
That's why I would like them to either add the ability to select the server layer we want to play on after logging in, or just lockout every charachter from joining a new layer after logging in for a set amount of time, 1 hr, 6 hours, whatever they feel is necessary.
---
just cause there are guides, it does not mean everyone will read them... if you think there wont be tons of noobs, then you don't understand humans at all. today, you can google stuff in seconds, yet people STILL ask on forums where a) they wait for the reply for hours or b) get laughed on for being lazy idiots
---
You mean day 1 when it was 2 apes guys against a full R1 glad team and they were yelling “Apes who?!?” and talking shit?
---
My names william and I’m an altoholic...
---
I am not justifying the troll, but thats a part of classic wow aswell.
---
Nice
---
I'm pretty sure that if (unrealistic, I know, but hypothetically) 70+% of the player base host a boycott unless they adress it, they'll do so. There's less realistic things that's happened in games, games have removed entire futures from games because enough people reacted.
---
thats a great idea
---
this post is so unexpectedly and unintentionally funny to me
---
Respeccing costs a lot, healers are good at soloing because the self heals when things go side ways. I used to never step out of healing spec and didn't regret it, just took awhile to kill stuff
---
Also now considering druid because speed...hmm
---
Go SMOrc or go home!
---
Are they really adding dual spec? Cause that's some big qol, albeit a loss of a big gold sink later on.
---
Resisting 1 out of every 3 stuns (everyone has a 5% resist) is just godly, especially as a cloth wearer getting surprised by Rogues. Any class that can be an Orc, should be an Orc.
---
Garotte doesn't silence lol
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy09EIDGm0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy09EIDGm0k)  gotta link the better version.
---
while someone like you, who uses words like "beta" is going to be so "alpha" right? xD
---
I can’t find my spell powered slam spec for my warrior.
---
Yes! Feed the hype for classic and (hopefully) the return of a good cod game MW!
---
More like the power of an actually good player, against a racist dipshit noob streamer, too dumb to use his heals.
---
I see you only talk about the convinient parts of my response, so I won't bother giving further opinions.
---
Intentionally pulling the AV boss out of his base during attempts, so he resets, and your side can't finish AV.
---
pretty sure they said there will be paid server transfers so there's that
---
Okay, i probably just missed that, however i did see that venruki was close to losing to a hunter, still cool event to watch him win.
---
Orc is objectively better if you're interested in min-maxing. If not just whatever looks coolest.
---
Nearly a third of incoming stuns are resisted. Its just so good in PvP
---
Considering leveling a warrior, even though it takes forever. But is the warrior gear-dependent?
---
But did they listen?
---
Orc, the resist stun is Ugee!
---
Just do whatever you want. There will be “hardcore” that won’t accept you and there will be other “casual” or non-tryhard guilds who will. Raiding in vanilla was not hard. When I was 12 I played an arms warrior with PvP gear equipped and got carried through MC, ZG, and AQ even though I was trash at the game.
---
&gt;Let's say they want to have a max population of 5k once layering gets removed they might have a projection of 50% of the pop either quitting or playing much more casually after the initial rush in phase 1 so they might put a total cap with layering at 12-15k or so.
---
Agree and I believe that's probably pretty damn accurate as to what blizzard is thinking going into launch. 
---
So with that in mind, and I know this is a sensitive topic for some people (for some reason I'll never understand) what happens when a streamer says or gets found out that server (A) is their home and they have 10-15k people wanting to log on to that server in phase 2? Does that server just get a 10 hour queue until guilds decide to move off that server?
---
Then that server just ultimately has 5 guilds on each faction that consist of only people that follow those streamers.
---
This is all just interesting to me since this has never been an issue because streaming wasn't nearly as big as it is now back when they just started implementing sharding in retail.
---
I mean, privateserver are illegal anyway, so why bother.
---
All the horrors of drinking that 20g potions just to wipe while stepping into cthun’s chamber!
---
Hoping for that sweet Classic -&gt; TBC -&gt; WotLK -&gt; Reboot cycle
---
The winner was Trollgodx.
---
If you’re not happy about it. Don’t get it. You can pay 50gold per respec.
---
Do you have some pathological issue making you hate on classic wherever you can?
---
I have seen you in multiple threads now, and all you do, is somehow talk it down, usually with zero or no evidence to support your claims, and no basis whatsoever.
---
**Yes, is does.**
---
If something doesn't cost a lot to develop, and makes a good deal of money, it is printing money. The fact that it is surrounded by other products, doesn't change that.
---
Okay, take RP out of the equation, you already said that has nothing to do with it and it's just confusing. So streamers have griefed people on normal servers and they've been griefed themselves on this one. You already said it was for a similar length of time to this. Sounds to me like they just stopped before Blizz stepped in. It's really hard when I don't have any reference points, do you at least have like, one video of this stuff happening for a long period of time?
---
Found the weeb.
---
I imagine that the more people report bad behaviour, the more likely it will be punished. Obviously on such event a lot of people are reporting it so it is easier for stremers to get blizzard's attention but it is not like it's their fault. It is Blizzard's fault for not reacting approprietly.
---
I think the servers will cap at 3-5k.
---
Orc probably better for PVP. At higher gear levels, when you're stunned by a rogue, you either pop a free action potion or you die. (And if they pop a shadow reflector in response, you still die.) With the stun resistance, you can at least get lucky and not automatically lose to any decent rogue. If I were to reroll warlock, personally I'd go orc.
---
&gt; Refuse to cap the flag in wsg. There are some very good places to hide the flag (look them up), and in vanilla you don't appear on the map.
---
Both flag carriers show up on the map on the beta.
---
this post got more upvotes than subs on retail
---
you enjoy putting labels on people, don't you
---
Druid hybrid should be on that list...
---
No, videos are cut down for a reason. I don't think you'll find any videos on YouTube from any big streamers lasting more than maximum 2ish hours at best.
---
It's a free product included with a paid product. It cannot make money.
---
And no, I don't hate Classic WoW, as many of my posts will show. I just fucking love triggering all of you.
---
God damn the hunter part.
---
My brother had 3 hunters at different levels twinked out to pvp on.
---
All in all he spent about $1,500 in gold buying the bis gear to twink them out back then.
---
I don't know what that means (congratulations, you're smarter than me)
---
- to simply put - there is no guarantee that servers will fall into a reasonable population by the end of phase 1
---
- and without that guarantee I would just like to know what blizzard has planned or is thinking about doing when they get rid of layering
---
- will our starting servers be playable or will we have to decide between sitting in a 8 hour queue or transferring to a dead server?
---
If asking "will our starting servers be playable or will we have to decide between sitting in a 8 hour queue or transferring to a dead server?" Is trying to set you up or not worthy of a question then what is the point of this sub?
---
Considering that ~~almost~~ all specs are hybrid specs, that is a nonsensical poll.
---
What's a 30/0/21 Warlock? An Affliction Lock? No, most of his damage comes from shadowbolt. A destrolock then? No, he has 9 more points in affliction.
---
&lt;Zz&gt; Hardcore Raiding Guild
---
North American Horde
---
West Coast / PVP Realm
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Zz&gt; is comprised of a core of 15 veteran World of Warcraft players, our leadership has cleared through Naxxramas on Private servers and has raided in top retail guilds such as &lt;Gentleman's Club&gt; and &lt;Midwinter&gt;. We are eager to find players that want to bring a hardcore mindset to Classic.
---
**Goals on launch:** Our first goal will be to achieve a **World Top 5 Ragnaros** and as such we are looking for people interested in leveling quickly and diving straight into the end-game content. We are confident that we can kill Ragnaros by day 9 if not faster.
---
**Goals beyond launch:**" Once we have killed Ragnaros we are going to be forming a second raid and doing split runs and once Phase 2 is released we will be pushing to have as many players reach Rank 14 as possible.
---
**Raid Times:** Scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday 6pm-10pm PST, Early on you can expect the weekly raid commitment to be only about 2 hours per week since it will just be Molten Core and Onyxia. Your schedule should be flexible and agreeable with raiding Sunday and Monday as extra raid days for new content releases and split raids.
---
**Requirements:** Raiders will be expected to show up to raids fully consumed and with an attitude that lends itself to working in a team environment. We're looking for players with competitive mindsets who will push each other to improve and overall better the guild. Members will also be required to have a level 20 Warlock/summoning alt for world bosses. 
---
**How to Apply:** It's as easy as sending in an application! &lt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link&gt;
---
Feel free to  DM me with any questions. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
My favourite pastime. You didn't deny being a weeb, so I guess I should go pro with my labeling, what do you think?
---
I'm also addressing the hypocrisy in their behaviour now vs. When they do this themselves.
---
True, and I just want layering to be more polished for launch, it doesn't have to be perfect but it can be improved.
---
Lvl 30 is a weird threshold. Mage can have both coldsnap and ice block at lvl 30, making him quite a duel powerhouse. If the tournament was held in lvl 29, it would be quite a different thing. Same goes with lvl 60.
---
What about my post suggests I'm mad about anything lol. I even said it was a big qol (quality of life) change if they are indeed putting it in.... You didn't even answer if they were adding it or not.
---
Orc, because Female Orc == awesome, and Undead tatters suck visually.
---
They may look cool in the beginning, but I played an Undead male warlock for the entirety of Vanilla, and ended up regretting the choice.
---
I never experienced that. Weren’t there servers only in Europe and NA up until cataclysm ?
---
I don't really care how some random kid labels me on reddit, sorry to burst your bubble.
---
Cheers, just wanted to make sure cuz i couldnt check this out myself on the beta *sadface*
---
I mostly want it to experience the small community with all the famous streamers and the level 30 cap which brings a new kind of end game that's not returning ever again.

---
**Focus-** Experiencing the World of Warcraft while obtaining fortune and glory with a motley crew of hard lifes, lowlifes, and no-lifes. The goal is to play on an RP-PvP server, but if blizzard fails us, we'll roll on whatever the community decides is the unofficial RP-PvP server. The PvP part is the important one.   
---
**Scheduling-** Raiding Monday and Tuesday every other week from 1930-2300 during phase one and two. This allows us to hit two raid lockouts back to back then return to farming, PvP, and general tomfoolery for the rest of the week.  
---
**Loot-** DKP

**Leadership-** Last played retail in Cata. Working adults with no tolerance for wasting the group's time

**Membership -** Seeking people with a goals-based mindset who want to be in Azeroth to escape the overbearing culture of politics and memery that has invaded all video games and all of the internet this past decade. We do not care if you are a MAGApede, a Hilldawg, a Bernout, a Fascist or a Communist. Can you get out of Rain of Fire and press your buttons in something resembling the correct order? Fantastic, you're hired. Total noobs are allowed. Although leadership has a lot of experience on private servers, expecting everyone to have been playing technically illegal copies of a 15 year old game is a big ask.

We were doing Baron Geddon and we had a muslim who didn't want to move out of the raid when he was the bomb. Shit was really frustrating.
---
And the servers that have 8k additional people wanting to play on that specific server? 10 hour queues or will they disable any new characters being created on those servers?
---
As few as there are of streamers, it's a legitimate question that blizzard hasn't had to deal with before since retail has sharding which give a potential unlimited amount of players per popular server.
---
But these aren't just players, they're STREAMERS!!!! How do you expect them to use playing video games as their main source of income of people keep killing / interacting with them in the game?!?!
---
Edgy
---
Some I understand whey the are funny, but some are just plainly being a jerk.
---
I'm a man now though (at least my mom says so must be true)
---
They won't necessarily open up free transfers to completely new realms but to realms with population issues.
---
I can just speak for myself as someone who used free transfers i vanilla. For my guild it was a very enticing offer, partly because of the queues but partly because of world bosses and things like that. On a new server we could establish more control over the outdoor world and make a name for ourselves and that was exactly what happened. We became kings of that server, opened the gates of AQ and had a much better time playing the game.
---
A lot of people will probably flock to popular servers but after a while they'll realize that it's a double edged sword and may long for a more reasonably populated server with less top guilds.
---
Hopefully they will lock the server before that becomes an issue, and most viewers won't sit in hours of queue just to be on the same server as a streamer.
---
I'm not sure what the plan is but I bet that blizzard is working on something for this.
---
Healing lvl 15-60 cuz of Dungeons,  by far the most fun role. 
---
Dps is alright for dungeons depends how much utility you gonna use. 
---
Tank is pretty hectic imo I couldn't handle it to go full tank in classic. 
---
For raiding dps or tank. Raidhealing is literally 2 button gameplay, as a priest all you do is spamming heal and flash heal, no pots/flask/food needed. Really low effort gameplay.
---
Suicide Kings?
---
Thanks Satan!
---
Dont get this one, can explain?
---
You decided to engage with me, buddy. I can't just sit back and let you go unlabeled after that, especially when you're such an easy target, being a weeb and all.
---
&gt;It's a free product included with a paid product. It cannot make money.
---
That is the most absurd and nonsensical statement I read today.
---
Classic is ALREADY bringing back subscribers, just because many people believe that you need an active subscription to get a Beta Invite. It is already making a huge amount of people care about, and talk about the game. The marketing value alone, is worth more than anything they invested in its production so far.
---
And no, it's not a free product. I am not currently paying a subscription. I will pay a subscription once classic launches, to play Classic. Therefore, I am paying a monthly fee to Blizzard that I wouldn't pay if Classic didn't exist.
---
&gt;I just fucking love triggering all of you.
---
You are not triggering anyone, that's just your justification and apologetic explanation towards yourself to better cope with the fact that all you do is exposing yourself to public ridicule.
---
Aaaaaaaaaaand now every hunter will roll for it too
---
Undead also have a terrible /train sound LOL
---
How does this work in regards to stealing content?
---
If this is official no issue, and if Tips isn't planning on an upload, again w/e, but otherwise I don't know.
---
This was Tips content. I don't know how I feel about this. I feel he should've been the one to upload it...
---
Alright, then there's not really much left to say, it's just anecdotal. I don't believe that a streamer was allowed to get away with intentionally griefing people for any longer than those two taurens were allowed to do the same, which was several hours, specifically because they were a streamer. If there's no video evidence of it (not even a Twitch VOD somewhere?) then there's not really much discussion to be had.
---
Warriors get a bad wrap, they're the slowest out of all classes if all the classes were in the hands of a speed leveler... 
---
Warriors are the strongest overall class, and yeah they struggle on their own a bit and don't have much sustain but they do huge damage, and leveling is far more about commitment than speed.
---
If you commit to getting to 60, you're already going to be "faster" than a majority of the players lol cuz most won't survive the grind. Just buy food for your warrior or keep a healer around and you're more than fine.

Had to answer fury but I'll be running a fury/prot build for offtanking.
---
Thanks for sharing your experience with it, I just feel as though layering solves that influx of players but disabling it causes these issues.
---
I hope when they offer free transfer that there are established servers that are sub 3k players after removing layering.
---
It just seems more likely they will have to merge dead servers like they did in the past.
---
Cannot wait the salt when [this](https://imgur.com/a/uoWXZkS) happens.
---
I'd rather there not be, but if someone wants to dump $20+ every time they scam 2-3 people, then go for it. That seems like a huge waste of rl money for such a trivial little act of assholery. I also doubt it's going to be very easy to scam anyone out of meaningful shit these days. Ninjalooting anything that matters usually results in background checks on new servers by any decent guild, so that shouldn't be an issue either.
---
r/gamersriseup
---
I didn't enjoy healing 5 mans, I don't think that's their strength.
---
Raid healing was OK.
---
PvP is great, they're a really versatile class in duels and have a high skill ceiling, and they're the best flag carriers in WSG.
---
I don't think you'll regret it.
---
For a hunter the time would be even less considering you can send your pet to the next mob while skinning and as a BM hunter the pet will probably be half way through the HP before you start attacking.
---
Endgame will be rough for you... you have 2 options.
---
- play with people at all times
---
- have tons of gold to respec constantly
---
&gt;since I’m from a FPS background
---
Out of curiosity, how did you move there? Because all FPS players I know, use WASD as well.
---
I cant really answer this question properly because i dont know if u are more of a tryhard type or not. If u are tryhard then you will have to put in a lot more effort to make feral be competitive against other specs. e.g. getting consumes and crowd pummelers for raids. if dont give a fuck about being the best or min maxing then who cares just do it. if u are a pvper, you dont just sit in cat form as feral. u use every single form equally if u want to be successful
---
# &lt;Informal&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore]  MORNING EST
---
**INTRO:** This is a brand new Semi-Hardcore guild being made from the ground up. I am looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. It does not matter if you are new to classic or a veteran, All I want are dedicated players willing to do what it takes to down bosses. If you can do this, I want you on the team.
---
**GOAL:**
---
\-week 3/4 MC clear
---
\-Clear all content quickly and efficiently
---
(example: phase 1 should be 1 raid night, except for off day ONY)
---
\-Clear Naxx, full T3 guild before BC release
---
**EXPECTATIONS:** I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. I want everyone on and ready 15 minutes before raid begins. During progression I expect full consumables to help us get the kills we need. 
---
**LOOT:** Council and roll decay. Some loot is too important to be simply bought or rolled for. Others are not so much. So we will be using a mix of these 2 systems.
---
**SCHEDULE:**
---
**RAID TIMES** \- EST, MORNING
---
7:00-10:00 AM EST
---
**RAID DAYS** \- MON / WED / THUR
---
Discord [https://discord.gg/Dzb9rj5](https://discord.gg/Dzb9rj5)
---
I'm sure there is, but I'm not Going to sub to them just to prove a point here. Go on any RP forum and you'll find several people who have stories about entire RP campaigns being griefed by streamers. But I'm just trying to raise awareness on this. If this continues into release, then blizz will eventually feel the real backlash from favouring streamers.
---
rather be called a weeb than be someone who uses "beta" as a serious insult, go back to fortnite or what dirt you crawled from
---
Is dual spec confirmed though?
---
you're right, wanted to share the whole experience but seems like this reddit just wants to see random 2004 screenshots :(
---
Holy Paladins were making good money off SM farmruns IIRC. Yes, they do crap damage, but even crap damage can AoE down a cluster of mobs if you cannot fuckin die :D
---
Do you have a source for this claim? The best times I've seen is from the speed running competition on Barrens Chat, and it's on repack with nothing to worry about except good routing.
---
With live competition and no sleep I have a hard time seeing any "normal" individual making it @24h to level 30.

I think a lot of my guild in classic were also muslim then...
---
In real life, mentally deranged people should be put in an asylum. In a game, they should be put on the GM island.
---
Who is the scuffed jakenbake that got destroyed by a hunter 8 levels under him?
---
Have seen his name before but know nothing about him... was he a private server hero or something?
---
WoW has servers in:
---
* Oceania
---
* US  (Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern)
---
* Latin America
---
* Brazil
---
* Europe (English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian)
---
* China (Shanghai, Beijing, Sichuan, Guangdong)
---
* Korea
---
* Taiwan
---
Doesn't mean Muslims don't play.
---
Queue's and free transfers for anyone that doesn't want to wait 3+ hours to play.
---
Power Word:Fortitude on players just as they jump off the zeppelin. PWF increases max life but not current life, givinng them several % lower % HP. if they jumped early, this can kill them (works better on lower players
---
They haven't even said how big servers will be. Also there be queues from the start to prevent unbalanced population. Only maybe the big streamer server will be problematic as you described.
---
Btw. I don't like layering either but not because of the transition to phase 2.
---
Mmorpg's on par with content and quality of wow classic? I have not seen one.
---
If you want play druid then play it. I doubt you will ever regret it unless you want compete in lfr mode meters. It's the one class that can do everything quite well but it's not best at anything but being so versatile (tho moonkin might be quite hard with mana issues but you can still try it if you really want).
---
You can dps, heal and tank while you level and find what you like best. If you fall in love with tanking then I have good news for you: you can even tank in end game if you gear right and know what you do. Most druids will still just heal because it's so chill and you don't have to compete with others. There are generally quite few druids in game so you get geared out very fast while raiding.
---
About pvp, you can be a god. You have more tools than anyone else, you're fast, stealthy, tanky, have cc and heals + long range spells. There's so many playstyles you can have and you can adapt for each encounter differently. And if things go south you can always just run away and save time for avoiding that corpse run.
---
Druid is my second favorite class (after priest because I like all the healing tools they have) and you can't go wrong with that unless you're very competitive person.  I find something a bit similar with hunters as well so you could try keep an eye for that also. Simply put: everything is under your control whether it's far or close and if that's your playstyle then go for it. Don't let others decide what you should play because if something is not genuinely fun for you, you'll just end up losing interest in it.
---
Get fucked alliance. Good luck leveling an alt within the first 8 months.
---
Alexensual, some selfclaimed private server hero
---
Undead instant cast animations are to good to go anything else..
---
\&gt; but I do not recall, any of us ever EVER being verbally toxic to our griefers.  
---
I like your post and I agree with the sentiment of it since I really do miss UO (never played EQ.) But you really can't recall an instance of someone being verbally abuse and going off in a rage over being griefed? I think we were more accepting of it back then, but people absolutely would lose their temper. I don't remember the specifics of the game worked, but once my partner "stole" a fancy horse (a nightmare?) to tame right out from under someone else and they sent her legit death threats.
---
While this is correct people will quickly get the information on which servers the streams plan to play on and can avoid them. If you go onto a stream server without knowing it it will be an issue but most guilds will at the very least wait to pick a server without streamers to be unaffected by them
---
What the Fuck Did You Just Bring Upon This Cursed Land
---
"cultural" lol
---
I agree that favouring streamers is bad, it just didn't happen last night and I've not seen any evidence that streamers get treated differently for doing so, so I don't know what awareness you're trying to raise. Plenty of streamers get banned from the game, hell Preach recently took a month for abusing some leveling bug. RPers getting griefed has happened since the start of the game, streamers have nothing to do with it.
---
Isn’t it nice we’ll have a chance to create characters before launch?
---
You sound like someone who's tired of being called beta, too. A beta weeb, name a more iconic duo.
---
Idc if we have to take a short break if someone has to do a quick wank, open the door to accept a package, need to take a shit or have to pray.
---
Aslong as it does not take to long. But you cannot expect a group of 39 people to wait for personal things. Most raids will have 1 or 2 shorts breaks a night.
---
pretty sure we can expect more of the "joe is my friend, he will get this item over you" or "joe is our guild streamer, let's give him free shit" than good old ninjalooting but people are not that smarted as you may think. there will still be guilds who's legendary items will be stolen
---
I meant it from ARPG perspective. Never used WASD to move , rather , I used a my LMB to Point and click
---
could you get a little bit more in detail about that?
---
Dont forget that 5% orc pet damage.
---
If you switch to classic, don't judge it based on the trial you are about to play. 
---
Modern wow blows chunks and a tried and true mmorpg is classic... but at the end of the day you might enjoy modern more since you are new to mmorgps.
---
Healbot still exists in retail. It doesn't autoheal. It lets you set up clicks and modifiers to heal off a grid, eg I right click the tank's name on my grid and it puts a PW:S on him.
---
Do you have a source for the servers allowing 15k on there to begin with? Because that doesn't make much sense since the vanilla cap was much lower.
---
If you don't have a source, could it be that they'll use layering just to make the starting areas not so cramped? That's what I'm thinking
---
ok, so griefing makes the game fun for you, to each their own..
---
attack speed normalization only applies to the damage gained by AP, not to the damage on the weapon itself.
---
it is only in mail for 3-5 days
---
RemindMe! 84 days
---
what is the secret to getting a beta invite?
---
I mean yeah, if you compare leveling a mage playing like a headless chicken, running in circles killing yourself over and over in fire spec, to leveling a warrior playing optimally, then I guess both class are about as good, but I don’t feel like that’s a really fair comparison...
---
I was the same until I got shift working job and a car.  Then I stacked it on.
---
And I appreciate it! I'm mostly only familiar with vanilla from a solo perspective, or playing with a friend or two, so I never really understood WHY having unwanted specs was such an issue.
---
That is honestly the most detailed answer I've ever seen on this subreddit, and it is incredible. Thank you for the information!
---
got one for you, trihard kid
---
Yeah, I’m the same way playing pranks on people is fun for them. Griefing people in wow by corpse camping them or disrupting their play somehow is some harmless fun
---
just don't download retail and wait for classic.
---
If other people's decisions affect how you enjoy your gameplay then yeah go orc.
---
Don't know what that is, but I'm sure it's cool.

Had internet connection issues and put bloodvine vest in the auction house for 8g...it was sold within seconds :(
---
Im guessing the drop in numbers is also due to the fact that when WoW was released it was the only option in terms of an MMO in that scale, it attracted a lot of people to try it out. Once they did, they were hooked. And they stayed loyal to the game for a long time. But a lot of people has since left the game due to growing older, kids, fatigue or whatever and its harder to attract today's youth because of the wide variety of games out there
---
The run across the barrens, as an alliance player, just to find some random NPC to get my Felhound was a quest I'll never forget.

That's bullshit.

If grenades are allowed which require engineering, then should everything else.

A video says more than 254 words:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp6V7JdfxsY
---
Name: Exiled -- Semi-Hardcore
---
Region/Raid Time: NA - Eastern Standard Time with 2-3 raid days(Wed/Fri/Sun) for progression and gear 6:30 - 9PM + EST Server Type: PVP
---
Faction:      Horde
---
Priorities: Raid First, PvP second but we like the construct of the ability for open PvP.
---
Discord: We do have our own discord, PM if you are interested
---
Rules/About Us: Currently, we are a mature group of men and women. It's a discord where there is freedom of discussion of whatever topics and many of us have known each other for literally 15+ years. Some in this discord are family members and good friends. We have over 40 people who will be playing Classic WoW. At least two more meetings to discuss loot council, class leaders, what server we will play and to talk about anything else. 
---
We do not expect anyone to play a certain role they do not want however, the best top 45 members in the guild will be the core, but it looks like we may be hurting for Druids, healers. In our discord we breakdown everyone's committed profession, race and class. Whisper if you are interested and I will get you the discord information or ask addition questions. Thank you!
---
Ideally you'll communicate enough before hand to know if anyone has a time limit... I can't wait to get rid of the people who queue up for arams and leave 8 minutes in because they "thought they would have the time"
---
"I am a streamer, so I am a special snowflake!"
---
Did he say Wadu?
---
Go do your own research you lazy fak. And how poor are u if u can’t afford $10 for a race change if u wanna be the other race???
---
Then show up to raids on time or leave the guild
---
Best case scenario would be every big streamer on the same realm. They can organize whatever they want and everyone can watch it and enjoy it. If you like it join there server if you dont join a diffrent realm.
---
That's usually how it works but since every server at launch doesnt have a cap and is instead layered, when Phase 2 comes around some servers will have more players than the normal cap when layering  is removed
---
I imagine streamer servers will be hit by this harder. I think all they could do is offer free realm transfers. I feel like whatever server Asmon and Soda end up on is going to have 8k going into Phase 2
---
Demo version of WoW is incredibly bad. Current WoW is broken disfunctional game and is not MMO or RPG.
---
Well, I managed it on the Beta in 22 hours and on a packed as fuck Private Server in 23 hours and 43 minutes (the private server is allowing us to make copies of our best character times to practice each bracket of 10 levels, so yes, I'm still playing on them even with Beta access).
---
But there's no way for anyone to give you data on how it's going to be on launch.
---
I just know it's going to be pretty easy to leave the spergs behind.
---
why does NONE ever do us and eu separately?...
---
Basic macros that just cast a spell arent any different at all to just having the spell on your bar.
---
The main advantages are things like customising WHAT spell is cast based on various conditions (eg, if you're in combat, pressing Q pops an attack skill, if you're out of combat it makes you mount), or having one button to cast 3 different spells depending on whether you use the button with/without shift/ctrl, though of course you can technically just have 3 separate hotkeys bound to this without macros.
---
One very useful thingyou can do those is combine things that arent on the global cooldown. For instance, if you had a trinket like the spellpower On Use trinket from Zul Gurub that gives you a 20 second buff of bonus spellpower, and were a Presence of Mind/Pyroblast mage, you could do one button that pops the trinket, casts presence of mind AND fires the pyroblast in one press.
---
You can also check if a target is friendly or enemy. You coudl have a button as a priest that casts Flash Heal on a target if Friendly or Holy Fire on a target if they're an enemy, and doing similar with other damage spells could condense your entire damage rotation into the same keybinds as your healing rotation depending on what you're targetting. 
---
In general they dont do anything that you cant already do with regular keybinds, they just let you CONDENSE keybinds together so you have less keys in total and help with making your bars less cluttered.
---
Ebig meme
---
They wont be a focal point for PVP if they all endup on PVE realms!
---
It seems that they are aware of the issue and don't want dead servers. Layering will solve that in the short term and once layering is removed I don't think they will add new servers unless it's completely necessary but instead try to spread the population out on the severs they already have.
---
Tbh snutz played scared and showed him too much respect.  He should win that 10/10 times but knowing the caliber of player venruki made him play worse than he should/could have
---
Aye, if you dont bind stuff like that its fine. Ive got stuff like battle res on a keyboard bind with a normal mouseover macro.
---
I use unitframe mods for tracking hots/debuffs and filtering, so im reliant on addons anyway.
---
&gt;Streamers act as a world focal point of PVP and community events that couldn't be generated easily before.
---
You're going to get a lot of hate for this part but I understand where you are coming from :)
---
I just hope blizzard knows what they are getting into when factoring in streamer servers + this promise of "layering will be gone by the end of phase 1"
---
Is there a re upload? Unfortunately i Cannot watch
---
His toon stopped at the usual fear range and then randomly ran straight full distance again, it was unlucky asf lol
---
True, as long as they get queue priority it's all good since that server will have a 10 hour queue.
---
The ones I play currently (1.12 and 3.3.5) were both download 1 zip, unpack and play. No need to change realmlist etc
---
Deathwing actually attacked before the 3rd war and destroyed much of stormwind. The Mason's guild was tasked with repairing SW a and it took them more time than needed and Lady Prestor(aka Onyxia) was mucking around in politics and convinced the king of SW, pretty sure it was Varian by then, that they did a crappy job and shouldn't get paid. The masons guild held a riot and during it they killed Varian's wife. Varian was ofc pissed and the dudes from the guild were like, oh shit, we gotta go. So they fled and formed the Defias Brotherhood in Westfall.
---
This all makes sense and I’ll plan to do that 
---
I was thinking pre launch of trying to meet up with ppl who have the same play time and end game goals
---
Sodapoppin is currently playing a Druid on the beta and PvP wise, the class isn't great but you will be using everything from Balance spells to Cat Form and a ton of heals. In raids you might end up being forced to play a healer but I think in PvP Druid seems very fun even if it isn't the top pick.
---
Priests farm very well after a bit of gear
---
I would vote for a 10k pop streamer server where these guys can have prio in queue. And everyone is warned beforehand that its a streamer server. Let them do the crazy stuff they want while we watch and play on our own quite servers.
---
Blizzard has every intention of figuring out ways to convert you Classic-only players over to Retail. They make over half their revenue from microtransactions and Classic has none.
---
Blizzard isn't making Classic to turn a profit, they're doing it as a PR stunt to get more Retail players.
---
And yeah, you're triggered.
---
I will echo Orc for the insane stun resist :)
---
That could have something to with the fact that there are barely any players in the Beta, and almost all streamers got Invites.
---
We had large scale community events 14 years ago, when streaming wasn't even technologically possible.
---
Fresh servers or will there be plenty of servers with 1k population to transfer to?
---
Why not have queues to begin with like the old days - guilds either decided everyone will have to endure the queue or you all start on another server.
---
Nah, Deathwing was a big bad in the Warcraft lore prior to to wow. I think his pre-wow story is told in the novel Day of the Dragon when one of the Kirin Tor Mages (Rhonin) help to take him down.

**\[EU-PvE\] &lt;Truefaith&gt; \[Alliance\] Filthy Casuals Warning!** 
---
**About Us:** \- We are reincarnation of vanilla WoW casual guild. Friendly and laid back, yet raiding capable group of nerds. Guild got to like half-way AQ40, which if you ask me is quite impressive for casuals, and that’s on Qual Thalas which was a realm added later, not at launch
---
We don’t focus on PvP tho certain individuals with questionable sanity and paladin toolkit (Sorry John) can teach you the ropes in all of the battlegrounds. We will not actively discourage PvP either (but seriously stop wasting time and come to MC ok?)
---
**What We Provide:** 
---
\- Hunter loot and Chuck Norris jokes
---
\- Knowhow … we were there, we did it, we had amazing time so we wanna do it again
---
\- Dire Maul sighseeing tours with a guide (Im so salty with will not be there at launch)
---
\- Friendly environment of adult people, we will all jump into the dungeon to help you with your one dumb quest and we don’t care if griding levels is more time efficient
---
\- Pooling resources, we work together to get our crafters up to speed. Epecially if you get some of them juicy patterns from the goblin in Dire Maul (Yes I love the place!), get people Onyxia cloaks and resistance gear…
---
**What Are We looking For:** 
---
\- Being casual guild makes this easy, we welcome everyone with good attitude, bad language is perfectly fine as long as it’s a joke. Insulting guildies is a no-no, but we like a good drama, just keep it civil
---
\- Open mind, WoW classic is very different from retail and if you were not there, you will just have to trust us. If anyone says something about class/spec not being viable we will mock him. If you didn’t expect group healed by druid and tanked by fury warrior with hunter jumper cables being only rez, to run DM north tribute runs, you are in for a surprise friend. You will also see paladins in cloth healing in MC, its actually really funny (Sorry John)

Oh, man, you reminded me something with 15.
---
Back in the day you could go look for enemy faction guilds raid times and then gather your own groups and cock block raid entrances.
---
The feeling of actually being there when it happened, instead of just watching it happen from someone else's PoV.
---
Lol what? Dual spec hasn't been announced for Classic.
---
Hilarious
---
speaking of priority queue, i would pay for that, they should too.
---
Thanks for making the ridicule even easier, by confirming my above point that the marketing value alone is worth more than the development cost.
---
Oh yeah. That wasn't added until TBC. My bad. Still, if the mage survives the opener my money is on the mage. Especially one of Venrukis calibre
---
They have stated multiple times they are wanting servers to be as close to Vanilla as possible. We aren't assuming it's going to be 1k players or 8k players... so we can make an educated guess.
---
I sure do hope the streamer servers are the only ones with issues, then streamers can get queue priority and this sub will explode again :)
---
This isn't quite how Classic "specs" work. :\
---
I'm not a muslim but i take prayer breaks in raids too, begging RNGesus for that 99 roll.
---
What have you done
---
Well duel at 30 and against blizcon champions
---
They destroy everyone else
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Guilds will be all in the same layer. I believe Friend listed players as well, but I'm not sure about that one
---
They could make more servers and have free server transfer from the overpopulated realm to the new realm. Splitting the "still to full" servers into 2.
---
If realms are still overpopulated by phase 2, we will have the autentic experience of queues.
---
Still doesn't change the fact that it's a free product with no revenue of its own.
---
Aye, I didn't notice it immediately either, nor how much I needed this before it wasn't there xD
---
I played a mage on classic and got rank 13 and was able to get gladiator as mage rogue 2v2 season 1 in TBC and gladiator season 2 as rogue mage priest 3v3. 
---
Venruki and I are the same age and i remember him  from vanilla. 
---
Hes a very good mage, and one of the people who helped popularize mages as a whole back in the day. 
---
I have been playing warlock on classic so far, they seem fun and were the opposite of mages. New classic, new class. If I am going to do another 1000 hours might as be a different class right? 
---
But watching him still play mage so well reminded me what a high skill cap class mage is, they have so many ways to play and are extremely fast and versatile. 
---
Man I just might have to play a mage on live, I'll probably force myself to go with my original plan and play lock but damn mages are soo good.
---
Nothing feels better then killing low lvls when u suck at pvp. Amirite?
---
UD = casting animation.
---
Tauren master race! 
---
Too bad I main Mage so no Tauren for me :C
---
Wow, seems like I got you triggered.

Good thing i was watching that stream and it wasnt "they", it was just Sonii saying that after they got the winning cap.
---
Hell yeah dude, I found him from his PoV from the arathi highlands world PvP stuff with the northern flank, he came across very chilled out and having fun while also being decent whilst everyone else was running around screaming. 
---
Then saw his apology video about being wrong about classic and gained a lot of respect for him, happy to see him win this thing and keep gaining more and more popularity, he deserves it.

We are **__&lt;Light's Hope Survivors&gt;__**  ll  **Horde – NA – PvP**  ll  Loot Council for BiS + DKP
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Tues &amp; Thurs 8–11 EST, Optional Monday for progression
---
**Introduction:**
---
We want to have fun in this game, &amp; fun for us means being competitive in raiding as well as battleground and world pvp. To foster healthy competition, players that go the extra mile with regards to performance get rewarded with BiS items via Loot Council Lists, DKP for other items. We tuned our methods on pservers and bring that experience to the table for Classic's release. We strive for success but having a good time is of equal priority. 
---
**PvP:**
---
We plan on being active in wPvP and with world bosses, and expect to join Horde coalitions and partner with like-minded guilds on our server to that end, as well as forming premades for BG in the latter phases. Lok'tar Ogar, For the Horde
---
**Officer/Members Prior Experience:**
---
Our core played together on Light's Hope as a second raid group for our parent guild, and we eventually surpassed them before F R E S H happened and the war of attrition became too much. As a guild we went 8/9 AQ, Separately, We have 15/15 Naxx experience.
---
**Expectations:**
---
We expect members to be competitive, come ready with consumes and world buffs, and perform each raid. PvP is not required, but encouraged.
---
__All exceptional players are considered__
---
We're looking for:
---
-&gt; Mage 
---
-&gt; DPS Warrior
---
-&gt; Rogue 
---
-&gt; Shaman heals
---
-&gt; Druid heals
---

---
&gt;Do you have a source for the servers allowing 15k on there to begin with? Because that doesn't make much sense since the vanilla cap was much lower.
---
Server cap at launch is entirely different from cap at the start of phase 2.
---
Layering is an entire server population duplicated.
---
If we assume there are 2 layers per server that's about 8kish players? (3-4k per layer) allowed in on day one.
---
Pretty unlikely, right? Imagine those queues... people will just join lower populated servers.
---
So let's say they have 3 or 4 layers? The first 2 weeks those 3 or 4 layers are booming, but then start to decline. Now we are 6 or 7 weeks into launch and there are only 2 layers populated with people at peak time... phase one ends and all servers get merged into one layer.
---
Now on peak times we have 2-4 hour queues which aren't bad at all!
---
Let's say more people start playing classic since honor ranks are now implemented (phase 2) and bgs will he added "soon" (phase 3)
---
We already have 4-8k people playing on that server.
---
Do we just offer free transfers and hope people are okay with joining a dead server?
---
You just assumed 15k players on a server, that's what I was referring to. I doubt it'll be that big in phase 1.
---
hahaha couldn't resist doing this joke :-)
---
i'm no pro but if i were the rogue i'd be aiming to sap first to then get a free opener or force an ice block.  For my opener I'd either try a quick ambush into kidney, or just cheap shot.  either way, force a blink.  Before i've stunned him i'm already moving in the direction he's facing so that i can quickly get in range to then blind him after the blink.  then restealth and begin again with cheap shot etc
---
it's an interesting matchup because of the cold snap/prep options.  it's like an arms race to force the opponent into burning certain abilities first
---
of course once you're nova'd you're in trouble haha
---
I still believe he would have won the whole tourney if he didn't get the forced forfeit when Snutz feared him out. He had just used all his cds and was 100% gonna win.

***In any case, HAVE A CLASSIC SUMMER!*** :)
---
That's not the preferred nomenclature.
---
I raided for a while in Legion with a guild that was mostly made up of people from UAE and Saudi Arabia and we never had any prayer breaks. I don't think they mentioned prayers at all tbh.
---
Having the PVP gear available on launch would really fuck up the dungeon and raid progression.
---
thank god im from EU and I can avoid playing with the big names streamers and followers.
---
/y YOU MADE A MORTAL ENEMY FOOLS! THIS IS NOT OVER!
---
/cast Divine Shiled
---
/use Hearthstone
---
That makes one of us that ever considered this a serious conversation.
---
Wouldn't it be super easy to just have the battleground and not the vendors though? just releasing the vendors at phase 2 rather than the entire battleground.
---
THEY FUCKING FLIPPED IT!!!!!!
---
Macros are great in wow because they're still on a relative simple level.
---
Dont think any priest i knew back then didnt have a Power infusion macro aswell on mages :P
---
For one, WSG isn't in until phase 3. That's because a lot of the high level BG rewards are better than MC/Ony loot. If you release them at the same time it gives hardcore PVPers an advantage in PVE and makes a lot of the MC/Ony loot irrelevant. That's how as I understand it.
---
**You forgot the best one!**
---
Have a low level, something like level 15 or so, go to a low level zone like the barrens(if you're ally) and be a very high level. 
---
Once the low level baits someone into attacking them, they become hostile to the whole party. Than you corpse camp to your hearts content.
---
well, there *were* blood elf models even back in vanilla, but for some reason blizzard didn't use one for her. I don't know where else they were used but I remember specifically there were blood elves in the hinterlands.
---
Ive always been a big fan of ambient sounds so I generally turn off music, set effects pretty low, (I don't need my ears to bleed just because I'm swinging my sword) voice a nice middle, and ambient is always max.
---
i started playing WoW when bgs just came out, so that was all i knew, people always talk about great world pvp before that with the honor ranks coming out and there been no bgs, bgs really took all that open world pvp away. I think its a smart move to do it in stages with honor coming before BGS, we can experience insane world pvp zergs. and then soloers or small groups out there just doing their thing in the open world to farm honor. Id be far less interested in this game if honor started at the same time as bgs.   
---
When the bgs come out that when the boring honor grind begins and we will see lame shit like queue dodging, leaving games, spying etc. just to have that easy path of least resistance to R14. and rightfully so that grind SUX DIX.
---
hahah you destroyed him
---
So release the battleground without honor points and without tokens rendering it completely useless for all of those wanting to level? Yeah, why would they care to do that?

---
don’t forget to macro each emote and keybind them guys
---
So they end up merging dead servers at the end of phase one, which is great... but they still have servers with 10k+populations with 6 hour queue times.
---
Essentially forcing people to sit in queue or transfer to a dead server where their friends aren't playing. 
---
I know it's sounding like blizzard is screwed no matter what they do... I'm not saying I have the answers at all, just curious on how they plan to launch phase 2 without having servers situated.
---
No, because then honor is meaningless when you have nothing to spend it on. The key difference is that when honor is introduced with the vendors in P2, Battlegrounds *are not*, meaning if you really want those rewards you're gonna have to world PVP like an absolute maniac to even get close to the ranks with the good gear. By which time, MC and Ony will already be on farm.
---
Undead is better for pve, you can break fears in certain fights with WotF - - &gt; more dps. Orc racials don't do anything in pve
---
No idea. Blizzard seems quite confident that servers will lose about 75% of their pop in the first 3 months so everything will be fine.
---
Ryzen APU for classic will do just fine. Tested R3 2200G and on 3440x1440 mode 4 it ran above 100 FPS, more on [https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/#16](https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/#16)
---
It is also super easy not to release the battleground or the vendors at all.
---
Same deal with the Inky Black Potion. Though I can’t remember the streamer’s name.
---
Would love to have that as well, but I don't think that's possible with the amount of crybabies there would be with complaining about "special treatment to streamers"
---
I think blizzard she realize it's 2019band they didn't have to ever deal with this issue with crazy populated realms before because they had sharding implemented before streaming blew up to what it is today.
---
Still waiting for you to name some more bosses. Melee attack weaving is extremely uncommon in Classic and will 9/10 times be a dps loss. Does this fact upset you?
---
you dont need to be watching a streamer to raid a capital, join a guild, raid it with them. be apart of something more. i made RL friends for life in vanilla people who are still my best friends 15 years later, you wont get that watching a stream.
---
Missing the actual board game.
---
The report system doesn't work in the beta - you would have known that if you watched any of the streams.. 
---
Also - you should be grateful for streamers making events and pulling people to the game you like.
---
Stop acting like a baby.
---
&gt;I just feel as though layering solves that influx of players but disabling it causes these issues.
---
It's against the Vanilla philosophy of 'one world'. That's what a lot of people find appealing. Sure, there might be some population issues here and there, but this is to be expected. Personally I much prefer the 'one world' philosophy.
---
Shoutout bananagirl
---
Wouldn't that be great, and only through the cash shop - no wow tokens so people would get super angry.
---
Gotcha. Maybe I got confused and it's against Twitch TOS for a Streamer to Stream Snipe another Streamer.
---
My level ~12 druid making his first run to Ironforge is something I'll always remember as well.
---
That's not a good reason because the orc racial also works on incapacitate effects. It's just not mentioned in the description.
---
That aint grim batol that's the bit behind deathknell.

Well of course, this is all about phase 2 though - when the layers all get merged and there are potentially 6+hour queues on servers and nobody wants to be forced to transfer to a dead server.
---
In  Wrath of the Lich King there was guild which was doing all druid raids...
---
I wander if it can be done also in classic :)
---
At level 60 you're also watching out for Trinket are you not? 
---
I was Rogue mainly trough Vanilla and tBC and did a lot of PvP. That opener is usually what I would go for too, unless I got lucky on crits as Assassination and could Forego the Blind and just Cold Blood then Evis while running.
---
You'd always tell the good mages from the shit mages by how fast they Blinked your Cheap shot, Blinking faster than you could move to anticipate their movement so they would have time to Nova you. While Shit ones would either sit the stun full out. Or blink right into Gouge because you just moved up.
---
And you could tell the Good from the Great because they'd do some shit you never expected. 
---
On more than one occasion I had Mages either Trinket or Every Man For Himself out of stun, Spin, and blink the other way because they saw / anticipated my move to intercept. 
---
Or Blink straight into Ice Block before I could Blind, but so close on the timing the Block caught the Blind, then quickly cancel Block and Nova before I could move out to try and re stealth. 
---
If they pulled that one out of their back pocket I would lose 10/10 times. Not because those tricks are so Godlike, but because if they had a counter to my counter to their blink, they would just be better players than me
---
I never used macro but I would like to join the train. Is there some online resources that explain which useful macro I could make for specific class (mage) and what addon I should rely to make my life easier?
---
Only played beta through end of TBC, so nope.
---
Orc 100% I think a big issue for warlocks is stuns not fears, that resist goes a long way. undead animations are way better than the orcs though.

If you're assuming that you or the gm have the capability to RightFully judge who's mentally deranged or not, then I guess you should go consult a specialist, the result might isolate you.

Shadowlabyrinth in TBC. For some quest on heroic I made a group consisting of me (Tank Druid), my brother (Priest - healer) and then proceeded to ask for mages in the /2. No requirements beyond "You can enter it heroic". 'twas the chillest version of it because we had so many freaking CC. And mostly everything was humanoid so it could be sheep'd. The undead got shackle'd and melees rooted. It was everything. Easy, consistant, predictable but certainly: NOT FAST. Still one of the dungeon runs I remember fondly. When I try to remember a cool dungeon run of the last... 4xpansions only the one from Cata comes up where I tanked a dungeon with my Enhancement Shaman and the randoms liked it so much when we got the new tank they asked if I could continue tanking (he agreed, was kinda fun). but then again it was cata and that is likely to be out of the "4 last expansions limit". I cannot be bothered to count it. too hot here... send help.

I suggest watching Venruki's pov for the tourney for two reasons. He is insane when he plays and he shoutcasts most of the duels for his stream [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433500799](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433500799)
---
was called r/waterniggas before, but got deleted for obvious reasons
---
I think you misunderstood my post haha-
---
Even though I am watching now, I was thinking of server selection and being part of a group. Yes, sure guilds will exist and people will raid-some super hard, some more casually. But pointless stuff like bringing a dragon to a capital city- just wont happen. Or if it is- a small group of like 5 will try and will probably fail. I intend on raiding with a guild and making friends, but that is a whole different thing.
---
No buddy, you are the right one.
---
Taking a picture of some poor souls headstone to farm for karma is really fucked up.
---
One of my fondest memories of classic WoW was my first toons long journey to Ironforge. I couldn't wait to see the rumored duels out front of the city and what treasures the Auction house held. It was a long dangerous run for a level 10 druid.
---
&gt;If realms are still overpopulated by phase 2, we will have the autentic experience of queues.
---
This is my dream since a lot of new players don't get to cherish the ability to actually get past a queue and play.
---
But you can't just expect a large percentage of the server population to transfer off to a dead server.
---
What if sodipoppy goes to new server and me and my 12k friends want to go there as well? Just creating the same issue.

I got my classic/BC account back and also had a wrong name because back then i was too young and afraid to put in my real name.

I explained them like this and only answered my secret question right, plus telling them some names and servers of my old characters.  
---
That was enough to get the account back
---
Lol horde are everywhere bloooood.
---
I guess in the world of Macros they're spells and they're coded as spells, but the game (in text) calls them abilities. Both in talent trees, "Can't use that ability yet" information etc.
---
But from a coding perspective, they're indeed the same as spells.

Mojo Jojo would have been proud :')
---
This is indeed the case atm on classic beta but was reported numerous times already, as that's not how it worked in vanilla. Even with mouseover macro you lost you CP because it SHOULD behave exactly like you described. Will most probably get fixed.
---
Did you really just imply that streamers don't have any influence, or able to popularize something? Or that just because something has been going on for a long time, it should just be accepted?

Could it not be a case where you didn't even gain honour from BG's until the proposed phase 3 release? could be just a fun extra then rather than somewhere to grind honour.

I don't get the connection between discovering a FP and the feeling of a broken controller. :\^)
---
The only solo endgame pve content is farming gold and grinding rep, really. For farming you take professions, for grinding you bring a friend. 
---
You don't want to respect ever, really, but since the first few respeccs are relatively cheap it's still doable for a little while. I remember grinding cenarion circle rep as shadow priest with 3 respeccs (100 gold total).
---
You couldnt. Atm in beta you can tho, which is a bug and will most likely get fixed
---
Hi, /u/Pataya18
---
Well, it was a fuck fest, the sheer amount of people mountblocking was on the scale of orgrimmars regular population. And it lasted entire first day of launch, then it started dwindling, but kept on going for almost a week.
---
World bosses were always kited in vanilla back to cities, some just by a lone hunter. you just didn't see it because it want on stream.
---
He could have macro target the totem or pressed tab or activate totem nameplates to avoid it. Ofc is sucks but it was avoidable.
---
Thanks for the correction i've edited that - yeah i get you, but could it be just the battleground released and then vendors at a later date?
---
Don't leave bear form and die
---
They did also normalize the instant attack baseline. Two-handers have an instant attack baseline of 3.3, one-handers (except daggers) have 2.7 or something, etc. Their own weapon speed is no longer a part of the damage equation. Essentially, while a weapon with a high top-end damage will get you phatter crits etc, it doesn't scale doubly from its slow attack speed. Actually, I guess you could think that it scales negatively, since eg. a 3.8 attack speed weapon will still only get a 3.3 multiplier for instant attack damage and thus lose a few points of "multiplier", whereas a 3.1 attack speed weapon gains a few points.
---
Weapon damage bound extra attacks like Sword Spec and Windfury Weapon naturally "normalise" themselves, since a chance-based attack will occur more frequently for faster weapons while dealing less damage than a slow, high damage weapon would.
---
Would need to actually go through various weapons to see what the true, end-game effects would be but I, personally, am not quite convinced that the chorus of "slow main hand weapon or bust" is 100% accurate.
---
Go with him to AA meetings?
---
Lol that overhealing with regrowth. Someone was sniping him and it was a paladin. I don't know how your druid heals but if he does precast then he should be able to output more healing and ''snipe'' those paladins a bit better. The sniping is needed to proof your value for fools who only watch meters but that doesn't matter if it gets job done. It's just that community perception gets worse than what reality is. Druid not a bad healer as if it would cause wipes but there are others who have faster cast time and are better to react, not ''pre act''.
---
Also that first healer was tank healer right? (I'm on mobile and can't seem to figure out how to find what I want from that website). It's just stupid comparision if you ask me and other healers. Comparing raid and tank heals with each other. The classic won't be even close as ''hard'' with 1.12 patch as those private servers with their buffed encounters. Having a druid or paladin doesn't make a difference other than hurt your feelings when you find how easy pve really is there. The true end game is having fun and pvp
---
I mean.. care to elaborate? just trying to gain peoples perspective.
---
!remindme 90 days
---
I had the 5 CD version :D. Good time having to switch CDs hahah
---
I think this is what they'll do:
---
1. Open up free transfers from overpopulated servers to underpopulated servers
---
2. If #1 isn't enough, open up free transfers from overpopulated servers to completely new servers.
---
I don't think they want servers that have population issues in either direction.
---
That is what I'm trying to say, to everyone who thinks they are hardcore, because they join a pvp server in classic. 
---
You don't know what we have seen in Uo. 
---
So many creative ways to murder each other.
---
I loved those times, but I don't want them back.
---
Okay, even if they did, it wasnt a group thing. It wasnt some dozens people being stupid trying to achieve something together. You just stood in a city and then you died. I think you missed my point.
---
but why?.. Why remove a fun aspect of the game?
---
Blizzard wants to give everyone a true Vanilla experience again.
---
That means a period of time where anyone can kill anyone in wPVP without getting DHKs.
---
It means a period of time where the only way to get honor is wPVP.
---
And it means a big anticipated launch of Battlegrounds
---
Adding WSG 6 months early would be a bad move, even if it was in some sort of sandbox that had no purpose or rewards.
---
Pretty sure druids still suck with power-shifting. There are no room for your bleeds.
---
Hey you shut the fuck your mouth. Swifty is a legend. He knows a lot more about the game than all of you casuals. Don't dare insult him because you never reach his level💢

---
But once they do... Game over
---
Not assuming at all, sorry if it came across that way.
---
So we can agree that they aren't going to have q traditional 3-4k server cap at launch if classic (which is their goal since it's vanilla like)
---
They will have multiple layers per server with that cap... not just 1.
---
We can't assume it's going to be 2 layers per server because that puts us at 7-8k players per server, with the eventual population fall off by the end of phase 1.
---
Let's say in a perfect world, this server with 8k players and only 2 layers get down to roughly 4k players by the end of phase 1.
---
That's great! It's exactly what blizzard wanted and now there will only be a small queue at peak times going foreard.
---
How many servers can you see that realistically happening to.
---
The easiest example is the fact that streamers will have thousands if not 10s of thousands wanting to play on their server... do those servers get split up? Or do they get permanent layering with an option of transferring to a non layered server?
---
It's a good thing blizzard anticipated people falling off by the end of phase 1 - we can't just assume the majority of servers will fall perfectly into a population of 3-4k like theybare aiming for.
---
What? Lol
---
Do the rain dance WHILE its raining in nothing but a sock on your private parts. Film it and send it to Blizzard HQ. Make sure to give them your email so they know who to give the beta key.
---
weren't they waternibbas just recently?
---
Yeah that’s when I found him too. Last week he got into a WSG with a team that only had like 8 people and were already down 1-0 against a premade with McConnel and Quinn (and others don’t remember all of em), he got Ziqo to join and they way the two of them led their team of random people to victory was epic. 
---
He was carrying the flag like a god, and staying up beat and on point with the strats to help his team win. 
---
He’s had some great moments so far in the beta.
---
There are very few bosses where there are tanking mechanics. Mostly you stand there and spam sunder armor. All dps has to do is spam 22222 after 3-5 stacks of sunder armor are up. Healing requires thought to minimize overheating, using proper downranks, and keeping an eye on health bars. I’ve played all 3 in vanilla raids and this is my opinion at least.
---
There were a lot more on pages like [this one for example](https://web.archive.org/web/20041207200401/http://www.planetwarcraft.com/wow/oldmedia/screenshots/beta/index.shtml) but most of the images are unfortunately inaccessible.
---
We aren't removing it, it just comes later.
---
That's fair! thanks for the constructive comment.
---
That kind of gameplay has no place in an mmo. It needs to have a reward structure to be put into an mmo.

---
It's not just the tank healer. These druids don't rank in the top 5 of healing.
---
The true end game for many is hardcore PVE. The only hardcore PVE left is speedrunning. And in that arena, Druids don't belong.
---
What? something can't be added just for fun?
---
Ah the cod4 reference. A man of culture
---
You are taking it too personally. Is that You, TrollGodX?
---
The comments on the item say it was hot fixed early in Vanilla. If that's true, we probably won't be able to use it this way, sadly.
---
1. no
---
2. you are a literal bot if you melee on this boss
---
3. you should be kiting or keeping an add CC'd, not fucking meleeing
---
4. Razorgore adds spawn in waves, they also cleave. Another no.
---
5. Maybe if you had BWL geared character with askhandi
---
6. There is absolutely no reason to be in the melee group and stack debuffs on you and take extra damage for no reason, your extra 100 dps isnt going to do shit but waste healers mana
---
7. no x4 except viscidius because EVERYONE in the raid basically needs to melee.
---
Your dps as a hunter is still in feral druid territory, which is garbage. If you want to help the raid, don't be a melee tard, im sorry you think its viable because you played some shitty Pserver but the fact is it is a DPS loss in 90% of boss fights. Also the fact you think you're the only one who knows about this just shows how ignorant you are.
---
It's at most phase 1, not at least. Big difference.
---
Yea.  It's a group of people from my original server looking to be on the same server again.
---
Alright then i'll reword my comment.. Why not add a fun aspect of the game earlier that would have no negative effect on the game if it didn't give honour or have the vendors?
---
Payo is 100% the true classic PvP server rogue. He has the exact persona so many of them had back in the day, it's hilarious how true it is.
---
I think the togetherness will be less so after launch but it'll be a hell of a lot better than current retail
---
If you do zero quests, and never fail to skin a mob, and have the bag space for it, and don't factor in the extra time spent leveling skinning (especially the first 50ish points). That's a lot of 'ifs'.
---
other way around! Shadowmelt worked VERY differently in Classic! You couldn't use it infight and you couldn't get out of combat with it. We used it primarly to lay ambushes if we knew a Horde attack would commence. 
---
That old shadowmeld would only stealth you until you performed an action! Moving, Jumping, Attacking, Casting. All of that would break it. I believe unsheathing/sheathing and sitting down wouldn't break it.
---
And when servers do, we merge dead servers?
---
And when servers maintain 80% of initial playerbase because there is no other mmorpg like classic out in 2019/2020?
---
Do they force a server transfer to an already established dead server or just let the 8 hour queue exist?
---
Hell, I hope the servers die down that much in 3 months - but will phase one last 3 whole months? They seemed to have said layering will only be in effect for a few weeks. 
---
But it would be impossible to remove layering on a server with 2 or 3x the amount of people they want on a server. 
---
I don't have the answers, I'm just curious as to why we are all led to believe the server population will die off so largely and so fast. 
---
I believe there will be a dropoff for multiple reasons,  but I also believe hundreds of thousands of people will remain, and the longer the server stays up, the more people will join. Especially when the content phases are already mapped out.
---
I wasn't really serious. But by current mmo standards everything needs a rewards structure to be added else nobody will bother. It's how mmo players have been groomed to play their games over the years.
---

---
Things like this happened a long time before streamers were even a thing, if the community wants events they will manage to do so with or without streamers.
---
We will have realm forums, discord servers or subreddits to arrange events if we want to.
---
Cool. I'm gonna go play on a PvE server.
---
Use a seperate DKP for each tier and you don't have that problem. It's anyway a few months between each new raid and plenty of time to gear everyone up before BWL or whatever is released.
---
The absolute best feeling is when you roll a horde and you’re questing in the Eastern Kingdoms. That FP at Kargath in the Badlands which connects the two networks of flight paths north and south, so you can fly from booty bay to the Undercity. Brillant. Around lv40 or so
---
Because it wasn't released a that point back then. Should we also release AQ and Nax at launch but without loot. Why not have those fun aspects at the launch?

It's not a max level tournament, so hunters won't do too well.
---
I prefer world pvp for a few months before we’re forced to play boring BGs with complete stranger because of cross realm.
---
Thank you for this.
---
I was a NE hunter in Vanilla. I would go the barrens, tame a crane or cat or other low level quest mobs, put it on a little patrol route with the others, shadowmeld and wait. I'd generally not kill people more than once, unless they we're clueless enough to make multiple attempts to kill the pet.
---
Druids tank 5 mans exceptionally well, and can handle 10mans and some raid bosses with the right gear. Warriors can tank all content though, which druids certainly can't.
---
Yeah, I'm clearly the one trolling, and God forbid anyone doesn't agree with your personal insults to someone
---
That's what I meant, didn't mean to imply anything by the order I said it. In fact, I honestly didn't even know you could use it in combat in retail till just now
---
Wow you're the first person besides myself  with such an immesuarable  hatred for gnomes i've seen in  a long time.

The only good thing about gnomes is the dying animation.
---
&gt; Buy many, many copies of Peeling the Onion (or alliance equivalent) from the AV vendor and mail them to people until their mailbox is full. These items are free, and cannot be vendored once purchased. Hopefully the other person has a mail addon ;)
---
I am quite sure this would count as harassment and could lead to a ban no? 
---
The rest are creative.
---
I don't even care but: Someone can improve and become good, no ?
---
I remember first playing vanilla with my friend. one night when he went to bed, i created a orc, and i swam him all the way to goldenshire, and when he next logged on i logged my orc and would just follow him about waving at him.
---
Skinning doesn’t add time to quests. It’s no loss there.
---
You can’t fail to skin a yellow mob. It’s no loss there.
---
This one depends on your starting zone and route, some level skinning very naturally.
---
all the pvpers will be doing wpvp, there will be so much activity non instanced and everywhere over azeroth. WSG will change this.
---
I wanna go explore and engage with hordies in all the nooks and crannies of the world!
---
glhf trying to gank me in a non-contested zone
---
But of course, it wouldn't be acceptable of layering was in longer than it needed to be.
---
I would just like clarification on what happens to servers with 10k+ people and servers with 1k or fewer people before phase 2 hits.
---
Ideally it's not layering.
---
avoid streamer servers if you can, they will surely be more "strange" than normal ones
---
WOOOU WOOOU CHUGA CHUGA CHUGA WOOOUO
---
I liked it better here a few Years ago. Now we have all these bandwagon- and stream-fanboys here.
---
imagine taking offense to being called shit on the internet in 2019.
---
haha this is ace! what did you use to make it?
---
Until you miss one. Then you have to halt all progress for 30 minutes to go get it or just running to where you actually wanted to go
---
It may be faster for the warrior than soloing, but for the priest it’s likely going to be slower than solo.
---
The main reason is that you get less xp/mob when grouped. So a quest that requires you to kill 10 boars (for example) will usually net you X experience for completion, in addition to Y experience for the actual kills. In a group, you get X + (.5 * Y) instead of X+Y exp. so your net xp gain for those kinds of quests is merged by being in a group. Further, you’ll end up spending twice the time on collect quests because in vanilla collect quests drops were not increased for groups. That zhevra is dropping one hoof despite the fact that there are two of you, and only one of you gets it. So collect quests are also less efficient in groups.
---
Grinding is also worse typically because of the xp split, but can be better if you’re doubling your Jill speed or more by grouping. For the warrior, this is almost certainly going to be the case. Warrior solo kill speed is very low, especially early when their gear is still very poor. But for the priest, you likely aren’t going to be killing fast enough to justify the xp sharing.
---
There are also other issues like priests not reliably proccing spirit tap if the warrior gets the final blow, which gimps your mana regen, or warriors getting rage starved because the priest’s better damage pulls aggro (and waiting for the warrior to establish threat is just a huge waste of time).
---
So yeah, warrior/priest is actually one of the better duos for leveling, but it’s still not ideal (usually).
---
there are swim speed rings in bfa too

There’s a weekly thread for this in the sidebar. Just read those.
---
interesting point, but technically i believe rank 14 is available once honor comes out. RP calculation is based off players in the pool, not honor generated. correct me if im wrong.   
---
but there may not be enough time to grind the RP until phase 3.
---
Yeah, I'll probably upload future videos to the same channel where I posted this
---
There are no raid fights short enough for boomkin to be viable, especially not on prog.
---
I totally agree on that! Streamers are awesome for a healthy Server!
---
The inbalance of Horde and Alliance might be a Problem tbh... But I think there is many People intentionally rolling the opposite faction as well - in order to fight those amazing World Events that the streamers plan.
---
That way you don´t only get awesome Content - you can also have amazing WPVP fights at the same time....
---
The more I think of it the more I like the idea of being on a streamer Server... I don´t even watch streams.. D:
---
I think their estimates come from wod, legion and bfa launches and how players played there. It's the information they have. They will find a solution for those servers at that time but they already said that queues and server transfers are what they plan on doing for now if the server pop is still to high.
---
Holy shit people really use ”beta” as an insult? You must have just turned 17
---
Yepp, as a vanilla Rogue I must say this have to be fixed because it would makes Rogues VERY good even in team fights, which isn't their nishe and they're already too good in other areas.
---
And since I'm not playing Rogue in vanilla I want this fixed because I don't wanna die 24/7 =(
---
ahhhh Every Man For Himself.  I still can't believe they added that haha
---
this is the stuff I love about vanilla.  there aren't MANY tools, but the ones we do have are therefore more important and timing is everything.  It's what I love about dota, you can play everything to such a fine margin because it's such a discrete system.
---
I had a friend who came from LoL and didn't like how in dota you didn't have the mana to cast many spells early on, and most characters didn't even have 4 spells to use - but look how insane the skill cap is!
---
what do you think of rogue vs hunter?  i played a rogue in vanilla but i was a teenager at the time.  Now i'm rolling a hunter having pretty much never played one... i remember the matchup was aids but i'm sure i wasn't playing it right
---
how to do mouse over macros is always useful for aoe targetting and things like heroic leap (though i dont think heroic leap is in classic)
---
There are 0 fights in classic raids short enough for balance to be viable.

I agree this is the route they will try to take, but that worked in Vanilla.
---
Before people wanted to go back and have their home server actually mean something.
---
If people are given the choice to sit in an 8 hour queue every single day or transfer to a dead or empty new server... I don't see that as much of a choice.
---
This is all to say, I'm sure blizzard will figure it out but I do hope they don't just decide to leave layering in lost phase 2 simply because some servers are too populated (like streamer servers will be)
---
Multiple monitors I assume
---
I have lost my copies of Vanilla/TBC/WoTLK ;&lt;
---
except most researchs have agreed that a forward curve was found to be used to bypass people's shields and other types of defense, as it would bend around it and still inflict damage - even if minor.
---
and there has been recorded battles that were won thanks to these types of weapons and the opponents inability/inexperience in how to block/parry weapons of this shape.
---
Hey, thanks for the reply!
---
But - isn't "strange" kinda appealing? I mean- the norm is why most of us have left retail WoW in the first place!
---
Well said! I wasn’t hardcore at UO or Everquest but I suffered that toxic behavior and for sure it was a good time.
---
I do not want it like that again but I prefer to have more freedom to do whatever you like in games.
---
Regards!
---
Epic raid vs raid wpvp battles will happen more often on streamer servers. Thats one upside
---
If they are downloading modern WoW hoping for an RPG, then I don't think they will like modern more than classic.
---
That's 95% of the female characters in the game. All d00ds.

Did he buy that mountain bike yet
---
As Blizzard was never verbose about player numbers i doubt we will ever know
---
Slowness only usually means more weapon damage which is the desired factor. Slowness itself is not beneficial.
---
Lol
---
The macro editor changed a handful of times over the course of the game. Do we know what version is going to be in Classic? I'm somewhat under the impression that its more similar to the one they had in Legion as opposed to the one that the game originally launched with.
---
Okay good, now we just have to hope people are willing to leave their launch server.
---
Anything they have to do to 100% completely remove layering is fine by me.
---
IDK about priest or druid, however for paladins generally speaking you can just go Ret abd geal 5man up till lvl 40ish. You don't really get much from your starting talents so it's considered "better" to go the DPS specs while leveling. Unlike in retail you also get most if not all your healing abilities as a class default which work exactly the same regardless of spec. Just have some healing gear and you're fine. 
---
That said, there's nothing wrong with leveling as a healing spec either really. You'll be a little better for 5mans (but not much) and you'll level solo a little slower
---
The biggest reason the duels are so long is that everyone is good geared, mostly with stamina. Caster gear don't have any extra spelldamage so they do the same damage as a "bad" geared player would, so it will take much longer to kill someone when they have 3x the hp of a normal level 30.
---
Yes. They did happen and it was usually a group thing. Sure, sometimes a hunter would grief a town by bringing a world boss, but mostly it was groups doing it. There weren't streams back then, but there are a few old videos around of things.
---
Yes thank you for your input! And, I am on the same side. I think streamers will make or break a healthy server. Just imagine the people playing with them and people on the different faction that wanna kill them! WPVP will be amazing!

Asmongold has said this multiple times. He believes that the private server players only have knowledge about the game but low mechanical skill.
---
I tend to agree to some degree, but I barely ever see this matter discussed and I felt obliged to make the post anyway. Trying to get a snowball rolling, in a way. 
---
I could probably write down some designs for alternatives, but I don't want to spend tens of hours on a project that's very probably going to be ignored. I've done a bit of map &amp; loot design for an MMORPG so I have a rough idea how I'd go around doing that, but I simply don't have the time to spare.
---
All the people falling for this, geez
---
BLender
---
Because sometimes people think they want something, but they don’t.
---
&gt; this is the stuff I love about vanilla. there aren't MANY tools, but the ones we do have are therefore more important and timing is everything.
---
PvP is probably the only thing I miss from Classic that can be replicated with any degree of reliability.
---
Classic has too many hybrid specs for a poll like this, I'm planning on going elemental on my Mage so do I choose fire or frost? Neither feels right.
---
If too few players have enough contribution points, there won’t be a rank 14. It could be a while before we see anyone with it.
---
But yeah, I believe the Blue and Epic sets will be available with the Honor system during phase 2, which will be 2-3 months after launch. That’s 7 to 11 raid resets for a hardcore guild.
---
Yes it would be ridiculously OP
---
They aren't normalised because the static proc chance already normalises the damage. A 2% proc chance will occur more often with a swing timer of 2.10 when compared to 2.70. The higher top end damage weapon will indeed proc-hit harder, but less often.
---

Some you get from world quests, some you get from bosses, some you get from rare mobs, tons of random whacky items that are pretty useless but unique as well.
---
because he's an OG streamer, started streaming in 2008.  soda helped pave the way for what streaming is today.
---
&gt; They did also normalize the instant attack baseline. [...]
---
Your damage equation for instant attacks looks as such: 
---
    avg dmg = dps * attack_speed + [3.3/2.4/1.7] * ap / 14
---
As you can trivially tell, the average damage of your attack goes up as the attack speed goes up
---
&gt; Weapon damage bound extra attacks like Sword Spec and Windfury Weapon naturally "normalise" themselves
---
That's only true if you're only auto attacking, as soon as you add in instant attacks they're more beneficial to slower weapons.
---
That is nice to know! So probably will be rolling there, even though people are hating for some reason.
---
Good luck ever competing for scarab lord when these streamers have hundreds of 12 yr olds who can farm everything for them.

---
Nope, layering is in phase 1, the only priority they should have is removing that as soon as possible.
---
As soon as we get our true server identity then roll out the phases.
---
Yes I understand bgs will be cross realm anyway but stbkesst let us establish pvp groups on our servers and get to know one another before queuing with randoms and just playing BFA in classic.
---
&gt;If you do this I hope you get suspended.
---
Well, back in Classic I was ganked by a level 40+ (he had a mount) warlock). For 6(!) Hours I was unable to play. After the first 10-15 deaths in Ashenvale he would gank me back up to Auberdine in darkshore (I hadn't discovered Astranaar in Ashenvale and didn't knew it would be a "safe haven" for me).
---
When I reached darkshore (I tried rezzing at the graveyard and fleeing but he would catch up to me (poor druid. Not even level 20)) I wrote a ticket. And fairly quickly a GM answered my desperate plea.   
---
"Its another player and you are on a PVP server. As long this player is not doing anything illegal like using cheats, its within his right. You can ask your friends (1 but 0 online) or your guild (no guild) for help. Thanks for choosing blizzards service bla bla bla. 
---
But that Story got a funny ending. Because later, when burning crusade got released, I powerleveled and while farming some herbs in the zangarmarshs I encountered an Undead Warlock with a familiar name. And I ganked his sorry ass until he logged out. I would hover over his little horde outpost and swoop down like demon. Shapeshifting Mid air into the bear, charging through the air and then erasing his boney existance. Revenge felt sooo good.
---
Orc have an op pvp racial and what? Dwarf priest fear ward is insane in pvp and pve, escape artist is very good too in pvp, dwarf stone form is bis against rogue, human have +10% reput gain, that shit op as fuck if you're a pve player.
---
lol dude you need to relax.  it's just a minorly offensive word.  are you retarded?  if not, i don't know why you're so offended.
---
jOb 😂
---
&gt; They are just really hard to play well, in all their specs
---
Yup, I said the same thing in the comment you replied to.
---
What Blizz should really have done is to reveal his main character's name. If You want to be a douche, fine, be one, but have balls to do it as Your max level char.
---
Yes. They already plan on having free transfers if servers are too big when layering ends. Also it was in vanilla and allows blizz to make more money. It will come.
---
Oh yeah i know on low pop servers there wont be enough for a rank 14. but on these there should be even without bgs.
---
Sure you are, Alexensual fanboy.
---
 &lt;**Eminence&gt;** \[NA\] \[H\] \[PvP\] \[PST\] is now recruiting for our hardcore Horde Classic Raiding guild! 
---
Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you’re like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you’re busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you’re ready for classic already… so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
Eminence’s Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. 
---
**Loot:**
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP based loot council loot system in order to provide the most fair and streamlined loot in raids. After over 7+ years of running guilds on this system, I have had minimal to no drama due to loot. During times of progression loot will be handed out to those it best suits our community and raid team in order to maintain a top position on our server.
---
**Recruitment: (Experienced and Dedicated Warriors/Mages/Shamans Needed!)**
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience and willingness to help others, to join us on the path to achieving excellence. We take raiding very seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between. We do not require anybody to play a race they dont want to as immersion is a big factor in this RPG game, and racials minimal effect wont play a role in downing a boss or not.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you’re in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild, you’re the type of person we’re looking for. A lack of high level experience isn’t a deal-breaker but it’s definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience who can put &lt;eminence&gt; above their own personal needs in game in order to meet our community set goals.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more add me on discord and I will personally talk to you and see if you will be a good fit
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks/Dps warriors, Mages, and shamans. ALL people of high skill and determination should apply (through discord). We are 40+ members strong!
---
***Raider Requirements-***
---
***1-*** Warlock summoning alt (level 20) will be required once we have cleared MC and start preparing for world bosses
---
***2-*** Engineering is required of every raider, Tanks, healers and dps. as it is the staple profession of classic wow
---
***3-*** You MUST be able to put the guild ahead of yourself in game, we are not looking for selfish or stuck up people who   
---
think they deserve more than anybody else for some reason.
---
**Raid days and times** (We use PST times because it is the blizzard standard, not because we are all West coast)
---
The 1st 30min of raid will be to gather buffs set up raid groups, we will be pulling at 6:30 MINIMUM
---
Tuesday - 6:00-9:30pm PST
---
Wednesday- 6:00-9:30 PST
---
Sunday - 6:00-9:30 PST (cleanup day/ Onyxia if not weekly resets)
---
For more information you can add me on discord, I would love to chat!

---
Ew the worst class in classic, why do you hate yourself?
---
i believe it was ok because this beta is mostly an advertisement for vanilla, with huge streamers who have never played before getting invites and veterans not getting in. it was just layering one troll so hundreds of thousands of people can watch beta footage, if it happened on live that’d be much different
---
Image / humor posts must be immediately recognizable as being Classic-specific, which the headstone isn't. I've re-approved it though as I can see the argument that the W looks a heck of a lot like the W in Warcraft / the Classic .exe launcher.
---
It is a journey. You are actively working on researching those location and it becomes a personal achievement.
---
ooh, when i spied that first bonfire in blighttown halfway down... the rush!
---
&gt;On the other hand though, so many cool and "vanilla things" are possible. For me, classic is all about this beautiful world that you get to explore, despite the fact that you are born "nothing" and eventually become "something" So having a person that many people follow and do stuff together is just.. nice.
---
As long as everyone understands that 10-20k servers will NOT be a thing and layering will be removed by phase 2... sure enjoy the 10 hour queues to be able to play on a streamer server.
---
That will lead to 1 of 3 things happening
---
- streamers get queue priority 
---
- that server gets an option to transfer for free to a lower pop server (defeats the purpose unless the streamer goes ther and then has the same issue)
---
- layering permanently stays on that server
---
Let me know is there are any other options.
---
Mind control gamon in the orgrimar in.  He has a kick ability that dismounts you.  Proceed to dismount everyone.
---
Thanks for letting me know, I don't mind, if you think it's not right for the community I'm happy if you take it off. I was more wondering so I know for the future. Thanks for replying, appreciate it.
---
I see your Point and I actually do agree with it to some degree!
---
I think WSG being out early has no negative aspect if it's added early.´Of course there has to be other things changed like honor gain and vendors.
---
Blizzard has announced though  - to give us the most Blizzlike, original Version of classic that they can provide with their ressources.
---
Changing a Major aspect of the game would not cater to that promise... WPVP is a huge Thing for a lot of People and the greatest time for that is Phase 1+2 - of course there would still be WPVP with WSG - but it wouldn´t be the same.
---
Also you have the #nochanges People that will go wild over that Change because they have fought for years now. Only to get the most polished vanilla experience possible. You would take a lot of that away too :3
---
I understand where you are coming from but I think that Change wouldn´t be possible.. :)
---
But, Not if they all roll on PVE servers as planned. :P
---
DPS most relaxing. You have no real responsibility.
---
Tanking no frustration from playing with a shitty tank. Sometimes you just wish you could do it yourself.
---
Healing is the most challenging/rewarding, but you'll get blamed for wipes.
---
jesus dude..
---
Every other thread: I'VE PLAYED SINCE CLOSED BETA
---
This thread: wHaT KiNd oF BiRd iS ThIs
---
Faerie fire doesn’t stack with sunder armor, so applying both is a waste of a debuff slot... not sure why you’re listing it as a “great buff” when in classic raids it was not worth casting.
---
You do you.
---
According to the resolution 4x 3440x1440 monitors would make the most sense. Although it seems quite ridiculous lol
---
Gnome mage literally shits on UD mage lol.
---
A free swing 2.5s swing is more damage than a 1.5s swing, but it will proc less often. Unless you're being limited by an inner cooldown, the swing speed doesn't actually matter to the DPS that the extra swings create. (If extra attacks reset the swing timer, then the result might be different but likely the extra swings happen on the same "frame" anyway and thus the reset does not matter.)  
---
Rogues definitely will likely see an effect, since their extra attacks are limited by Energy regeneration, which has nothing to do with swing speed and thus doing more damage for every x amount of Energy spent is obviously better.
---
You can't macro target enemy totems on the beta. [video proof](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433646958)
---
&gt;the 'private server people' aren't invited to the beta
---
&gt;they were not participating in this tournament, because they're alliance
---
don't know about that one m8
---
You can OT as prot. Just NEVER expect to MT.
---
It was always the best when my 7 year old self would find a new flight path :D
---
That's the one, thanks!
---
But then you are playing a Gnome, which is a life not worth living.
---
I think there are to types of people here, ones that remember specifically grouping to do this and ones that never played vanilla.
---
Both are perfectly acceptable and both will play classic.
---
I get you point ok streamer servers and I do believe they can be a lot of fun, but it is fact that before streamers existed, groups naturally formed to do the exact same stuff.
---
Now in 2019 it will be just a follower mentality more than a equal group of randoms doing something.
---
Both can have fun in classic!
---
I still have this in live lol
---
The number of level 60’s when Honor drops is going to be very low. Very likely too low to allow enough CO for anyone to reach R14.
---
Vanilla did not have starter editions but 10 days trials. I dont think these trials will return but maybe in the future we might get level 1-6 or 1-10 free to play, who knows.
---
But there are no plan for trail/starter editions confirmed.
---
Ehh, would be weird if I was first telling everyone where I was, and everyone would come to kill me, only for those people to get banned for using unfair advantages and information about my location. Nobody is forced to stream their gameplay
---
Cdew literally tested it yesterday with /target healing stream totem. Not as macro tho, but should make any difference.
---
No one did that back in Vanilla, so I don't see why they should impliment that policy now
---
you will hate yourself when you will meet me in the world (assuming oposite faction of course).
---
Yes you did - every Server did!
---
But you cannot tell me it was to that extent :P
---
People of the own and the enemy faction working together etc.
---
They build These Events out of nowhere. Announce it and 20mins later they are on their way.
---
They do multiple at the same day sometimes.
---
I don´t even watch streams but seeing some of the YouTube Videos is just fun!
---
Why would you not want to have that on you Server? xD
---
The 1v1 thing they did in MoP(?) When he beat 5 people in a row as monk was epic!
---
Yea to be honest I did not think about that, you got me there. Even though Scarab Lord is probably a bit too hardcore for me anyway haha
---
They already said there will be. We had them in vanilla aswell.
---
My hopes is that they are on a cooldown of 6 months like we had before.
---
Plan on providing some examples?
---
I would love them to release an original box which includes the game.. I know the game is free so maybe it could include 6 months of subscription instead.. I just want to open that Classic box one more time.
---
Binding the warrior stances to the pedal would mean you're literally stance dancing ;-)
---
Yup, paid transfers? Probably not at launch but 100% will have them eventually... why would they not want to capitalize on $25 for each guild member to transfer away from a realm with a 6 hour queue daily.
---
Not all elites have the same damage ratio’s, even at similar levels. Some hit you with brass knuckles, some come at you with a baseball bat lol
---
The WoW model only covers about half the market. There are a few other successful design types; Old School Runescape (OSRS), Black Desert and Eve Online to name a few particularly high profile examples.  
---
Curiously OSRS operates on a bit of a wow-like theme park format and still manages to almost entirely negate powercreep. They've even doubled their subscriber count in the last few years, despite only trickling in bits and pieces of content once in a while. They've grasped the dream of leaning on 20 years of content, which is still mostly intact and relevant - something I would kill to see WoW do.
---
Its not. What you see is the diffrence between a nornal level 30 and a level 30 with best in slots. Gear really does matter that much!
---
The numbers has been proven to be correct.
---
The Beta server was not designed to be a place for legit competition, and it never will be. You can't expect Blizzard to go running around policing stuff like that on a Beta server.
---
As an altoholic in current WoW I've never wanted to buy them, I just feel it ruins so much of the experience for me at least
---
Server transfers were in vanilla, during 2006, I believe patch 1.10. 
---
Free transfers were available much earlier.
---
If it was purely a promotional beta, how did an average player like trollgodx get access? You think everyone there were streamers? Of course not. Streamers were acting as windows into a closed off play test of a game. This was in no way streamers beta game, so they shouldn't act like it's their game either.
---
Doubtful, play retail for free or sub to play classic.
---
They don't make money by offering free trials on a 15 year old game.
---
A huge meme way back in the days, you say?
---
nothing to add but damn gl sounds fun :D
---
Yeah I was like 14 at the time and never got past level 30 in Vanilla due to getting bored. But now I'm so stoked to spend time in the real Azeroth.
---
Damn :(
---
Thats not enough. Someones enjoyment of leveling can be ruined by killing and ganking. That is not griefing.
---
I think there will be some sort of trial, maybe a free week.
---
&gt; Did you really just imply that streamers don't have any influence, or able to popularize something 
---
No, I don't know where you got that from. I said I don't think they get away with breaking rules where others don't.
---
&gt; Or that just because something has been going on for a long time, it should just be accepted? 
---
In this context? Yes, absolutely. I don't think that because it's 2019 we have to totally change the social approach to the game. People are in for a rude awakening if they expect 2019 bubblewrap in Classic WoW, the community aspects both good *and* bad are what made the game so great, and the game will die out if Blizz try to neuter that.
---
Wrong. The Mobs are correct
---
Who owns this channel? Are these all stolen vids/clips? I'll wait and watch on tips channel who was the host.
---
Did you even watch the video? You can /target friendly totems, but not enemy totems.
---
**&lt;Awakening&gt;** NA, Alliance, PVP Realm
---
**About Us:** We are looking to have a very successful Guild in both PvE and PvP with dedicated leadership to make sure everyone is enjoying their stay and time spent. The guild will have a dedicated bank which eventually will help fund the raids consumables and repairs. Team is composed of experienced players competitive and casual in both Vanilla and Retail WoW, FPS games, and others.
---
**Schedule:** Raids will be 3 nights a week *8 or 9pm until 11pm or 12am EST* (will discuss and go with the best time slots). Off nights will be PvP, farming, and other guild activities.
---
**Rules:** Have fun. We plan on clearing all content being the best we can be but having fun while doing it. I am sure things will get stressful here or there but ultimately let's have fun.
---
**What We Expect:** Mature players who will do any learning before hand or ask for help before it is too late. Come prepared to raids with consumables and be ready for invites at least 15 minutes prior to start time. We expect players and teammates to help and give as much as they take and receive.
---
**Contact:** Best form of contact will be sending me a private message here or sending me a friend request and message on Discord ***voltx#1384*** Please let me know on Discord you are messaging from this post.
---
If you are a "no changes" guy, you want server transfers to be in the game.
---
Nerfed by 50%, whats your reference?  
---
Your view has been tainted by Private server inaccuracies.
---
I feel like a hipster. Vanilla WoW was a niche private server game just a few years ago but now it's gotten so mainstream that giga chads are playing it too.
---
Yea maybe some "Invite your friend to play 10 days for free" promotions.
---
I think it will do  better in the first day without a doubt. People currently playing BFA will be likely to give it a go on the launch day, even if they're initially skeptical.
---
Hard to say about in a month, though. I think the main audience for Classic will obviously stick, and streamers will probably keep Classic interest up for a while longer (Just look at how many viewers the PVP Tournament had last night.)
---
alrighty then
---
See other answers, sorry, went out for lunch!
---
&gt; from the toxic chats only
---
I mean... The players themselves are definitely contributing to it. Watch some of the premade vs premade WSG games and you'll see how salty some of the APES players get (Tribe, looking at you), and that causes the chat to salt it up as well. They keep saying that chat is causing all the drama but when actual streamers are calling the opposing team out on using pots, trying too hard, mocking them for playing retail, calling them dumb etc, that doesn't help.
---
I watch a lot of Mn/Perp streams, but I switch off when they do WSG because the comms are just so full of salt.
---
Oh wow, thank you for your super detailed answer! If that is the case, there is no other option. There is no doubt that streamers will be getting priority- I even guess people getting logged out so a streamer can play...
---
Well if things are that bad and servers will not be able to handle the population, lonely PVE server it goes!
---
That's a bug not a feature. Its practically impossible to run an event without a streamer if they are on your server.
---
Yeah, you’re right.  As I’m remembering...on launch the majority of PVP was duels outside IF/Org and ganking...and shadow priests owned that.  As they got more geared there was also the release of BGs and Arena and that’s when I’m remembering warriors running around chopping off heads.
---
Well of course, but layering issues need to get solved first :)
---
Well that is very true!
---
If you want to compete for scarab Lord...
---
Good luck on pretty much every Server though :D
---
Streamer Servers will be impossible I won´t doubt that! But for most People even on non-streamer Servers this would be beyond impossible...
---
It is literally the most hardcore questline - only reserved for the most hardcore Players and I surely don´t Count the majority of Players as that.
---
But that is a great point
---
Not really, still comes down to outplay potential like in the finals. If we take the fuel where Snutz used his Fel Hunter, Venruki could still play the same strat of only using instant abilities to burst him down to negate the interrupt and would just save block for Death Coil. 
---
And on the topic of being higher level, mages rely heavily on mana pool, so he could Arcane Explosion spam a lot more later on. That and the amount of extra burst they get with talent points is significant. Not even accounting for the reduced damage with Ice Barrier or the extra burst with a hybrid fire/ frost build.
---
Again, comes down to outplays. Warlocks dont become unkillable until late Classic with SL build with more hp than a tank.
---
Well maybe let those speedrunners run with themselves then. As far as I saw everyone was using their fastest possible healing to snipe even a little hps and druids are at disadvantage at that game (where everyone steals food from each other's dishes). Those speedruns will become even more laughable with smaller boss health pools and armor values. You'll see people running in hybrid specs/dps gear and throwing a heal or two here and there if needed.
---
You're up for a rude awakening if you think there's any challenge in pve end game. Speedruns will be a thing for competitiveness but for normal guilds, that will clear everything without a problem, it doesn't matter one bit who heals. It's not one man's responsibility to keep everyone alive alone but a group effort. If one man casts a spell faster than anyone then so be it but that doesn't make others bad healers. They either precast and adapt their playstyle or priorities their own group to compensate by their output doesn't take a hit by other healers being there. The active healing might take a hit if people constantly snipe each other.
---
All the people who downvoted this post have obviously not played on a Vanilla World of Warcraft PvP server or knows what it's like.
---
Why?
---
of course it’s not only streamers, but they gave big streamers access on purpose. it’s a beta test not an actual game, if they had a fun event by doing crazy things GMs spawned people wouldnt say that it shouldnt happen because its just a test server
---
My guess would be they wouldn't want to confuse folks. BGs not being there is one thing, but can you imagine how many tickets they'd get per day for "I'm in WSG but not getting any honor!" from people that don't keep up with forums? That's just my guess.
---
Bag space....
---
Holy hell... Can we stuff people like this on a separate realm, Blizzard, please?
---
Streamers weren't a thing in 2005 and WoW was still enjoyable. You don't need these retards with a personality cult to enjoy playing a game. Yea, enjoy getting the same goddamn catchphrase associated with that particular streamer repeated every 3 seconds in /1 and /2. ISNT IT HILAAAAAAAAAAAARIOUS?
---
I would expect that Blizzard actually has a pretty good understanding and analysis to support their decisions. It is unlikely that they will share this with us in such detail however.
---
What I personally believe to be true:
---
They know the server cap that the newer hardware will be able to support, compared to original Vanilla. Lets just say 5k players/server. This is purely speculation, as it would make sense that the hardware can support more than the 2.5k/3.5k originally available. They will also have some retention analysis and projections. So they should have an idea on how many of the people starting out will stay around. So say maybe 30%? I bet there will be a lot of hype and people joining for phase 1, but some will not find it to their linking and some will discover they can not capture the glory of days past.
---
So based on these totally hypothetical numbers, they could allow 15k people per server at launch and expect this to trickle down to 5k who will stay around and keep playing. Do note that I am SURE that they will not have uncapped servers at launch! Also if 5k is the full population and is also the concurrent capacity of the server, it's even better, as these 5k people won't be online at the same time. Some play more at night, some during the day, some dedicated few close to 24h. So this will leave some room for even new players to join down the line and organic rotation of older players leaving/new ones joining.
---
Also layering will be crucial for launch and the following weeks. As people will crowd the starter zones, and there's really only that many 'Young Wolves'/'Blackrock Spies'/&lt;insert favorite racial starting mobs here&gt; available in the first zone and having even 100 people in one would seriously piss everyone off and have 5-10 people camp every spawn to complete their first quests.
---
This is a very simplified summary of what I believe Blizzard will be doing. Because I'm sure that they ARE aware of the dangers of over/under-population of the servers.
---
So, I don understand your concerns, but I choose to believe that Blizzard has thought of that and they have a plan. It's is most unlikely however that they will be sharing said plan with the players however.
---
&gt; Yes you did - every Server did! But you cannot tell me it was to that extent :P
---
No, because we did not have the same ability to form them. 
---
You used these before;
---
Wow forums and IRC to organize events. 
---
Today?:
---
Reddit, Facebook, wow forums, discords, fan forums etc 
---
If you wanted to organize something before, you it was very hard to announce it. Today, you can do it so easy that it is ridiculous.
---
Buy stuff from /2 and request for sellers to send it via COD to your mailbox. You then leave it in your mailbox for I think up to 30 days until it gets sent back to them. Tell them you’ll return to sender if they pay you gold. Essentially holding their trade mats hostage for a month.
---
Yup blizzards promise of "no layering by phase 2" puts some really interesting server questions that haven't been answered. 
---
"Queues and free server tansfers" are not solutions.
---
or just uncap the fps :D
---
I dreamt I was invited to a 10 man UBRS run as a dwarf holy priest a couple nights ago. It was a short dream. I was the sixth person in the group, but we we're already clearing while some looked for more players. Then I woke up and remembered I plan to play a human paladin
---
If the beta pvp server is anything to go by, redridge has only occasionally had a ganker or two, but duskwood is camped around the clock.
---
Early on in the severs life you should do a mixed spec where you are half DPS, half healer. This will suffice for initial dungeon running and will let you do open world content decently. Once the server has matured a bit, switch to full-time healing spec and make gold with professions and dungeons (either soloing stuff in Dire Maul or doing Stratholm live for Rigteous Orbs or whatever you can get).
---
Hook of the master angler or bust.

I don't think the number is particularly important - What matters is whether or not players run out of content to do. Classic appealed to me because by the time we'd cleared BWL, AQ was just behind the corner. After we downed C'thun, we only had to wait a few weeks for Naxx to come out. The difficult and rate of release of content in Vanilla felt appropriate, but I can't say the same for content released afterwards. 
---
Even in BC we were stuck for 9 months running the same thing week after week. Cataclysm offered a similar experience; while the raid was appropriately difficult, there was not enough of it and we were simply stuck waiting for Blizzard to create something new.
---
In short, 2½ months to clear a tier would be fine, if there was another tier released after said 2½ months.
---
Yes to be honest I did not play retail vanilla, even though I have played on private servers before.
---
Now- if people group up to do stupid, pointless stuff, that will be amazing! Since it is 2019 though, I sense people will just want to get though it. Raid with ONLY the select "elite" classes, big numbers, efficiency. I just fear that the majority of people will not play to have fun, just to get the grind done.
---
There are already hundreds of small changes https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp61yw/beta_bugsproblems_megathread_report_issues_here/?st=jwgaf1x9&amp;sh=82b076ca
---
I hope you roll on my server :)
---
Immunity to poison on certain bosses and high nature resist on other.
---
For some bosses poison are still the best option
---
Woah its like The ogres and female gnome were modelled after Esfand and Staysafe from the future.
---
I think it would have been fine at 30, but at 60 Thistle probably wouldn't be fair. ZG trinket would have to be allowed though.
---
What is this? Am warlock
---
Exploring a lot and having fun is kind of what the game was intended for.
---
Asmon Horde? Pretty sure he plays Alliance?
---
Some boe greens with good stats will sell for 3-5x the vendor price. Other bad greenies are worth almost equal to the vendor price. So I only sell the good ones while vendoring the bad ones.
---
I keep all cooking recipes for fun. I will level it one day and these quest reward recipes can't be obtained later on. They are useless but I just want them for the "collecter feeling".
---
Again, the challenge is in the speedrun and going with the fewest amount of players possible. Druids have no place in that.
---
Are they already advertising them now?
---
Okay, hey, chill. 2005 was 2005 and 2019 is 2019. People have more knowledge now, have grown up and have other stuff to do rather than goof around. That is all Im saying- no need to be all offensive about it.
---
You're retarded

---
I do not have a beta key but if you watch the live streams you can cleanly see the elite mobs hit for half as hard
---
When you watch a video of a streamer and expect to hate them but use autism as an insult
---
Okay, thanks a lot, I didn't know!
---
Meh, I ran as tank in 5 mans with my friends as a shadow priest just to see if we could. Worked fine, even if it took way longer, incurred way bigger repair bills and forced people to hold back on DPS a lot more than usual.
---
Why should there be noobs? The game looks dated, it doesn't attract a young and new audience.
---
At least that is my guess.
---
Blood Fury, Axe spec. and Command doesn't do anything in pve?  
---
ok.
---
If you have to ask why you shouldn't be trusted with cameras.
---
Keep crafting mats, sell greens and keep +resist items
---
22-24~
---
23-26 is the average level to do BFD if I remember correctly. The wand is really worth doing it asap just dont be so low you become a burden for others.
---
I mean it really depends on the level of your group. It’s doable as a group of low 20s. If you go in there at 18, you won’t contribute much to the group.
---
You can create multiple bank characters and just mail items to them, creeate a level 5 char learn enchanting and DE all the items, but keep the mats for a while. The more time passes on a new server the more expensive those mats start to get.
---
Actually not, but I guess sort everyone here got my joke... sad story :(
---
I've never in all the guilds I've been in had a guildie summon me to a flight path. Is that a thing?
---
This has been talked over a lot in the past weeks and last I saw Blizzard confirmed its working as intended
---
We could litterly get to any spot in vanilla. In classic it will be harder, but Ive seen people reach Mount Hyjal in the beta.
---
Exploring is still there but its a bit harder than before.
---
Just send it all to an alt and deal with the mail within 30 days.
---
Theres a difference between 2/3 hunters rolling need on intel cloth gear and people being too lazy to Google.
---
The playerbase for classic wow is going to be many times more informed than the playerbase for it 14 years ago.
---
Theres still going to be people that dont know what they're doing. There's just going to be a lot less of them
---
nah, it was only from MoP https://twitter.com/holinka/status/328903950139027456
---
There was a 40-druid Onyxia kill posted not too long ago, so I suspect so.
---
Its really hard to believe mage actually won the tournament, with all the druids, priests, warlocks in the tournament. 
---
Thats not something anyone would expect, mad props to venruki.
---
Rogue and warrior duels are ez for a mage ofc, but playing against these "dot survive" classes are really fucking hard for  a mage. you need to manage your mana, play with range, resets, drs, look for burst opportunities and so you have enough mana, fears etc.. 
---
Even ziqo failed before playing against the lesser geared and skilled warlock. snutz not only a good player he is super geared with a ton of hp. the fact the mage manage to win in bo5 is actually crazy.
---
I really hope so if not I not going to buy the game
---
We did a night of what we called chain-ganking one time.  It's a simple game where you have a couple lads on a boat and a lad at the graveyards closest to each port.  Wait till right before the zone screen to gank on the boat, zone, ganked player automatically revives and gets ganked again.  Frustrated, the player rezzes in the graveyard and is subsequently ganked/camped.  
---
If you time it right you can get a triple kill gank in about 10 seconds.  It happens so fast.  Glorious.
---
I see why they did it. Most of the hardcore PvPers there were engineering, so if they all have it it isn't an advantage, they also had a while to prepare if the desired to level it. Mainly though, there are so many OP pots out there that it would have forced all the players to come prepared with stacks of all kinds of different pots for every potential match up and would have been a nightmare to prepare for. That and duels would have lasted forever, so long CDs wouldn't be a disadvantage anymore, so they would have had to create rules on number of consumes allowed per fuel, which also would have been a nightmare to track.
---
Actually has a lot more EU viewers than NA, he streams around your evening time.
---
You can have my spot sir. If I had one!
---
I think Everquest went through a phase where they literally did this, some kind of premium account to pay for login and GM support priority. Unsurprisingly, it was not well received...
---
How come?
---
I’ve only ever played warlock and still never found a use for my breathing tbh
---
Sorry meant stadium.  Got the names mixed up
---
seems odd that they'd count a duel where you got feared outside the area.  why not just discount it and reset?
---
I analyze games a lot on my free time, and this is an aspect that I hadn't even thought of. It is incredible to find these things in a game that is 15 years old. It really goes to show why WoW was considered a masterpiece for the ages with this much subliminal depth!
---
Give us blood
---
There are no trials in retail, just the free version up to lvl 20. Since they share subscription I doubt  there’ll be any trials in classic either.
---
Does swimspeed also increase swimming in Lava ?
---
u don't use bleed as feral dps, it's viable but u need to put some effort.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdBCt0ErpMg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdBCt0ErpMg)
---
&gt;So based on these totally hypothetical numbers, they could allow 15k people per server at launch and expect this to trickle down to 5k who will stay around and keep playing. Do note that I am SURE that they will not have uncapped servers at launch! Also if 5k is the full population and is also the concurrent capacity of the server, it's even better, as these 5k people won't be online at the same time. Some play more at night, some during the day, some dedicated few close to 24h. So this will leave some room for even new players to join down the line and organic rotation of older players leaving/new ones joining.
---
&gt;Also layering will be crucial for launch and the following weeks. As people will crowd the starter zones, and there's really only that many 'Young Wolves'/'Blackrock Spies'/&lt;insert favorite racial starting mobs here&gt; available in the first zone and having even 100 people in one would seriously piss everyone off and have 5-10 people camp every spawn to complete their first quests.
---
I appreciate you taking the time to have a detailed response and I agree with you.
---
The issues for the starter zones comes down to what they have committed to - layering instead of sharding - layering comes with hundreds of players instead of thousands of players at the beginning zones.
---
Of course with blizzards experience I have no doubt they will figure out the server populations before phase 2 starts... it's just super unrealistic to think the majority of servers won't have 6 hour queues and free server transfers immediately after they attempt to remove layering.
---
The whole purpose of this discussion is to hope that blizzard doesn't ultimately keep layering a permanent fixture on obscenely populated servers... but maybe that's what the streamer servers will need since sharding isn't a thing and 6+ hour queues are pretty terrible a couple months into launch after you have already established your character.
---
Again thanks for your through response and I hope for the majority of us, we'll be fine when phase 2 hits :)
---
Oh boy another one of these...
---
Wow I totally forgot how hard dungeon mobs hit, even when you are max level and 20 lvl above
---
That's retarded. It straight up gives the beta players a huge advantage on launch. They probably didn't consider it or care back then. But that was 15 years ago, people are a lot more vocal with the internet now.
---
Don't insult yourself
---
Sorry mate, not planning on playing on a PvP server, honestly not planning on playing Classic at all. I just dont support borderline harrassment and bullying.
---
If you get honored with some faction, and sergeant rank you can get it for 80g
---
What do you mean people don't credit how good he is as a druid?  He's a former rank 1 druid.  There's no dispute how good he is at the game.
---
I had just written out like 20 lines as an answer....
---
But the conclusion was that you are right - streamers are just quicker at doing it without planning ahead. 
---
But I though that doesn´t really matter..... So I´ll leave it :D
---
Good Point!
---
Streamers are pretty much just like the Person actually "planning" it which every Server Need in order to have such Events
---
My offer stands if you need some lessons feel free to lmk.
---
Not even close?
---
The duels were unbelievably tight knit, Venruki was stabbing with his dagger and wanding while Snutz was draining life. Cdew was basically 1 WF away from victory everytime he managed to get close. 
---
Go ahead and Ask Snutz and Venruki what they think of Warlock vs Mage at 30.

What do you mean by “get to tailoring 300 and get the robe at strat?”  Can toy link me to said robe?  Is it a pattern only available in stratholm?
---
It’s called oomkin for a reason, that’s all I’m gonna say.
---
&gt; Proof please watch the video in full.
---
Read the comment the creator of the video made.
---
yeah that shit was nuts.
---
There will be every type of player, you won't have to worry about that.
---
Many people will only play to grind it out but that's okay because that's gaming in 2019... new game comes out, grind it for 1-3 months depending on how successful it is and then move on.
---
If you are truly interested in staying for the long haul and eventually raiding AQ and Naxx, you'll have plenty of people to do that with - especially if blizzard merges servers as the poplautions die down.
---
Don’t give a shit about China.  Blizzard, and the industry bowing down to foreign, censorious communist governments waters stuff down for us. Separate them. They can all cheat and bot and we can enjoy a game without them.
---
Classic overal is eazy to learn hard to master. That why its eazy to get in and stays intresting over time.
---
Well that was quick, guess I've been looking wrong all this time. Thanks so much for the link!
---
I wouldn't say Deathwing was big when WC3 was released. Not as big as Illidan and Arthas anyway. He was just a unit to kill in some WC2 mission, and I think the whole lore of Aspects wasn't perfectly established back then..?
---
My man, “The Light” and “The Burning Legion” are entirely based off of Christian mythos post-Alighieri.
---
Fair enough, but that’s just part of the game. People can be as sweaty as they want. There used to be posts on server forums all the time of high level rogues camping low level areas for weeks.
---
and he even mentioned it himself right afterwards, pointing out the enemy wasnt a full premade and he was just fooling around for the lulz
---
Ima buy it
---
I think askjeeves shut down.

What was your name?

After releasing your infernal near the flightmaster and they aggroed, banish it for maximum time wasting.
---
They did, but he used all his CDs already in that duel. Arcanite dragonling has 1 hour cd.
---
Here lies the PvP vendor and Resilence. RIP
---
That is nice to hear! Thank you for your detailed comments! :)
---
If we can't get to the airstrip what is the point of classic? Shut the servers down.
---
Server queues. They can make the population cap lower over time, max 2 layers towards the end of phase 1.
---
You're welcome, friend!
---
so they didnt get a ban, i guess i was right. :) why would you want to play this game now since they dont go all hitler on everyone that likes to fuck around?
---
True.
---
I remember the mc off a boat happening so many times in vanilla.
---
OOTL, what misinformation has he been spreading?
---
Yes? And ''again'' let them challenge themselve that way if they wish so. It does not make druids bad healers. It's just that druids are not optimal in that environment if name of the game is everyone steals from each other as fast as possible and healing isn't the issue but damage to down bosses when every second counts. Druids are good at healing so it wouldn't be a mistake to roll one if they wished to heal unless they have the ''minmax and meters over fun'' (or only meters are fun) mentality: there are better games imo for those people where they really could challenge themselves in pve lol.
---
My goal for Classic is to experience all the content I missed while being able to appreciate the game more now that I'm less of a no0b. This includes desiring to play a more supporting role rather than DPS. I took plenty of time levelling my mage and paladin back in the day, so this time I intend to be 60 no more than 3 months after launch, with 2 months being the fastest I could reasonably do it.
---
Not sure what FedEx is but there is no escaping day 1 or 2 of launch.
---
You have to either endure it or wait a few days for it to thin out.
---
Welcome home.
---
ohh right.  did they wait for CDs between duels, like cold snap and so on that aren't as crazy long?  or did you have to strategise when to use longer cds
---
That last screenshot seems like one of the minigames they wanted to implement originally.
---
You just don't understand.
---
Have a nice day friend.
---
🤢
---
No real disadvantages if you have it planned out.
---
You should be quite slow in comparison to People getting ahead of the pack right away (which will be almost impossible at the start) so not too much to loose.
---
You won´t have any Gold for skills. You won´t have any gear or bags (which you probably wouldn´t have by Level 10 either way :D)
---
You won´t be a pro in stealing Mobs from other People by Level 10 which is a skill you will most likely still Need after 10 ;)
---
Also you have the great possibility to already get some flight paths in advance which should save you some good time later on :)
---
&gt;the "Wall of No"
---
So many good QOL changes in the TBC patch history: 
---
\* Meeting Stones usable as summon stones
---
\* Display enemy cast bars
---
\* Hunters able to use traps in combat 
---
\* CC effects lasting no longer than 12 seconds max in PvP
---
\* Thrown weapons use durability instead of stacks
---
I remember when my vanilla guild was going to get help from an alliance guild to kill the Thunderfury boss... 
---
We had to get a hold of them through IRC (which meant catching them while they were online) , organize so that people in charge from their guild got on IRC, get them on Ventrilo, get a date that worked for both guilds (Forum posts with suggested dates, people had to respond to which date worked best), get people to sign up etc 
---
Today we would just jump on their Discord, write in their general chat or PM their GM directly. Set up a calendar invite.. DONE.
---
he is asking for opinions.  
---
Learn to read.  
---
Also dont be a dick
---
tfw an asshole and proud of it
---
If you want to see an edge case here check out the Path of Exile subreddit. That community has no idea what it wants.
---
In general, convenience and satisfaction are in tension. People will demand convenience, but - especially now, in the vanilla community - may also realize its cost.
---
You dont even need wallhoping to get there. Slowfall is ebough.
---
Would be fucking perfect
---
If your worried about the overpopulated questing areas, the only real option is farming on non quest mobs.
---
But most people still know what LFG VC means, is been saturated to the point you could almost use whichever you want
---
For top tier players a mage should take it, for all of us normal plebs rogues will win more often than not.
---
It’s beta. He was invited to participate to test the game. I’m sure they can pull your invite for any reason they want.
---
what is mcp?
---
No matter how long it's been, I still can only see the flight point icon as a little crab claw.
---
Druids don’t single-target heal better than Paladins and Priests.
---
Druids don’t raid-heal better than Shamans and Priests.
---
They’re absolutely the worst of the 4 healing classes in raids.
---
Yeah sometimes we need it for a couple of horrifically hot days lol fans generally do me
---
I think that will work for the majority of servers, what about those that still have 10k+ active daily when phase 2 hits? 
---
10 hour queues or permanent phasing for that server?
---
balance spec is the worst at a vanilla in raid in my opinion, your will spam 1 spell all the time and be oom veryfast (aka oomking).
---
&gt;  everytime they lost WSG to soda's team consisting of venruki, snutz, ziqo and sonii etc. 
---
Lol you mean when Sonii calls it an APES premade when there's only one APES guy in the entire BG? 
---
You're forgetting that Monkeynews' premade won so much that Horde stopped queueing at one point.
---
I love how on one hand people talk about how blizzard ruined the community and then on the other upvote shitposts like this that talk about being a massive twat to everyone you meet.
---
Sure, but if you use a DKP for each raid tier, you might find your main tank or best geared members will decide not to join the guild for Molten Core or Onyxia, and even if the other 80% need gear from there, they'll be screwed.
---
Then you could say: "Well, sure, but ask them to do it anyways for the good of the guild" of course. But then the system is quite imperfect if we need people being selfless for it to work. 
---
You might say "but it's months between raids!" sure, but I can have really good pre-raid gear, join MC, not buying anything, then do BWL and outbid everyone. It's "Doable", I'm not saying its ethical and should be allowed but anybody with this system could do that and you couldn't blame them. And after they have full t2 they might as well leave for a better guild, right?
---
Overall it comes down to the same thing: Find a guild of MATURE people who share your ambitions and goals and have it be a GROUP OF FRIENDS rather than it looking like a work space where you go, raid and leave.
---
wat
---
That doesn’t show mobs took a 50% nerf. That videos shows how much damage someone is taking based on lvl, gear, talents, buffs and type of mobs.
---
He has the black book trinket in that vid btw https://classicdb.ch/?item=19337
---
Also I think it's tbc prepatch
---
Only 30 seconds between each duel, so longer CDs you'd get once a match up.
---
No, there weren't, they used the same database with datamined values and only fixed bugs unrelated to core game values.
---
Are you sure about that? I just spent a few hours off the coast of Southshore hunting Alliance that are trying to kill the Murlocs for their quest.
---
Theres something almost cinematic about an undead warlock rising from the sea the moment you accidentally pulled a few too many Murlocs.
---
I also spent quite a bit of time summoning imps from the depths and just telling them to attack people.
---
10/10 time, would do again.
---
As a night elf you should consider yourself lucky, you'll be in the 2nd least populated zone after Taurens. Honestly, your best bet might be to just stick to Kill X quests and ignore Get X quests, and tag every single mob you can. As a hunter you have a huge advantage in that regards. Spam tab and shoot and you'll get ahead of most classes.
---
Why even comment then ya fucking care bear. 😂
---
Haha at least he was honest
---
Nobody has to buy classic. It's free with a sub.
---
Half as hard as what?
---
summer is here and all I want is those heavy winter snows to come back
---
FedEx = "bring X to Y" quests that require no mobs.
---
Both great races. If pvp Is somewhat relevant to you go orc. Otherwise undead is great
---
Yep. You can only buy the [transmoggable](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/twisting-nether/flabbygash) versions if you had the vanilla FoS
---
I see but it’s just a mindset I can’t share. I leveled 2 classes to 60 in vanilla and a bunch around the 30s and the journey just feels like the same even though it’s different. That’s why I love the leveling the first time because everything is new, now where ever I go I feel like I’ve seen all this before and tried this before.
---
Yeah this is too friendly to.new people.
---
New people should get scraps ans things the core already has
---
I hope it doesn't get overlooked as a minor thing, animations are an important part of the way the game feels.
---
I struggled with them with my Warlock. They do like 80dmg Fireballs and at that level you have like 200hp at best.
---
bankAlt !
---
I did it at 20 lvl as a priest. Being a tank I waited for 22-23 lvl (better safe than sorry).
---
Yes I did and therefore I'm in the beta also.
---
Bit if YOU had played back in vanilla you would know that there was no Devilsaur mafia.
---
Wouldn't be less complicated to just take the mats from the mailbox wihtout paying and sell them yourself? Unless COD is a kind of feature I have never heared about.
---
What exactly will a lowbie learn from this?
---
Let's not pretend you actually have to learn your class while leveling. There's a reason like half of the playerbase still sucked ass at 60. But even if it were so, that really doesn't matter if all you wanna know is what the class looks like at 60 without spending absurd amounts of hours
---
I used to hate streamers. Happened upon payos stream accidentally. Dude is hilarious
---
Ah gotcha, thanks for explaining it without making me feel like I should jump off a bridge :)
---
Well I’m sorry, I didn’t know! 
---
There aren’t a lot of staves itemized for melee so I just assumed they sucked 😆
---
99% of players wont be scarab lord regardless if they play on streamer servers or not
---
Yeah man can never be too safe with who you trust with a camera.
---
I'm so glad so many people are interested in Classic!
---
True actually. Thanks,
---
Because with burning adrenaline the tank will likely be fine regardless. It’s a Dps race and cats with infinite energy do a lot of damage. You can start in cat and go bear where a prot warrior will just do shit damage. I mean ideally you would use multiple feral tanks on this fight but let’s be honest that’s not happening
---
But how will
---
You get 60 faster if you have no gold to buy bags/pots/gear/mounts
---
I like to imagine that the brothers wright were on a hill, daydreaming when one of them  sighed:"Wouldn't it be cool to fly like a bird?" And then someone like you, was also on the hill also laying in the grass, who just laughed "yeah, sure keep dreaming."   
---
Then the brothers shared a very determinated nod. And in synch they said: "Watch us."
---
If you want someone to do something just tell them its impossible. Humans will go a long way only to prove another human wrong!
---
"No one can survive 200degrees for 45min, you said!" said a guy coming out of 200 degree hot self-made-oven big enough for 1 human.
---
Yes...
---
And then wait till everyone is there on the date you planned^^
---
Streamers are like: "Let's to that and that" and 10mins l8r there is 250+ People around them doing whatever they say.
---
Can´t tell me you can do the same in the same time
---
This is incorrect, back in vanilla a mob resisting a sap breaks your stealth. You needed to hover over the vanish button each time just in case.
---
Lol you were ahead of your time
---
Yeah Cash On Delivery has been a mail option since vanilla, you send items to people through the mailbox, and when you take the item out, you pay whatever fee was sent with it. 
---
It works well for a lot of people but there is the option for people to just not buy or return the mail and let it sit... especially for people competing to sell the same item(S).
---
He would've lost if he wasn't UD
---
Late august in Cali is still like... blisteringly hot.
---
All the Soni and Soda etc. -fanbois seem to think there's a huge battle between APES and the retail players. 
---
All the APES players are just chillin with the 30 cap and messing around while Sonii and Soda etc. are tryharding at the 30 cap.
---
All the APES guys are saying that the mount collectors have good chops and recognize that they are good players. 
---
Also. most of the good private server guys rolled alliance and didn't participate in this turny. 
---
Also also, when Monkeynews has been premading they've been mopping the floor with the horde even though they have non-ideal compositions. So yeah.
---
Would like confirmation on not failing to skin a yellow because in every profession yellow means &lt;50% chance to fail.
---
im on the flipside.  id love the modern graphical updates from BFA in classic
---
*all animations you mean.
---
I really hate the fact that it's coming out in summer. I don't want to waste summer inside playing classic ... again. But I also don't want to miss out on launch.
---
I wish it would start at the start of winter here. I wouldn't mind nerding away for a couple weeks then.
---
for the lazy
---
&gt;EDIT:  Thanks to all who provided video footage for most of the examples in my video, after reviewing many of them, it does appear that the mobs are likely doing correct damage.  However, this doesn't make me any less concerned for Classic's well being.  I'm personally in favor of increasing the damage for many of these elites so that crowd control / discipline are still somewhat needed for these dungeons, as they were in vanilla.  I'm not asking for mythic RFK, I'm just asking for elites that do damage.
---
&gt;It's quite possible I'm in the minority camp now, but perhaps you might reconsider when you do some of these dungeons for yourself.
---
Have wiped more than I care to admit with groups that are just a bit too low levelled for DM on that stupid dock going up to the deck of the boat.

No, it’s sad because your life is probably so miserable that being a toxic asshat is your only way to feel like you have control over anything. If I had to bet your probably the Troll that got banned for griefing the tournament and are just crying because it’s yet another part of life you lost at.

Id take gnome in stormwind over ud in any horde city, horde cities are only good for one thing: raiding

little payo ofc

One doesn’t just throw away something their buddy made!

I don't know. The 30cap has changed the meta a lot, i think.
---
!remindme 3 months
---
Your only option to level at a reasonable pace prior to ~40 is by going enhance. Unless you don't care about how quickly it takes.
---
You can either 1h shield and flametoung and whittle targets down with searign and flame shock. Slow and mana efficient. Or you can get a slow 2h weapon with rock biter and earthbind to trade hits. The latter is the fastest until mid-late thirties when mobs start to get more beefy and you need very strong reliable damage without the need if keeping your melee weapon up to date.
---
Bro can I get that guest pass? I still need Beta access.
---
Aha, 1440p! Most excellent, desktop wallpaper material. :-)
---
You underestimate the player base
---
You're right, there were always level 1 trolls on forums and in trade chat, however, if someone is a troll on a level 1, there's a good chance they act like one on their main too and will get a bad rep real quick. It's  not uncommon for communities and guilds to have blacklists where that person doesn't get invited to decent guilds or pugs.
---
I don't know about casting, but I could charge aimed shot in shadowmeld on my hunter. They patched it unfortunately, but I don't remember if it was in vanilla or not.
---
Pretty much everything. The mobs used to hit quite hard, had similar health to all of the other mobs in the dungeon, and you never left combat so your healer/casters couldn't drink and had to rely only on in-combat regen. Pretty brutal given the gear and dps available at the time.

Yeah back then they were trying very hard to stake a claim in the Korean MMO market and probably had to do a few things they wouldn't normally do to appease them.  One of which was launching live for korea simultaneously with NA as it was apparently something not many (or not any) NA companies ever did, except Blizzard.
---
Yeah man I dont play pservers either, but it's the best way to do it. It takes wayyyy too long to level to find out you don't like the class.
---
I've been hacked back in the days and after I recovered my account, my guild gave me an arcanite reaper and the gold for buying back my epic mount.
---
So it was very unlucky, but also very lucky (:
---
I really miss the good old days, with community's like that. That why I fell in love with wow, every time you came online it felt like coming home to your family on Christmas (:
---
The only one that really sticks out to me is the Warlock summon portal. I'm sure there's others but they're similar enough to the vanilla effects that it's hard for me to tell.
---
But I kinda wish they'd change the Warlock portal, it's really jarring.

# &lt;Dark Spirit&gt; [H] [PvP] [NA][US-East] 
---
Seeking to establish a guild that is **fundamentally about PvP**, and **ignores PvE raiding**. Dark Spirit seeks to recruit primarily those interested in Druid, Priest, and Shaman classes of all specs. Ignore raid drama, forget heal-botting, and kick in some alliance teeth. **Rank, not Raid!**
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
**Servertype**: PVP
---
**Time Zone:** US East (EDT/EST)
---
**Event Time**: Every other day, primetime
---
**Main Classes:** Druid, Priest, Shaman
---
**Alt Classes:** Any
---
**wPVP &amp; BGs:** Yes
---
**PvE Raiding:** No
---
**Optional Twink Bracket:** 19
---
**Phased Progression**
---
* Phase 1: Core Quests &amp; Dungeons for key equipment quest rewards. Twink prep. wPvP zone control &amp; town raiding.
---
* Phase 2+: sPvP Reputation &amp; Rank 10+ gear progression
---
**Events &amp; Schedule**
---
* Guild event every other day, loosely primetime EST, as strict scheduling is not as necessary as PvE raiding. As such, other NA time zones may not be a problem.
---
* sPvP/BG , wPvP zone/town raid, key quests, etc.
---
**Interested?**
---

That's kind of the point. Also I don't get how you're "screwing" someone over when bidding on an item. You'll receive this item with the points you just spent. So i guess it was needed.
---
There’s a really easy shortcut from dun morogh to unlock the thorium point FP as low as level 5 or so. The problem is the return trip is like ten silver so you have to hoof it back.
---
HP/Mana pots. FaP is nice for PvP. Swiftness potion is expensive but neat. Swim speed potion come in handy sometimes.
---
Thanks for the free guest pass code, pal. 😎

It'd be one thing if it didn't feel like a toxic cult

Yeah probably

Vs demand. Lots of mages and rogues needed
---
&gt; It’d be like if Roman Empire and Gladiators had Twitter.
---
This would be an epic netflix series. just sayin.
---
6 1/2 hours of Behind the Scenes of the base game AND it's expansions.
---
Keep recipes. Store them on an alt, if needed for room. Auction items of magic quality or better (There'll be plenty of auctioneer addons eventually).
---
You mean WC1, right.. Because thats how everything got started, the Orcs came through the portal and invaded Azeroth..
---
Define payoff. You're actually getting a pretty accurate picture, certainly a more accurate one than by watching some video because you're actually playing.
---
Madseason's video tells you nothing about how the class actually plays like though. Sure you get a general understanding of the abilities but you can find that pretty much anywhere.
---
I'm really not quite sure about what you mean with spoiling it. If you find out you don't like the class then, sure you spoiled it for yourself, but that's the entire point. Seeing what playstyle you enjoy without spending hours upon hours leveling only to find out that no matter how cool the class fantasy is, you can't be arsed only spamming shadowbolts in instances and raids.
---
The quality is undeniably poor in Molten Core, however in general most raids are great design even by today's standards (if you look at the entirely of WoW, not just Classic). Molten Core is kind of a fringe case not really worth discussing. Poor raids could be touched up a little to bring them up to scratch. Either way the point isn't to re-experience the past, it's to have a LOT of content for players to choose from. Repeating the same 2 or 3 raids every week gets dull, if you had 50 raids to choose from you could do a different raid every week of the year. 
---
As far as equipment and rewards go, I think this has been one of the big problems in WoW over the last decade. All gear is very one-dimensional; It comes out of the same mold and even the wildest pieces of equipment only have slight variance. I mentioned these examples in another reply somewhere, but what if equipment actually did something interesting? Examples could be things like unlocking new skills that change the play style of a class. What if the Frostfire set from Naxxramas let mages use steam spells, you know, because fire vaporizes water? Or a warlock weapon that would let them summon a demon only available to that particular weapon?
---
Druids only win by attrition, and are much more easily ignored on private servers. There's a reason people want them to carry flags... And that's literally it
---
You just linked another reddit post.
---
We don't have a clue what are you trying to say ?
---
Go rewatch it, he got auto attacked a few times by ranged weapons mid duel. 1 or 2 even caused spell pushback. But the dude is a saint and didn't complain about it and still won that duel.
---
Layering is only for the first phase, I don't know if it's an actual concern.
---
Ah of course they had no intention of disrupting the gameplay by jumping on top of duelers and their totems. They just wanted attention and went about it totally innocently.
---
Thanks! I get it now. The missing information for me was that you are talking about effective skinning time. Seems obvious now that I think about it.
---
Frost oil for a quest. Otherwise as the other one said hp and mana pots are always nice.
---
Having said that the best thing to buy while leveling is usually bags if you can get them cheap.
---
That kind of thing happened all the time in classic. Why would those require streamers when they never did before? My server had huge hints for Starsky and Hutch.
---
Don't forget to whisper people "Your AFK tag is on" in the middle of a BG.
---
This doesn't make any sense at all.  
---
The one who is the best, deserves to win...
---
That's a bit misleading. DPS \* Attack Speed = Average Weapon Base Damage. So, higher weapon damage causes bigger numbers. A slower weapon with equal DPS will thus cause higher numbers but then the question is, how often can you hit those instant attacks?
---
With Warriors, your limit for instant attacks is generally Rage generation, which is itself a function of damage, which then of course needs to be averaged over time and thus becomes a function of damage per second. Static Rage generation from Rage Potions and Anger Management favour high damage, slow Attack Speed weapons but basic Rage generation from auto attacks should be expected to even out between Attack Speeds. While tanking, again, the Rage generation from being hit can be counted as a static Rage generation mechanic and does favour slow weapons. (Likewise, slow weapons will attack less, thus being parried less, which means less damage taken from parry haste attacks. Thus one could easily argue that slow weapons are preferable to tanking. The downside is of course that early aggro catching is a bit more precarious.)
---
With Rogues, your limit for instant attacks is Energy regeneration, which is a static mechanic. As such, Rogue instant attack DPS naturally favours slow weapons.
---
It was a faction zone, so the Horde weren't flagged. If they had moved to a contested zone there would have been Alliance attacking people mid duel like when Venruki accidentally got flagged mid duel and got hit a few times by random Alliance.
---
It's like talking to wall... That still doesn't matter! They are good healers for the content vanilla has to offer. The content is laughably easy: so easy that people speedrun it. Others are better but druid is still good.
---
As I said true end game in vanilla is elsewhere other than pve (except as you said there's a small niche that speedruns an easy content and makes the scene competitive) and people in general play druid for different reasons than getting getting to heal in raids (I main priest because I really like healing in both raids and bgs).
---
Let me make a stupid example and hope you would get it:
---
You are missing 10$ for train ticket so you ask if someone would help and give you some money for it. The first guy would give 90$, the second 100$ and third 80$. Which one do you pick? The min maxer takes 100$ because he gets 90$ extra and which he could use later. The normal person doesn't care and would pick any of them because he just needed that ticket and would just select the first offer and thank him.
---
The conclusion is that it doesn't matter who heals. The content is too easy and all healers are good.
---
Some people will be ready. Not everyone knows about it. The real problem is the bug that produced it has been fixed.
---
When I first played Vanilla, there was a mace specced arms warrior that tanked literally just about every dungeon. He utilized the stuns to keep himself alive. Now he did say that once he hit 60 and got into harder content that the immunity to stuns prevented him from tanking like that.
---
The tram whistle goes doo d-dl-lu-doo
---
Competition is heavily overrated. Hunters can tag mobs very fast with arcane shot by L6 which is enough to allow you faster leveling then exploration even in madly contested starting zones.
---
the problem is you are nerfing your potential explore xp, you should explore zones only within level range of 5 of you otherwise you will only get xp based off your current level.   
---
IMO just grind if you're a hunter. if you're worried about competition on quest mobs.
---
The issues that come with it are the servers with high pops after it gets removed.
---
10 hour queues and the ability to transfer to a dead realm can't be the only options in 2019, could they?
---
Go back to retail
---
&gt; Some I understand whey the are funny, but some are just plainly being a jerk.
---
I was already planning to play on a PvE server just to avoid world PvP, but I think most people who enjoy being jerks will end up on PvP servers, so double the benefit there.
---
the winner is an undead mage? uh so exciting and unpredictable wohoo
---
Actually Serenity Now was a guild and they weren't banned.
---
They didn't happen as often. They happen every day with streamers.
---
Effectively tell people whether or not they're allowed to hold their opinion, or tell them that if they have such opinions they shouldn't play Classic.
---
Only the level 50+ resist items really matter at all tbqh.
---
No it’s not confirmed. He’s just trolling
---
Bro you give me $20,000 and I won’t play a single day of wow ever again.
---
LF Oceanic/PvE guild/Alliance
---
I'm planning to roll as a Dwarf Priest and I'm looking for a semi-hardcore PvE guild, preferably raiding during night prime time/before 12am AEST.
---
Same one we've always had. Are you meaning the Macro API ?
---
It's 26% cheaper.
---
$14.99 (2004) = $20.28 (2019)
---
14.99 / 20.28 = 0.739
---
Today's price is ~74% of the old one
---
No, he overestimates the playerbase's sanity
---
Cant kill them in an horde zone obviously
---
The best leveling rule:
---
Questing is a top priority. If you can't quest then grind. If you can't grind then explore. As long as you move forward you'll get there.
---
I miss the concept of "how do we beat these mechanics with these classes/these spells" instead of "how do I get so much gear/so high numbers that mechanics mean absolutely nothing".
---
i think blizzard got much more useful data from this event than you think buddy
---
This guy is just a douche.
---
If people keep grouping with him they shouldn't complain about being ninjaed ...
---
Yeah that would have been annoying and disruptive but I would defend that as legitimate play that isn't against the ToS. I think there is a pretty clear difference between just PvPing, even in an annoying way and what these taurens were doing.
---
You're very welcome.
---
I will say first though that you're not wrong for not wanting to play the class based upon being rejected and being criticised. It is an intrinsic part of playing druid (unless they re-balance the classes, which is unlikely, and I'm not sure even I want that).
---
It's really hard to tell you what to do in the realm of being a caster because honestly I've never played druid as pure balance. I've played everything except balance.
---
I think the best idea is to decide what you want to accomplish PvE-wise. 
---
As a feral tank, you will be in very high demand for dungeons. We find groups as 60 as a tank with the same ease that a tanking warrior does. I know because I've mained both classes at 60 in a dungeon environment!
---
Finding a dungeon group as a feral DPs/balance is not easy. To be honest it is downright frustrating. As either, not only do not not bring crowd control to the table, but you also actively make more desirable classes not want to join the group.
---
You'll be rejected from groups as feral on the connotation that there is already a rogue and he does not want competition. 
---
Honestly the only real way to get gear at 60 as a feral DPs or balance druid is to tank or heal, and tell the group that you're not there for healing gear.
---
Many people hate me for it, but I do "reserve runs" a lot. Meaning that I'll pick an item that I want, and I'll set up a group. So for example I decide that I want the mace from the final boss in DM:N. I'll set up a group with myself as the tank and have master looter for that boss. I make doubly sure that everyone in the group knows of my intention beforehand- but still this doesn't bode well with some. 
---
To be honest with you, the class is amazing. I love druid to bits. The world PvP is sensational, the class has an identity, and you can play exactly how you want to.
---
However I'm not going to sugarcoat it. At 60, you will (probably) not get dungeon groups playing as pure balance or pure feral. However if you can grind gear as other specs, and then find a raid leader willing to raid with you- problem solved.
---
Raids are much more accepting of druids because they bring battle rezes, innervates, off-tanking and other very useful things to the raid.
---
But there's that "rejection period" between reaching max level and raiding that you need to put up with.
---
&gt;Most of the hardcore PvPers there were engineering, so if they all have it it isn't an advantage, they also had a while to prepare if they desired to level it.
---
Most hardcore PvPers have a stock of potions of different varieties.
---
&gt;Mainly though, there are so many OP pots out there
---
Are you suggesting a ranged, no mana, aoe incapacitate with damage is not OP?
---
&gt;have forced all the players to come prepared with stacks of all kinds of different pots for every potential match up
---
This is a pretty huge exaggeration when the limit is level 30. Outside of free action potions the variety is quite lot due to shared cool downs. It's not to say there isn't a variety, it is to say for 95% of situations and match ups the answer is a free action potion.
---
&gt;That and duels would have lasted forever
---
Total conjecture. It's possible and indeed likely that free action potions shorten a duel not lengthen them. The ones that would lengthen are protection potions, which increase health by effectively 1k. Nothing near the amount you would need to have a duel "last forever"
---
I didn't play vanilla so i could be wrong about this but sharpening stones might be helpful. If you are playing melee anyways.
---
For your first character I wouldn't even bother, you're going to need every penny. Alts are when you can flash your cash and pimp them out with delicious greens and consumables.
---
Their change was to pools. You can fish in pools at skill 1 and catch things but you will only find trash in open water (until around the level required originally). 
---
It meant you could fish current content to level up, but also required you to run around a lot to find pools while high skill players could farm more efficiently.

Me: spends rest of my play time jumping off the sides to my death multiple times until a mage was kind enough to send me to storm wind

This might be the case now during the beta when content is limited but I doubt it will happen all the time once the game is released and everyone is spread out on different servers with different goals and a ton of content to consume.
---
Expand tamable pets.

Not sure if OP is trolling
---
Hey, you are identical to me, weird
---
No I dont think that it is haha I haven't heard of this either.
---
I’m familiar with Shedo. He’s great. And puts in 500% of the work of your average hardcore. He’s a right tail outlier. You’re not going to get Shedo performance a month after dinging 60.
---
Nothing feels better than ganking gankers. They usually have their pathetic ways to hide on the roof or water in Lakeshire, which only makes it so much more rewarding to camp their corpses.
---
Ahh this explains it and makes sense! I always almost certain that if you were standing next to a mage and jumped while his nova animation cast, you couldn't hop over it.
---
I mean, I was remaking my first ever trial character as a mage to begin with, so this just makes it more awesome.
---
There's like 5 APES on the beta, most skilled duelers are not invited...
---
Yeah in Scandinavia it's usually getting pretty chilly then. Definitely fall territory.
---
Yeah some the guys in the duels actually gave great commentary themselves.
---
Wasnt there an option where you could click to move or am I remembering completely wrong?
---
If you're the kind of guy to quit over being griefed, you're not going to have much fun anyway.
---
This is nothing - on a certain pserver, there were a couple of guys dedicated to keeping Westfall/Redridge quest givers dead 24/7 on rotating sleep schedules.
---
Not jumping in wow while walking is actually harder than pre-nerf C'Thun.

I've rolled 5 on Valor chest (that was unlucky). The second warrior laughed loudly and taunted. He rolled 2. I won the chest (that was super lucky).

He left the guild right after, couldn't be more triggered.

IIRC you can start eating, then Shadowmeld to eat while hidden.

Outside of Teldrassil...I never leveled in the Classic World. By the time I was able to play again, I was able to use the dungeon finder, the only place I quested in Classic world was Silithus.
---
i am like him too ... i want to try warrior this time purely cos its going to be a macro machine to stance dance ....
---
I'm just going off my personal experience and the experience of the few friends I had that owned mice like that. THey all preferred to not use them, although I know at least one of them felt that way because his earlier gen Razer one wouldn't keep working properly and he was sick of sending it back in to be fixed, because it meant he had to relearn/pratice kind shit to only use the keyboard each time
---
Now, maybe my exp is atypical completely. I dunno, I just know even before my injury that made them unusable for me, it was not worth the headache esp since I didnt play any high keybind heavy classes/specs. I was offered a 75% discount off the MSRP by one of said friend and spent a long weekend riading/BGs fucking with it. Ended up giving it back and using my walmart keyboard (this was before ORbweaver was released, and I didnt know about older model keypads. Wish I had)
---
tl;dr - Just my IME. YMMV
---
Okay, so no official word on server caps. Got it.

I've been there and done that before, that's why I'm a little concerned lol. Part of the fun I guess, but if anyone has a chance of sort of managing it I guess it's blizzard.

Classic should never try to be an esport. It's an unbalanced, rng-heavy mess and we like it that way. Esports/balance focus is why the rpg got removed from mmorpg.

As a Vanilla Hunter, you just triggered the shit out of me.

Also you forgot to camp the 4 Hunter Epic Bow Demons and shoot them when the Hunter is trying to kill them.  Just having a second person on their aggro table will despawn the mob for 3 hours.

Most of us who remember and likes Venruki are players from TBC/LK arenas era.

-repestedly sap people in goblin cities. If they attack you they die. If they leave the city you kill them. Puts them in a constant state of fear
---
Wrong
---
I’d also like to know.
---
In fairness, venruki has always been the mage god. He's played on world championship level teams since BC.
---
The amount of time I have spend searching for this sword with archeology in Cata is the only time I feel like thrown away for nothing in this game.
---
Don't have it in horde zone
---
Not only will 90% of the server not give a shit about it unless you're consistently disrupting dungeons/BGs, but you can also just completely reset your reputation by rerolling whenever you want.
---
/cast [@mouseover,exists,harm]Polymorph
---
Streamer realms are like a double edge sword to me. They have the ability to host huge events, whether Weavil raids or Duel competitions, which are just as fun to watch as they are to participate in.
---
However there are numerous down sides too, like streamer perks(negates fair comp, think clout for rare boe's or just epic mount $) Stream sniping drama/cloud chasing, and some toxic players. And even these downsides can limit non-streamer interaction with others because you don't want to be accused of sniping/cloud chasing when you interact with them naturally.  
---
Even with all that said, I hope there is one "Streamer Server" where all streamers would have at least 1 character among many other players. But this would be an alt server for streamers as they would also split up among numerous different servers for their more serious characters. That way we could enjoy/participate in events with all Streamers along with all the fun that brings and still have a normal non streamer influenced servers with normal and natural economies. 
---
I'm definitely will be avoiding streamers on launch but after being apart of the beta, I can acknowledge the fun side of being on a streamer server too.
---
&gt;I’m a pretty casual viewer of WoW streamers 
---
Translation: I only sent him $100 of my parents' money during the event
---
Although, only after writing the response did I actually notice that there's the "Do *rogues*" part in the topic... :D
---
The game will use the current retail engine and will have modern weather and water effects and whatnot so you can check retail requirements and that should give you a pretty good idea.
---
Level 6 will take 10 + hours at launch
---
Pretty sure it was the case back then. It did DR
---
&gt;If you're the kind of guy to quit over being griefed, you're not going to have much fun anyway.
---
I play MMOs since UO, so I know a thing or two about griefing. Tho, I really dislike griefing for the sake of griefing and a lot of those tipps are just that. They don't net you anything except the knowledge that you ruined someone elses fun.

&gt; Belkin n52te
---
Goddamn I wish I knew about those before. I never got a Orbweaver until Christmas 2016. It's cooler than the Belkin but I except they functionality wse they are mostly the same. Funny though I only used the Orbweaver for a couple months of Legion in a depserate bid to find a game Id like and play. Quit. Felt like I had "wasted money". Nope. Turns out, it's actuallly very convient for even Old School Runescape (granted, I mainly used "pedal button" for alching or fletching or whatever, or up to 4 max, usally only 2, for repitive skills, but still hella convient lmfao) 
---
Hoping to get my full "money" out of it though! Havent gotten a gift since that's reallly ended up signficantly changed my life. Just typical spiderman stuff and giftcards -_-. Thanks Mom for looking up weird Forum posts for something I could use and then paying extra bc christmas prices &lt;3

I see my bad
---
Yeah that makes sense. I'll keep an eye out. Thanks my dude!
---
The Nelf lands has fewer people than starting dwarf/gnome lands, and much less than starting human lands.
---
However, the repops are much slower also. It took us Forever to get anywhere in Teldrasil, the only thing that helped us is the constant crashes during stress test, each crash we could get a mob or 3 before the general population got back in.
---
A Better plan, is Group up for quests  for kill quests you are on, then disband when you leave to work on something else.   
---
Skip/abandon the kill + collect quests. I've seen a couple shady people start a group for collect quests, with the loot on free for all, and just ninja all the collection fist.
---
Instead, when you make it to a place like Fel Rock, where no one needs the trash, just the "boss" of the cave, grind those mobs hard, no one needs to kill them, and they have a very fast respawn.

This was a duel tournament with over 100k spectators taking place on a beta. There was a tuaren village idiot ruining the experience for everyone watching as well as the guys dueling because he was standing on totems rendering them untargettable and on players so you coudnt see if they were casting without addons. The event was just a bit of fun and everyone having a good time watching streams (I was watching Quin's PoV). I dont know what Trollgodx was trying to prove but he got ported out and rightly so. HOWEVER, if this was happening on actual live realms then that is different, anything goes there. But lets have some common sense on this issue and let it go.
---
Why do you think a premade would take a rogue to their WSG? Very curious btw
---
Is this the horde version ?
---
Yeah then no one would troll for sure /s
---
lol fun ruined
---
Graphics take a backseat to fixes that are necessary to game mechanics.  If they leave them it doesnt change the game for me
---
Lol there is a difference in being exhausted and not having fun 😜
---
I agree to a point but the internet is different than it was on 2004.
---
Also it's not impossible that there will be entire dickhead guilds that are completely okay with all of this. I dont think people will get as punished as everyone says
---
dude please get naked strap the boxes to your body and like, film yourself with Goodbye Horses playing in the background, and just murmur shit about wow put it on youtube plz.

Fresh Classic raiding guild looking for people to progress with in a laid back environment. If you are of the "raid smarter not harder" mentality, then we are the right place for you.  In addition to raid content we will also be pushing PvP rankings and staying on the cutting edge of the hottest memes. 
---
**GM and Raid lead:** Both myself and the raid lead have a lot of experience both in Vanilla and through BFA. In vanilla we both cleared into Naxx in addition to ranking in PvP and have been doing the equivalent of Mythic raiding throughout WoW's history. 
---
**Recruitment Needs:**  Currently recruiting all classes and roles for Raiding and PvP. 
---
**Raid times:** Tuesday, Thursdays 8-11 EST. With optional Raiding on Sundays 4-7. Times could vary depending on progression / challenge level but will only reduce hours. 
---
**Environment:**  Laid back, but focused on progression. We want to raid smarter not harder. Steady progression without the yelling and stress.
---
**Loot System:**  Modified DKP. We want our system to be easier so we adjusted it.

At the time the first people don't want to join MC raids because they don't need anything that raid has usually become easy enough to not need them anymore. (And people anyway start to gear up 2nd chars at that time) I really don't see a problem here nor do i remember one.
---
As someone who has played arenas extensively, I don’t know that it has done that last part. It’s certainly streamlined things and added a lot, but in many ways it’s also simplified it.
---
And yet, an unimportant part of the game mechanically.....
---
Soft. Must be fun getting you’re feelings so hurt.
---
How old's your PC? With everything turned all the way down the game should run on just about any currently functional system.
---
The self proclaimed troll is calling me salty. Guess i struck a nerve.
---
Hahahahahahahahhahahaha that is killa might do on my next bender
---
Certain greens are worth a lot more than others, and can be worth selling. Others, DE, and most I just vendor.
---
Weapons are usually worth vendoring; but anything with high DPS can be worthwhile. Ranged weapons especially.
---
Leather "of the monkey", cloth "of the owl", cloth "of shadow wrath" or "of frozen wrath" are all good and can sell for a bit. But if it doesn't sell after the first time or two, I'll just cut my losses and vendor or let it sit on a bank alt for another month or two and see if the market develops. When you are leveling, absolutely just send *everything* to a bank alt... Any crafting mats, BoE greens/blues, recipes, extra potions you outleveled, etc.

Longer breath underwater for a class that has a spell to breathe underwater....

you can always mail anything your unsure of to an alt, (you don't even need to log the alt in before you can start mailing it).
---
you have 30 IRL days to open the mail before it automatically returns to your character.
---
If you log in before then, you choose to return to sended unopened, or open it and make an actual bank/ah alt to take care of your town needs.

ITS A TYPOOOO HE MEANT DUEL SPEC
---
I don't know why you are getting downvoted exactly how I see it too. Granades but no thistle tee?
---
For a healer? 18, if you are good, have a good group, and have OK~ish gear. Everyone else, 22+.
---
They’re both good, orc is generally better though, the stun resist is much stronger than wotf as rogues and warriors are going to be your biggest issues. But again they’re both very good, orc has the edge though.
---
At lvl 24
---
Used to play MUDS had books of hand drawn maps with notes as a kid. EQ Cleric who had his epic. I agree 100%. Well said
---
My favorite item ever. Now shhh. I don’t want too much competition for it lol.
---
mc those guys and run them into the guards ... you might die too but who cares
---
Same, it’s been my favorite item since I got it fourteen years ago.
---
There isn’t any. People just don’t like it when you jump around or stand on totems. With the intention of disrupting gameplay.
---
For my 12th birthday my dad ran and I learned every flight path. I was in the mid 30 levels so there were several that were difficult for me to get. Actually ended up helping me get to 60 a little faster because I already had the next areas discovered.
---
Thanks for spoilers in the title :(
---
Jungle Remedy from specific STV mobs
---
Fishing every wreckage pools for pots, skins/cloth to vendor/use.
---
You should not spend much on things while leveling.
---
No, it's a wallpaper that lists all dungeon instances located on Kalimdor, later I will upload a wallpaper with the Eastern Kingdom dungeons
---
It's a close call. I'd say orc just for the simple fact that everyone serious for pvp runs with grenades and rogues will give you the hardest time. That being said, I'm probably going to play undead because they look better.
---
Were? I thought it's still a thing
---
I don't know either. People in the thread are unable to describe it either any way other than totally arbitrary.
---
The only truly fair way to conduct duels like this is either all crafted consumables are permitted, or none are.
---
&gt;One of us is being ganked by ~~that~~ **those** annoying undead rogue**s** in lakeshire?
---
Let's be realistic here :o
---
That is how items should look like in an rpg. Random stuff, garbage items, weird stat combos and once in a while a truly good item... not generic stat increases with "perfect itemization". The most boring way to create an item.
---
From a fantasy and story perspective I don't mind the portals between the BFA hubs and major faction cities, I think it makes sense that in wartime each faction would dedicate resources for maintaining portals for supply lines, etc. The portals to older content I am indifferent toward, mostly because I never interact with them anyway.
---
Yeah but i still need to get arcane shot.
---
1) It was removed by automod because it received so many random reports. We didn't do anything.
---
2) The cuck is the guy that just got banned for calling us cucks (Rule #2) instead of just sending a quick ModMail asking what's up.
---
End of August is absolutely not really summer.
---
It’s essentially the start of fall here.
---
depends what class will you be
---
5% pet damage too!
---
Good tip, ty
---
He's still extremely entitled though.
---
I really wanted to give him another chance for beta but his old ways of screaming for loot whenever it dropped just came back fast during his WC/BFD runs.
---
I do respect his druid skill though.
---
Joke's on you for watching tips' stream.
---
Yeh, blizzard just needs to start banning people who is just causing nuisances.
---
How do you delete someone ekses post?
---
Orc will certainly offer the most dramatic swing moments when you resist a stun, and alliance rogues and paladins won’t relish fighting you for that reason, but having WotF available when you want it is huge. Cannibalize will keep you going early every so often, but if you play optimally you’ll rarely need it. Warlocks self sustain better than almost any class solo. Having relevant on-demand abilities is a big deal in PvP.

**&lt;Addicted&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Hardcore PvP/Raiding Guild - English**
---
Addicted is a serious but friendly guild which is looking for outstanding players in order to rush the content when the game comes out. We will both rush PvE and PvP content. The members come from different background but we all have in common the passion for what the game used to be. Most of our players played on retail (2004-2006) and then on and off private servers.
---
**Goals**
---
* Have the first 60s of the server among our members
---
* Be the first guild of the server to clear the PvE content
---
* Break PvE records for speedruns
---
* Manage the PvP ranking of our server when PvP comes out (in order to have the most R13/14)
---
**Member Expectations**
---
* Be 60s within 10 days
---
* Strong PvE and/or PvP knowledge
---
* Team member, friendly attitude and not being a pretentious asshole :)
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
At start everyday until content is cleared. Later reduce that to 1 to 2 days when content is on farm/speedrun. The days are not defined yet but will be discussed together with the members.
---

---
Layering won't help unless it would be overly-cheesable to hop between layers at will and without hassle. Usually you want to blend quests with AoE for max efficiency. If you see nice packs you may delete them. Best pure AoE spots likely will be taken or overkilled without somewhat faster respawns.
---
Nobody cares
---
I’m stuck between this too, and warlock 
---
As I will only be playing 2 or 3 hours a night I don’t see myself getting past Tier2 or into AQ, so wondering which class is least gear dependant for pvp endgame, mage lock and hunter seems the best, but obviously hunter needs a good bow

Yeah it's so funny to be an asshole to innocent people because they picked blue instead of red
---
No life at start trying to get ahead of the curve. If I manage to do that Ill abuse the layering technique and aoe farm on multiple layers.
---
Im not a fan of abusing the layering technique but Im a fan of leveling as fast as possible. So Ill make smart use of all game mechanics.
---
If it aint possible to propper aoe farm because Im not enough ahead of the curve Ill follow a leveling guide.
---
My tallents will be decides by the reason mentioned above. But either way Ill take inprove blizzard and aoe farm when possible.
---
But why?
---
Everyone bitches about loot, not everyone acts extremely entitled to getting all loot whenever it drops.
---
This is something one of his subs would say to rationalize his bad behavior.
---
&gt; Brush up on your cross-faction language. Pro-tip: all alliance to horde messages can be sent from undead (gutterspeak) to alliance.
---
What?  That was actual beta only.  Not sure whats even being said in terms of one way or two way communication.
---
No mention of Mark of Shame?
---
Virgin minmaxer detected
---
I see, so using that logic we'll just have to have Blizz ban people for griefing other players by bringing bosses to main cities.
---
Noooooo thanks
---
Interesting insight. I am planning on leveling skinning on my mage, so that I can skin the mobs in Maraudon when farming around lvl 46. Should be worth it I reckon.
---
Innocent when they picked pvp server over PvE 👍
---
You dont understand. Vael is the only fight in the game where your threat ceiling directly correlates to with fewer people dying, as Burning Adrenaline is cast on a timer.
---
Not using a Druid as a tank there would be insane.
---
Agreed. I only watch highly intellectual streamers for connoisseurs such as myself.
---
Yeah you can. Just play on a private server. Somewhat the same. Feels close. I'm doing it just to refamiliarizemyself with the questing.
---
lol
---
Havent you played on nostalrius back in the day?
---
So you're opening a radial menu, moving your mouse to an icon then clicking said icon all the time?
---
Yeah Cdew especially.  It’s actually really cool to hear him talk through everything as I’m pretty naive to high end PVP.
---
Thank you Master Vanilla Dueler. The logs will be updated.
---
Basically if you are not pro-tanking and have average gear pugs, the difficulty is as people remember it.
---
Arugal murders your party, you have to slow down in some pulls, but it is overall doable.

go to pve realm if you don't like it

We are an up-and-coming guild quickly filling our ranks. We have extensive goals to be one of the top guilds on the server and will always be current on content. We fully expect to be ready to raid within a 2-3 week timeframe from launch. We're looking for casual players as well has those as hardcore as us alike.

We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule. We will not have a "one and done" mindset in regards to missing a raid. But no less than 90% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after.

It better be. That would be a HUGE change in mechanics that would alter most raid and PvP itemization/Best in slot/etc.
---
haha and every one of us had to go through the coming-of-age ritual of accidentally pulling the 3 parrots, 2 pirates, 2 goblins and a fookin murloc or whatever else was upstairs
---
EVERYONE JUMP ONTO THE BIG WHEEL THING
---
Well this is best MMO launching since 2004, 1 month is not enough time for anything.
---
The thought of it killing bfa or causing many guilds to switch is not a radical thought.  It’s a rate opportunity to play a launch MMO that doesn’t suck.
---
It is? So you can get banned for ganking and such?
---
Yeah thats what I mean. The dude is an unreal pvper and he's already settled in very nicely at top end (all be it lvl 30) mage play.
---
Your DOTs will only deal the damage they were intended on spell cast. Any modifications of intelligence/spellpower after the spell is casted is irrelevant for the DOTs already on the target.
---
ahaa that's very interesting.  it adds a bit more meta-game
---
I think the main difference is that there is actually a reason to get flight paths when there is no dungeon finder.
---
Why does this make me feel really uncomfortable?
---
Almost don't want to give this one up because I don't want it to be used against me. You can mind control NPCs and use them to attack un-flagged people of the other faction. If they retaliate they become flagged, if they don't, they just have to run away or risk dying.
---
Redo the expansions but with the core of Vanilla !! Hope Hope Hope !
---
This worked all the way until wrath I think. You had to basically single out one dude and have a group to pull it off but it was hilarious when you got it to work.
---
&gt; Asmon got people together to raid Stormwind with a dragon, eplored Zul Gurub, Caverns of time, Karazhan and more
---
People did all that before streamers you know. Heck, we did it before LFG. One of my fondest memories of WoW (actually from TBC) was being in a raid that took down all four Alliance leaders in one evening.
---
Yep. Then there's portals in stormwind (/org) to get to all the cata zones, a portal in the mage tower to the blasted lands, ship to nothrend, portal to pandaran, etc.
---
I remember in vanilla feeling really clever figuring out efficient routes to certain places. (Flight path from org to crossroads, walk to ratchet, then ship to booty bay...).
---
I’m assuming your dots only take advantage of the extra spell damage that activated items give you if they are applied/refreshed after you activate the item and gain that bonus spell power. If you have dots up on a target and use your active item the dots applied before using the item won’t have an increased damage until you refresh them with your temporarily boosted spell power. I’m not totally positive if this is the way it works but it’s always the way it seems to work for me.
---
He's also a caster for arena wow tourneys sponsored by blizzard
---
The amount of nature and shadow pots you'll use on c'thun progression is definitely insane anyone looking to make money should be prepared for AQ to open
---
Just like Mortal Kombat 1 on SNES
---
Lol fuck Alexensual
---
and is 50%smaller than the 2004 one.
---
Dwarf male and Human Female really looked more lifelike in those last screens.
---
I had a friend give me that back in BC as a birthday present. Haven't heard from her in at least 10 years, maybe more. :(
---
Yeah I hope they get changed to the classic version before the beta ends.
---
How the fuck is this a Tyrion Lannister reference?
---
I wish they would make it at least 30 mins but whatevs haha
---
Or blizzard will intervene still in live cause it’s the streamers and they’re still part of marketing.
---
You can’t say they won’t when you don’t know that.
---
Yes, it got banned.
---
After every battle you get nommies :)
---
Kinda blunt but pretty much this. It’s a ton more immersive for some getting sucked into wpvp than instanced pvp.  WPvp has that “unexpected” and “mystery” feel to it not to mention it makes you really feel apart of the *community* (there’s that word again)
---
I made a fortune from 30-40 grinding on the Turtles in Alterac. Cooked their meat and vendored the cooked meat for profit + the Greys they drop sell good!
---
Items like these make rpgs
---
You mean another reason to play Alliance?
---
I've tried leveling on a 10k server in a starting zone and 1-6 takes less than 2 hours even if you have bad ping as long as you ignore certain quests.
---
I have to honor your spitefulness. I would keep a notepad of any dudes like this that had really wasted my time when we first started playing and any time those guys were spotted it basically turned into an all out war. I feel like the single server model really supported this type of stuff and can’t wait to see it come back because now you have a chance of finding that guy again somehow out in the world.
---
With lifetap you'll be low on health a lot so I like undead for eating corpses.
---
Considering ranking won’t be in the game till phase 2...
---
That’s a long time to not have a mount unless you’re just very very casual
---
Even prior to then it's not THAT bad.
---
You know what? i don't mind it really. but id like to be able to do something without aids retards spreading the shit.  i'll be happy with just being able to store the bomb debuff on my pet and putting it in the AH in ironforge (from baron geddon)
---
[I don't think so](https://classic.wowhead.com/enchanting#recipes:0-17+1)
---
They added in TBC ability to convert 1 nexus crystal to 1 small prismatic shard.
---
Any idiot who rushes to 60 is not playing the game and might as well play retail.
---
That is nice to know. As stated however, my fear is  that people will not do that stuff anymore. We now have jobs, some have kids and family. What I see is the majority of people just leveling up and raiding with the little time they got, plus the whole "efficiency mentality" that is so prominent nowadays.
---
What?
---
I mean, I'd argue they have. I played mage all my life, my first character in OG vanilla was a mage, and I played up to rank 11 back in the days. 
---
It's really easy to shattercombo people and throw out a sheep, and if that's all you're doing, you're already pretty effective in the context of a BG. Now, try playing a (non-shadow) Priest, a Druid or a Shaman - much, much more difficult to do the right thing in any given situation. 
---
I still think the 'Easy to learn, hard to master' stuff is a meme at this point, but I think there is an argument to be made for mages, well geared warriors and rogues having a lower skill floor than most of the other classes. Just my 2cts on the issue.
---
imagine having guildies in retail
---
WoW Classic hype post + CoD reference just after the announcement + Chernobyl reference the day of the series finally.
---
Triple threat pop culture reference. Well played sir
---
He was trying to help test totem stomping macros.
---
I agree with you, get an Mailbox addon, with that you can send hundreds of leather to an alt within 10 seconds
---
The biggest issue with druid, is there are going to be a ton of people that don't play druid that will attempt to dictate, exactly what role, spec, and gear you should have. They will want to tell you how to play.
---
(This was very common for all the classes in original wow, simply because there were so many people that had no clue what was going on. )  However with druids, it's much more common.  Be prepared to lose loot rolls to everyone, and the group/raid not caring because you didn't bring a "pure" class.
---
That said just like any other class, if you can find a niche of the class you really enjoy then it's going to be fun, and that's all that really matters.
---
The FPS will be BIG.
---
I saw 2 gay people kiss and thought of OP.
---
No they've promised that layering will be completely gone by the time phase 2 comes out so there will definitely be free transfers open from the servers that asmongold and sodapopping are on.
---
What's nice is that you can avoid all that if you want to. Avoid streamer servers, put netflix on your 2nd screen, and level your toon.
---
Or, you can jump on a streamer server and/or run twitch on your favorite streamer and soak up the drama. I feel like there's no wrong way here.
---
Send me a PM on discord :P
---
Get a real job
---
Up to BWL you can do casually. It's AQ40 that fucks up guilds because suddenly everyone needs to farm lots of resist pots and flasks, not just a few key players. Naxx turns it back around in a way, as the trash rewards are still insanely good, though clearing the whole thing is way harder than even aq40.
---
Little Pagolas

Alliance - Mage

---
Venruki is awesome but Sodapoppin was also great. I haven't had so much fun watching a game in 15 years 😀
---
Not sure. I usually wouldn't describe that as griefing since its part of a pvp server.
---
Uhm, no. I click on my scroll wheel, move the mouse \*slightly\* in the direction of the shape I wanna shift in and release the button. It takes getting used to but for me, it's as fast as pressing a button on my keyboard.
---
u/tipsoutbaby worth a thought for next one!
---
It will. Streamers have a built in audience and the biggest impediment community events is getting the snowball rolling but streamers can advertise easily and have a group of people willing to go from the outset.
---
It works though, even though Reddit shits on them, PoE is still fun because there is some player interaction ^{TM} left
---
Fuck you
---
I watch the same "what class should I pick" type of videos each week because I still can't decide. Just gonna go with the flow once classic hits and stick by my choice until level 37 and reroll and be behind the curve 😂😂
---
Thanks. Yea that’s what I figured. I can imagine that you’d think twice before opening on a orc due to the stun resist alone. Just such a shame that the blood fury doesn’t do shit for a lock, then the choice would be pretty obvious though hehe.
---
Well god damn, then orc must becomes better after level 24?
---
I mean since raids are locked behind phases, there really isn't a choice. You'll pvp a lot more while waiting for t3
---
Fuck streamers and their lame attempts to make money (that's all this is) off of the public beta.  WoW is an open world.  You don't get to pull a permit with the WoW police and have a little safe space event.  You'll get trolled just like funerals and every other world event since 2004.
---
My advice is to get comfortable with the thought of having to adabt.
---
You can think up hypothetical scenarios with somewhat accuracy until you're blue in the face. But in the end, you never know how the server you choose will behave.
---
A good mage adapts to the environment.
---
Good points. Thanks for adding.
---
Totally deep wounds it looks like. I get the same effect on Private servers
---
Think about that one, OP, this person has a valid point.
---
Wait what? That’s not the issue that happened at all, there were only a few private server players in the tournament anyway and the best one has almost no gear. Not sure what skills you think don’t translate though lol I’d love to hear about that.
---
Aoe grinding will work best only for those that get way ahead. It'll still be okay for other mages but with competition you'll likely need to resort to quests.

I really couldn’t care less about karma and those weren’t my intentions at all. It’s simply an interesting font that resembles a font used on Warcraft. Stop reading into this.

Fucking baby game

Ah this brings back memories..

Yes that's what I meant!

I thought the class speed boosts were around 20-30% as opposed to the mounts 40%

That had me laughing

Cool. Thanks for the reply. Haha yeah that’s a viable reason too! The fashionista factor is strong.

There's a quest in the barrens where you need to use a horn to summon a lion. Assholes will sometimes wait for you to use it then steal the mob. Forcing you to go back to town to get a new horn.

Sounds like my brother and I will need upgrades. I quit at panda. He just quit with that patch back in Oct?

If you are a druid, bring your lock friend to dungeons. Respawn &gt; port
---
It is hard to watch him for more than a minute
---
Aye. It is likely they will allow free transfers from overpopulated realms to underpopulated ones.
---
Its because it feels bad to earn flying and then suddenly not have it in the next expansion. Its so annoying to complete the same achievement with a new skin every expansion.  Its like interviewing for your own job. The story as to why we can't fly is even stupid. Also, If we (super strong heroes) can't fly why do the weak NPC's get to create flight paths for us.
---
&gt;  is there direct evidence of this?
---
Yes. They put it on the modern wow client in order to only maintain one codebase at a time. Work in software that has to clients and you'll see why this is a necessity almost immediately.
---
You can abandon the furlbog one, but if you abandon the tram quest the flute goes away. No big deal, you can always pick it back up in IF tram, it's not exactly hard to get to.

Input for Furys reading this Topic: 
---
After you're geared in MC/BWL Gear, you ALWAYS want a slow OH aswell! You just put the higher DPS wep into your MH, even if its faster than your OH.
---
Bloodthirst doesn't scale over Wep-Dmg and a fast OH will eat uf your Enrage and Flurry Stacks with a weaker hitting OH than your stronger MH.
---
Considering the sheer amount of rage it generated on pservers where people are generally used to things like this, I can't even imagine how much these sadists will feed off of classic players who go in expecting friendship and nostalgic fun times.

Ah, the subbed that ripped off r/waterniggas

One thing i found very unpleasent when leveling in vanilla was wasting so much time on my proffesions for minimum benefit while leveling. Skipping them this time until 60.

Wait so XP is a fixed value for quests... 3 people would give you 1/3 per mob... and our plans is for her to heal me while I do damage so I'll probably rock a big 2H and depending on when I start being able to do some AOE I could do 2-3 mobs. Also tank healer would be easy for dungeons
---
Everyone tanks this fight as the mechanics dictate tank WILL die. I’m saying you don’t start. With haste + infinite rage a warrior will be fine on threat (especially in tier one gear). Additionally if your not first in line you can brez where if your first you have to be brez’d to brez.
---
how can u feel bad for such a shitty / troll person?
---
No, it didn't its just quarantined.
---
&gt;But you cannot tell me it was to that extent :P
---
Yes, I can tell you that and know it's true.
---
But what would be the point? You are obviously determined to fanboy on the streamers and laud them to high heaven, so nothing I say will convince you, because you are not open to what I am say anyway.
---
&gt;Why would you not want to have that on you Server? xD
---
* Because as outlined above, it's not required
---
* Because I want to avoid the toxicity, fanboy-cults and positive reinforcement of negative personas they bring with them
---
Luckily, for me, Streamers won't be a problem. I live in Europe, and am a native German speaker (Half-German on my mother side), so I will be playing on the German realms, where there are no big streamers :P
---
They didnt nerf them, they hit 50% less than private server
---
Attention for sure, just wants to be an OG.
---
Download the main game and get a trial account, set everything to the absolute minimum and give it a shot. If you can run retail at minimum you can run Classic. I think Ctrl + R is the frame rate shortcut. Post findings here, I'm curious.
---
He's not talking about classic, he's talking about modern, and I'm inclined to agree with him. Mostly because the game is largely fundamentally different than its Classic counterpart. Classic was never completely linear, but tiered areas did create a traffic path for players to follow.
---
Modern WoW is much less limited in how content is discovered, so I think it makes sense to still gate areas behind ground travel but not via connected FPs.
---
Well this wasn't an RP event...
---
It will only impact your experience of you either play on one of their servers or watch their streams. There were already several "celebrity" servers in Vanilla, including Shattered Hand (initially, before they transferred to a more stable server) which had Drama and Death &amp; Taxes, who were often competing for world first kills early on; Mal'ganis, which was the Something Awful Goon Squad server, and later became known for being home for Elitist Jerks; Dark Iron, which was home if the Penny-Arcade and PVP web comics guilds; and after the Leeroy Jenkins video came out, whatever server Pals 4 Life played on saw a lot of traffic from celebrity seekers.
---
But if you didn't play on one of those servers, and often sometimes even if you did play on them, you'd never notice or have it impact your play. Certainly streaming is a bit different, but not by a lot.
---
I'm not a min maxer, I say if they want to do it then fine. I'm a big advocate for play how you want to play but I may as well save him the time when his friends or group members realise he can't maintain threat at all...
---
Because he put a lot of effort into that tourney and the way he lost was really harsh :(
---
You're just a judgemental, petty prick.
---
Make sure you upload your Duel Tournament and Analysis videos so we can all see how it should be done.
---
In which case it's up in the air right now as to what form of the Macro API Classic will end up with. They've started with an 8.x.x macro API but people have been discovering things they've cut out of it. IMHO This will change as beta progresses. We won't have a definite idea of what the Classic Macro API will look like until we get a release candidate.
---
no
---
While I see everyone saying Orc, and that’s what I’m rolling for lore reasons, having an on-demand fear break is actually a big deal. Resisting 1/3-ish of stuns is definitely god-tier, but there will be times when it doesn’t proc and you wish you had a button you could press. You’ll also love wotf when you get feared by another warlock, a warrior, or a priest. 
---
Orc is awesome, but it’s closer than people think. Both have unique advantages in PvP.
---
\&gt; Exactly, there isn't a possibility of getting ahead unless they make it to where each zone is a separate layer... which is what we currently have in BFA and that's sharding. 
---
It is entirely feasible that layering system will work this way - after all CRZ and sharding already work this way in BFA, why remake the system when you can just append some features on top of it - namely just logically group a list of world servers running one instance of every zone in the continent and call that group a "layer". Seamless transitions between world servers have been a thing since at least early 2002 (according to WoW diary by John Staats), so functionally a player would not be able to tell the difference between this arrangement and the presumed standard one - when the entire continent is run on a single world server.
---
In other words, player cap might be higher than you think, provided those players are spread out across different zones.
---
Why don't you just let people play the way they want? "rushing" to 60 still takes like 5 or 6 days. If they choose to optimize their xp for that time instead of jumping around in level 19 wsg then that's their own prerogative.
---
The "10k" servers have insane respawn rates. 10h is a overexertion but it will probably take 3h at least. If i did a exploration run 1-4 for 1h i could be ahead of the curve.(Depends how big the layers are)
---
Armoury link?
---
Screenshots?
---
Anything?
---
Dicking around on a beta server would just temper my excitement for the august release of Classic Wow.
---
Case and point with you.
---
Players choosing UD not to be undead, but to be horde humans, was a mistake.
---
Only if winning can be bought with gold.
---
&gt;Also I don't get how you're "screwing" someone over when bidding on an item.
---
Simple:  
---
If I know you want the item, I will bid on it, just to make you bid higher, and waste your DKP. Then, when the item I was actually waiting for comes up, I have an advantage.
---
He knows
---
&gt;He wasn't wrong
---
Well shut the fuck up then you moron.
---
Do better or fuck off.
---
&gt;This is nothing - on a certain pserver, there were a couple of guys dedicated to keeping Westfall/Redridge quest givers dead 24/7 on rotating sleep schedules.
---
Imagine being this much of a loser. Jesus
---
It'll be like a fucking slide show lol
---
Shit talking a competition and commentators on a game you can't even play...
---
Y I K E S
---
I hate the level increase because it feels like it negates all the work you did to get to max level. 
---
Instead I would like to see more challenging content that takes advantage of the world and the systems they already built. Why not have survival type quests where you need to use cooking, first aid, etc because health regen is turned off. These could be long quests that require traveling to hard to reach locations throughout the world.
---
Also, why not make alts a type of content. Have a high level raid drop be a "soul of a hero", which allows you to roll an alt that will be more powerful than a regular character. The flip side is that dying on a hero makes you lose XP, so leveling will be harder.
---
We are not your 'boys'
---
Don't allow achievement linking/sharing. If implemented, it should not change the gameplay at all except for the person. It should basically be a built-in achievement add-on.
---
Since no one seems to actually be answering OP's question:
---
Yes, the important part is the weapons' damage (not DPS). The weapon being "slow" is a side effect of it.
---
If you have two weapons with 50 DPS, one with 1.00 speed and one with 2.00 speed. The first weapon will be doing roughly 50 damage per hit (1 hit per second) while the second weapon will be doing 100 damage per hit (1 hit every 2 seconds).
---
The "100 damage" from the second weapon is important, because your special skills will use this damage as base. So that's why you eventually will go for slow weapons (not because they are slow, but because their damage per hit is higher).
---
You can do that?? I love it
---
Fucking payo man I love his persona. Grade A troll.
---
You said retail twice. I'm assuming the second one was meant to be classic or vanilla?
---
!remind me 90 days
---
Imagine watching something you don’t enjoy just to appease some random on the internet in 2019
---
Homophobic loser in the 21st century... yay!
---
Yeah, thanks for the reply. Considering the abundance of stuns in relation to the amount of fears that are in the game, you’ll probably get better value from the stun resist in the longrun even though WotF is big if used correctly.
---
What what?
---
Why not bro 😔
---
Thanks for the tip, i will go for it :)
---
&gt;You can’t say they won’t when you don’t know that.
---
Yes I can say that, because I am capable of logic thought. Such interventions require attention and manpower. This costs money.
---
Right now is the marketing phase. The product is set up for a big launch. After launch, marketing is pulled back to normal levels again.
---
They can probably tell how much of an autistic troll you are.
---
Make sure you let us all know what server you join so we can either avoid you or gank the fuck out of you.
---
Abandon is fine. I have the furbolg wand on my retail shaman still.
---
i compare the hardest possible classic dungeon ( BRS, timed strat, scholo) with the hardest possible  retail dungeon.
---
the fact that the classic one barely equals the heroic retail version isn't my problem.
---
&gt;It's a collective effort.
---
not really. unless you mean ''sheep moon sap square'' as a colletive effort. there's no external to be thrown, there's no CD rotation to prepare, there's no interrupt rotation, mob to be stunned... if you go the CC route, you are tank and spanking your way through. 
---
On retail.. and this is something player who haven't pushed M+ have a hard time understanding... you have all of those to care about + the affix... if you don't work as one well-oiled machine on steroid, you'll be dead in no time.
---
and yes, a 6-7 spell rotation is harder than a 1 button rotation.
---
This cracked me up more than it should have.
---
Yup, this is really what it's all about, making sure you have enough for skills and bags. However, if you're in a group or leveling with a guild, it'd be more useful to funnel shit like linen and leathers (or even just half if you use linen for first aid) to one or two people. Basically you'll have guild efforts power leveling enchanting, lw, bs, and tailoring. You'll ensure getting bags and even decent gear pretty damn quick this way.
---
Ganking and PVP is some honorbound right of passage. I used to stand on roofs/hard to reach places all the time. It's WPVP, I'm taking every advantage available
---
Kappa
---
Sounds like Ohio, USA.  One day it's 80 something and the next it's a high of 61.  Every day is a chance of rain.  So enjoying a Classic summer... yeah, OK.
---
Yeah I was disappointed he had so few views when he’s the real expert. Tips should have spent much less time commentating during duels, and just being a hype man between them.
---
0.00001fps and 5days loading time.
---
Too late, my bags are already filled with heavy leather balls
---
Kinda have to pick one or the other.
---
Leveling straight to 60 and then backtrack, or spend longer keeping professions up to your level.
---
Keep in mind nodes won't be 1 hit and done, and aren't shared.
---
A good balance of mining what's on the way to your objective is probably your best bet.
---
But in the end you'll have to choose to take 7-10 days /played or 14+
---
Prot warriors number 2.... yeah, ok.  Seems legit.
---
k.
---
so the vanilla server will be a shadow of the real thing, just like P99 is a shadow of EQ.
---
glad we could clear that up.
---
That is impossible in a hidden bid system. You can't bid higher when you don't know what i'm bidding. If you bid higher you get the item.
---
Remember to start with the economy is going to be very short on gold so an item that might sell well in 3 months plus probably won't get so much at launch simply cos no one has the gold. 
---
Personally I'm going to try swap/trading items that don't fit my character whenever I can. Cloth green on a mail wearer? Find a clothy with a mail drop or a weapon. Barter well and you should improve easy of leveling with no gold cost.
---
&gt;5 or 6 days.
---
You mean /played, right? Without massive sharing of accounts so that it's being played 24 hrs a day, this isn't possible.
---
What the fuck kind of a stat is Versatility?
---
Jesus retail has turned into a clisterfuck.
---
There are always people willing to “waste time” while playing. Just got to find them. Hopefully with the extra means of communication today it will be easier.
---
So many missed voidwalker sacs and throwing up coa instead of corruption on a mage to stop bandages while sheeped.  Is Venruki going to decurse?  Hmm I don't know?   Also starting with the fel hunter seemed like a misplay.  He should have gone voidwalker and only gone fel hunter if he was able to get the mage low on mana to prevent a reset.  If he would have gone voidwalker in that duel he would have had fel dom back up in time for the end.
---
Where the hell were they fighting? Below something like sw bug?
---
thanks you for your honesty.
---
Classic is only challenging for people who never bothered removing the training wheels on retail.
---
It depends. I loved flying around with my Ironbound protodrake before everyone had it. Especially when we were all on it as a guild.
---
Damn after reading your comment I did some searching because I remember UBRS as a 15 man dungeon and it looks like it will only be 10 man for WOW classic.
---
Why go sit in a football stadium when you can just watch it on TV?
---
You are right, i thought they would be PPM.
---
PvE servers exist for a reason.
---
&lt;Shut Up and Color&gt;[NA][Horde][PvP]
---
We are a semi-hardcore raiding and PvP guild planning on weekend raiding, world PvP, battleground premades, and twinking (29 bracket). Our guild is primarily 30+ adults who have played various games together going back to vanilla and TBC. 
---
Raids: Saturday and Sunday 3pm to 7pm EST / 12pm to 4 pm PST (very likely we won't need this much time once we get some gear until AQ). Optional weeknight raids for 3 day reset content may also be planned. 
---
Loot: Loot Council consisting of 2 officers and 3 rotating positions filled by raiders. 20 man content and PvP items will be /roll. 
---
Expectations: We want to complete raid content efficiently to not waste people's time. We expect raiders to be on time with appropriate consumables in a PvE raiding spec. We would like to start raiding 1.5-2 months after launch. 
---
Recruiting: We are currently recruiting all classes/roles. We are looking for people interested in any or all of our guild activities, as well as more casual players just looking for some people to run dungeons and bgs with. 
---
Current raid needs:
---
Prot warrior: closed
---
Fury warrior: medium
---
Druid: closed
---
Shaman: closed
---
Holy/disc priest: low
---
Shadow priest: closed
---
Hunter: low
---
Rogue: low
---
Warlock: medium
---
Mage: low

Snapshotting exists in vanilla. It was removed at the end of Mists of Pandaria.
---
If you’re putting numbers of hours in the thousands up, you have more than enough time for both lol
---
The thing is, if overpowering a given fight isn't possible, no matter what you do, then you're kinda defeating the point of an RPG with character development. If my character gets stronger, fights have to become easier because of it.
---
When you stuff every other fight full of instakills, percent damage and similar mechanics to counter the fact that character progression exists, you no longer have an RPG, you created a Jump'n Run with extra steps.
---
Which, btw. is exactly how retail Mythic Raids feel at times.
---
The rogues corpse ran past your rain of fire spam and now they are waiting for the right moment to rez and disrupt the duel for 1-2 seconds before they get killed again.
---
And its funny when you apply this to other genres as well.   
---
Look at the small subset of people that want the Soulsborne games altered to be "easier". It would defeat the very thing that makes those games so good. 
---
Obviously there ARE QoL changes that took place that would be good overall to the health of the game mechanically but its hard to tell what small changes effect the community interaction which is the precious part of the game.
---
fair enough
---
AFAIK AAP is being worked on to function for classic.
---
As soon as you stop playing to sleep or whatever you'll be behind the pack. Coming from private server launches, you can't keep up with the thousand or so people that seemingly have no life. 5 hour days for 3 or 4 days will ensure you'll be in zones surrounded by people. You need to play minimum 18 hours a day to stay ahead.
---
This is why I roll my eyes at people talking about being behind the pack. What we're talking about is the situation for the first week of launch. Everyone will be spread out after that week and it won't even matter if you took the couple minutes to send mail to an alt for extra gold.
---
30 within the first 24 hours is crazy speed leveling. I don't even know if that's possible without any competition.
---
I hope so-
---
It is a game after all, you are supposed to have fun. I guess we will have to wait and see!
---
Griefing is against the TOS. It has been multiple cases with similar type of trolling which Blizzard has dealt with. One clear example was the people who spent all day blocking mailboxes on their mount. Just think about that, most of your day consists of logging on a game just to block mailboxes.
---
I’d start with a Hunter maybe.  Go slow.  Enjoy the ride. WoW Classic is meant to be savored
---
Most people opt for the fishing pole first,
---
Then use Hydrocane from gnomer, and the crafted cloth belt (forgot it's name) to make up for lost trinket.
---
The mechanic you are refering to is called "Snapshotting", and yes, this is exactly how DoTs worked in Vanilla, and will work in Classic.
---
Plot twist: it's the gravestone of vanilla and we are all waiting for it to make it back to its corpse and respawn.
---
are you planning on raiding? If thats the case i wouldnt expect to get full duration on your DoTs
---
Am I remembering incorrectly that back in early Vanilla, there were only non-stop flights? This meant that if you wanted to go from Tanaris to Winterspring, you had to click, fly, land in Theramore, click, fly, land in Ashenvale, click, land, etc. etc? Maybe I'm just remembering not having sufficient paths discovered to make the full journey?
---
No need to be rude for the sake of it
---
Play undead so I can be more of a special orc-snowflake.
---
Vanilla Wow did  fast travel perfect and it made the world feel huge,  perfect combination of Mount riding, flight path, zeplines, boats and hearth stones. There are tools to make it easier ,like portals and summons, but they both have their pros and cons and isn't an instant "travel wherever you want in the world at one click". If you're in say Tanaris at and want to get to Swamp of Sorrows you know you have a  journey ahead of you. And when the game was new I remember actually having to learn the routes. There were places that seemed impossible to get to. 
---
I really dig  that you're flying over the world as well , such a brilliant design choice. The traveling in vanilla is just genius, can't say enough positive things about it.
---
So why didn't you just take a picture of the "W" for your 15 upvotes?
---
Did you realize that this stone was for children? Isabella May who died at 5 and Emily Lorence who died at age 2. 
---
This is a terrible post to begin with because lets be honest "Holy crap guys look at this WoW "W" I found today." is pretty shitty content but karma whoring dead children is just scummy.
---
undead.
---
The tourney just ended and an undead mage beat an undead warlock, there will of forsaken was very important in the duels
---
Logical thought would dictate that blizzard would still intervene when their streamers with thousands upon thousands of viewers are doing something and it gets “ruined”. Live or beta doesn’t change that.
---
Saying “oh it’s beta is different” isn’t something based in logical thought. Especially considering the bug/exploit used to get to the dueling area. Beta is kinda for finding bugs/exploits not marketing.
---
Hey guys!
---
I've been playing WoW on and off since 2007 and I'm thinking of getting my sub again when vanilla hits.  
---
At the moment I've playing on private servers but I think it's not the same thing and I'll play on retail as soon as it hits.
---
I've been maining a resto shaman since I started playing but I don't know what to play now. I'll be a casual player.
---
I've watched some videos and I got undecided in 4 main classes: Warrior (mostly for PVP, but I can learn how to tank) , Warlock (since it's easy to level), Mage (good DPS and at PVP), and Shaman (resto ofc :p).
---
Can someone talk a bit about your experiences with these classes so I can settle down my choices ?
---
Thanks everyone :)
---
Orc. Hands down.
---
I was an Undead throughout Vanilla, always regrettet it. Orcs have better visuals (especially females), and superior racials.
---
L o l
---
Don't over value Stam. As long as you have enough health to survive until the next top up from your healer then you have enough health.
---
Thank you fellow human.
---
Every 40 man raid will have multiple druids.  You'll be fine.
---
This doesn't work. I tried it in the stress test and as soon as you leave the tram it stops working.
---

---
No its moins guard goldshire, this server is the Most fucked of all of them
---
Theyd afk while doing it so it didnt fost them anything. And you could zoom in to click on it regardless.
---
Ja also ;D
---
I´m not watching any streamers besides some of the Events on YouTube. 
---
I will be playing German realms too.
---
I´m just really pissed off by a lot of People hating on literally every move they make just because they find a Little Detail that may be bad. But ignoring all other Details that are amazing.
---
It wouldn´t have so much Attention if People didn´t like it.
---
And I want to see a single Server that had several big Events each week.
---
I am very open to opinions and was about to leave the whole discussion with the comment like 2-3 comments ago where I was about to write a 20line answer... But I got Kind of pissed by your answer :D
---
I know there was Events on realms in classic. And I know it is even easier to do nowadays. 
---
But I also know for a fact that it is way easier for a streamer who already has 10k + People watching him at that given time. 
---
And there is literally nothing you can say to Change my opinion on that. Streamers can do it easier, quicker and more effective.
---
Not saying that it is better or funnier. 
---
I´m not fanboying anyone really - there is no one to fanboy :D - I like that Expression though.
---
Also you have just brought no other Argument since the beginning so what should be convincing me? xD
---
We are obiously both German dudes, that are just bored, don´t really have an opinion and just like to argue about shit :P
---
I am at least - and I usually opt for the side that has the better arguments IMO. This time it was the "streamer fanboys" side...
---
I would Change my mind if you could give some proper arguments :O
---
I liked one from another thread about the scarab Lord literally not being obtainable for a normie on a streamer Server... That is a great argument that could Change peoples mind
---
THis will change come live and we have guilds
---
Destromath US. Daish got the tabard. He would always spam "Daish Daish Daish" in chat. He moved on to Oceanic servers once those became a thing and I believe he was well known there for similar antics as well.
---
Not an apt comparison. The models will be low poly, and the textures low resolution.
---
Still, MacBooks suck for gaming in general.
---
Unless you're Canadian.
---
The typing starting at 8:00 triggered me when he was still doing it 40 seconds later.
---
You sure about that?
---
what about scholomance and stratholme?
---
&gt; That is distorting the game.
---
Patch 1.12 is the real distortion.  Classic will suck ass.   It will be more faceroll than retail lfr.
---
Woops, I think i got some things mixed up, thx
---
Not sure how sad your life is currently for you to look at everything in such a pessimistic way, would it make you feel better if this post was deleted? You're clearly focusing on the wrong thing here and that's your right.
---
thanks, edited. lol
---
&gt;Saying “oh it’s beta is different” isn’t something based in logical thought.
---
I am saying "it's the primary marketing phase".  
---
If you try argueing with me, use arguments, not Strawmen.
---
I NEED THAT
---
I agree. I don’t mind when they do bad things. But keeping it as a B roll is best.  I just like Nathanos. Even when he’s being mean to me. I like him.
---
What faction will the guild be ???
---
Played on a server with 2 guilds competing for world firsts but mainly US firsts.  It was definitely fun.  All the other guilds competed for "server 2nd" as the two top tier guilds were in a league of there own.  They'd snipe US 1st and 3rd kills, then the rest of the guilds were all top 200-500 killers. 
---
Before cross-realm battlegrounds, the Raid or Guild leaders were warriors.  Full T1 with T1 healing support.  It was intimidating as hell.  The first time I got kill by them, it was like being star struck.  Then over the course of a few months, some emote taunting, and a few kills on them, a nice friendly rivalry forms.
---
Internal testing isn't that useful, really.  You need people who'll use the product like it's going to be used, not like some guys know it "should" be used (worse when it's a game and they might not be that good at it).
---
It's also remarkably silly to hire people and force them to not play the game.  If anything shows how stupid "world not-so-first" races can be, that idea, in a nutshell, does.  No one would do that.  It's a remarkably daft idea.
---
It's not a "huge gesture of good will to the community" to risk handing them a messy game just for end game content, especially as they haven't done that for years, and the few people who are pissy that they can't get a bug-riddled environment aren't really worth risking upsetting the majority by handing them a product that's broken.
---
Maybe you should stop gasping so you can take in enough air to think logically rather than gasping for air so much and coming up with ridiculous ideas that are obviously bad in order to come up with a way to do something that absolutely 100% doesn't need to be done.
---
Especially with WoW Classic.  This is the dumbest place to be making this argument.  This is 15 year old content!  There's no "advantage" gained here.  The content existed before.  There's strategy guides and videos.  Thousands, possibly millions, of people have already done the raids and endgame content.  What, are people going to be such morons that they'll then demand that anyone who played the game when it was first out isn't allowed into WoW Classic "for x amount of time?"  Even though that's most of the people who are wanting to play it?  Cool, so Classic's dead on arrival, because heaven forbid someone plays it who's seen the endgame content.  But it's okay, because blocking most of the people who want to play it from being able to play it in order to preserve the sanctity of the World 10,287th Race is "a huge gesture of good will to the community."
---
I have worked around software I am a System Engineer. They could have forked at 7.x and backported bug/security fixes or they could both (retail and beta) be building from a more recent code base to the 8.x and 1.13 clients.
---
I'm asking if there is direct evidence is all, not just conjecture. As folks are saying "It is built from the 8.x client" or "it is built from the 7.x client". If they are stating this they must have evidence of the fact.
---
We’ll see. I am positive there will be some people (like Joana) playing 16 hours a day and following leveling routes that get them 4 days /played. Several guilds have been talking about their hardcore people hitting 60 in a week of real time.
---
Im subed since 2005 i even bought wod ans never played it
---
Is there a pic?
---
I get what you’re saying and cudos to you for trying to see the positive aspects big streamers may have. But these kind of shenanigans happens even without big streamers. There will be guilds having these kind of events as a extra to a raid or insted of a raidnight. But ofc, it’s nice that people who are not committed to a guild like this still have the chance to take part in fun events like this through big streamers!
---
Bitching about gankers is not really less pathetic.
---
Well, there are going to be plenty of losers with time on their hands, and those losers feed off of rage and complaints.
---
If the average classic player isn't prepared for that, they're going to have a bad time.
---
Used one you ignored it. Prime marketing phase or not (its the latter). Beta is for testing and reporting bugs/exploits.
---
Truth. The modern API is a lot more secure
---
You'll find add-ons available for the majority of your needs (timers, minimap skins, DPS meters etc) but imo, there are some add-ons that are considered essential.
---
Aggro meters were critical for raiding as keeping an eye on threat is essential, even as a healer! Tanks aren't able to mass aoe taunt a whole dungeon and some don't even have a taunt! 
---
Other essentials for me include EZ dismount, which automatically dismounts you before combat as this wasn't a built in option in early vanilla.
---
I assume the title translates to "What tree will you have the majority of your points in". 
---
Still, it's hard to say what I would "main" since I'll be constantly swapping specs between Raid and PvP in the longrun.
---
I might be interested, planing on going shammy or priest right now, but could be convinced to go druid. I do plan on leveling at my own pace, but if I had a group I could push a little. Going alchemy and herbing
---
Bread..?
---
From what I was reading they will be 5 man
---
The weapon speed used to actually matter in the equation but has been normalized.  So you used to get more damage from a higher base damage and a slower weapon (double dipping into the slower weapons) which is why most people still say slow.  You might still want a 'fast' offhand as a rogue to apply poisons faster though.  As the damage from the weapon is nerfed already but the poison application isn't nerfed it can work out that a lower dps fast weapon is better in the off hand for a rogue.
---
I loved doing that!
---
I doubt it, for a while. Eventually they will probably make 1-10 free since that's probably the equivalent of 1-20 retail.
---
Do you have any examples? I haven't noticed anything yet
---
The dark satisfaction of ganking lowbies on the other faction to fuel the hate war, of course
---
I heard you can turn in rugged leather (1200....) to darkmoon faire to get a nice pre-raid BIS necklace for rogue/war/hunter
---
Do you not know about other languages? Or Accents? What is going on?
---
You’re so weird. Clearly the attention seeker needed punishing. Man up
---
orc, you have a trinket for fear, warlock trinket does not work on stuns
---
Was watching monkeynews' stream during the dueling tournament and one of the hunters was fucking around with his pet attacking him, when the pet retreated mn attempted to taunt, but it didn't attack.
---
Not sure if this is a bug on beta, but currently by the logic what you stated shouldn't work.
---
Yikes. I thought I was being a bit of a jerk when I would go to Freewind Post on my high-level Pally, kill the 20-30 hordies, and then run away from the counter-gank squad by jumping off the cliff with my bubbles. (Hilariously, sometimes high level chasers would jump off after me, thinking they could survive).
---
But now I can see that I was one of the nice ones.
---
Didn't get a beta invite so I am not sure which parts of the engine are new and which are old. I know about the water graphics and I know we use the old textures for a lot of the models, but I am unsure on the load it has on your GPU
---
&gt; I'm asking if there is direct evidence is all, not just conjecture
---
They have stated that they used the modern client. They have no stated specifically which build.
---
But the ENTIRE point of using the modern client is so that they woudn't have to maintain two codebases. By not using the same one that retail uses, they'd STILL have to maintain two codebases. That is terrible practice and defeats the entire purpose.
---
Either they are using the same client as retail or they defeating the entire purpose of marrying the old data to an arbitrary client.
---
We aren't just wildly guessing lol.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

It's still one month of summer.
---
Please bug-report it.
---
But then you can murder them
---
Gankers are just as a mixed bag as any other group of players in terms of skills, hell I wouldn't be surprised if the gankers actually are better at PVP because that's what they do all day, though many of the lack gear,  which is more important than skills  in vanilla. Also on private servers ganking  alts is very popular (like a lvl 20 alliance in stonetalon). A lot of the ganking community just enjoy the overall chaos and fun of world PVP, slaying a couple of low lvls for a good hour, take down the hero lol 60 that comes to save them, run to another zone etc. 
---
Then you have people like Redridge and whitegrape who just wants to see the world burn.
---
If the pet is on passive, taunt won't work.
---
I 100% recommend skinning since you're going to be killing the mobs anyway, vendor all the leather for easy extra gold to get that 60% mount. If you have enough gold to get that mount immediately at 40 it's a huge time saver. 
---
Mining will be way harder to level at launch and engi is a straight up gold sink. The engi PVP bonuses are nice but what's nicer is being a higher level than the enemy. Plus, no honor for a few months, no battleground for months more. Come back and level mine/engi when you have your mount.
---
It's a soft vanish, hard vanish for stealth classes
---
BFA BAD
---
CLASSIC GOOD
---
I selected war mode, but with one caveat: There should be war mode servers.  Alongside PvE and PvP, which are the true classic experience.  My friend group has always been today between PvE and PvP, so a war mode server would be ideal for us.  But it should only be an option on specific servers.
---
I think this is a similar post to one before which was “what will you miss from retail”. I can’t even remember if multiloot was a thing in vanilla or you had to loot each mob. Little things like that would be a benefit but I’m more than happy with absolutely no changes
---
Blizzard has already come out and said paid transfers will be a feature in classic wow.  From the way they said it, it seems like it will be available immediately as a paid feature right in the game, similar to how retail works.
---
I know you aren't just wildly guessing, but folks are stating "It's built from X.X version number" show us evidence.
---
I completely agree it is built from a recent code base (this was stated in videos and I am not disagreeing there), from which version we do not know unless the info comes from blizzard or a leak.
---
That’s true, but since the resist is a proc, not a button you can mash, there will be times when RNG puts you on a really bad run and you might get extremely salty haha.
---
It was hilarious when he raged like a child after losing in the duel tournament.
---
That's why you add /train to the strongest rank 😎
---
Apparently the old wall jumping was in patch 2.0.1, not in 1.12
---
Transmog is literally the only thing I'm going to miss like crazy in classic... I hate it when my char looks like shit just because the item is good =/
---
Works everytime
---
Pretty sure he was just ball parking a number, no reason to take that number seriously
---
It was fine for a little while, but it got to the point where you couldn’t even log into the game or get to a flightmaster without getting infected. It stopped being fun when it prevented you from playing; at that point, I just logged out until it was over.
---
That would be really smart if they did it at launch and when layering is removed, anyone that doesn't want to sit in a 6 hour queue everyday can transfer :)
---
Well He Just got Luck. There are lot of clips where he get crushed by random warlocks. Seems good played Warlock is prob.the best
---
Because their belief is that the only game is the end-game. And that is what Blizzard focused around. The retards who sees leveling as a tutorial are partly responsible for making the game shit. And going into classic with the same mindset as in BFA is retarded.
---
You feel me brah?
---
Those are pretty cool as well, and they finally started to fix the mistake of not making these items in BFA
---
Yeah I agree. But it was pretty good for being the first time, and tips is definitely good as being the hype man. And TV channels often do the same in other sports, where they will have 2 commentators; one expert and one more mainstream guy. So if they just work a little more with the balance between the two, this could be a pretty good team.
---
Not pretending anything, nor assuming anything.
---
Did Blizzard say anything about populations on servers? Yes/no
---
You do you but I know what I consider best by a country mile.
---
&gt; I completely agree it is built from a recent code base
---
This is not what I said. I stated my reasons it would be the SAME client as retail wow. It is ridiculous to assume that they would even entertain using a random client other than the MOST recent one. The ENTIRE point of moving to a modern client was to AVOID maintaining two clients.
---
IF they didn't use the SAME one as retail wow, then they'd still have to maintain two clients. Very basic stuff mate.
---
People who have have multiple 60s are a special kind of crazy
---
Solo content on a pure healing build is hard, I did it back in the day. This time, I'm going to try a [Smite spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsV0oZfxt0MbVZx), which really is just 2 more points in the holy tree. If that doesnt work, im just giving up and going Shadow until I start raiding.
---
As a healspec, you will be agressively hunted for groups, which can make you some money. Not amazing money, but a bit.
---
Having a big audience in-game is part of the fun.  
---
/u/tipsoutbaby just hold the next one in a contested area and bribe/ask a pack of max-level hunters to snipe anybody griefing or entering the dueling area.
---
He did Not got banned. They Just say so, to make people Thing they Care. But He was on again, so.
---
Hey your mistakes aren't that bad. At least you knew taunt existed, and slow 1H has some situational benefits.
---
When I first tanked on my druid, I thought growl was the main skill to use, so I ONLY spammed that.
---
I also didn't know about weapon trainers so I leveled my rogue to ~40 as combat daggers using sinister strike. Always getting the fastest daggers because fast hits = killing fast. I didn't even get improved ss because rogues are supposed to dodge, right?
---
Yep. He Just was online.
---
But this is level 30, a powerspike for mage.
---
Unlucky : I have never received tier 1 shaman shoulders. That was my main in vanilla, both retail and private servers, and both of which i raided hardcore. I started playing November 23, 2004.
---
Okay, thank you for your reply! 
---
It will be nice to see non-super-hardcore guilds that do things for fun! If that is the case, I definitely aspire to be part of one.

**&lt;IRONFIST&gt; -- Horde -- PvP -- Casual Adult -- North America Central Standard Time**
---
I'm not going to waste your time with some over hyped thread, instead here are some key points, and if you are interested, Join our discord.   
---
* We are casual but that does not mean we slack off. We fully intent to raid, see all the content when is arrives and PvP
---
* Since we are adults, we have no time for toxic people. If you want to join a guild and intent to be an ass-hat, sorry we are not for you.
---
* We are using a DKP system for loot
---
* When not raiding, we intend to run dungeons, PvP and other things that bring back the sense on community that has been missing for so many years in WoW
---
Feel free to join Discord and ask more questions, or to join us: www.ironfist-gaming.com

Problem is the item gush in retail.  I quit in Cata/Mop, from what I remember, you'd get 100 items at level 60 in the first day.  100's of items, perfectly itemized.
---
Vanilla you spend a lot more time leveling.  Casuals will spend 3-12 months just leveling their first 60.  Some of these items are relevant for weeks or months because of the messiness of itemization.  They streamlined gearing and itemization over the years, and like flying mounts and LFG system, it slowly took away from the overall experience. 
---
I used carrot on a stick and some AOE poison trinket with 30 minute cooldown for like 6 months in Vanilla because the trinket was one of the rarest slots while leveling.
---
tank hardest and funnest. I could never dps too boring. Healing felt more important but almost as simple, yet allowed some strategy

Literally Satan
---
You can do it but you're going to need really good gear or really good healer. Without holy shield you're going to be taking a lot of crushing blows.
---
Yeah, I get that but at the same time it's also nice to not see everyone running around with the same 6 transmogs.
---
I swear in Legion every DH looked exactly the same.
---
Well, as a clicker it's literally impossible to use mouseover macros, so I recommend already being used to keybind.
---
That's the issue. You'll generally outlevel an area before being done with its resources so if you plan to race to 60 it's not ideal.
---
Personally, leveling can be exhausting in vanilla and it's good to spend some time on professions as a change of scenery. Who knows what the early economy will be like too..
---
Is there a resource detailing good exploration paths? Or do you literally just run around and hope to tag some flightpaths on the way too?
---
Can you link a vod?
---
? Deathwing didn’t destroy the original Stormwind. That was the Old Horde during The First War. Deathwing’s only work during the Orc/Human wars was to pretend to be a Lordaeron noble and fuck with the alliance, to give the Horde dragons, and help the Horde with the portal towards the end of the war.
---
https://youtu.be/RAKvIx6eQpA
---
I played a lock orc when the game came out but only because i liked the look better.
---
UD racials are better imho. Orc never gets "better".
---
The Calendar, if they're removing it.
---
Both are good in their own ways. Undead has the edge in fights that have fear/charm/sleep effects. Orcs have the edge in fights where stuns are a factor. It depends on what pvp situations you find yourself in the most. 1v1 is where racials tend to make the difference. For group pvp it doesn't really matter since your team comp and coordination matter more than specific racials.
---
I'm definitely happy with no changes, but would also be happy with changes that didn't affect the actual game play. AoE looting is actually something I had taken for granted and forgotten it wasn't in classic.
---
Pretty sure the people who were ruining the tourney were streamer fans. Of course some of them would be spergs.
---
Choosing the wrong faction.
---
well, its too far a run, from Mulgore to Org! ;D
---
perplexity won against ziqo - there are a few clips out there
---
Absolutely.
---
Though If you go 20 points in Prot you may as well go 21 and get BoSanc so you can provide an additional blessing to your raidgroup that other paladins will have.
---
Don't worry about Reckoning as prot - your threat and damage comes from judgement, consecrate and reflected damage from Ret aura, BoSanc and Holy Shield if you have it. You wont have Holy Shield but that's expensive in mana and for five mans it just means you'll be able to use an extra Consec for every Holy Shield you don't pop.
---
As you wont be raid-tanking as a paladin you dont need to worry about crits, just wear high stamina spellpower plate (T2 Judgement is pretty much the perfect five man tank armor) so the lack of crits wont be an issue and you'll have plenty of Redoubt procs.
---
Just make sure to have a way of replenishing mana - would recommend being Alch/Herb to make your own mana pots as all protadins are very mana intensive in Classic.
---
Don't worry about losing Holy Shock, its on a 30 sec CD in classic so isnt super vital as it's also very mana expensive. Having BoSanc for the raid will be more beneficial as long as you have 30 points in Holy to heal as well as the "pure" holydins.
---
You said they were weak, they are definitely not weak if played correctly.
---
Horde player here looking to experience the raids I didn't get to the first time around.
---
Probably going Priest or shaman but could be open to druid but at any rate im healing 
---
Also going Herbing and Alchemy to be a potion machine

looking for a fun semi hardcore or casual guild

Ill probably take my time leveling but would push if needed

&lt;Adventures and Consequences&gt; North American Alliance West Coast / PvE Realm
---
About us: &lt;Adventures and Consequences&gt; is going to be a casual PvE guild, we're recruiting players just to have an awesome time with WoW Classic and casually progress through content. There will not be any sourt of pressure to reach max level, we all have lives that come first and will be the priority. The raids we do will likely be half pugged. We're coming to this game to have a great time and try to pursue loot without destroying our lives. That being said, this will be a mature guild, under 18s are allowed but must understand that we won't heavily censor ourselves around them (Though harrassment isn't acceptable).
---
PvP focused players are welcome to gather here, though the leadership isn't planning on focusing on PvP much more than the occasional BG.
---
There is not currently a set raid schedule but end of week (Wed-Fri) is the most likely direction we will take this in with maybe a pickup on Sunday or Monday, the leadership is based in the west coast region of the United States.
---
If you'd like to find out more feel free to DM me, Discord is Takerofsoles#2742. I check discord a lot more frequently than reddit. There isn't any formal application process but I would like to just speak to you before I hand out invites to the Discord server.
---
&gt;  I am sure mythic raiding is harder than anything classic can create
---
&gt; with fake difficulty
---
&gt; I want a dungeon to feel like a group achievement
---
some consistency and logic would be nice...
---
&gt; No one gets that feeling in retail
---
except people who actually try to push themselve , in raid or M+...
---
Reckbombs will not be the same, no. Will someone find a workaround, possibly. For now, it seems to not be possible. As for tanking dungeons, it should be possible yes. I am thinking about going this same build when classic hits.
---
It wasn't, and you did.
---
Ah yes, the driveby slaps.
---
Excellent post my friend
---
Snutz had multiple misplays, but congrats to Venruki. Zero mistakes, maximum punish.
---
Lock should win that fight
---
Exactly
---
The 5% pet damage is negligible. In pve the pet will be sacrificed or the imp with be phased for the stam buff. In pvp, the pets are just used for their abilities or slowing casters with auto attacks. 
---
Who knows though? Maybe the private servers pet damage numbers were jacked and the imp is beastly.
---
In 5 mans you wont be taking these as they arent raidbosses. They'll still take crits but these should be less impactful. Just make sure to use highish item level plate with stamina on. If they're raiding as holy then T2 Judgement is superb for tanking 5mans in.
---
There will be many more things you’ll try to do in classic and it just won’t be there. Even flight paths could be problematic, I can’t remember if you could fly all the way from the top of the map to the bottom on a single click or you need to make 8 smaller journeys. Little things like that I’m excited to learn if it’s in or not
---
Wait do you get flight points right away on retail?
---
Now thats a list!
---
No, but most people who care about server community would rather see it go to a top end guild rather than someone who can yell loudly at a screen.
---
Barbershop with all original hairstyles would be fine. 
---
People saying AOE looting are flat-out wrong. Less time taken looting stuff = less time taken in open, dangerous territory, giving you the chance to move on from a spot much faster. Might not sound like much but it will add up. Changes gameplay and should *not* make it in.
---
Responsibility is hard right?
---
What if you're horde ?
---
To classic? Almost none, all small changes will have an impact. 
---
- Auto dismount when casting a spell.
---
- Able to take flightpaths without dismounting first.
---
- The new UI for proffessions
---
- New ( and Imo better ) macro system
---
Lol, the BETA VIP streamers flipping off the plebs
---
if people are personally harassing you then i am sorry, idk if thats what you are trying to say exactly. If they are not personally attacking you what i have to say is this.
---
people are gonna use a lot of different words, especially in the online world, i find choosing not to let things bother you, woiuld grant you the most peace and enjoyment, rather than reporting everyone and never really being able to play the game. Most people will stop said behavior if you say hey im gay btw (if they start say f@gg@t and such). IF they start personally harassing you then its a reportable offense and they are jerks.
---
My last guild had 2 openly gay men and i dont think anyone disliked them or treated them differently
---
If you put this macro on your bar in keybind 1 slot, but have shift 1 bound to another slot &amp; spell....what happens?
---
Plus Ven and Ziqo run the bakery together. All around positive vibes.
---
Just macro it with cheap shot/garrote/ambush etc
---
Not showing the actual dock gates in the Westfall/STV transition zone / 10
---
AFAIK you can't even buy it under lvl 120 :3
---
Is the equipment manager gone? I’m pretty sure I had a macro for my ‘transmog’ set in vanilla. This was just a set that I literally put on running around IF to look cool before putting on my pve gear
---
Druid tanking is difficult, as you wont find a raid that wants one
---
I can't I wasn't invited to the beta, only to the stress-test.
---
There were definitely unconnected paths.  So yeah, you'd have to have a layover somewhere sometimes.  Nothing as crazy as 8 tho, I don't think.
---
As a skinner can I say people that run through area's killing skinnable mobs , then never looting them so the cant be skinned  ARE THE DEVIL THEMSELVES.
---
There's an script to autoloot within the macro tho.
---
Windfury procs out the ass in the 3rd place fight lol, extremely good RNG, for most of the tournament
---
&gt;You could make your same exact argument for a Blizzard Subscription that included every Blizzard game for 100$/month. "You're getting more than ever before and it's your own fault if you don't want to play them. 
---
You're ignoring half of my point with your idiotic example, and I'm not sure whether you're being intentionally obtuse or if you're actually this fucking stupid.  Your suggestion involves raising the price more than six times, while the reality is the price is starting exactly the fucking same.
---
If you truly believe replacing a $15 subscription with a $100 subscription is the same as offering more content for the same $15 subscription, you might actually be retarded in the most clinical sense of the word.
---
MC, ZG and Onyxia should be doable by all guilds who can make up the numbers.
---
They all have pieces that would interest those classes depending on spec. For MC it would most be rings/weapons as the tier 1 set pieces are pretty poop for casters. Tier 2 sets are good for just about everyone so getting your helm and pants from Ony/Rag is worth. ZG has a bunch of decent caster loot with a wand, dagger and rings.
---
BWL is probably first gate for inexperienced raiders with a couple of challenging fights.
---
Related:
---
Try to get a feel for the aggro range of mobs. That way you can maximize your movement speed by stealthing just outside the aggro range. This will save you a lot of time as stealth is EXTREMELY slow in classic (rank 1-4: 50/40/35/30% \[lvl 1/20/40/60\] movement speed reductions).
---
well you may want to let them know that Classic is 1.12 not "when it was released"
---
its basically the most refined version of vanilla
---
It a really good change for the game, but putting that into classic will have an inpact. Solo low level dungeon runs for cloths or greenies will be way faster. Therefore I'm not a fan. Fast loot mamagement is a skill.
---
It's also unfair to conclude that 1v1's, while showing individual skill, vanilla as a whole is based on MASS gameplay. I mean, look at world bosses, AQ event, Devilsaur Farming, Felwood in general...
---
Alot of ignorant people spewing banter on both sides don't realize that this 30 tourney means literally nothing. The GROUP/RAID play matters. That's what gets you the rank 14, the securing of world boss kills and farming zones for top spots on raid clears. You watch the streams with raid groups fighting over something of great value, like AGM for instance in the beta, that is the essence of vanilla.
---
Bde
---
A downsized is accidentally setting off and remembering you forgot something.
---
So you settle down for the hour long flight...
---
It's actually a very stat based on how impactful it is on both damage and survivability
---
people say wow is dying because 4milion is a far cry from 12 or w.e peak was.
---
Part of that is that you're the hero in retail, and you aren't in Classic, so you shouldn't always look like one, unless you've actually collected sets.
---
Do you wanna raid in your 80's ?
---
...
---
The answer is yes.
---
I'm pretty sure resist does pull you out. Source: it pulled me out last night in the beta in arathi.
---
You definitely needed to hoof it in some places. Even in BC you needed to go to STV to reach the lower half of the map as horse IIRC
---
So because I decide to have some pvp fun I deserve to get camped level 1 with literally 0 chance of ever fighting back or having any fun. Stop justifying being an asshole
---
Mate, it's all about Ryzen these days. An intel inside might not cut it anymore.
---
Oof, forgot about that.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Why the hell would you do that tho
---
Gatekeepers like you ruin this game.
---
You're devil!
---
1v1 a fear, charm or poly is crippling. In an organized group most fears and charms can be despelled, whereas a a 5 second kidney means a dead lock.

**\[EU\] \[A\]&lt;Da Krew&gt; Casual PvE guild recruiting!**
---
Da Krew is a multigaming community with roots in many games, and we are looking to come to the world of Azeroth for some chill and fun raiding in classic! 
---
Our goal is to give a laid back atmosphere for people to enjoy the classic raids in, while progressing steadily. However, the experience is the main priority, rather than progression.
---
We are a core of a mix of old timers and new timers in the context of WoW, but all have a passion for classic WoW, and we’re advocates of it since even before the time of Nostalrius. 
---
We will raid twice a week, for 3 hours each, with many optional alt days for the non-40 man raids, as well as dungeon runs and 10 man dungeon runs.
---
**What can we offer?**
---
We will offer a mature, but fun atmosphere, and want to allow people to build the community that Classic had over BfA. We will also provide aid to new and veteran players alike, during leveling and gearing. 
---
**What do we expect?**
---
We expect laid back but mature players. We wont be pushing to kill the bosses in the hardest time, instead we want to have fun with the game, so we are looking for players who also have this mindset. Attendance to raids is expected, and we will still ask that if you cant make a raid you let an officer know.
---
We will be on a EU PvP server, and are recruiting all roles other than main tanks.
---
If we interest you feel free to join Da Krew discord and message me (Konotsu) and we can have a chat.
---
Thanks for reading!

---
This got a lol from me
---
Good luck finding a copy for a decent price. There are also two expansions is you decide you really want all the games.
---
The raid bosses are mechanicly way more intresting. Besides that I can't come up with alot.
---
I will admit, I was over the top excited about Classic at first.  My Youtube homepage now being full of vids of people playing the beta has flipped that, though, now I may even take that week off to play (new Tool album that week too!).
---
Some people see max level content as the end-game, some enjoy the leveling and alt experience. Trying to blame those in the camp opposite you for your issues with the game and calling them retards is both ignorant and infantile.
---
Holy/Prot is fasted leveling and that's common knowledge. What the heck are you talking about?
---
It’s a 50/50.
---
Transmog and barbershop are ok for me, the former is not that big a deal to me as how you look is up to you and it affects very little.
---
Some sort of LFG tool would be nice, not porting you to dungeon but something better than spamming a channel.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you would accept joining a BRS run with a hunter tanking right
---
Play pve server, don't get camped, play bgs and duel people.
---
If Blizzard had not considered the original a bug, they wouldn't have flipped it. You may prefer the original, reversed version, but that doesn't make it "correct".

Yes you can. It’s just 10k per book
---
$480 new holy fucking shit FUUUUCK that
---
Would this work with Shaman's Stoneclaw Totem?
---
This was amazing, thank you for the laugh.
---
You could play the action house.
---
I mean, to each their own. They like it better for their own personal reasons. Let em enjoy what they have. I don't agree with them, and they're more than entitled to be as wrong as they want, but I'll enjoy Classic ;)
---
Who hurt you?
---
You mean Santos Dumont
---
It’s so weird. Had 5 discs to install and then the dreaded patch after that took all day to download.
---
Now I can download the client in 2 minutes
---
Exactly. So what is there plan when phase two hits and some of the streaner servers still have 3 layers of people filled to the brim ?
---
Que times of hours upon hours or server transfers. Keeping layering in would completley ruin the game
---
Not true, u can buy it with new RBG pvp rank 9 as well...
---
Why would I bother wasting my time
---
Those very beta damage numbers (the font) is what I've fallen in love with. Such an adorable collection!
---
Were you guys on Stormscale back in Vanilla? I don't remember anyone in particular from the guild but that name was pretty memorable.
---
&gt; It wouldn´t have so much Attention if People didn´t like it.
---
By that logic, McDonald's makes the best food in the World :D  
---
Just because a lot of people consume something, doesn't mean it's good. People in general are herd animals, following the masses.
---
&gt;We are obviously both German dudes
---
Actually I am Finnish. As I said, half-German on my mothers side.
---
&gt;and just like to argue about shit
---
Very true, and I thank you for doing exactly that while staying civil. Most people here cannot do that, and not trying to be racist, I guess it shows that we are both European :D
---
&gt;I would Change my mind if you could give some proper arguments
---
Righto, let's do that, however already said, I am not here to change your opinion. But here goes: Streamers with large audiences introduce problems in online games. I will outline some of them below. Mind you, these are not specific to WoW, they apply to all online games in general. To me, these problems far outweigh all community aspects they may bring to a game:
---
* **Abuse of Report Systems** : If a streamer doesn't like someone, is owned by someone, or if his community doesn't like someone, quickly said person get's mass-reported. Most systems have some automatic response to that, leading to people getting disconnected, time-banned, chat muted, or worse. By the time humans CR managers can intervene, the damage is usually already done (if they bother to intervene at all)
---
* **Advantage by Fanboying** : In every reward-driven game system, a Streamer has the advantage by his Fanboys funneling time, game-currency, items whatever into him, thus introducing bias into a system that is supposed to be driven by player skill and effort. The AQ Title you mentioned falls into that category.
---
* **Harrassment** : Similar to Report-Abusing, if the streamers community has beef with someone, they will harass that person...not just with fake reports, but in chat, via ingame actions (trolling), and on Social media. Over the years we have seen all kinds of things, starting with Mailbox-Spam, up to and including Rape ad Death threats alongside revealed Real-Life names and Addresses.
---
* **Abolishment of Game Rules, Promotion of Toxic Behavior** : Over the years, we have seen Streamers with large Audiences, who were banned from their respective game for toxic behavior. Tyler1 in League is the obvious example. Reaction by their Audiences: Huge Shitstorms towards the gaming company, to revert a justified decision. Not only did gaming companies crack in some cases, but in doing so, both Audience and Company promote Toxic behavior. If it's okay for my famous Hero, why shan't T do the same?
---
So, here is some reasons. There are others, but as you have said yourself, You are not here to reevaluate your opinion on the subject, so I don't see a reason to invest more effort into this :D
---
Also to support number 15, if you have like 10 engineers, you can basically kill an entire raid group with sapper charges. We used to parachute in to the MC staging area and spam those. After every ZG we would check for guilds grabbing the zandalar buff.
---
Oh no he wasnt a 5Head big brain caster which wouldve just lead to the audience being confused and the content being less watchable.
---
Upvoted for "general dickery".
---
What? He constantly makes weird sounds like he’s having a seizure, cant tell if those are words.
---
Read my other comment here instead of being a smart-ass
---
Actually a great idea, and they may even be able to get away with just one 3 man summon squad depending how long duels take. The squad would just have to move to a new location immediately after summoning the contestants and casters. Although ideally you would have 2 of these squads both to dissuade followers and to give them more time to find a suitable location, however the locations should be preplanned. Only downside is you dont get the atmosphere from the ingame spectators who aren't trolling. u/tipsoutbaby
---
transmog is probably one of the only things that could stop me from playing classic. it's absolutely bullshit to have transmog in an mmo
---
High hopes for beastly imps!
---
Idk if anyone else does this, but I kinda do like exploration trips? idk what to call them really, but i'll go out at say 30 and grab the few FPs i'll need for like 5-10 lvls Stonard, Kargath, Grom, Bootybay, Hammerfall, Shadowprey, and Gadgetzan. Usually kill stuff along the way, and it is a nice change of pace!
---
I plan to take my time and follow quest lines, perhaps do occasional dungeons as needed. I’m in no rush to get to 60, though. I enjoy playing the game, and experiencing the stories. 
---
I do understand that for some the game is all about raiding, and “starts at level 60,” and I kind of feel sorry for them.
---
I took this question as a best case all round
---
also typically relying on a passive doesnt allow for high skill play, most pvp situations you wanna rely on your actions
---
Can't be used outside tram zone on beta, tested.
---
😃, but people will still say "stop thinking ahead, they'll figure it out when we get there"
---
Seems like a shitball system if they implement layering at launch and don't have an exit plan...
---
Downranking is especially useful for healers, help them save mana when a lower rank would do the job nicely.
---
From the sounds of it, thats why they DONT want to play. Maybe I read it wrong but it sounds like his friends dont want to play because its not the same as when it first came out.
---
Nostalgia is the most powerful force in the world. As for people that have never played checking it out, I think it has to do with checking out what the hype is all about. 
---
I played all weekend. I truly did miss Mulgore.
---
I dare to say this is better https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZxGkhxzyo 
---
You will need holy shield for proper tanking and as a healer, you dont necessarily need to use holy shock in raids. You can get BoW from some pally, who has improved BoW and as for +5crit chance and Divine Favor goes, that you are missing in talent trees. Psst, tell nobody. Nobody can see your talent trees so you ll be good. Just dont accidentally cast holy shield in raid, or your true identity will be revealed
---
Pack it up, boys! You heard the man, we're doomed.
---
Sorry Blizz, but this is some S-tier market analytics
---
That shit looks mint. Mine is stuck in drawers and cupboards at my parents house where it's been sitting for the last decade +. If it wasnt pre-beat from use its certainly soaked in years of dust.
---
Thanks for the video. I missed a lot of this.
---
I might be confusing his direct actions with him just supporting the horde and trying to fight the other aspects.
---
After brainstorming names for a few days we came up with it last week. On our servers in Vanilla most of the guilds had latin names. (I suppose a lot of them did) It's kind of a throwback to that.
---
Just go with whichever looks cooler, stun resist and WotF are both very, very good especially in PvP.
---
PvP flag mechanics. I was victim to something similar. I had a chuckle and didn't fall for it again. It was good to experience prior to entering my first contested zone.
---
I used to love healing him in BG's. I was Bularn in Sadface, and UGG was so much fun to pvp with.
---
Aye I can totally see my salt flowing after getting hit by 4+ stuns in a row haha.
---
Yeah we really need clarification. Honestly i still stick with the idea of just having a ton of servers and merging dead ones together etc. No sharding no layering. No perfect solution though.
---
He means like a sports event in this type of case. Don't have to be super technical.
---
In my opinion, you can't even compare classic to retail. They aren't even really the same genre of game if you ask me.
---
Have both boardgame and bc expansion. Still looking for shadows for reasonable price.
---
I leveled up with Chuck. Wonder what he is doing these days.
---
I thought they were comparing classic to retail
---
Mount is 60% (epic riding is 100% but that’s lvl 60). Shaman ghost wolf is 40%, learned around lvl 20 (not sure exactly when). Druid travel form is 40%, learned at around lvl 30 (again, not sure exactly when). Hunters also get cheetah for 30% around lvl 20, but the daze factor is big.
---
Those movement abilities are pretty darn huge. I plan to level a warrior with a friends shaman, and I know it’ll be miserable keeping up with him in the barrens.
---
Ganking and corpse-camping is what I was talking about, not scamming.  My fault for not being clear, but reddit will take any chance it gets to not give the benefit of that doubt so whatever. 
---
No need for the “I played vanilla btw”.  I could easily say “Same MMO history as the OP btw”, and you wouldn’t care either.
---
It will be new to play, yes. However nothing is going to be actually new. Being able to watch a hundred YouTube videos and read a hundred guides takes away from the wonder. I just feel like people are romanticizing classic a bit too much and are going to be disappointed when they don't feel the same awe as when they first played the game. Completely new content would do that.
---
**&lt;Nightshift&gt;** | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Horde | Off Peak Hours
---
**Intro:** &lt;Nightshift&gt; is a guild for any Classic WoW players who want to play and raid during off peak hours on a US realm.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Regarding raid days and times, there is a survey in progress but the plan is to have 2 scheduled raids a week. At the moment the days most people can make are late Wed night/Thu morning, late Thu night/Fri morning and late Fri night/Sat morning. And so far 1-4AM/2-5AM/3-6AM EST raid times seems to be most popular.
---
But it's still early days, as the guild grows and the game progresses there's always the possibility of additional raid days and/or raid groups.
---
20/40man Raid loot will be distributed by a loot council - made up of officers, plus 1 random raid member for transparency.
---
**Looking for:** Anyone with an unusual schedule or in a different time zone who has a passion for Classic and a good attitude. We are mostly in need of dps as well as resto shamans, but all applications will be considered. If you're interested in an officer position, please be sure to provide more information on your application. Purely social members are always welcome.
---
**Moving forward:** We will seek to be a semi-hardcore raiding guild that pushes to clear the latest content all the while enjoying ourselves. We may strive for greatness but our primary goal will always be having fun!
---
**Apply:** If this sounds interesting please apply using the link below:
---

---
None.
---
I've got a ring in one of my characters' banks, from one of the more recent expansions (one of the last three, can't remember which at the moment), that gives a boost to swimming speed.  I have a tendency to hold onto items like that "just in case."
---
But it was nice back in ye olden days when trinkets had interesting effects and weren't just another chunk of stats to stick onto the character, and other gear could have some neat effects on the side.  There's still some things like that in the game, but not nearly as much as there used to be.
---
Though the sword... yeah, I still would consider that largely useless, except maybe to chase fleeing mobs.  (Amusingly, I'd consider it amazing in WoW Modern, where it'd be a godsend for quick transmog runs on a melee class.)
---
People will say nostalgia but it’s more then that. I don’t have to ever talk to a single person in retail WoW to experience the game, some will say that’s fantastic for their lifestyle but some of my fondest memories of WoW were meeting people.
---
Classic WoW is more of a MMO where retail is a single player story with options of multiplayer.
---
There were some good ones in Vanilla, the issue was the need for exact pieces of gear, a perfect play style, and endless consumables.  It was a labor of love and that's about the only way to put it.  They weren't chart toppers, but did OK.  It was kind of fun to play at times.
---
&gt; Prot/Holy is fasted leveling and that's common knowledge. What the heck are you talking about?
---
I wouldn't call it common knowledge - every single class "guide", youtube vid or general comment about Paladins on this forum I've seen has said you're basically stupid if you do anything other than level as pure Ret. I'd legit welcome some links to guides that say otherwise actually.
---
I guess so. Ironically, I got a gifted sub.
---
im sorry you cant understand other cultures and how they might have trouble streaming live as a second language
---
Yes, still there
---
You call September summer?
---
No one forces you to play it. If you think retail is better, go with that.
---
Yeah you need sub only.
---
Basically sub to retail get classic.
---
**&lt;Thinkin Bout Thos Beans&gt; Alliance | NA | Normal/PvE**
---
We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster for Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Vanilla. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing.
---
**Raid Times:** Weekends only. Aiming for two nights a week.
---
We are looking for any **DPS and Healer** at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles.
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H](https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H) (mention WoW Classic)
---
That's why I think layering is preferable to sharding, but it doesn't solve the problem OP pointed out.
---
Yep. You just need a subscription to play classic.
---
&gt;Beta is for testing and reporting bugs/exploits.
---
If you actually think that, you are very very unknowledgable about the gaming industry.
---
And pink pigtails!
---
The $15 monthly fee covers retail AND classic.
---
Many arguments it being the most “refined”, it is the most altered though.
---
Couldn’t agree more. You actually had to group with people to complete quests. I definitely had that nostalgia in Camp Taurajo during the stress test and doing the shaman totem quests
---
&gt; brake
---
Its a shame, because apparently you need to pay attention in school a bit more...
---
So they are 100% doing layering, the ideal option they do is add server queues across the board for thousands of players... what I'm wondering is if they have the ability to create or open a layer after the queue gets past a certain point... or if they start with 4 layers and 5k players on each, will there be crazy queues to fit on those 4 layers if there are 30k people trying to play the same server?
---
I played mainly during tbc, it released before i hit endgame.
---
For me, I stopped playing and witnessed the game get seriously dumbed down, they even got rid of talent trees?!?!? 
---
I tried to come back and play twice and was gobsmacked at how unenjoyable the game seemed. 
---
I always longed to go back to the game I loved, and said if I could play TBC again capped at level 70 I definitely would.
---
Although this is classic and not TBC, fuck it close enough 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I am against the “quality of life” changes. If I want to see something changing is the scope of adding features to the game that breaks the immersion.
---
Instead I would ask for : a deity system, implement the original emerald dream feature, add a shadow/ethereal plane that coexists with the living world, enhance the classes with a prestige class system, add new lvl:60 content as it was envisioned by the vanilla wow designers. 
---
You want a bigger bag space? Add a craftable “bag of holding “ or “portable holes” based on the pen and paper RPGs wow inspired and build on. Make the reagents difficult to obtain, add the recipe as an epic quest, make the player feel rewarded for his efforts and give him that awesome gadget.
---
Right, the most efficient heal is always a downranked option. But you still only really need three spells to be your bread and butter. It might be something like this:
---
* Efficient heal: Heal Rank 4
---
* Big slow heal: Greater Heal Rank 5
---
* Fast oh-shit heal: Flash Heal (max rank)
---
imo a setup like 5 different keybindings for GH ranks 1-5 isn't necessary, and scares people away from playing a priest.
---
If Heal Rank 4 is your most efficient heal with your current gear, you (imo) don't need ranks 1-3 to be hotkeyed. For greater heal, you're often precasting it on the tank before they take damage, and then deciding to cancel or not based on HP. So downranking doesn't fit that style of healing. If the tank doesn't need big heals, just use your most efficient heal. 
---
For "oh shit" healing, use max rank flash heal. If a low rank small heal is sufficient, it's probably not enough of an emergency to warrant an inefficient flash heal.
---
People want to play a simple but still hard MMO. No free loot, nothing that punishes you by not playing(daily quests with crucial factions). Just play as much as you'd like. Casual is fine in Classic. Hardcore raider is fine in Classic. And nostalgia. More nostalgia than anything prior in the world of gaming.
---
Classic drops week or two after my birthday. Its causing some existential dread that I'm excited to play a game I was excited to play over a decade ago.
---
 RemindMe! 84 days
---
Wouldn't want any changes although I wouldn't hate having the retail guild bank.
---
The game no longer feels like an adventure, it feels like an on-rails action game. The community has all but died with the addition of LFG/LFR/LFD. Every class / spec feels homogenized to hell and back and nothing feels unique or fun anymore (my opinion).
---
It’s a stupid stat that doesn’t exist in Oldschool MMORPGs and shouldn’t exist in wow.  It’s just one of the many things that have ruined the game.
---
[Yeah it's weird lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/49x7m0/chinese_wow_censorship_comparisonlots_of/)
---
Shouldnt it be alt-holic not alto-holic? you know someone who is addicted to alts rather than somoene who is addicted to high pitched male singers.
---
Wha---? I've played a lot of retail. I've enjoyed it a lot. But versatility has to be the most boring stat in the history of the game. It's literally just do more/take less damage. A stat being worth stacking doesn't make it fun.
---
A large majority of us are players who did play back then, or maybe have a little private server experience with remakes of vanilla wow. We played the latest 2-3 retail expansions and said we KNEW vanilla was better than this shit. We argued and tried to convince people what they were currently playing was hot garbage and the games early iterations are 10 times more enjoyable. Well in a stroke of brilliant luck it seems things actually went in the gamers’ favor this time and we are getting our wish. Low and behold the nay-sayers are dropping videos confessing they were wrong in their doubts, and the “rose tinted glasses” advocates can be found most hours of the day streaming classic wow on Twitch.
---
that is good to know, thank you. I plan on taking holy shock for the pvp aspect as well. I am trying to get a well rounded spec so i don't have to waste so much gold repseccing 1000 times. But i do like your input. not a lot of paladins would have BoSanc and it would be good to add to a raid.
---
The engine is basically legion, your above comment was correct in that regard.
---
Lower Polygons means, less calculations per cycle == less GPU load.  
---
Lower Resolution textures == less VideoRAM usage.
---
You can use Cryteks CryENGINE, if all you display is a low poly model, it won't put much load on your hardware.
---
Its almost like people can change their mind about a game after they play it. Wow what a concept.
---
The calendar does.  
---
Well, 2/3 of it.
---
You can simply get the free copy of retail wow and add a subscription to it and play Classic.
---
An attempt was made. At least you tried, Snowflake
---
is the optional monday onyxia, zg, aq20?
---
Vanilla wow represents a style of MMO that isn't quite as popular in the modern game. That is, it's especially grindy. Some players, like myself, find this style of game to be more rewarding, as you get out what you put in. People who played back then miss leveling as it was, where it was more involved and laborious. This is a result of Blizzard seemingly doing away with this style of leveling entirely, in favor of Looking For Dungeon (in which someone can reach max level almost entirely via the dungeon queue system, from a major city, without ever consulting another player in the game).
---
There are other factors as well: people enjoyed how raid loot was acquired (rather than how it is the live game currently) or how professions feel more involved or valuable, etc. There are a litany of reasons and it likely varies person to person.
---
Classic wow... the first despicable me... FFVII... hi are you single?

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---

Im kinda in the same boat.  On one hand, i'd like to get that extra month of fishing and stuff in.
---
On the other hand, i dont want to wait any longer lol
---
Jumper cables baby! Engineering is BIS anyways, might as well.
---
He’s a fucking shitter and it showed.
---
Non stop chasing with void? Check
---
Wanding over using searing pain/immolate? Check
---
Missing voidwalker sac? Check
---
The guy clearly never played vanilla wow.
---
I love absolute shitters in here who never played the game talking like they know wtf they are saying.
---
Can’t wait to see you crying on the forums about class balance lmfao.
---
&gt; So, is the game free? 
---
&gt; You won't have to actually buy classic, just have a subscription to WoW?
---
Exactly. You don't even need to buy BfA.
---
&gt; Will it all be linked to the same bnet?
---
Yup.
---
Dude. He is straight up yelling nonsense making throat noises. What do you mean other cultures? You dont even know where im from lol
---
Lets chalk it up to the post not being very well worded, lol.
---
For a lot of people, myself included, it's not nostalgia but a return to a better form of WoW than the current, even if it's not new content.  Community, lack of LFR/lfg, one raid size/type, meaningful character and gear progression (epics not handed to you at every corner), RP elements, world pvp (and a bigger feeling world since no flying), etc etc.  Just read some threads on this sub and the list goes on and on.
---
In this case it's not really gatekeeping.  I play on PVE servers because I don't want to deal with the negative side of World PVP.  If you want to play on a PVP server, you have to accept the bad alongside the good.  Recommending that you avoid the bad if you really don't like it - without even remotely saying "don't play this game" - isn't "gatekeeping."  You're just pulling that word out to try to win an argument with a term you don't understand.
---
Depends on just how crazy blizz will get with how many layers per server. I would assume they have to cap it at a somewhat reasonable number 3-4 ish any more than that and there plan to eliminate layering in phase two will result in monumental ques for said server. 
---
I absolutley do not want to see 10k+ people playing on the same server like private servers(no layer) the vanilla world wasnt meant to support that many people. Farming and questing is an absolute debacle lol
---
Thanks! I'm psyched for it, and glad I'll be getting the chance to see what I missed out on :)
---
Transmog would be absolutely awful for classic. There's no need to obfuscate your power level. You can tell just by looking at someone who they've killed and just how strong they are.
---
Would like to see you comment it better.... Like Perplex doesn't know anything. Come on man..
---
I don't buy when people say "nostalgia" 
---
Vanilla was a better game than anything they gave us cata through BFA.
---
Better systems and everything wasn't balanced to be exactly the same like current wow.
---
There is literally personal loot throughout all of BFA, shit isn't an mmorpg any more it's just a slot machine that isn't fun to play.
---
Healing robes for a shadow priest? ;p

#[NA] [A] [PVP] &lt;Hurricane&gt; is recruiting! Hardcore WPvP, Semi-casual raiding
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you new to Classic, and want a supportive, organized guild to provide you with the friendship, advice and backup you’ll need to survive on a PVP server?
---
**Consider &lt;Hurricane&gt;! Here’s what we do:**
---
* Highly disciplined, scheduled weekly city raids; plus the drills and tiresome lectures necessary to bring newbies up to speed on the do’s-and-don’t’s of zerg vs zerg pvp
---
* Support leveling members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP - Don’t want to rank? No problem. Once was enough for me, too.  3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE, 1 City, from 7-10pm CST. Days TBD, but will fall between sundays and thursdays. Modified DKP loot system with class-specific sanity checks. (Sorry, Hunters. You can’t roll on the bindings.) DKP is awarded for city raid attendance.
---
**Who is Hurricane?**
---
Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit. We know what we like, and what we like is a tightly controlled raid, ripping through horde towns. Our culture is strictly old-school - we don’t stand for pettiness, harassment, or the mindless regurgitation of tired memes.
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you, and teach you: how to assist train Horde raids into the dirt, when to spread out and when to tighten up, what actually constitutes “flanking” in a game without collision detection, and how to fight through crowds of Civilian NPC landmines without detonating your weekly ranking on Dishonorable Kills.
---
**Interested? Here’s what we’re looking for in a member:**
---
* Friendly, non-toxic, patient
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Loves world PvP
---
* Communicative Discord voice chat user
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
&lt;Hurricane&gt; wants to have you - if you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, you’ll be right at home with us. If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla - you’re welcome, and you’re wanted, regardless of where your journey takes you.
---
**If you are interested, join our Discord:**

This is an entry lobby only - please make yourself known, and myself or an officer will get with you as soon as convenient.

the first knee-jerk response you'll get is that it's because of nostalgia. while nostalgia does play a role, for a lot of us it's not the primary reason. I've been a fan of RPGs since 1997 when I played FF7 and UO. After UO I played another mmorpg called Dark Age of Camelot. Then when WoW launched on day1 I bought that because 1) I was a huge blizzard fan, having played all their games since becoming "Blizzard Enterainment", and 2) everyone in my DAoC guild was moving onto WoW. The problem with Live WoW is that it's a very watered down mmorpg experience. There's no challenge to the game anymore. When you do a quest, there's never any fear that you won't be able to complete the quest. Items and stats are completely dumbed down and simplified. Classes have been stripped of most of their abilities and homogonized to the point that most of them, while they have different abilities, do exactly the same thing. Vanilla-BC WoW was an actual MMORPG with a challenge to it, not the kiddie park solo adventure that is live WoW
---
Anyone running by the AH to get to the FP is a prime target of course lol
---
This IS nostalgic. Bring back the massacre!
---
I came into the topic just to see if someone else saw that.  At least I can feel a bit more sane, knowing I'm not the only one.
---
Dude I've tried my best to not say anything but no one will want to join your guild with those weird selfies you posted.
---
#nochange
---
I go fully heal/disc for PVE raids with 60 of course :)
---
At max level, farming in full healing spec/set is going to be pretty much impossible. You're going to want to either level an Alt, group up, or do what most people do and hybrid spec a bit with an "off-spec" gear set. You'll definitely have an easier time as a Druid than as a Priest.
---
No, if you were a brand new retail player today your map might look similar to this. Except, portals, two person mounts, etc. This will be your primary travel option until a few months when people join guilds with higher level mages and warlocks.
---
OMG I didn't even know that one :D
---
Don't have to fight the 3 fat giants over and over again.

indeed
---
thats fair
---
fiction8 apparently
---
3 months out from release with bugs and exploits as well as artifacts from the modern client, while in a closed beta capped at 30 is not “prime marketing phase”. That would be about a month out from release when there aren’t as many bugs/exploits or artifacts. If you think otherwise it’s you who isn’t that knowledgeable.
---
For sure lol... but how would they stop 30k people wanting to play on the same server as their favorite streamer? Give them all 10 hour queues or free transfers?
---
Transfers won't work and the majority won't wait for 10 hours. 
---
Only outcome I see is them saying "well these servers have uncontrollable populations so we'll be keeping layering alive until the population stabilizes"
---
And if layering is in phase 2- rip.
---
I think in the long run the stun resist will be better. I know myself while I thought undead was cool to play, I ended up getting tired of having all the armor looking ratty and torn, and my bones/backbone sticking thru. Ended up switching to orc and just liked the overall aesthetic of it better. But really its up to you.
---
I wonder how much work he personaly did for the engi items.
---
I really hope this strange strafing functionality isn’t in the game when it finally releases. That shit is immediately obvious to anyone who plays the game for atleast 5 minutes
---
I will probably level as a holy pala and here are my thoughts:
---
1. There are MANY FACTORS to consider while leveling, and thing is as a holy paladin you will find groups in a blink of an eye. And if you can find groups really fast, you can clear dungeons and get good gear very efficiently.
---
2. You do not need to level solo. You can, but you do not need to. There are few 2/3 man combos that include a holy paladin and they're sick: they mostly include warlock/warrior due to how much they benefit from having a healer by their side.
---
3. The time spent by a DPS looking for a dungeon group also means "slower leveling". It's not just "I kill mobs so I level faster", unless you're racing to 60 doing 100% quests / solo content.
---
4. Just have fun mate. Leveling in classic is part of the game, its not a "skip to 60 so I can play the real game". Just enjoy your journey, I don't give a fuck if it's too slow, Ill play holy paladin because I love it. IF it's unbearable later on Ill just throw a respecc here and there. It's easy to change later on anyways, you just need a good 2h which you'll probably already have because how easy it is to run dungeons.
---
I have no words. I heard somewhere that the human mind tends to selectively recall pleasant memories. Which is why I believe running the risk of meeting some one who play by these steps was a positive part of forming the struggling coming of my first level 60 character. 
---
Let there be twists and turns this time as well, if I have some thing to say for it!
---
VIP streamers, yoink! :D
---
Shit was pretty bland. Not very funny
---
It feels like Heavy Leather is as valuable (sometimes more) than the other leathers as trade good because not only is it going to have less people gathering it passively (beyond the initial leveling wave), it's the first tier of leather that still gets used in "end game" items on a consistent basis, including several engineering items like Goblin/Gnomish Rocket boots, LW Swift boots, Steel Weapon chains, and a few LW items that are used in Blacksmithing.
---
It might be easy to kill and skin 25-40 mobs, but the vast majority of players will either be low level alts who can't,  or maxed out 60s who are too lazy to farm "lesser" tiers, and might focus on Rugged for straight profit.
---
In terms of value, it's never a bad idea to horde Heavy leather for personal use for alt professions, or to sell when demand raises up and supply is low.
---
It's definitely correct. If you look at the 'sister' weapon, Jin'rokh, it also has the same orientation. For some reason they changed ZR (I believe in Cata when it was made a BoA from Archaeology) and didn't change JR or the PvP equivalent.
---
There are a ton of non streamers with beta access testing.
---
Either were gonna get layering for phase two...or theres gonna be huge ques... if laying continues the communitys gonna bugggg lol. No easy answer here mate
---
Well you see it has the word "know" in it. And Tyrion Lannister "knows things". The case is air-tight!
---
Ahh the ol’ “I’m a dick on the internet because there’s no real life repercussions” defense to being a shitbox.
---
Hey, I'm more of a casual/semi-casual type of player and very chill guy and looking for people with similar mindset to play with on Classic.
---
 I started playing wow on WOTLK and used to tank as a DK and heal as druid, but I'm "playing" vanilla wow through pservers right now just to get the feel of the game, nothing too serious.
---
**Intended Class**: Druid
---
**Intended Region**: NA (east)
---
**Intended server type**: PVP / RP-PVP
---
**Intended Faction**: Alliance
---
**Intended raid/play times**: Saturdays I'm available all day and Sunday-Friday I'm available after 5-6pm EST
---
**Any priority you may have in a guild**: PVP and casual raids, social experience
---
**A preferred form of contact**: Discord: Parker\#8782
---
They don't need testers.
---
The game existed 15 years ago.
---
Closed beta is for A. Small specific testing and B. Free marketing &amp; hype throughout the summer leading to launch.
---
&gt; I truly did miss Mulgore.
---
I read that in Cairne's voice
---
I reported three bugs during this tournament, which were reproduced after observing the duels and hearing comments from the participants.
---
I wont gank i only kill everything red in sight once
---
!remindme 83 days
---
If they considered it a bug, why did they then design Jin'rokh and the PvP sword which have the same orientation?
---
Imagine getting triggered on a game. Get a life buddy
---
Because I don’t think everybody playing classic necessarily wants all the best loot in the game. For me, what made pre WOTLK was leveling characters. The end game stuff is great and all don’t get me wrong but searching for 4 other people to run SM so you can finish some quests and having to actually budget and save money for your mount was fun for me. Just a few things but as previously stated it feels more like a true mmo than an optional mmo. It’s definitely not a game for everyone, especially a lot of todays gamers.
---
"tons of streamers and a few random people" is pretty disingenuous. There's a handful of popular streamers, a few smaller ones, and hundreds of others normal people. You may have only seen streamers report a handful of bugs but who's to say the hundreds of other people aren't? Hell, I reported a few really minor ones myself while on the stress test.
---
I do think they need to hurry up and increase the beta level cap soon, though. More than half the game is currently untested, publicly at least. MC and Ony are going to need a few runs.
---
Honestly, their solution will probably be to keep layering. They just don't want to tell us that yet.
---
He also had that problem. Heh.
---
Before that date, I assume the week before so guilds can organize.
---
Nah we played on Scarlet Crusade
---
Yeah, that's why I go PvE as well... with the limited time I will be able to spend playing the game, I don't want to deal with that kinda crap.
---
The other guy was making a statement that this is fine. If we're making a pragmatic argument then yes obviously you should not play pvp if you don't want to even have the chance of getting camp spawned at 1v1. 
---
I assumed you agreed with them but you don't so you're really just stating the obvious, so you're saying nothing.
---
11 points isn't deep and there are times where sunder isn't up, and an interupt can come in clutch in many raid scenarios.
---
“I’m thinking about subscribing to get on some sweet sweet loot grinding”
---
See that’s the thing, wow no longer has a loot grind. You log in save some turtles and BAM better loot than the first raid tiers mythic epic gear. That’s why people want the old ways back. The old wow was golden. Runescape fucked up and they restarted as well, and look where they have gotten. It’s been 9 years of old school runescape and it’s going strong.
---
its because those npcs are experts at flying. We players hardly are... i mean what kind of skills do we have at flying? they are pretty nonexistant, we cant even attack while mounted so we are nubs! 
---
And flight paths are tested to be safe and reliable. I would argue that they are  faster than our flying mounts... if they flew in straight line that is.  
---
Its relatable to real life, you can be the richest or strongest person irl but you still cant pilot a plane until youve completed the training and know all the regulations about where you are allowed to fly. They are very strict.  
---
The real life equivalant to ingame flying license is moped license, you can buy it without needing to do any actual training.  
---
If you can suspend your disbelief on this it would make sense.  
---
For years ive wanted blizzard to design flying better, make it more dangerous to the player and have actual mechanics to it, but they havent done anything.. ever since it was released flying has been a mobile sanctuary in pvp.   
---
The  addition of flying guards in cities havent done anything to change that, even if you were to world pvp in a city.
---
I leveled engineering pure for 1 more extra teleport option, and I enjoyed the fact that it still only added a very limited travel option and not a 'go anywhere device'
---
If he was my friend sure why not. It sounds like a fun challenge
---
Escort quest in westfall for the defias traitor.  It's a major gateway quest for the VanClef quest line.
---
Just kill him every-time., alliance have to restart it over and over.  It's desirable because the reward for completing that deadmines quest is huge....best item for some classes in the early 20s.
---
&gt; With Blizz saying that we will be able to log in the 13th to secure character names 
---
Uhh, did I miss something..?
---
Depends what metric they are using to measure "better".
---
Does retail WoW have better raid encounters, visually and mechanically? Yes it does, therefore retail WoW is better. 
---
Does retail WoW have more competitive and skill based PvP? Yes it does, therefore retail WoW is better.
---
Does retail WoW have more engaging dungeon gameplay?  Yes it does, therefore retail WoW is better.
---
Does retail WoW have more casual content for players to engage with and explore?  Yes it does, therefore retail WoW is better.
---
Many different ways to evaluate "better", you may think classic WoW is better because it's quirky. That's absolutely fine.
---
Surprised people still haven't figured this out.
---
This isn't a Beta to test for bugs, mechanics, etc.  
---
I mean yes, they may iron out some issues, but that's not the main purpose of this.  
---
**The game has been tested 14 years ago!**
---
The purpose of this "Beta" is to gauge community reaction and to market the Classic relaunch. Why do you think there are so few Beta invites compared to even WoD? Why do you think they invited almost ALL the streamers, regardless of whether they even played classic, or on Private Servers? You think Asmongold is in the Beta because he makes for such a great Beta-Tester :D :D
---
This is genius level marketing, that costs them next to nothing. Almost no one is in the Beta. Rarity breeds craving, Craving breeds demand, demand == subscriber numbers. We already see people resubscribing after someone put up that you need a subscription for a Beta Invite.
---
&gt;Inviting tons of players 2-3 weeks before release is not the way of properly testing a game.
---
Predicting it now: They won't even do that =)
---
And that's why I keep posing these questions to people, if blizzard doesn't get ahead of the potential 10k+ player servers then GG, that will be their excuse + gateway to getting away with layering as a permanent fixture.
---
I know that. My point is that these harassment rules exist and are enforced... It's up to GM discretion.
---
Followup questions:
---
They got rid of the talent tree, is everybody of the same class the same now? 
---
With the talent tree you actually had to make some choices on how to play your class.
---
Also I just remembered that I played about 8 more levels before someone showed me the talent tree. That was rough
---
1) it's not two weeks before release, it's 9
---
2) stress testing is merely a matter of pushing server to the limit. It's not meant to be for testing the quests, gameplay etc
---
3) I'm fairly sure there will be beta testing focusing on gameplay too
---
You think you want in, and you do
---
Why would you need that flight path at level 5!?
---
Nobody knows if it's logging in... you'll be able to reserve 3 character names on August 13th... only those that have an active sub.
---
All (read as most and good) private players are on the alliance side.
---
I think his name says it all :p
---
NA/PVP Horde player looking for a semi-hardcore guild.
---
Intended classes would be Hunter, Warrior(prot/fury) and Shaman. PST/CST times. Msg me for more info on my raiding background or guild history.
---
I have no idea why you are getting downvoted. I use to do this all the time. As a member of the Horde getting to the Badlands sucked. I would always get a couple higher level guild members to summon me to Kargath to get the flight path then run through Arathi, Wetlands, Loch Modan, and then Badlands just to get it.
---
Must have. The said we can log in to reserve names two weeks before launch, assuming you have an active subscription.
---
Soda didn't mute as soon as they asked everyone to mute, tips asked ven if he wanted to go somewhere else to finish the final. It seems they may have been talking about tricking the ally to leave by attacking them? Because a lot of them seemed to be gone when the final.
---
Are all the classes close enough to each other that it doesn't matter what class you pick?
---
We will be able to create 3 charaters 2 week prior to release.
---
You are out of arguments, and just devolved this conversation into petty insulting. Good bye, I wont be hearing from you again.
---
Or maybe it's fun for them
---
For fun! Also skipping the quest chain to open the gate to searing gorge later on
---
I have fond memories and felt it like a "right of passage" when I would go from Undercity (Undead priest) and run to Thunderbluff to get the quests for Ragefire Chasm.  Back then, Ratchet didn't have a FP, and neither did the other Tauren camp just before RFK and RFD.
---
Fond memories of organizing and tying in my 'running' quests from TB to UC on the reverse quests; and making sure that the quest for RFK that awarded the blue-cloth shoulders was 'shared' among the party as we entered.  Granted, there were times I would get the quest reward and have to wait a level or two to wear them, but still.  (Best boss fights are when you are under the level of the boss, those fights feel epic!)
---
Those runs, along with the run to BFD, the run to Kargath, and all those "runs" pre-mount were the best -- especially when done in a group.  Still get lost in Loch Modan every other run to Kargath.
---
But if you were a dungeon crawler, you ran to get those FP's -- you didn't expect summons.
---
It's all subjective, I'll be limiting myself to PVP because I love it yet raids and dungeons have always bored me to tears from Vanilla through to MoP. Hopefully I'll be lucky and get my pre-BiS set without having to run too many dungeons. Wishful thinking I guess...
---
Correct, not necessarily logging in, but you do choose name and which server. See article here. https://www.wowhead.com/news=291719/claim-your-character-name-in-classic-character-creation-starts-august-12th-13th
---
West of Deathknell
---
you could argue the opposite tho, by spreading things like that the community could become more toxic even if people get banned. I highly doubt they would be permabanned for saying it.
---
are you sure? i tried and it was not buyable or even visible in the heirlooms  vendor on my level 40 alt.
---
It's not
---
Thank you WoW GM &lt;3. I can't wait to read his ragepost on the forums
---
TL;DR - 
---
Current game sucks. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. Vanilla WoW still has classic Blizzard game "Fun factor." People like to socialize on the internet to overcome virtual challenges.
---
&gt;TLDR: Why are people super excited to play an old game that they may or may not have played before? 
---
Because in recent years, gaming as a whole, and WoW in particular, devolved into a frontloaded jumble of instant gratification, high access, "streamer culture" driven bullshit, that people are sick off.
---
This sub is full of would-be CEOs.
---
&gt; Why isn't the game a flat fee like the other remakes?
---
You keep bringing that up, but none of the other remakes (RTS games) had subscription fees - *ever*.
---
I prefer the old school MMO feel and design. I think Vanilla WoW is the highest quality version of that type of game. No game has came out with these same ideas as well as this kind of polish.
---
And for all those nostalgia arguments... I never played Vanilla WoW (played sbaseball in college and quit EQ just before WoW launched).
---
I don't know why this is so hard to understand. If I love tetris and the developers drastically altered tetris to play more like DDR... I would be thrilled to get the old version of tetris back! It's not about nostalgia. It's about game design.
---
I loved seeing Venruki’s reaction to it all. He was so in the zone with his duel with Snutz. After he won he planned the camera over and thought it was so cool that the audience was all seated like that for the spectacle. 
---
The tournament really was such a cool event. Can’t wait to see what content and events we have in the future for classic!
---
I've seen this mentioned before. It seems like really interesting way to play Warrior. Could you tell me more?
---
There is still some flavor to each class but you don't feel like you fill a unique roll anymore.
---
Mount is 60. I hear ghost wolf is 40. And i think cheetah is 40
---
And there were those of us who just couldn't figure out why an Alliance NPC was in the "Horde-safe" zone!
---
Thanks guys, completely missed that post somehow!
---
He got his money from the views and ads and that is all she wrote!
---
Same here, I have been jumping around to multiple things.  ESO, Star Wars, Overwatch, P99.  Nothing has garnered my attention longer than a few weeks though.  I am waiting on another MMORPG and of course I am waiting for the Classic Summer.
---
Speaking of something like that...
---
if classic is a hit I'm curious to see if they attempt to do BC again or if they do a fresh expac off vanilla.
---
People will be bigger douchebags than 15 years ago :)
---
You never addressed a single argument and just said I was unknowledgeable and using straw men(which I am not) from the start, yet can’t handle it when it’s said back? Must be of the same ilk of those who called for a ban for a guy standing on totems.
---
I love cottage cheese. I do not expect every single person I meet to love cottage cheese.
---
Difficult concepts, I KNOW.
---
And take a break while in flight, bathroom break, snack break, hell, talk to a friend to let them know you're still alive.  Come back, refreshed and ready for the next adventure!
---
I'll admit happily that I can no longer function without add-ons.
---
Doubt people use it to obfuscate their "power level", rather than just aesthetics for themselves.   I certainly never looked at the dudes AFK'ing in IF and took much from the sight of their gear.
---
Yes /played.  We'll definitely see someone reach 60 though in the first week.  World record was 4d 20h.  That can be done in 6 days for sure.  28 hours of sleep over 6 days is fairly reasonable.
---
I had a (sort of) similar issue once when I D/Ced in scarlet monastery (cathedral) and upon returning...... every single wall and surface had item icons lining them. The floor of the cathedral looked cool, like it was tiled and on purpose.
---
Those were the only screenshots i often wish I had.

**&lt;Willingly Suboptimal&gt; NA - Alliance - RP-PvE**
---
**INTRODUCTION:**  
---
Willingly Suboptimal is a freshly founded guild that is preparing for official Classic launch. Our goal is to enjoy Classic and everything it has to offer, especially committed when it comes to dedicated raiding. We’re focused on achieving our ambitious goals, and looking for more. We will be rolling on an RP realm for its higher sense of community and atmosphere.
---
**RECRUITMENT:**  
---
We are recruiting all dedicated and focused raiders of any class for our hardcore main raid team, those who want to push content at a fast and consistent pace. We currently actively searching for Warriors, Hunters, Druids, and Warlocks for our Main team. Our current leadership contains individuals who have had a long and successful resume when it comes to true hardcore raiding on both Retail, and Classic private servers. Our main raid roster is already pushing 35 players.
---
We are also recruiting for two more casual minded raid teams, one weekend team, and one late night team. We’re RP friendly, but RP is not a requirement. However, we will have some casually organized RP. Our guild is not just about raiding, and we are also looking for casuals, friends, and family who wish to integrate themselves into our community.
---
**EXPECTATIONS:**  
---
As per our guild name, we do not worry about being completely 100% optimal. We are open to any class, and any spec. We believe it is the player that truly matters. Currently, our raiding rosters have room for any dedicated player of any class. We expect main team raiders to put in the required effort during progress. We expect to use our raid time as efficiently as possible, by also preparing outside of raid as well. We will be using **Loot Council.**
---
Main raid goals go from hitting the ground running into Stage One of progress, clear content at a fast pace, and end with killing Kel’thusad at least 30 times. We intend to have the casual raids begin in the 4th month, and clear content at a relaxed pace.
---
**RAID TIMES:**  
---
Hardcore Raid Team - Tuesday/Thursday/Friday/Monday 8pmEST - 11pmEST
---
Casual Weekend Raid Team - Saturday/Sunday 8pmEST - 11pmEST
---
Late Night Raid Team - Tuesday/Friday 12amEST - 3amEST

Personally have seen a member of a partner guild getting permabanned for this. He went to Ironforge and spammed what translated to "N I G G E R" into the /y chat. He suddenly logged off an hour later. Next day, he logged into voice for the last time, complaining that he got a permaban.
---
I even know the guys ingame name to this day, not posting it for obvious reasons =)
---
Hunter traps in neutral cities
---
That is a shit argument.  The subs fee was for developing content, which is no longer a service being rendered any longer.
---
roasted
---
This gets posted every 30 minuts or so, but I will answer anyway.
---
Guildbank, is my main addition I do like, it solves the account sharing used in Vanila, which was and still is against the ToS.
---
Being able to upgrade the grafics to BFA standards, without it being push down on anyone who does not want it.
---
I think you will get a fat 3-6 fps on average. A classic feeling indeed
---
[MLG Orlando 2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q5pb-fEQhs) is basically when everyone got to know who Venruuki is coz of him being GCD'd by the Beast cleave. You couldnt really go on arenajunkies or whever where PvP was talked about someone mentioning not Blocking (similar to Daanzka no blocking)
---
Avoid the AH, most items on there will be too pricey. Instead, consider networking with guildies and making friends. Say you're a hunter doing leather working and you join up with some rogue for a quest and see them picking herbs. You can offer to trade them some leather gear for agi pots that they can skill up on.
---
Money is at a premium, but those doing trade skills will often be sitting on a pile of worthless stuff they made for skill ups. Enchanters especially have tons of low level enchants to give away that are fun while leveling but not worth paying for. For example if you know a tailor enchanter, send them stacks of extra cloth in return for regular enchants every time you're in town and have new gear.
---
Getting access to trade goods via your social network is a good way to get that easier leveling experience while not giving up that hard-earned cash you'll need for your mount.
---
I even got a nice amount of flightpaths on level 1 bank alts. Some I could reach myself (if you swim along the coast you can reach quite a few locations at lvl 1 without danger) and for  others got summoned.
---
I always had periods that I was not very active with leveling or with a lvl 60, but still would log in to chat with friends or to make gold on the AH and in those times my chief bank alt was my 'premium' character so I wanted it to be able to get around the world, just because :D
---
It's just so sad that it will be so ez mode, and distroted with warriors everywhere.   The best thing about classic is it will make the private servers better.
---
But no level req. !
---
It looks completely stupid in either orientation.
---
Oh really? I did not know that!
---
Holy Thralls balls how he looked. Thank you, this is awesome. Will have to see all pics when I'm home.
---
I'm similar in that I enjoy leveling and it'll probably be a good chunk of my content in Classic, but its important to concede that there isnt a defined way to play the game or at least what the focus should be. "Endgame" and general gameplay priorities always vary from person to person. Yes powerleveling to 60 isnt the "correct" way to only play the game, but the opposite is equally true.
---
Im personally going to level at my own pace, doing professions and skills, with no real min-maxing or mongoloid obsession for hyper-efficiency along the way since i enjoy the game at my own pace, but if somebody wants to do the opposite, then thats fine. Play the game however you want as long as you're not toxic and harmful.
---
you dont even know me
---
Character flying was a mistake.
---
Why do you think there will be no population caps at start? Sure, these will be expanded due to layering and not what the server can support without, but even so, these servers will still not have 100% player retention. People seem super convinced that Blizz will NOT see it coming and will not prepare accordingly.
---
Have some faith! They have some 15 years of experience with WoW. They have seen population issues before. There are analysts who will predict behavior based on recent trends.
---
Damn I wish I could fcking post like you... It just makes everything seem much more valid xD
---
1st Point
---
I don´t like that comparison. I never said that streamers are the best Thing in the world because People like them. 
---
Some People do like McDonalds - just as some People like Streamers. But I understood the analogy and actually had to laugh a Little bit :P McDonalds sucks xD
---
2nd Point
---
Ohh so you don´t live in Germany :/ You just dropped in likeability :D   /s
---
3rd Point 
---
Yeah... I should actually just get a life I know xD Just the fact that I´m still in this conversation while thinking that this is pointless... Weird :P
---
Soooo....
---
Those are some really really good Points that are valid and probably apply in some extend as well. 
---
Although I would class some of These under the same Category of "dumb and stupid crap"...
---
Those are still valid Points... I still want to argue against that please stop me xD
---
~~I wanted to say that People should not follow that as they should be smarter but well... There are several cases of that and People are usually not smarter xD~~
---
Which is sad actually... And I get your Point - of course all of that is possible to happen without a streamer - it is just not in such a large scale and not as easy to accomplish in a notable scale. 
---
WHICH BRINGS ME BACK TO:
---
~~Streamers being able to make Events quicker than...~~ jkjkjk
---
I see you m8 
---
Thanks for the valid Points I won´t argue this anymore I think I lost this battle
---
Cudos to you good sir!
---
und Viel Spaß in Classic ;)
---
I think it was like that at the start, but a patch or update made the connecting flights automatic.
---
Is this true of physical abilities that have multiple ranks, like charge, etc?
---
Even if you are ganking lowbies on a PvP server were griefing is allowed, you are still an asshole, we all still think you are an asshole. If we roll on a PvP server that just means we will have to deal with that shit, doesn't mean we have to like it or encourage it in any way. 
---
It's a bit like when racist people get shit on by normal people and then go all "but muh free speech", as if that is any sort of excuse for being an asshole. 
---
There is a difference between what is technically allowed and what is accepted as decent behavior by other people.
---
i spent all my gold twinking myself and then had to ask my mom to buy me some chinese gold
---
I would agree if it was after release, but why does he deserve to still have beta access?
---
It's neither better nor worse. It's a completely different game.
---
Retail WoW is essentially an RPG simulator, built around a core of mechanically demanding raiding (That is, if you do Mythic, which most people don't).
---
If you enjoy what basically comes down to a very elaborate multiplayer Jump 'n Run, then Retail is alot better than Classic.
---
While it's great for open world farming, it's generally not worth the mana &amp; GCD for dungeons. Targets will die far too quickly for it to be worth it.
---
Someone needs to do this. That way we have 1 guy at level 60 in like...... 2ish weeks and he did zero quests.
---
It'd just be funny at that point and he could insert himself into the meta of his server if he started on pvp or forming a raiding party early on.
---
Then again, that person would probably be some sort of terrible cave troll whom everyone would hate being ganked by.
---
This is a shameful game, haha.
---

---
He won blizzcon 2012
---
Planning your CDs correctly is part of the game/tournament.
---
That’s a good concern.  It is still cool to have the odd specs on the gear.
---
I have tons of guildies in retail on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9-12. Then they all dissapear until the next raid night.
---
It's almost like the game pushes you right to end game, then has a serious lack of end game content
---
My favorite was Venruki vs Cdew.  I watched Cdew early on and improved my Shaman skills by watching him play.  Seeing him wielding a two hander with Windfury brought back so many memories.  Great matchup!
---
AoE Grinding is, and was, only ever effective when there is zone congestion, aka. when questing is impossibly slow.
---
Followup Questions:
---
Free Loot??? Is this an idle game?
---
I remember reading on my guilds forum that I used to stay in touch with people after I quit that people did not value the daily quests, but it sounds like a chore.
---
FFXIV. I've been playing it since right after I quit WoW and they're releasing a new expansion at the end of the month which looks really good. But I can't and don't want to juggle two MMOs.
---
I made up my mind a couple months ago and picked Warcraft. I quit my raiding group in FFXIV and everything. I'll be playing it casually until classic comes out and then I'm done. It's a great game though!
---
&gt; What's the point of having a rule that specifically prohibits to delay a fight for cds when there are players doing exactly that?
---
Stalling a match in Classic generally requires you to invest resources of your own, or outplay your opponent - simply waiting between matches does not take either of these, so I suspect that's the distinction for that rule which made it okay to stall during matches.
---
def not on population %
---
same, it would be great if they gave us client side options
---
They have internal testers that don’t have a level cap.
---
yes, those swim potions were used for BRD lava runs (to skip most of the dungeon and get to the Emperor as fast as possible)
---
i suggest 30/21/0
---
holy shock is not super important since its on a 30 second cooldown
---
There is a valid argument and it's preference.
---
One is not objectively better than the other. They're just different.
---
And it's not stupid to kill people with 1 hit? There is a difference between ganking someone and basically constantly killing low lvls. So please stop talking about the stupidity.
---
It is great to have all these items that are made in quite low levels but you keep them in bags just for the quality of life improvements. Just making enchanted white cloth items with minor speed or 5+to all stats, its great because you can mail it to alts and its your heirlooms for some time and the boots of speed can stay in bags until mount easily.
---
Same here, those nochanges dudes are getting ridiculous. I get it about them hyped about experiencing all this joy of "original" wow, but it wont last long on those enthusiasts. For new people to stick around it would be nice to have some kind of setting to turn on new graphical updates. Like new lightning for shamans, new shadow bolt and stuff like this. Seems like ill be downvoted to hell, but at least ill vent it out
---
Login screen says so.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
No it doesn't
---
You don't have a single argument to support any of your claims, do you?
---
It seems to me that you're just here to hate on classic.
---

I don't think it was bad for giving vanity mounts.  I did the violet proto drake in WotLK which you needed to do every single holiday achievement.  It took a year and I felt like I deserved a nice mount for all that.  It got me free 310% riding too.
---
Regular WoW has slowly become a idle game. And there are so many chores that you "should/need" to do that you don't want to miss out a single day and that has a big negative impact on the game.
---
The Cataclysm was an inside job. Keep asking questions.
---
Danke, dir auch :-)
---
I've just given you an example.
---
professions can give a lot of benefit, you basically waste time going back through all the old zones (if you choose to gather)
---
its not too hard to keep up cooking, and first aid.
---
And some of the others, like alchemy for warriors, absolutely help.
---
Also as a tank once i hit 60 id like to have some engi grenades ready

Hardcore vs casual argument.  And also game play of modern vs old school.
---
During vanilla and for a little after, there were countless mmos that tried to compete with wow.  So many of them failed miserably.  Why?  Because they tried to do it like vanilla hardcore style with various gameplay upgrades.  However, this was a bad because: if people wanted to play a hardcore mmo, they would stick to wow.  WoW had prestige, was still a good game, and it was the "cool" mmo.  Because prior to wow, MMO's like DnD and Everquest were the loser, fat virgin kid game.  WoW broke that stigma.  WoW made the mmo genre cool.  Everyone was playing.  So these other new mmo that were hardcore just were never going to compete.  As for trying to get the folks that left wow... same reason really.  If they were going back to play a time consuming mmo, they would return to wow, not some new game they knew nothing about.
---
However, blizzard realize in the TBC and Wrath that kids were getting tired of 3 hour raid nights.  Most people were leaving because of time restraints.  So wow made the game more and more assessable to casual gamers.  And when other mmo companies saw this, they followed blizzard lead on the casual/dumb down gameplay.  And all of sudden, these new mmo's were sticking around and making money.
---
In short, casual games sell.  Retail caters towards casuals.  Is classic &gt; than retail?  Ummm... perhaps.  Depends on what you want and how much time you have.  If you have 90 minutes to commits towards dungeons and 3 hour for raid nights twice a week, then classic is the way to go.  For the people with a life outside of wow, then retail is the way.  Casual sells.
---
Wowhead forums were so good back then.
---
Dedicate phase one to getting to lvl 60, getting your epic mount, leveling engineering.  This should take you up until phase 2 where you can rush the rank 10 PvP set.
---
If you think raiding/dungeons are boring I would try to find the most hardcore guild you can.  Nothing about a speed run MC is boring. Not only will your guild be out of there in less than an hour, you will have many guildies wanting to PvP in premade groups.
---
I like the barrens... there is a ton to explore out there. And it borders ashenvale.

Greys. This is the thing people underestimate. Grinding mobs that drop greys is probably one of best gold per hour can you get below 40. Also, skinnable beasts rarely drop greens/blues compared to other types.
---
So beautiful and adorable.
---
Thanks for sharing, keep it up!
---
I can understand this. I wouldn't grief myself because I enjoy helping people. But I can definitely see the fun in it, especially if your real life is causing you frustrations that you want to let loose in a harmless way.
---
TLDR; No, you won't regret it.
---
1. Druids are some of the best levelers in the game, second only to hunters. A lot of private server first lvl 60's were/are actually Druids, and I expect to see a lot of that come Classic launch. Stealth, free Travel Form @ 30 (compared to 100 fucking gold @ 40), self healing, CC (roots), and ofc Tank Form all add up to a very efficient leveler that can solo elites/group quests when necessary and requires very little downtime compared to other classes. Obviously, you're going to level up as Feral.
---
2. Feral Druids are *very* good open-world PVP'ers while leveling up 1-60. The same pros listed above apply here.
---
3. Piggy-backing off of Point 1, Druids obviously can and will do all 3 roles in 5 man dungeons while leveling. 1-55 you can easily do any instance you want and basically get a guaranteed invite to any group. BUT, in higher level dungeons (45+ish), you'll want appropriate gear sets (a int/spirit healing set, a stam/str tanking set, etc). Obviously you're going to level up as Feral. 
---
4. From 55 onwards, you will be pigeonholed into either Resto (90% of the time), or Bear (10% of the time). Contrary to what everyone sais about meme-specs, you basically have no chance at going balance if you really want to raid (past MC anyway). Technically there's a Cat DPS spec that is kind of viable, but you'll be doing 5x the effort of a Rogue just to keep relatively up in the meters. Guilds probably will take a good Bear tank all the way through Naxx though, if you're try hard enough. Resto druids are always nice to have and chances are you will be healing.
---
5. Druids are stupid good at PVP @ 60. Some of the best healers (Resto), and the absolute best flag carriers (Feral, but only relevant in WSG). So unless you plan on doing a lot of WSG spam, you're better off going Resto. No, there really is not much Balance spec in PVP, or Balance hybrid. However, if you want to play that style, go Shaman. Hybrid Ele/Resto is very strong and can do some serious damage in PVP.
---
6. Druids are all around one of the most underrated classes in Vanilla, and also one of the least played, so it will be easy to find a raid spot and PVP premades will always have a spot open for you. Just don't expect to actually do any DPS'ing, whether its PVP or PVE, because you either Resto or Bear, (but in reality you're just going to be Resto 9 times out of 10).
---
It used to be like this, but that got changed like halfway into vanilla.  You can take a non-stop flights in 1.12.
---
Or prefers playing end game. It’s what’s great about this game, there are dozens of ways to enjoy it.
---
\^ the real use for it is mainly in PvP and what vodka expressed
---
Your math is wrong thats not the way you calculate the the value of money on time, you ate just using 2%*15 so its 30% but the right formula is this:  i = (1.02)^15  - 1 and the real inflation for 15 years ago is 34.58% so its even cheaper that you think
---
Lol. Different strokes. I agree that silithus is horrendous, but undercity rocks.
---
Redridge is the lowest level zone in the game that is contested territory. Both in actual vanilla and on pservers horde rogues and stuff roaming around lakeshire ganking lowbies was commonplace. It's even a thing on retail, still. There can be horde in Duskwood as well, but it's not as prolific as in redridge. 
---
I believe the people PvPing in Duskwood are more comparable to the PvP going on in Eastern Plaguelands for example at lvl 60. It's mostly people looking for legitimate PvP, not griefing low level players.
---
If you’re insulted that’s on you. I can’t help your feelings are hurt over words on the internet from someone who has no bearing on your life.
---
But it seems such a plane zone man. Is it real terrain or somekind of bug?

&lt;Team Naked&gt;
---
NA-PVP / Alliance
---
Introduction:
---
&lt;Team Naked&gt; has played together since 2004, and is a home for players passionate about PVP and PVE. The guild is primarily active in WoW, but many of our members have broad experience in various MMOs including DAoC, FFXI, FFXIV, Ultima Online and EQ/EQ2. Our members include several High Warlords/Grand Marshals and multi-Gladiators, as well as server-first and world competitive progression raiders.
---
We hope to couple a hardcore/serious approach to PVE with a relatively light raid schedule, recognizing that our members have real life responsibilities. Organized PVP will be completely optional, but encouraged, and the guild will organize battleground groups for members intending to rank on non-raid nights.
---
Raid Schedule:
---
Wednesday &amp; Thursday
---
8PM - 11PM PST
---
Note: hours may fluctuate based on progression/clearspeed, but will never exceed those listed above
---
Recruitment:
---
Mages - high
---
Warlocks - medium
---
Warriors (fury) - high
---
Rogues - high
---
Hunters - medium
---
Druids (resto) - low
---
Priests (holy/disc) - high
---
Shadow Priest (note: we will likely only recruit one!) - limited
---
Paladins (holy) - high

God I loved these zones.
---
The "don't care how I get there" crowd never takes into account the practicality of barely stumbling to 60 with a bare minimum of gear. For them it doesn't matter. But for any real player, it's going to cost you time to backtrack and finish quest lines for good items, level professions, and class particulars like tame pets, build item sets, work on class quests/skills like lockpicking, etc.
---
So you skip over all that stuff to get to the end, but in the pratical sense, a "real" player is going to want to have all that stuff to actually play the character. So, why would you chase an imaginary finishline that isn't really isn't even close to being a finishline, in a game that argubably doesn't even have one?
---
If your running with a guy whos farming mats for 30 hours a week your most likely in a hardcore guild. Someone who goes above and beyond and performs optimally should have a better chance at getting the gear
---
ouch...  I had a lvl 60 warlock who had so many 'useless' but special  junk gear items , plus his various raid tier sets plus resistance sets, pvp gear set,  etc etc that he could hardly collect anything. he had 9 16/18 slot bags + Core shard bag (28 slot , but soulshards only) plus  the main bank bag full of crap, BoP junk and raid stuff.   I had to park anything else on alts.    I didn't like to throw stuff away that had some unique function, even if you almost never used it.
---
Shill
---
Ghostwolf is pre or @ 30 and Cheetah is @30
---
This makes sense from an RPG point of view. You kill something &gt; you loot it &gt; you profit or you don't. The looting is an action in itself.
---
2? Maybe 3?
---
It's not 100% tho because the scatter could have been resisted or missed, but if he had landed the scatter on ven then he absolutely would have won.
---
No, but I CAN tell you more about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!
---
Mostly nostalgia, i expect classic to primarily appeal to people who played it, just like most re released products do.  But for a new player a lot of things will just generally seem like they haven't aged well.    
---
Plus retail right now has been in a sorry state for a few expansions, and yeah classic is better than retail right now but that's not saying all that much.
---
Even when played correctly, they are weaker than “pure” classes in terms of dps, tanking, and healing.
---
They bring unique utility that’s valuable, yes, but it is accurate to say that they are markedly weaker than their competition in significant ways.
---
Also increases generated threat
---
Nobody is arguing that they can do it, I am arguing that they did it not to disrupt their special event, that is not a valid reason to do it in my opinion and goes against what the game is all about.
---
These items destroy my bag space.  I'm one of those players that always has full bags because I love farming.  This time around, I'm hoping to manage my bags better and throw shit away/sell more often.
---
There wont be people on this scale craving to play anything past WOTLK once the respective expansion has turned a decade and a half old - i feel safe stating that as a fact. 
---
MMOs are a dying genre. We all see it, people was fast cheap thrills and instant gratification. Its most likely a generation thing.
---
Look at Apex. Blew up real fast then just seems to have vanished. 
---
Fortnite survived because they throw out new shit every damn week it seems. 
---
If wow was free to play do you think people would be active between patches? Fuck no.  People pay and feel obliged to get their moneys worth. 
---
A new patch is out and it lasts 3 days. 
---
Vanilla just had all the right things to make it last and leave an impression on you.  I was born 1994, started playing wow around age 11-12,  not sure what patch i actually started. The only reference i have is the naxx invasion but by then it had been afew months of playing (never got past lvl 27) 
---
Vanilla may not be as flashy with super mechanical bosses or complex rotations.  But each Class feels unique, and is suppliments by roles.  Debuffing and buffing being a huge part in that.  You arent just another affli lock. You are the warlock doing Curse of X.  Or the shaman with improved WF totem that can actually totem twist. 
---
To me, that far overshadows ”complex” rotations that still come down to: 
---
Combo points with rips offs like Holy power or iciles 
---
Or its Build and dump  a rage bar in different colors. 
---
Idk even know where im going with this.  Word vomit sorry.
---
Evil Activities -- Dedicated reminds me of farming in the EPL or WPL as undead holy priest everytime I hear that track
---
you're fooling yourself if you think druids are the worst class. Good luck trying to beat a competent feral/resto or balance/resto hybrid. :)
---
It's both. The "the game was already tested in 2006" argument is laughable bunk, this thing needs testing inside and out and *looooots* of issues have been found. 
---
But, yes, it's also some of the easiest marketing material I've ever seen in my life.
---
I remember when i first started playing and was too broke after skilling up to afford flights. Good times
---
Exploring is fun!
---
Guild banks are quite important for an organized guild and would be even more welcome in the larger 40 man raid scene.
---
But for now the #nochange zealots won.
---
The people bitching about no flight in expansion zones are mostly not from the same pool of people that want classic wow. They’re entirely different. It’s almost as if people on reddit can have differing opinions.
---
Yea a douche that gave 3 people eng trinkets before the duel tourney.
---
Aye, but they need masses of people bug-hunting as they are now in the 30 beta. No use having one internal team of 40 testing the raids in one way. People need to bend and break them.
---
Because it was a really good mmorpg. Way more social interaction wich made it fun. Modern wow has "nerfed" everything you needed other people for.
---
Now we are left with personal intrestest. The collecors collect, the raiders raid, the PvPers PvP, the altoholics keeps leveling.
---
Everyone can do whatever they want and dont need others players for it. The need for other players is gone. Unless you are able to have fun on your own without other player interactions.
---
The game feels hollow for those that play MMORPGs for the Multiplayer aspect. 
---
Also the RPG parts are less intresting and rewarding.
---
Sucks you're getting downvoted for speaking the truth. Skinning is overrated. Its good but not great. If you grind beasts during a dryspell of quests or inbetween quests instead of humans. You will miss out on grey drops and green drops. Many beasts don't have these items in their drop tables. Skinning is better than having nothing, or a crafting profession which would be a gold sink, but its not worth the time investment or bag space until lvl 35+
---
I’m in the same boat as you guys kinda 
---
I played vanilla on release and played until cata I think and then stopped when I went to college. After about 4 years I got the itch to play again so I re subscribed and went back to playing 
---
However, the game that was once challenging and required thought and planning, was now as easy as all the other games in the world. 
---
Getting gold on your first toon was easy. Leveling to max level was easy. Professions was easy. Everything was just easier and it wasn’t the game I once loved as a teenager
---
I miss the challenge of vanilla, and BC wow. Like very, very much.
---
Took me a good ~week of logging in at obscure hours to tame broken tooth (with usually 5-6 other hunters around), just to eventually have some mad alt kill it out of spite instead.
---
No, the legitimate pvp is happening in WSG or hillsbrad. Trust me, this is the same handful of level 30s specifically targeting questers at raven hill.

**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**​Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
​
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
*P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.*

I won't participate in any of this madness, because I don't have an "online brand" to care about, and I have never seen my prefered Character used anywhere other than by myself :P
---
 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE Server - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking organized vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
**About Us:**
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players from Vanilla to Private Server to Retail. We’ve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured. To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization. We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience. Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS. In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended. In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks. Please refer to the Charter at[ celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this. We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience. Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.
---
Tuesdays: 6:00 –10:00 pm. PST
---
Wednesdays: 6:00 – 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule. With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
Pre-designated loot council (details in website Charter)
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are still recruiting for many positions. It should be noted that if you resonate with us but are unable to commit to our raid program we may be open to recruiting you as as non-raiding member. Such positions remain selective and are held to all of our member expectations.
---
If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at[ celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) and read over the Charter. The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading. May you find your perfect guild!
---
**Risen | NA-PvP | Alliance**
---
First team: Tues/Sun, 8pm CST – 11pm
---
Second team: Wed/Mon, 7:30pm CST – 10:30pm
---
**Loot System:**
---
Loot Council with Wishlist
---
**Introduction**:
---
Shard, founder and GM of Risen, has been playing WoW since February, 2005. In retail Vanilla he led one of the only 23 US guilds that were able to clear Naxx prior to TBC launch (Validus of Mal’ganis). During TBC and WotLK he raided in &lt;vodka&gt;, one of the most prominent US raid guilds that has ever existed. For the past 3-4 years Risen has been based on a private server where we quickly took over as the top NA guild in raid progression for AQ40 and Naxx, and built a reputation for world pvp dominance. Perhaps you’ve seen us in one of Pronker’s “Buff Watch” series of videos! If not, go check those out on youtube!
---
We have some pretty lofty goals for Risen in Classic! Not only do we want to be the dominant guild on our server but we also want to create the ultimate Classic community—a guild with 2-3 separate raid teams within it! Picture a guild where there’s always plenty of people online to do stuff with—that’s what we want to build!
---
**What you can expect from us:**
---
•    High-end leadership with a long track record of success
---
•    The most well-organized guild you’ll ever be part of—ask any of our veteran members what they think
---
•    A fun, competitive atmosphere embracing the hardcore mentality without most of the silly no-lifer requirements
---
•    Dedication to server dominance in all aspects
---
•    2-3 raid teams within the guild, which means there will never be a shortage of activity!
---
**Currently recruiting:**
---
Team 1 High-performing healers, and one feral druid tank
---
Team 2 All classes except tanks, feral druids, shadowpriests, and tanks
---
Check out www.risencc.com for more info about us!
---
 But I ain’t got no friends Lt.Dan!
---
You can make your character, name and and all. but only up to 3.
---
names with sexual organs in it are not allowed, and somehow "King"
---
I tried the name Boobear for example, and it was not allowed, it contains the word "boob"
---
Rogue here. 
---
I take auto attack off my bar and right clicking can be weird sometimes so I mix my Sinister Strike and auto attack together. 
---
/start attack. 
---
/cast sinister strike. 
---
That way when I tab a mob and use sinisterstrike it automatically starts auto attacking. You can use this on any class just have to pick the ability you want.
---
Not at all. Lol
---
If you have no expansions you have less clutter from old expansions.
---
Lol snutz blizzcon winner,part of reckful dream team. Given a few weeks more meta knowledge he will literally own your soul you boomer scrub.
---
What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been was indeed a long, strange trip. I missed a few holiday achievements early on before I knew about the mount, so I was an extra few months behind everyone else.
---
My all time favourite thing of vanilla WoW would be the fact that after playing  hardcor ein 2005-2006, and pretty serious on pservers from lets say 2013 till 2018 I still discover new items I never heard about before , like this Phytoblade of yours.
---
And not just one,  this topic alone already gave me 3 unknown ones and i really was into collecting rare gear
---
Or just dont loot the Hounds in MC.
---
&gt;looooots of issues have been found.
---
Lots of "I remember things differently!!" and "This was different on PServer XYZ!!" have been "found", and most of these "findings" were thoroughly shot down by Blizzard.
---
Yes, there is testing to be done. But it's by no means the focus of this "Beta"
---
They're both just solid. I like Cannibalize, the cast animations and having a panic button for certain cases instead of hoping for a blessing from RNGesus.
---
Do you think that older wow characters that no longer live in the current wow world (so from lore) will be fair game?
---
Is there any sort of rule of thumb for how much stamina you need to survive general 5mans?
---
saw a post a while back where a guy was gift wrapping like blacksmith hammers and sending them COD for a few gold to top tier lvl 60s on his server.  few could resist opening them and he made enough money for his mount.
---
It's not bothersome at all.
---
funny how alliance was the only faction that behaved.
---
DOT Snapshotting was awesome, really boring decision to get rid of it.
---
Tank/healer would be easier to run dungeons with, yeah. But dungeons are not efficient for leveling outside of when you have quests for them. You can’t really level effectively by dungeon spamming.
---
Warrior AoE is also fairly bad, also, even with a priest supporting them.
---
Warrior/priest is decent, but you have to double your solo kill speed to make it viable when grinding, and it is going to eat into exp gained while you quest (as described above). So just be aware, it may be slower than leveling solo.
---
The issue is that if it's finals it'd be best out of five. I don't think rogue would win that.
---
I dont think they are bkring but for me they are mostly a grind since pvp is my main content. So id like to do them up to a point first month(s), get the most out of it and then switch to pvp 90% of the time
---
[Someone already did this post from the demo](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9r93me/this_man_is_a_psychic_deathwing_reference_in/)
---
Orc stun resist no question
---
&gt;They got rid of the talent tree, is everybody of the same class the same now?
---
Well, not exactly... There's still specializations and *minor* talent trees, where you get an ability every 10 levels or so, but you don't invest points. But then on top of that, there's also dual spec, so you can swap between two specs on the fly. Plus, in legion they added "artifact power" as a talent-ish system that you had to get points to pay for, plus glyphs, and now I think there's like azerite or some shit (never played BFA).
---
Essentially they ultra-dumbed down talents to where yes, everyone is very cookie cutter across the same class. But then they added weird talent system like things, to give the aesthetic of customization, but they don't matter till max and aren't particularly variable.
---
But it doesn't even meet the minimum requirements for the installer
---
So I was thinking of going herb just for swiftthistle.. until I read this.  Do you think if I pickpocket enough I should have a steady enough supply that I could use dif prof?
---
&gt; Wanding over using searing pain/immolate? Check

Check here and add to the list if missing.
---
Yeah. I mean my life is pretty good. Couldn’t ask for anything else tbh. I don’t think peoples actions on games have to reflect their situation in real life.  Maybe it’s the case for other people tho idk
---
As OP mentioned, a few of these are dangerously close to breaking [Blizzard's Code of Conduct](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/42673), specifically:
---
&gt;Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
Historically, Blizzard has been much more likely to take action against repeated and same-faction behavior of this sort; corpse camping the opposite faction indiscriminately won't get you banned, but harassing players of the same faction in some of the ways listed here repeatedly could get you into trouble.  Pulling these tricks against a player once or twice is one thing, but following a specific player around for hours would likely cross the line.  Exercise caution.
---
Tallents got dumped down. The old tallent system had more personal options ( even tho the endgame all went with the same "best" build. The option to personolize it is gone. ) and it cost gold to respec. Wich people saw as a waste of gold. Do your "personal" build gave you an identity. 
---
Now its expeced of everyone to respec to the same best option for the given encounter. 
---
You used to be a 0/31/20 firefrost mage. Or whatever build you personally liked the most.
---
Now you are just "A" mage. And expected to always use the best options.
---
Awesome post and grats on having a good time.
---
Will no doubt be better than launch experience for the first few days :)
---
Also with how little the population is on beta, what is your take on how the removal of layering will affect crazy populated servers that streamers are on? Do you think it will be even possible for them to remove layering with the amount of people that will roll on those servers?
---
Im not sure, as i typically dont like naming my characters as something that already is used in a story
---
There used to be a bug - pretty sure it's fixed in 1.12 - where you could invite someone who's partied and immediately kick them from the group in a macro
---
/invite player
---
/kick player
---
and the game would think they left their instance group and begin the kick timer. You could do a /who Stratholme (for example) and get players teleported out of their dungeon or raid. They'd still be in the group while the timer ticks down and not know what to do (not even sure if there was anything you could do) and then have to run back to the dungeon if their group had no Warlock.
---
I may or may not have gotten a kick out of that a little more often than I'm comfortable admitting.
---
If it was too hard then pvp servers wouldn't have survived. Yeah you will be ganked. Raids not happening prob not cause you will have 39 players backing you up. Open world raids are much more difficult.
---
There are no mmos in market where everything you do is constant progression. There are no filler levels and rewards. Everything you do feels rewarding and there's difference between putting an hour to game or putting 8 hours a day. You feel satisfied doing either one and hardly anything feels meaningless. It's a great fantasy world where you can immerse yourself as much as you like and create your own story. Not a prescripted game with daily chores to maximize the efficiency
---
I play on the most popular private server and there were 12k horde logged in last night and we're outnumbered by alliance. Didn't notice any lag.
---
3. use a 2 hander, because dual wielding occur a 24% miss rate. Any strike that misses is a lost occasion on generating threat.
---
For the same reason I would use a fast 2 hander, if you miss the next strike is coming soon and since you have a lot of crit on raptor strike it's best to use it as much as possible.
---
Play horde, windfury totem should help boost your DPS / threat (and our rogues are scarrier).
---
5. I'd take the wolf to boost damages. You can tank as a hunter when you are over geared and your heals are competent. So don't bother too much about mitigation but about threat : the shorter the fight the better.
---
11 points, 10 of which giving 0 benefit 99% of the time and 1 point giving marginal utility in very very niche situations? Fairly massive expenditure for extremely limited benefit...
---
Also, when in a raid environment is sunder not up, outside of the first several seconds of a fight?
---
You could tank as a Resto Druid if you really wanted to. All you need is Feral Charge. It's not much different from a Fury who puts points into Prot for Last Stand. Your build could look [something like this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZxx0oZVxsoeqMo). 
---
If you actually like tanking and want to do it regularly, then a [30/21 build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxsoxo) gets you all of the important tank talents and all of the important healing talents at the same time. Most Druids who want to fill more than one role will have some variation of this build.
---
See, this is something I missed. Doing quests that have you items, like a key, to use to unlock new zones.
---
on a crowded server, you could just stay underwater and farm nagas or other sea creatures without competition from other people.  There would be a few interesting spots for tis, around shipwrecks or sunken ruins, with mobs with decent loot, herbs, clams and treasure chests.
---
Yes, if I would try to do it, I would have to unbind space bar. :^)
---
idk my early BC guild still had some world drop rares that no one could ever use
---
Is the game any good?
---
Who are the pservers players in this tournament?
---
yeah what are they talking about this is what WoW is all about.  organic activity
---
Yes, many of them were. Many of them have been legitimate bugs that needed fixing. Hunter pets, for example, are still messed up. They were always going to have a beta to find these things, but bringing streamers in for the promo is an absolute no-brainer. Still makes me laugh that some people are somehow angry Blizzard are doing this, like you wouldn't turn down 24/7 free advertising!
---
...for what reason? This is way more work than just replacing the old version with the higher rank one on your action bar. If someone is too stupid to figure out how to do that, then maybe they should not play RPGs.
---
My .02. Druid gets fit into lots of places, but rarely as a primary choice. If the party or raid has a slot, Druid usually can fill that role for almost any content. That’s a trade off but it’s not a bad one. 
---
When there are 40 people in a raid, having to pug 4-5 people per raid is not uncommon. You can reply to lots of LFR shouts especially when content is farmable. 
---
You can run around doing almost all the game content with one build and fill many roles in lots of groups. Try having a deep prot warrior. All they can do is tank. Over time many classes niche down so far they can’t do anything outside their role. 
---
Druid is the perfect alt. Yes, you need a bag of gear for each spec. Yes, you will never out perform a single class. But you really can do it all. 
---
And Druid is a blast and the class fantasy is fantastic.
---
Some people's finish line is being in some of the first few onyxia/MC runs on their server, getting full T1, and taking a break until BWL comes out.
---
My point exactly.
---
You can do a mix of FedEx and Exploration and get to level 10 in 3-5 hours (depending on how much you practice it). It's slower than leveling normally IF the starting areas are clear. If they are cluttered, it can definitely be a time saver.
---
Pretty sure it’s in Boralus/whatever the horde city is but I could be wrong cause I don’t play much of BFA.
---
Good Macros, thank you sir.
---
psh
---
You need this obvious shit sourced?  What part?
---
They all got changed to their smaller versions over the course of vanilla. So we are getting their final versions. I only ran them in their smaller versions and really only a handful of times back then. Kinda sucks we won't get to experience both, but it's an ok compromise I think.
---
Not to off topic, but it's not worth a new thread...doesn't the opposite apply to tanking? I remember using a dagger to tank because the fast attack speed helped generate more rage and then threat.
---
You can always enter the raids. Keeping your world buffs is a other story though 😅
---
I miss these days. There was more wonder and community back then.
---
Yeah, just like how it is a shame that Warcraft movie never got released. Just think of the potential it would have had if it was not cancelled.
---
Good catch, this happens on pservers and is it also the case in classic beta? 
---
I have read it did and didnt on varying posts over the years, I tended to not use it even in lvling due to it pulling off my VW so easily
---
That is what I don't like about games like that, I feel like if I'm not playing, I'm losing. It's a weird addictive thing, so I don't play them.
---
Classic wow actually rewarded you for not playing by giving you an xp boost (maybe only if you were in and inn, I don't remember) but I remember once I couldn't play for a few days, was excited for my big xp boost, and forgot to make sure I was in an inn so I either had none or just a little.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic
---
See "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?"
---
yeah i imagine its much easier for the mage if neither has longer CDs
---
Ok, that explains a lot, and it is how I remember playing, I want to play the game now.
---
Yes first aid is an exception (huge benefit at almost no time cost since i get enough cloth) and i might skip gathering professions alrogether and just grind mobs or something for gold at 60, be a tad more frugal etc.
---
unless you never tell people bout it so it doesn’t get removed ...
---
September is definitely not summer where I'm from, but you're getting too technical. Most people in this hemisphere wouldn't consider it summer.
---
Given my experience on pservers, do you do a lot of grinding at those levels? 
---
I find it impossible to follow any sort of route as at least through the barrens there are no quest mobs left.
---
Is catform with dps gear and resto spec still garbage when it comes to killing. I feel like druids would have an easier time than priest. Also, how is priest healing in dungeons while in shadow? I feel like that might be an option early endgame; trying to stay dps specc as long as I can while still healing dungeons
---
Ignore posts with zero knowledge like this one.
---
but you could also use fire protection potions, or both (but then you have to time the drinking, because of the general potion cooldown)
---
It's not even dual spec anymore. You can just hop between all three (or 4 in the case of druid, 2 in the case of demon hunter) whenever you want.
---
what would a PvE realm do to change what happened?
---
It's really not a unpopular opinion though.
---
Totally. Haven't laughed this good on reddit for a while
---
I dont limit myself but pve is a means to an end for me. Id rather spend a bit in pve and then switch to 90% pvp
---
Bank and Guild-Calender.   
---
its QoL changes that will just make things better, and take away what we are forced to use 3rd party for anyway.
---
After six months and after my shaman is 60 so I can aoe grind in peace.
---
I dont think you understand how the boss works then :P
---
As someone who never had the chance to play vanilla :( Would someone care to explain the difference between retail specs and classic specs?
---
Yeah, sure. But it's still not comparable to a lvl 60 one-shotting lvl 17s in Redridge. As I said, it's more comparable to the people running around Eastern Plaguelands or Blackrock mountain or whatever ganking other players roughly their level. It's not 100% one-sided.
---
Not sure I'm following, the only thing I noticed was that my character's model would actually turn to face the target while strafing. That's not functionality, that's just the modern engine knowing to point the model where I'm targeting as opposed to facing. You're right that it wasn't in vanilla but it doesn't make a difference to the core gameplay.
---
Unless it's something else you mean?
---
"Only true pvpers fight through the ganks on a pvp server. With no complaints." 
---
That's what gatekeeping is bud.
---
I understand your point, but it's kind of irrelevant to the issue here. If the rule says "do not prolong the match to get your cds back" (I don't remember the exact phrase and I can't find the link right now) and you do exactly that, you are simply violating that rule. A simple time limit would have solved the issue (and also made some duels less boring in my opinion).
---
That doesn't really say much. 40 Priests did Onyxia in Vanilla. 3 geared raiders did Onyxia in Vanilla. Literally 3 manned her. I'm sure 40 Druids can group up and clear MC/Ony with ease, but 40 druids trying to tackle AQ40/Naxx? No way.
---
Not sure but you can bet your ass employees and streamers will have their names reserved before it opens to the public :)
---
Iirc Vanilla had plenty of character names with in game npcs.
---
what would a PvE realm do?
---
If you're going to tell tbc fans "it's just nostalgia" then you're being a hypocrite. We finally get Classic after so many years. It would be a dick move to deny someone's favourite expansion remaster (or whatever's the correct term) after you've been called nostalgic and delusional man for such a long time.
---
"most honorable kills"? what... i dont think that was the only way to receive it. Where does it say it anyway? Ive never heard of  this.
---
I remember one guy had it on my original realm and he had gotten it through winning a leveling contest, he was a hunter so makes sense.  
---
So i think people just got them from winning blizzard-held contests.
---
It's a bug Hunter trap didn't Dr with trap until mop .....
---
Raided on a PvP Server in Vanilla and it's fine. We had some battles with other guilds in front of Blackrock entrance on raid nights every now and then and sure you will be ganked. But overall it's just as fun as a PvE server. Well if you like PvP of course.
---
Oce player looking for raiding guilds. Semi hard core player, pvp and pve. Only pvp servers. Most likely playing priest. Thanks
---
I mean it's exactly the same as PvE except with the possibility of being attacked. Group up and you'll be fine papa.
---
&gt; and somehow "King"
---
King is a company owned by Activision.
---
They can reasonably release a very similar version of TBC, but people are gonna be on a #nochanges craze again. I dont see the harm of changes if they are done in the spirit of vanilla.
---
I for one would like to see welfare gear cost at least 50% more. Or maybe a limit to how many you can have on. ALso flying mounts should sink if you go afk or stop giving input for a while
---
As a mage with blink and fireward. Are these potions needed for a lava run?
---
If we get Classic TBC and you plan on doing arenas, Undead is considered to be better than Orcs.
---
In Vanilla PvP Orc has more advantages against the class which gives Warlocks the most trouble.
---
For PvE neither offers that many advantages, so just choose based on looks. If I roll a Warlock I’ll roll a male Orc, as Orcs are the only Horde race which is advanced and civilized enough to wear footwear properly and avoid wearing tattered clothes.
---
Even if Classic does EXTREMELY well, I doubt we will see Blizzard putting a full development team on it to make brand new content. IMHO, the most likely scenario is that they give TBC a very similar treatment to Classic and possibly even WOTLK. The real question is, would they be willing to remove things from said expansions that arent in the spirit of Classic? Keep flying to a bare minimum? No LFG in WOTLK? Etc etc. 
---
I am not against anything you said or anyone elses ideas, I am simply saying that the most likely scenario is that they try and milk the most out of this with the least amount of effort.
---
I thought the rule was that you couldn't delay BETWEEN matches to get CDs back up? Nothing that said you couldn't delay during?
---
Haven't had the time to watch just yet.
---
Did Tips win?  He is the best Warrior in North America.
---
But isnt some of the grinding spots designed with looting in mind? And aoe looting would make some spots broken?
---
I mean, yeah, it would be awesome, but I think it would break to much.
---
I was interested until I saw that you expect a level 60 alt before phase 3. I don't have enough time for that :(
---
idk why you would skipp gathering, skinning and herbalism you almost rarely go out of your way. Mining often does require you venture off. But herbalism has much more different nodes spread across azeroth, whereas copper nodes for example stop showing up entirely at a certain point
---
Yeah but it goes against the #nochanges making the game feel different to how it did back at release
---
I thought the tournament would be a big horde/alliance mashup, a bit disappointed
---
And would-be software engineers. "The game was already tested 15 years ago bro!" Like there's no difference between an old client and a new client re-purposed to interpret old data. Makes me glad these people didn't get into the beta when this is the limit of their developer knowledge.
---
It really depents Vs. What you play.
---
Paladin warrior is an iconic duo.
---
Rogue mage is a duo I really like.
---
Rogue druid can de really fun in world pvp.
---
8/10 would read again.
---
&gt;Everyone tanks this fight as the mechanics dictate tank WILL die
---
You dont understand how the boss works then. The tank does not get Burning Adrenaline until some time into the fight. The point of using a Druid tank is so you can kill the boss before this happens.
---
&gt; I’m saying you don’t start. With haste + infinite rage 
---
Yes you do. You use the Pummeler a second or two before the boss activates, and make sure you preuse Enrage 10 seconds before. Maul cost 7-10 Rage. After one tick of Essence of the Red you will have infinite rage.
---
&gt; Additionally if your not first in line you can brez where if your first you have to be brez’d to brez. 
---
Or you just kill the boss faster and avoid the need to res anyone in the first place. Besides, the resed people will lose Essence of the Red so there's little point.
---
Agreed, just whines all the time cant be doing with it.
---
In my experience a good druid will keep pace with any healer bar maybe a super geared paladin. Shamans I don't know, I'm an alliance dog. They have the highest single target hps in the game and with proper gear they can afford to throw out some insane hps. It's just sad that many guilds don't allow their druids to shine. This is especially prevalent in mid to low-tier guilds who think they can clear everything just by stacking 90% of the raid with warriors, priests and mages. 
---
As for ferals it's strange. A feral tank is a godsend to mid-tier guilds because they out threat any warrior tank by a mile while still surviving. In hardcore guilds though, DW fury warriors can keep pace with the ferals. Feral dps is also kinda strange. They can sorta stay in top 10 just by being good but to compete they need a ton of consumes and many many MCPs. They can still do top 5 in many guilds, but again.. in hardcore guilds they don't stand a chance. But that's like the top 1% of guilds.
---
I mouseover healed in WotLK. It is 100% supported.
---
Really???
---
SO REWARDING. AMAZING GAMEPLAY.
---
GIVE ME KARMA.
---
It’s bone my guy
---
Thank you for your kind words!
---
Yeah let me elaborate. The way strafing when targeting/fighting a mob is different than how it functions in vanilla AND retail. If im running from a mob, I typically strafe away from them using Q or E to avoid getting dazed.  So my back is never facing the monster.  In the stress test and beta though when you do this, your character appears to be running directly away from the monster with your back turned to them.  I found it very disorienting because my character wasn't moving the same way if I was in combat and out of combat
---
Paladins are best PVP healers : they can't die, they can fast heal forever and they can dispell defensively.
---
Priests are a distant second, because they're much more squishy than paladins (but they have both dispells).
---
Warrior + Paladin are an unstoppable machine.
---
Warrior + Priest are very good.
---
And don't think I'm an alliance fanboy, I was Horde in Vanilla and will roll Horde in classic.
---
Paladins are GOAT pvp heals, the dont die and can get away from shit really easy. Can also hit hard when they want too, and never go OOM
---
Maybe expand the content of Classic without an expansion, like further tiers or dungeons (even low level could be very cool). What the hell, even doing new events would be awesome and (maybe I am being crazy) having new classes/races. All inside Classic without the expansion madness
---
&gt; I haven't seen any solid arguments for sticking to the same expansions other than pure nostalgia 
---
Are you playing Classic for pure nostalgia? No? Apply whatever arguments you have to BC. Done.
---
Pay my retail sub, play Lights Hope, comfy as FUUUUUCK.   BFA is the pinnacle of streamlining a game to death
---
Pvp servers are not for pvp'er. They are fir everyone wanting to play the full game.
---
But PvE servers are for those that are allergic to ganking.
---
When you get as big as wow was in it's heyday, there is nowhere to go but down. It's not weird that a 15 year old game has dropped from a playerbase that at the time shat on everything else to a number that even today most likely shits on most other things.
---
For all of bfas problems, wow still has a huge stable playerbase. Look at how many battle Royale games that has come and gone, or other MMOs that were pretty much dead on arrival. Most things don't come close.
---
You can't be on top forever, nothing ever will be. Popularity will always decline, and I think it's really unfair to say it's 'dead' when it is still one of the most popular games out there.
---
its not only for the "stuns" that the classes brings, but it also work against engineering granades, since they are considered "stun" effect.   
---
Makeing it just to good to pass up on vs Undead
---
There's a ring that increases swim speed in bfa too. Lol. Also pants that reflect damage.
---
I'm not labeling TBC as "just nostalgic" but one thing is rebooting the foundation of the entire game and actually redoing it in a new way and another is redoing your work and ironing out the edges.
---
Classic isn't missed JUST because of nostalgia, but because its actually a better game than live. 
---
I agree that may also be the case with TBC but TBC expanded on vanilla, it'd make sense to build on vanilla in a new direction than just redoing the entire franchise.
---
I loved TBC, it was my favorite *expansion* but I'd rather them take the idea of TBC and rebooting it in a different manner.
---
Your point was that glads would shit on random streamers?
---
7FPS in a dial up internet connection
---
It's a faction conflict based game. Slowing levelers means they reach endgame slower. Which means less people competing for farming mats against your faction at 60.
---
It's almost like we're in a WORLD, one that involves war, and even the actions of a few can have a larger impact. Which is how it should be.
---
Benediction quest for priests too
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. It's not just about turning on a old server and then it's business as usual. They had to import all the meta data and assets into their new framework.
---
And it didn't really fit. See the classic wow presentation from blizzcon last year.
---
I also like Boob ears.
---
Yeah, as long as it doesn't slow down server processing, I'm 100% ok with it.
---
If memory serves, they're the ones that made Candy Crush? I recall them talking about it in one of their quarterly reports.
---
It's not my fault that people associate the Summer with warm weather along with June/July, I am going by the calendar which clearly states when summer ends.
---
You can dislike it as much as you want, but it's still a summer release.
---
It’s an open beta so I don’t find that to be a problem.
---
No
---
Lmao, turns out the MPAA has press kits you can download with there logs and what not
---
Is this the same for rogues? Do I have to change my sinister strike for it to upgrade?
---
It was an open beta anyone was free to play.
---
fucking hilarious lol
---
I am very interested to see how this will end up playing out for sure. The beta definitely feels empty at times and I have always been one to join highly populated realms. Those first few days are going to be absolutely insane.
---
I'm in the same boat don't worry it won't happen (here come the "LOL everyone said Classic wouldn't happen)
---
Here is the difference... there are much much much fewer players willing to hop in and play tbc/wrath like they were back in the day. 
---
Vanilla gives a unique opportunity to relive where it all started and show new players the old way of doing things.
---
Nobody will get nearly as excited for tbc / wotlk like they did for Classic.
---
Only the vocal minority wants this - and if the day comes where blizzard launches a classic Tbc and wotlk servers- I'll eat my shoe.
---
It still don't feel right to forcibly remove one player for not playing by other player's rules.
---
I would like HP / Mana on enemey bars, but I see how it would affect the game.
---
It's weird seeing the night elf model from the cinematic by itself.
---
"Bounty bay"
---
Interesting tidbit, if you have ever played with the warcraft 3 map creator, you can tell the WoW maps were created using basically the same toolkit.
---
So my authentic 2005 experience.
---
So many issues that i have seen from reverse engineering the legion client like this for example and the flight path animations, i really hope people make more noise about these issues as they are not vanilla like.
---
You can toggle PVP on a PVE server. At least this time, you know EXACTLY what you're getting into with a PVP server. If you are going to sit there and say its not fair to face the consequences of your choices, then you're the asshole.
---
See you in Elwynn btw, at the end of my axe :)
---
&gt;I can't even imagine how much these sadists will feed off of classic players who go in expecting friendship and nostalgic fun times.
---
Anybody expecting happiness, nostalgia &amp; fun times should just roll on a PvE server.  Not to be mean or anything, but honestly just trying to save everyone some grief before it happens.
---
Heal when healer gets killed. . Rez. Blessings. Auras. Protect allies with bubble or LOH.
---
Id like to see a warrior try that. 
---
Pallys carry their weight.
---
Remember, Classic will still be using the same engine that was in use during Legion. Old hardware will not be able to play Classic well if at all. If you really want to play on old hardware, private Vanilla servers might be your best bet.
---
Hah I'm not even surprised, way too much to expect people to have any kind of character identity anymore apparently.
---
People complaining about the choices they make ruin this game, which is you. Make the choice to roll on a PVE server and shut up?
---
Indeed, TBC is the logical choice for blizzard. Very low development costs but very high certainty that it gets a positive reception. 
---
Developing something new will be more costly and more risky.
---
Even if there is a group of 200 of the opposing faction camping the portal it's not difficult to die, rez closer to the portal then run in before they can react to you. There are plenty of times where you have two groups raiding at the same time from opposing factions and a fight breaks out, but it doesn't last too long before one side just zones in.
---
Cool.
---
And they can do what they need to internally.
---
If you were correct in assuming copious amounts of testing was required there wouldn't be less than 5k players in the closed beta, 84 days away from launch... ... ... ... ...
---
If you can affort the spells you need and a mount on 40. Giving some spare change or leather to guildies is a good way of making friends. 
---
The guild is all about working together afterall.
---
While you are leveling, its for yourself. When you are 60 then start to think of contributing to guilds needs.
---
Tanking the rival guilds is a part of the pve content in a sense.
---
cringe
---
"this episode has a lot of internet things"
---
and those things need to stay on the internet
---
I killed a LOT of people in Ratchet using hydrocane
---
&gt; none of blizzard's betas
---
You got to keep your cards in the hearthstone beta (after they opened the shop), can't remember if you got to keep your levels though, but they were only for unlocking golden versions of certain cards and didn't give you an edge.
---
But as far as WoW goes, everything gets deleted on the beta/PTR.
---
Where can we see the duel matches? The link posted on reddit is not working (anymore)
---
Insane but glorious:)))))
---
I have to agree with OP - everyone everywhere says go Ret.
---
for progression guilds what were the MC mats used for? fiery cores etc, leathers and whatever..
---
It's not nostalgia though. WoW Classic is a solid game and the reason MMO's got so popular.
---
You have just gave me a new motivation to enjoy even more classic
---
I'm probably gonna spec PvP while leveling so I can defend against would be gankers and gank same level competition. 
---
That means using the shatter combo, which is great for single targets but breaks aoe grinding using blizzard. Aoe grind is booring anyway and if I want to use it for some packs, it's possible without blizz although harder.
---
Leveling as a lock you shouldn't be life tapping much as they have very little downtime, and all warlocks get a spell for underwater breathing.
---
I like both tanking and DPS. Tanking is fun because it feels like you're the only thing standing between your group and certain death. It's a highly technical skillset and requires a lot of knowledge/nuances to do it well.  I also like DPS because it's fun to hit things and see big numbers.
---
Lol maybe, I just googled the phrase and that’s what came up, plus there is an add on called Altoholic used to manage all of your alts
---
You sound like a junkie trying for every argument possible to justify getting his dope ...
---
I expect to see you here 3 months after launch complaining that there's nothing to do, when's the next content patch ...
---
Azure silk belt is a legit item. I hadn't heard of the sword ever being used, but it could have some utillity for the PvP bracket at which it drops.
---
A warlock can put Curse of Doom on a player who is possessed by baroness in undead strat. 
---
If there aren't geared and you have at least decent blues it will one shot them when it goes off. 
---
Ask random players to help you summon,  summon a doomguard, act surprised when one of them dies.    Too surprised to enslave the doomguard.
---
Ask them to help you summon again, after they kill it, or die trying. 
---
-
---
Ask in global chat "How do you leave your guild?"
---
I guarantee you will get nasty rage messages. 
---
As priest, cast PW: Shield on your warrior tank EVERY time they start a pull instantly.
---
All the monsters will turn to charge you, and they won't be getting and damage rage. 
---
Bonus points if you snark about their agro management after the fourth or fifth time you do it. 
---
Don't dismiss your hunter pet when you jump off a ledge in a dungeon.  
---
Feign death, somewhere away from the doomed fools, as the wall of death rushes in to make sure you are the sole survivor. 
---
Ask for a rebuff before you feign if it's plausible, just to make SURE there is no escape for your clothies. 
---
Paladins should remain on the lookout for opportunities to BoP the warrior.
---
Never
---
This looks quite thick, perhaps there is a way to replace its component by modern ones. That would look pretty cool.
---
Probably easier than tinkering with modern laptops where everything is soldered together.
---
Listen I'm not going to argue the benefit of Feral Charge over marginal talent gains elsewhere. You can play your druid however you please and I'll do the same. Its about options available elsewhere. You lose out on some % of Rejuv Bonus, maybe the Regrowth Crit talent (since I'm not natures grace doesn't matter that much, I use swiftmend and HoTs for most of my healing) and threat reduction talents. So yeah, there's like 2-3 really good healing specs you can go and this is my favourite. The bonus in a pvp environment also helps, because the raids are easy and I'd rather be more effective outside of raids as well. It doesn't hinder my performance in raid so for me its all upside.
---
beautiful :')
---
Are you planning on tanking? Or being the guild tank more specifically?
---
I can definitely see both sides. Dude is a dick, plenty of them in wow; but the root cause is the streamer. Even though some streams show fun/useful clips, they are indeed a scourge
---
Ghana man I appreciate it
---
Exactly this. One of many reasons, sadly, that WoW went to shit.
---
Note that there was auto loot on the 1.12.1 client. Notably if you held shift and began interacting with something lootable, or a corpse with loot, it would auto loot all items.
---
yeah, that's the issue. on a fresh server (assuming you are leveling fast) you basically get 0 income from the AH, at least for most of the leveling process.
---
Yes, sick is a good word for my feelings. M+ is garbage and pure misconception, the raids are quite nice but you don't have the gear for it without m+. Not much else to do...
---
But Classic is too far away tbh, I guess I won't be hyped enough late August. I'm pretty tired of waiting now to be exact.
---
No, there was a 30 seconds waiting between matches, and then there was a rule against voluntary delaying during the match, I am sure because I remember it referred to rogues using stealth. I am trying to find the page with the rules..
---
Haha I know. This was just a joke. The manufacture date on this laptop predates WoW with a production year of 1995 
---
I’m gonna be playing WoW classic on a 35 inch, 1440p ultrawide monitor powered by a 1080ti ;)
---
Still runs good on a toaster apparently.
---
Lul I know you're joking but Tips didn't participate. Venruki won though.
---
&gt; Prot/Holy is fasted leveling and that's common knowledge. 
---
Without sitting for Reckoning being 100% reliable like on private servers, the only build if you want to level as fast as possible will be Retribution.
---
If you like leveling as Holy or Prot thats perfectly fine, but dont tell people it's the fastest. Because it isnt.
---
RemindMe! 84 Days
---
Tips out tapped out of his own competition he didn't want to embarrass the other warriors
---
Only person I fight on a regular basis who streams and doesn't roll with 5 pocket healers. He's gotten me several times and Ive turned around some of his ambushes pretty hard. He often gets me when I'm fighting mobs but that's just authentic.
---
Mad respect for him, and he seems pretty chill.
---
Venruki possibly shpuldnt have made it through the first round or at least should have replayed one of his first round duels as some retard alliance gnome ran in and ate a scatter shot during the last few seconds of a duel
---
I mean, you said it but it's fine. You cleared your view with the follow-up. I'm pretty sure everyone would like to see "wow2" with Classic rules always being in the core design but I simply don't trust Blizzard to do good wow content anymore. I know for sure I will enjoy Classic and tbc. I'd rather go for that instead of uncertain new Classic content.

Wed/Thur 9:30 p.m. - 12 a.m. PST    
---
Tue a possible 3rd day in Phase 4 with the release of 20 man content.    
---
We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.    
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.     
---
Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message.     
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.    
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.

Headstart at 60 for epic mount only counts if you can get to a good raw gold farm - there won't be hundreds of gold on the auction house until week 3 or 4.
---
No for me it’s nostalgia. I want to relive those moments and the good times I had 15 years ago. This is my opinion, so you trying to act as if your opinion is a scientific fact just looks weird. 
---
Also, MMOs were popular before WoW.
---
&gt;vodka ~~expressed~~
---
espresso :o
---
Lol I guess he does a few other people have said that too
---
Sure, it's possible, but then only one person is using it. The more they tell the more likely it gets leaked and then the entire relevant community will know in a day or two.
---
I have to agree. Raiding will happen, and classic will be there for as long as we need hopefully. The real gem will be experiencing the game again, not blasting to max so you can raid as in retail.
---
Classic and TBC are both better versions of the game than live, that would be my argument to play classic other than nostalgia. However, TBC/WotLK are expansions of the original game, so logistically the one that should be restarted should be the one that started the game. However, writing this, I wouldn't be opposed to actually have TBC and have the new content come out after that expansion. 
---
I figure that I just wouldn't want to end up playing the same game made in the spirit of vanilla.
---
I'm looking for the same qualities, please let me know if you find one
---
Biggest disadvantage is it simply won't work without friends boosting you. You'll have absolutely no gold to buy spells, you're gear will be trash, and you'll be **way** behind @ 10 then everyone else.
---
Imagine hitting 10 and trying to kill a lvl 8 cougar for your first quest you just picked up. You're be using a level 1 starting toon weapon, in no armor, using starting spells/abilities because you couldn't buy any, with a weapon skill of 1. You will get absolutely destroyed. 
---
The only way this would work is if you immediately group up with friends and let them carry you for a while, or if they send you some hard earned silver so you can buy your class abilities/gear (not gnna happen).
---
english might not be his first language but who cares about 1 spelling mistake on the internet, jesus.
---
BIG FACTS. Could possibly be an interesting project however the body/screen hinges on this thing have deteriorated to a point of no return.
---
She is THICCCCC though ;)
---
Nah don't tell me your names. I would never take them if you did but if someone else takes them you would always wonder if I was that asshat who took your name! haha. 
---
&gt; assuming you arent a kill joy who hates ay any name thats remotely pun related
---
lol I would never tell someone in game their name is terrible .... but I do prefer to name my own characters with something that could pass as a role-playing name. I just like to keep the fantasy as real as possible. Of course I will still see IRL names referencing things I personally find cool and I'll think "yeah, cool name!" haha.
---
I still put some of my alts in my cousin's guild that references his favorite sports team.
---
I plan to reuse some of my Vanilla names and I've made a list of a few additions.
---
Laying doesn’t effect the login.
---
That’s the server itself, you would already have a que before the layering was removed.
---
Good advice, a hunter is easy to learn harder to master, has cool RPG elements built around the pet, and is useful in all types of content.
---
I think that the main argument is why would you trust a company that has run this fanchise into the ground to make changes to Classic wow? They had 15 years to evolve the game and look at where we are now.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE to see extended vanilla content, but It's not going to happen for the following reasons:
---
1. Finance: It would cost millions of dollars in development costs to provide something that would not generate new players. Everyone who is interested in classic will play regardless and the people who aren't interested are not going to start playing because of some extra stuff. That would be a waste of money from Blizzard's perspective.
---
2. Risk: This ties in with my first point. By adding new elements Blizzard would risk player outrage and dissatisfaction on a huge scale. The selling point of Classic wow is that it is going to be exactly that. Classic. Wow. No changes. And the vast majority is very strict about it. People are already mad as hell because of the implementation of layering during the first months. So they would risk losing players without the chance of getting new players which from a financial stand point is a no-brainer bad decision.
---
3. Community: It seems like Blizzard is actively taking feedback from the community and the overwhelming consensus is "No changes to Classic!" So Blizzard would lose all the trust they've built up over the past months if they started adding things.
---
4. Better alternative: A majority of Classic fans are also TBC fans. TBC is probably the most unanimously celebrated expansion in wow history and for many the best wow has ever been. So it would be a safe and cost effective step for Blizzard to just add the already existing content while also satisfying the fanbase.
---
To sum up: Adding new Classic content would require significant investments without providing a financial benefit while at the same time significantly increasing the financial risk due to player dissatisfaction. Also they already have content that they don't have to develop and the community loves which is TBC. The smartest thing Blizzard can do is release Classic and later on an optional transition to TBC.
---
That would make an even better movie lmao
---
Because it's a good game which I haven't played when it was originally released?
---
There isn't any other reason. It's just a vastly more fun game for me than current WoW.
---
I played all the Warcrafts (I'm currently replaying them before Classic). I enjoyed them, especially 3 and the world was vibrant and fun. However I didn't play WoW because I'm usually not interested in multiplayer games.
---
However after a while I got really curious and did subscribe for a month. That was, unfortunately for me, 2 weeks before Cataclysm was released. Which was quite shocking. Just when I was getting comfortable a lot of things changed. And mostly for worse. The old world of Azeroth which I so much enjoyed was replaced. The new quests were uninteresting and the gameplay worse. I stopped subscribing.
---
Later I discovered private servers and I played on a WoTLK one. Run leveled up, run dungeons. But the friends I was playing with stopped and so did I. Even later I found a Vanilla private server. And it was fun! The slow leveling and hard dungeons, running all over the world. I really like the ambience of Vanilla WoW. I play to unwind, to relax. I can go at my own pace and can look forward to months and months of enjoyment.
---
But back to the Vanilla pserver. I stopped playing because of the bugs, pvp ganking and the lack of friends to play with. (It later closed anyway.)
---
Now I'm looking forward to Classic to finally enjoy it fully. I've even created a raiding guild. :)
---
There are no "old" games. Only good ones and bad ones. And Vanilla/Classic is a *very* good one. For me even Cata was boring and frustrating. Current WoW is bewildering. It's more of an action game with loot pinatas. The lore has jumped the shark, all content before the latest patch is broken and not enjoyable to play. Current WoW is basically Transmog and Mount collector simulator plus Mythic+ dungeon/raids. You either "play" completely alone in a pretty but mind numbingly boring world or you are forced to rush, rush, rush. Neither is appealing to me, especially because the story and lore is a total jumbled mess.
---
same, i also hated it when the duelers ran into the groups.

And launching with August 2006 1.12 catchup mob difficulty designed for 20 months after launch anyways,  
---
So you can aoe cleave every pack of elites without strategy or CC like its BFA,  
---
Where even a level 40 elite only hits a level 30 player for 5% to 10% HP.  
---
Ive asked and zero beta streamers are even interested in the difference,  
---
Between authentic 2004 mobs and scuffed 2006 mobs.  
---
Theyre more interested in power leveling and winning some duel tournament.  
---
So the narrative lives vanilla dungeons and players were a joke.
---
If you’re going the car route, [you may as well go all the way and get a gear shifter for your rank control](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005L0Z2BQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_X7s9CbHP5DA38).
---
Can’t say I’ve heard of the idea before- could use it to dictate which spell bar is displayed.
---
I would be in favour of completely overhauling any content that gets added to Classic instead of just redoing the old stuff. I'm also someone who loved BC when it was current, but I am aware enough of WoW's trajectory that I would not want to put it on that path a second time. Things like streamlined dungeons, the "power level reset" reset that has become tradition for every new xpac in WoW, flying - they were all part of BC, and I would not want to see any of those re-introduced.
---
That is not to say that BC didn't have its pros - like better playability of many specs - but all in all, I would be in favour of branching away from the old expansion model *if* that's gonna be a consideration down the road.
---
Yeah, same thing I'm talking about. You're facing away from the monster but your head is looking wherever your character's facing. That's definitely in retail, or at least it was when I last played the game in Legion. You're right in that it absolutely wasn't in vanilla though.
---
I'd be surprised if they changed it since it's baked into the new client and doesn't actually affect gameplay, but as you say, it might disorient people. Interested to see how that goes, I really wouldn't mind either way and it's definitely more "classic" to get rid.

Classic news network youtube channel

Like what? I haven't played since cataclysm.
---
Contribute when you have everything you need and can acquire your self, unless you are being handed out pots for raiding, then you need to chip in prior to that point.
---
1 Fireblast can be enough to sway a duel, if you watched the tourney many duels went down to the wire.
---
Did I say copious? Did you see their presentation from blizzcon last year?
---
Unlike in retal, you don’t select a specialization for your character, instead you distribute talent points between three talent trees. You gain 51 talent points in total when you reach lvl 60, and unlocking higher (and usually more powerful) talents and abilities requires a set amount of points to be spent in that particular talent tree. This enables a certain amount of “hybridization” between the talent trees, and while some builds focus mostly on a certain talent tree (PvE Resto Shamans being a perfect example), there are some classes with a certain flexibility when it comes to builds.
---
Depends on how much I like the guild im in lol
---
Nope, the powershift macro will work just fine. It was Blizzard adding the shapeshift abilities to the GCD that screwed it up.
---
These people are the people who ruined WoW, the everybody deserves a trophy bunch. They are offended they didn’t get beta access and they will be even more offended when classic launches and they remember how you had to work for everything in the game instead of having it handed to you for logging in.
---
I read that 4 times as ARE DEVILSAUR SOMETHING
---
and I Was like daaaamm, doing that with devilsaurs is top tier trolling.
---
Yeah, of course everyone should play they way they want to play.
---
But listing FC as a valuable utility druids bring is just inaccurate, borderline dishonest. In a raid setting, it’s virtually useless and costs 11 talent points which can be spent elsewhere for **much** more significant bonuses.
---
It’s definitely useful for soloing/PvP, but if we’re talking about raid utility, it’s a waste of points. :/
---
As someone who considered warlock. Yes i thought how great it would be to pass out healing roxks, rez rock, snd summon portals. Because a class is more than its damage. Its also the utility. 
---
The only thing rogues bring utilitywise is picking locks. And stealth, which is useless most of the time and useless all the time in world pve groups.
---
&gt;title should have been
---
No. If you wanted to avoid spoilers, why did you come to reddit?
---
Easy.
---
Uhmm..... what?
---
You must be new I suppose?
---
The individual servers usually have a queue to enter the server, especially at launch.
---
Layering allows multiple instances of the server to be up at the same time.
---
Removing those layers and making them into 1 (which is their plan before phase 2 starts) leaves the potential for crazy queues.
---
There will most likely be a login queue and then a small server queue (if any) while you get put on a layer on 8/26 8/27
---
I welcome guildbanks in classic, it makes sense to me, as the alternative often involves breaking the ToS.
---
Jesus you people are such scumfucks
---
How does it change anything about Raid Utility? If anything it adds a longer stun and gives u an interupt, vs what exactly? I'm not seeing your point.
---
Haha. Always mess that one up
---
I could play TBC forever
---
I expect to tank for the guild.
---
They should just go ahead and make 1-10 free in classic, 1-10 is enough to get a feel of classic.
---
Yes, but haven't committed it to memory. I'm going off of current closed beta that's capped at 30 for the moment.
---
They have the ability to pull in 10s of thousands of players if they needed testing other than stress testing.
---
And yet they don't do it.
---
As a fellow altaholic this speaks to me on a personal level.
---
This is some real friendship that you went to all the effort to make this for him.
---
He should do an AMA  being the first infamous troll of the newage vanilla.
---
It’s basically Diablo 3.5. Keep doing the same thing over again and RNG will get you top level gear. Now it’s to the point you can pug a mythic 10 without even communicating because everyone is ilvl 400+ just by logging in.

---
Ahh i see thanks, seems a lot cooler than the retail spec system.
---
That's not my recollection.  Unlike Gnomer, ST had gear people wanted at 60.
---
There are certainly people that want new content, but there's also a whoooole lot of people who want BC. Usually in the polls on this sub it's a fairly even split. Hell, a lot of the people I play games with will *only* play classic if/when BC is announced. 
---
It's a known quantity, that's why people want it. We *know* how good (or bad, if you're weird) BC was. What we don't know is if current Blizzard can make new vanilla content in the 2004 spirit that's any good without filling it with loads of the shit that makes retail bad. It's risky. They also *cannot* forcibly upgrade the game for everybody, Classic needs to stay classic, so to have BC and new content you'd have to have 3 server types which gets messy.
---
I'm a big fan of tri-spec priest healers over paladins for BG healing - they get to dispel, fear bomb and silence while still throwing out strong heals and mana-burning paladins into the ground. Lacks the spam healing of the other classes but makes up for it in extra utility. You even get a cheap aoe for flushing out rogues.
---
I was planning on vendoring low level leather just for some extra gold during the leveling process. It might be drops in the buckets compared to the nearly 1k needed for an epic mount, but anything helps.
---
If you want something easy to level. Play a combat rogue. You can solo your way to 60 really easily. However rogues usually suck at 60 because they’re hard to find raids with. If you want a class that’s viable at 60, level a priest, shaman or paladin. You’ll always be able to get in raids.
---
Hahahah
---
I love my cousin man, he's the shit! even though he can't decide on what to be for classic
---
kind of a catch 22 as most gold would be spent on repairing the tanks gear, so either you will need a lot of gold and want to keep it, or some guild funds will go to you
---
But it's all about accessibility!!!
---
...lol, glad that people will be able to go back to bfa with the same subscription after they realize they won't get an epic mount after 5 days of farming or 60 after playing 5 hours a day for 20 days straight. 
---
It's going to be beautiful :)
---
Doubt it. Fun detected.
---
Are you saying that this topic is not posted every 30 minuts? because it is. 
---
Are you saying that account sharing isnt breaking the ToS? because it is.
---
Alas, I am not making anything "up".
---
if this was confirmed, the front page would be nothing but posts about it. sorry.
---
Then you should know that testing is needed. And somewhere, someone apparently decided that the amount of testers they have currently is enough for now.
---
... and that's a compliment right?  At least it's not a scrapbook.
---
And this is why the world is empty.
---
New players level somewhat slow, and old players have a huge boost to experience, access to lfight paths, lvl 1 mounts, etc.
---
In vanilla and TBC, when you were leveling you would find a player at your zone +/- 2 lvls, and you will find him again on the next day. Now with all this that other player can advance at a pace that you can't follow, making any interaction impossible.
---
I am so ready for classic to come out I think I’ve finally decided that I may quit retail for classic now.
---
Have a lvl 1 in Booty bay, that punches everyone with thorns buff.
---
I was already very hype for Classic, but this post just makes me hard as fuck. :)
---
Literally everything shit about the game now will be treated as the best thing ever in classic until the honeymoon phase wears off. This game's path with follow OSRS very closely; that's my guess.
---
It’s just a game dude, holy shit, I’m cringing at all of the people getting so angry over this. Take a step back and take a few deep breaths man - it’s literally a video game. I know I’ll get downvoted for this comment but jeez...
---
Oh yeah!
---
I was hoping staysafe or esfand would duel the winner
---
never subbing to bfa, I can wait.
---
I don’t disagree that it can have a larger impact, but I seriously doubt the people going and farming newbies in low level areas are there for “the greater good”. Most of these folks that I’ve seen have just been trolls trying to ruin other people’s time in the game to get their daily dose of attention. It’s a part of the game, and if you roll on a PvP server you should expect to have to deal with it, but let’s not pretend that the vast majority of gankers are going at it with noble intentions.
---
Trinket for lock removes fear sleep charm. It doesn’t resist stuns. Wotf is good and undead is good. Orc is hands down the best pvp race for lock
---
There'll be enough on auction house that you won't need to worry about it. Herbalism still isn't a bad profession choice though.
---
Mages can level in 4 days with no quests after the early 20s.
---
Well skinning is good for 40 mount, after that I plan on changing it to one of my main professions, probably enchanting.
---
Not too sure the gold making ability with leather after 40. I'm sure it will be in demand since it will be fresh but I don't know if vendoring the higher leather would be worth it.
---
What are you stunning and interrupting as a Druid healer in a raid setting?
---
And you’re missing out on 11 points invested in more resto-relevant talents... not super sure why you’re choosing to die on this hill. Feral/resto hybrid specs are fine for PvP or raiding if you’re broke and can’t afford to respec for raid night. But there’s no argument for those specs being better for raiding than a pure resto build...
---
This is 100 percent false. For pvp the stun resist is much better than wotf for a lock
---
And what about needing to go out into the world to farm mats etc for raiding? is that also ok or you always need to be in decent sized groups?
---
That bridge in Azshara for example
---
Naw. Breaking a fear every 2 mins is useless versus several classes. Resisting 30% stuns all the time is good against all classes with engineering. If a class can be an orc in pvp you should 100% roll orc. 
---
I will be rolling undead because spooky boi locks are better than hunched over frog locks.
---
Arenas didn’t come until BC correct?
---
it's under the map
---
Nah, just logged onto my retail characters and tested it. Isn't functioning that way there.  Think its a strange interation between new client and older models.  Who the hell downvoted me?
---
Harassment and griefing are against ToS. We used to use it on RP servers all the time to get people to stop doing exactly this Trollgodx stuff at our events.
---
Trust me, the bar for action is high. I'm talking spamming chat/aoe for 30 minutes or more, spamming invites, trades, etc.
---
Also it doesn't count pvp, pvp actions such as the funeral crashing are not griefing. However according to ToS, corpse camping a specific player for hours on end can be actioned. It's up to GM discretion.
---
It's a good rule and they were right to action this player. Frankly I'm surprised it took so long, considering a GM would have certainly been watching everything.
---
Don't worry, you can be plenty mean to people in Classic. You just can't do it to an absurd, hours-long level.
---
I had crabs once.  That was a similar situation.
---
Pilav
---
&gt;  No intentional delays will be permitted (i.e., rogues intentionally stealthing for minutes to reset CDs). **Any non-strategic acts whose sole purpose is to delay** a duel will result in the forfeit of the duel by the delayer.
---
The bold part will be the caveat there - using clever polymorph, kiting, and healing, for example, would be permitted under these rules.
---
I'd rather them release a separate tbc server so the people who want to keep playing classic can.
---
Ditto, the best way for this to get fixed would be a little side-by-side video showing the differences.  Haven't seen anything though myself.
---
You won't even be able to equip the weapon without the 2h weapon training at level 10. Which also costs 10 silver. 
---
I'll stick with 1 hander+shield until a decent quest reward or drop.
---
I mean, both soda (cat form) and cdew are melee characters, so they don’t really have a choice. They have to follow their opponent wherever their opponent goes, even if its to the edge.
---
At least provide a link or this is just spam.
---
Everyone should level a rogue to at least 19. They're very fun. But then, all the classes in vanilla were unique.
---
84 days out with a public message saying "the invites for beta are rapidly decaying since we have the amount of testers we need as we build up to launch"
---
Beta is up and running, of course "testing is needed" 
---
- they just won't be inviting or opening servers for new testers because they don't need to.
---
Yes I can't wait to be apart of it. I just hope there aren't hours and hours of disconnects and we can at least experience it, even if we can't tag any mobs to level haha. I'm thinking Blizzard might be underestimating how many people are going to be logging in that first week.
---
Nah its pretty common and well practiced courtesy on reddit and many other places to not post spoilers out in the open
---
Alliance scum.
---
I've found a few with this. Good tool.
---
we shall see blizz is not even open yet, they are west coast
---
Unsubstantiated rumour so far.
---
They already confirmed that they won't be adding many more people to the beta, so even if more keys go out, don't hold your breath.
---
LOL ok. This isnt even remotely controversial or has it been in any expansion.
---
Ah you're right, trolls and I think undead start with 1 handers. Tauren and orcs, however, start with 2h training, and this strat still applies to them.
---
Shhhhh don't even hint at that, people will hunt you down on this sub... "blizzard knows exactly what they are doing" smile.
---
What is M+?
---
Someone did an analysis and found the time spent actually skinning the mobs ended up not even being worth the time you're better off just rushing to max level and solo grinding dungeons.
---
I know... i was horde till this beta and my irl friends want to play alliance so I’m using this to learn that side. It was nice being around the horde again
---
if you don't have engineering you've put a handicap on yourself
---
&gt;Paladins are best PVP healers : they can't die,
---
Only because bubble could not be dispelled back then.  But after it is down, one kick/pummel/counterspell kills them.  All and you needed counter them in general was force an early bubble.  One rogue could force it on their own, but a sheep followed by a fear.  That or have a priest mana burn them.  They would have to bubble, or be rendered completely useless once they had no mana.
---
See a psychologist

No one owns King.

---
Lmao that’s what I’m saying. The butthurt neckbeards are in full force today, watching hours and hours of streams and getting upset at some dude messing around in the beta. These people clearly need to reevaluate what is important to them and what gets them upset.
---
Priests should have no downtime when leveling. Spirit tap baby!
---
If you roll a Warrior, it would be the best idea to join a promising guild early, establish yourself as a good tank and mooch off the rest of the guild for gold, a good and loyal tank is a great investment and a lot of players would support your effort.  
---
Playing a Warrior is expensive, so I wouldn’t really give away my money, especially for leatherworkers whose main resource is going to be the cheapest on the market due to high initial supply.
---
You can definitely pickpocket enough to either get enough swiftthistle or enough gold from it to buy what you’re need. Still not a bad choice though.
---
Classic servers will be turned into TBC servers. or i'll eat my shoe
---
I'm in the beta and there are a fuck ton of bugs being reported.
---
I'm saying the differences are so marginal its actually not worth arguing over. So small in fact that I feel like what you're gaining doesn't really impact performance. I was topping heals on 4H and Dance Dance Revolution so druid still has its fights regardless of spec. As long as I have Swiftmend and NS I can perform just as well as any other druid.
---
Do they make monitors that large without bezel?
---
I haven't played since Wrath.  I only played S1, S2, S5, S6 and only didn't get Glad S5.  I got Merciless Glad S2, but in a small battlegroup.  I have an AJ profile that can prove it, but they don't show my merciless glad because I sold the account pretty much immediately.
---
I guess that's the tough part. Maybe I'll just vendor leather until I have my 40 mount and then after that I'll try to help out.
---
Because WoW in its current form isnt really MMORPG, its just RPG that happens to be online, so you can co-op if you really want. It's only the endgame that is still MMORPG. Makes you wonder why with every expansion they keep adding new quests and lvls.. 99% of the players considers it a chore anyway.
---
We want old school mmo's back. The grindfests, the organic interaction with the world and its players, the goofyness, etc. The biggest gripe I think with current state mmorpg's is that nothing matters. Classic is a hard reset, and its a reset we need in the genre as a whole. Somewhere along the way mmorpg's lost their identity in favor of demands of a vocal minority, in favor of shareholders, in favor of change for change's sake.
---
Mainly a pvp tool to distract/drain your opponents teams. Affliction locks are all about dotting up everything in sight (with the exception of targets that need to be CC'd if you're doing coordinated PVP.) 
---
It might be worth it to use it on 5 man boss encounters because every little bit of damage helps. Just be careful when it comes to aggro. I leveled as an affliction lock back in vanilla and this worked for me.
---
there were rumors that more were happening today
---
we really dont know
---
its 7:45am on the west coast so we can only wait and see
---
To be fair, warriors had no chance at level 30. They need pummel, berserker rage, and more talent points to be competitive (since tactical mastery is mandatory in PvP)
---
This is a great sales pitch. Maybe if you show it to blizzard they'll consider making a classic version of the game for us.
---
&gt; I have stress test access
---
Not no more. :(
---
Yes. But only Family &amp; Friends. So I asume, Random players are out of luck.
---
you can also create your characters looks and all, just wont be able to Enter World
---
Everyone saying that it is not bothersome at all has never been raid wiped by another raid. On the other hand wiping an enemy raid is super fun. It primarily depends on your understanding of "fun". If you are a little bitch that gets all whiny and upset because you are forced to pvp for half an hour to an hour before you can start raiding then yes, it is gonna be very frustrating for you every now and then. I personally think that it makes the world feel more alive and dynamic.
---
Farming mats is actually better, because you can kill all those assholes that are taking all your shit. Honsetly I hated people from my own faction much more due to the fact that I couldn't just kill em even though I really wanted to. But hey, getting killed by the enemy faction is ofc part of the equation so same thing applies as with my first point regarding being a whiny little bitch.
---
So here's my guidance: Just play PVP and go big dick down their throat, but expect to be choking on one every now and then yourself. If you don't like the sound of that then roll on a PVE server or just play retail if you don't want any interaction with the enemy faction.
---
Mostly agree but wrong about hs. Its bonus damage to your weapon strike just like MS. The difference in damage between HS and MS is less than 2%. HS and rend both have their place before slam or MS.
---
Today apparently is last friends and family.
---
84 days away, invites are done - time to stop looking for access and just accept the only classic experience you'll have will be the chaos at launch :) see ya there papa!
---
MW2 is the most fun I've ever had playing an FPS
---
Hooray, flying! Poggggggers!
---
Exploration was a HUGE part of the experience for me. I spent so much time wandering around dying, rezzing, corpse running.
---
Once I learned how to wall walk, the amount of time i spent exploring easily tripled. 
---
I can't wait to open up the map again, get those new flight paths, find new fishing areas etc.
---
Here in Canada, wages have not increased with inflation. The price of subscription has gone from 15-20$. It's not cheaper, it's more expensive.
---
Dungeons with variable difficulty. Nice idea, but not only the mobs and bosses are stronger with each difficulty, there are so-called affixes. Some affixes are quite funny, but there affixes that ruin the good aspects, especially in some combinations.
---
I approve comrade.
---
highly suggest keeping skinning until you get the 60 mount.
---
make a bank alt or three and just store potions, food and other BoE items on them and save the old bop items on the main char until then.
---
skinning is great at 55+ for profit....even if you need to kill greys to get tons of skinning supplies.
---
It's only one quest you get from killing a single mob and you never really need it anyway considering you can just kind of walk in through badlands.
---
Definitely priest for me as well. You get the option to spec all sorts of different ways to decide what you want to do.
---
Correct.
---
Yeah this is what I’ve been thinking. I was thinking skinning/enchanting to de everything as I go and AH the dust/essence. Then chose mining/engi later in the game. What would you do with skinning if you’re just going to drop it ?
---
Friends and family, just accept you'll get to experience the chaos 8/26 / 8/27
---
I guess you do have solid points, but I'd guess that if it does very well (maybe more profitable than live) it'd be a sound option to expand on the content that's most productive. 
---
I'm realizing that it comes down to what you've stated and that Blizzard has lost the trust of its player base. Not many people have the faith that the company can deliver awesome new content if the case was ever to happen. They'd much rather play the original TBC than take the risk of new content that may suffer from the same things that plague live.
---
Always roll UD. Always.
---

---
Pallys are kinda outstanding as they are tanky healers
---
I don't think it will be as chaotic as people seem. Well I'm hopeful anyways
---
Maybe I'll just be selfish in terms of gold and selfless in terms of grouping up and helping out. I've joined a guild that's in its planning stages and I'd like to make some friends and solidify a spot in their raid group.
---
Much of the fun for me when I played vanilla was getting to a new zone and looking for flight masters. 
---
You used flight paths a lot more in vanilla, 1 because you couldn’t fly and 2 because you had 1 hearthstone (not 3 if you have your garrison and Dalaran stones) and it had a 1 hour cooldown, so using flight paths was far more necessary and made finding the flight master in the zone so much more rewarding. 
---
Not really understanding the game for the first year or so that I played (was 13 and had no idea about bis, rotations, yada yada) I spent much of my time exploring, and this was what I had to show for progress. I can’t wait to see all the old faces and beautiful places I remember from that journey.
---
Why would you assume I have never been anywhere near it?  Rank 14 means nothing because it's all about time spent.  You can make it easier by winning a lot, but you will still lose to some chinese person playing 22 hours a day.
---
Provide a link to anything that said this please.
---
Yep, no problem!  Someone who doesn't know, but is willing to learn is perfectly fine.  We were all there once.
---
Someone who doesn't know, and refuses to learn, is doomed to fail for all eternity.
---
As far as I know, there's always better swords/daggers in every patch for rogue. I raided pservers, but never cleared AQ40 so can't speak from full experience. Obviously if you get carried or otherwise have a bad wep, a mace can still be an upgrade, I just don't think it's ever best in slot
---
Thanks for taking the time to write it all down and share your adventure with us, that was a satisfying read. Hope you had recovered well from your injuries. 
---
Also, your screenshots looks great!
---
this made me sad =(
---
Wow learn something new all the time. I figured it was the same for everyone. I always play human/gnome lol.
---
tis just a rumor
---
How bug free have your experience been this far?
---
Yeah, I remember getting ganked in Stranglethorn Vale and don't want a repeat of that. The only thing I could do was to just log in to an alt or wait till the gankers gave up.
---
I think that was one of their old April Fools jokes.
---
One example is Hunter's Mark. The classic client seem to have both the little red arrow bouncing ontop of your head and the red crosshair pulsating around you. The problem is that the crosshair is constantly pulsating. I dont think it was like this back in vanilla, either its one pulse on application of Hunter's Mark, or no pulsation at all, just the arrow.
---
On private servers its one pulsation on application and no more.
---
Your inability to see why they might only need 2,000 testers rather than, say, 20,000 lines up with your belief that the game doesn't need testing "because it's 15 years old".
---
You have no idea what you're talking about man, let it go.
---
I know for certain that dwarf starts with 2h, but I'm not too familiar with night elf.
---
I think they only appear on the map up until they cross halfwayish across the map towards their own base.
---
Thousands of players with servers only fitting so many, mobs have a 5 minute respawn timer (unless they are killed quick with a lot of people around) then it goes down to a 2 minute respawn timer.
---
Tagged mobs aren't global. You don't get the tag, you don't get credit.
---
Also, layering.
---
LW won't need the skins for anything pre-40, the only time you need to farm skins is around rugged.
---
Just ask them post 40 when you already have your basic mount, and see if any of them want to set up a CoD. Just request the same amount you'd get from the vendors, or maybe a little bit extra. There's so much surplus leather no one will really care if you vendor it.
---
Different experiences, I'm not going to argue about that.
---
On one server in a timespan of 2 Days as a fresh 60 warrior. Ironfoe and hoj on first run and felstriker on second ubrs
---
Tons of health potions as well.
---
Did they keep it like this in the new classic? I really hope its all hardmode again
---
guild banks
---
I can understand that. I remember that was the biggest complaint when it was happening. 
---
I guess the good thing was it didn’t last too long. I can’t remember the exact time but I feel like it was two weeks? I’m not sure. 
---
But I would imagine if they did something to honor the corrupted blood incident it wouldn’t go on but for a couple of days. Just so it didn’t get too annoying.
---
Looking forward to seeing everyone at launch! organized chaos, and i can't wait.  I started in summer of 2006, and with classic coming i have the same excitment i did back in the day, can't wait to come home and play.  84 days is to far away!!!
---
Look, not trying to be a dick here, but if you're having troubles coughing up 15 bucks a month for a video game, you should really be focusing your wow playing time on working more/earning more money instead of gaming; your priorities are fucked.
---
if this happens to you, have the raid leader move them to their own separate party
---
I love that you keep dodging the question of exactly which encounters an increased stun duration or interrupt is useful on.
---
Virtually any 11 points spent in the resto tree are more useful than spending them on getting FC when talking about raid performance. FC is just not useful in a raid setting. If I am wrong, please give me explicit examples of encounters where having an interrupt on a resto Druid is useful.
---
I'm on holiday when it releases so I'm glad I'm not involved
---
#nochanges is insufferable
---
Hi, /u/Shrepto1
---
Was trying to screw me over your mission? I'm the guy who has been gang stalked for 6 1/2 years and tormented by hackers. Am I reading too much into your cryptic message or am I hitting the mark?
---
 **&lt;Revelations&gt;** \- Alliance NA PVE - Semi-Hardcore Raiding Guild wants YOU!   
---
Greetings fellow Classic Wow Community!    
---
**&lt;Revelations&gt;** is looking to form a fully fledged (18+) raiding guild at the official launch of WoW Classic with the ultimate aim of raid progression and clearing on an NA PVE server as Alliance.     
---
I am also looking for experienced/veteran players to fill leadership roles within the guild so veteran players, as well as new players, are encouraged to apply. (those looking for leadership roles please note it in the application). \[not everyone will be chosen for leadership roles that apply for them nor will leaders be chosen immediately\] Currently, loot is planned on being distributed via a hybrid loot council system. Based on many factors including loyalty, veterancy, attendance, contribution, etc.   
---
Raid Leader is going to be filled by myself as an experienced vanilla veteran but I'd be willing to pass that torch to someone more qualified. If this sounds like a good fit for you please feel free to stop by our discord and grab more information and also to submit guild applications, thank you.   
---
[https://discord.gg/5f4uZ3v](https://discord.gg/5f4uZ3v)
---
Exactly yea, theres a reason mages do AOE DM:N runs for the Greys on the Beasts in there. They sell so well!
---
Zero mention of how many bugs you reported. You do understand that you were invited to beta test, not just play for free right?
---
My mistake, you're right it was 16. Guess my dream of rolling lock is, indeed, shattered.
---
Can't decide between skinning and herb or skinning and lw
---
Well, let’s talk about “summer” for a moment because August 26th/27th is as last minute as you could be and still say you released in the summer.
---
Most of the in game screenshots, excluding the few first ones are from 2004.
---
I have access to a 2003 alpha and much of the world we can see in these screenshots isn't built yet
---
While leveling, just go dps, you can heal every dungeon until like 55\~ without respecing.   
---
That said, for farming herbs, druid are awesome, they have roots and hibernate + travel form to get out of agro radius, its one of the best herb farmers. Herb farming should certainly not be overlooked as far as farming goes, everyone needs tons of consumables even if just for resistance potions so the value is always decent, and if you get into a crew that times all the black lotus spawns you can often get it on lockdown with a few other people. It turns into a fun mini game to control the spawns.
---
Remember that dust/essence is going to be worth less than just vendoring or AHing the greens for a while. Hardly anyone will be buying enchanting mats until they have some bank roll themselves.
---
Personally I'm keeping skinning until I can farm enough devilsaur leather for myself (and maybe a little extra to bank for later) and then drop it for engi.
---
You have to think about your primary enemy. If you're a warlock, you're weak to Rogues, so you should want the stun resist. If you're a Rogue, your primary enemy is Warlocks, so you want WOTF to break the fear.
---
What you doing for secondary ?
---
Even on the 'megaservers' (10k people on at a time) you can still farm.  It's just a lot more crowded.  Usually people somewhat peacefully coexist until a fight breaks out, then it can snowball.
---
Who on horde was acting up?
---
A lot of private server dudes overplay the knowledge they have in general. 
---
The top 3 were high end arena players on live.
---
DoT's are great in 5 mans, but you need to know how to use them...along with the group.
---
If the whole group is on one mob but the tank has aggro on another, dot the mob that nobody is on.... IF the tank can hold aggro.
---
If the whole group is attacking one mob at a time, its really not worth dotting unless the mob lasts for more than 12 seconds. Just spam the DD/wand otherwise.
---
DoT's in pvp are great to keep pressure on the enemy healers.
---
are.... are these flavor texts real...
---
I don't know if this will make you feel any better but I am in beta and there isn't much to do. I got level 30, ran a few dungeons, but none of my friends are able to play with me so I really don't have a reason to log on. I'm looking forward to release as much as anyone else
---
hope they fix
---
OP suggested inviting more people to the beta and/or opening a server.
---
The line that it doesn't need testing is about the fact they don't need a more testers 84 days away from launch for a game that they have already released 15 years ago...
---
They made the fucking game lol, and played it... they know what they need to test for and how to test it.
---
If they needed more testers they would add
---
And oh fuckin wait, they actually did the opposite and said they don't need anymore.
---
Adding on to the pointlessness of OPs suggestion/ request.
---
Have a wonderful day catakid 👍
---
I think everyone will be leveling and trying to get their epic mounts when they get to 60! Thats the 1st priority. Worry about the guilds needs once you are 60 and are working towards something. 
---
Everyone in the guild will be thinking likewise. Even the crafters will not expect free mats. they'll be happy to craft things for free if you provide the mats, cos they might get skill ups.
---
that was how it worked off the bat, I don't remember which patch it was that they added consecutive flight paths but I'm pretty sure it was a point by point system originally.
---
It was undoubtedly a lot of work to organize an event like that.  And it was actually successful.  The guy deserves credit for that.
---
the only people who acted up were horde players, apparently trollgodx. it doesnt matter what hs name is
---
You just need a pocket druid for innervate. We have a  balance druid meme in my guild and I made friends with him immediately. Since he doesnt heal people forget he has other druid things.
---
Pickpocket lockboxes also have a change to drop the level 40 Epic dagger Gut Ripper. I was able to farm 3 by pickpocketing the various ogres in Feralas back in the day.
---
I'm hoping to experience Vanilla for a while. After that, I'd prefer new content in the same spirit of Classic instead of moving onto TBC. However, that said, everyone who loves TBC is in their right to want to experience that again. Everyone who wanted to experience Vanilla again has a valid interest. Everyone who wants to experience TBC again is the same way.
---
I want something different than they do, only time will tell what happens. We might get permanent Classic. We might get TBC. We might get new content like OSRS did. Hard to say what will happen this early on.
---
my old classic guild, we raided a lot, but we also trolled a lot. Maybe it is the PvP mindset but having a wedding? No you are not, we crashing it with no survivors. Getting out of BG's at Thunder Bluff? Fantastic now my priest is MCing you off a cliff and when you and your friends rush me because who doesn't want to crush on some clothy human, my stealthed rogue friends will get you.
---
Oh and welcome to Stranglethorn Vietnam. Here Charlie don't surf, he ganks your lowbie ass then tea bags your dead face while you nerdrage because you can't complete those panther/tiger/raptor quests.
---
Burning crusade was better than classic, change my mind
---
Nobody cares about you dude.
---
Hi, /u/wakeor
---
I thought that wasn't out yet? Or are you playing the Alpha?
---
I've only looked at a little bit of stuff so far on Torchlight Frontiers. Shame about micro-transactions tbh.
---
I was a huge fan of the previous Torchlight games, but from what I've seen on this one so far, I'm not too interested.
---
r/anthemthegame has 184k members, and that game is completely dead and devoid of any community.
---
Just keeping it in perspective.
---
Lok'tar Ogar 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
---
Jesus you sound like a miserable prick
---
[Acting like this man can lose.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8BOIzbU8AAB1yp.png)
---
All top guilds will roll on a pvp server.
---
Real and true...
---
I'm sorry. Misery loves company. :(
---
 I think we're just gonna agree to disagree here, thanks for the conversation.
---
God damn, every day there is another valid point for what made the game so satisfying.
---
I lost my faith in these "nochanges" dudes after they demand spell lagging into the game. I mean spell batching into the game. Its so ridiculous
---
lmfao
---
Yes or at least it should - it's a heal and should be expected to generate threat.
---
There used to a DoT bug in /duel way back. I used to apply SW:P on someone right before I would defeat them and the DoT would remain and they'd actually die when it ticked after the duel at low health.
---
I'll keep that in mind, I wasn't sure how much demand there would be for lower level leathers.
---
Setting up a CoD system might be a pretty good intermediate option. That's a solid suggestion, thank you!
---
You're in high end premade territory here.
---
The problem with druids and shaman is they don't have a defensive dispell, so they're useless when your warrior is sheeped, novaed etc

---
What’s the garbage pile on the ground supposed to be?
---
Man as much as I love these I don't want any changes to compromise my experience. Maybe if they have a feature where I can copy my character like in a PTR and have on stay at 60 on 1.12 and one on 1.13 if they make without losing my original character then I'd be happy to enjoy new  things
---
Jesus the nerve of some people...
---
1. You think they don't have dedicated people testing the game full time?
---
2. There are like 30 streamers or so. The majority of the other streamers actually just started streaming BECAUSE of the beta and not the other way round.
---
3. It's not a "new" expansions. It's literally 15 years old and has been tested for years. There will be no changes to balancing anyway and vanilla wow was buggy to begin with since we are talking about the "classic" experience.
---
4. Stess test is exactly that. Stress. Test. They are literally testing the limits of their servers in order to calculate how many people can start out in a zone/ on one layer simultaniously without everything going to shit.
---
5. Vanilla had no dynamic respawns so enjoy reporting it as a bug on release.
---
6. More people playing the beta will not improve anything because there is only a limited amount of developers anyway. Say we have like 2000 beta testers now. Every one of em reports 5 bugs a day. That's 10k reports the developers have to go through. I'm pretty sure they can't even handle that due to limited manpower, now imagine adding shit on top of that. Like just turn your brain on for a second.
---
The actuall thing you want to say is "Please invite more people to the beta, so I can get another chance to get into the beta pleaaaaassee Blizzard, I'll even suck your dick down to the base".
---
Mana regen only kicks in if you spend 5 secs without casting a spell and Shamans don’t have any talents which gave them passive mana regen from Spirit. As a Shaman your main role is going to be topping off the raid via Chain Heals and making sure your Totems are up, so you are going to be casting almost constantly and won’t benefit from the 5 sec-rule.
---
The mailing items won’t work they are keeping the open all mail features that’s in classic.
---
lol, Okedoke.
---
So in summation, You can’t list a single encounter where FC is useful. Noted. :D
---
PVP healing &gt; PVP dps &gt; PVE healing &gt; PVE tanking = PVE dps. I can't stand PVE dps, all you really do is spam your 2-3 button rotation while watching a threat meter whilst hoping nobody else screws up. Healing is a bit better cause at least you can let people die if you don't like them.
---
PVP healing is definitely the most fun for me since it's much less predictable and you often find yourself in a position where you're DPSing to stay alive.
---
I would welcome guildbanks in classic aswell. The fact that you have ONE (1) person in charge of the whole guilds riches never sat well with me, too many times they became corrupt and used the gold/items themselves.
---
With an in-game guildbank, everyone can see who withdrew what and who donated what. Clears up confusion and builds trust.
---
Buy low and sell high. Buy mats and make stuff when it’s profitable. Buy rare mats from far away vendors and auction them. DE auction house items when it’s profitable. Shout in trade for your services like bags (very helpful), enchants and portals. Level a little slower and clear all the quests in an area before you move on. 
---
There are way more BOE drops and material drops in vanilla so you can farm those. Gather and mine especially in dungeons. Sell fish and meats to people leveling cooking. All white items have value. Learn what everything is worth. 
---
Spend very little. Don’t buy gear on the AH. Don’t use potions when leveling. Don’t sell valuable things to vendors. Don’t buy skills and spells you don’t need. Only train what you can use or profit from. Don’t respec until you’re max level. Try not to buy food or drink or use bandages (it really adds up). 
---
There’s more but that’s all I can think of for now.
---
I don't take pleasure from ganking lowbies I really don't, it's baiting their mains and other max levels is what I'm after.  But sometimes if you want to make an omelette you need to break a few eggs.
---
Wasnt there like a 16CD Version of classic wow first? I remember having a HUGE CD tray Almost full of them because me and my brother both bought it.
---
I forget if it was changed by 1.12, but there was a quest that would give you a debuff that temporarily made you hostile to the Horde. If you never finished the quest and just abandoned/restarted it you could do it when you wanted to.
---
Almost completely bug free actually. I have reported like two very small things that I can barely even remember.
---
It will be fun, especially when there is already a pre-determined market list that's shows what is in demand.
---
Just because there is zero mention does not mean I didn't do it. My experience has been almost completely bug free, I can't just make up bugs to send to them... The couple of things I ran into I definitely mentioned, nothing that was worth even noting though.... no need to be rude, this is completely not needed.
---
Not if you plug CRTs the size of Labradors.
---
What is the point of the swim speed belt when you can just use the azure water strider??? 
---
/s
---
Trollgodx did nothing wrong.
---
Nah, people organized for things in pvp zones, it's not impossible. Hold it near a neutral town, and have scouts warn of ganking raids. It's a tournament, not a wedding.
---
&gt;I am genuinely curious if there will be studies on how an economy will form from nothing at that start.
---
Because that opportunity is so rare they have to pick classic wow for their research?
---
I forgot about that. It is known what is needed and how to obtain it. I wonder how that will effect prices in the beginning. Knowing people won't have the gold, will prices be lower then ramp up as time goes on?
---
This is why we call it [World of Roguecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw)
---
Ven also got lucky (or rather the hunter got unlucky) that the random gnome got scattered instead of him. Cant remember if it was 1-1 or not but he should have lost that one -- still mega props to him, has such a small chance of winning vs warlock and he nailed it
---
No it’s not. Blizz listening to whiny min/maxers is the real problem.
---
I guess my thing is, I want to be able to play Ret and provide the utility/off healing when needed and also do some DPS as well. I'm OK with being at the bottom half of the charts if it means I'm still providing utility and all that. Ideally looking for a non-hardcore/casual guild since I'm in no rush to get W1st kills, etc.
---
You mean like when the alliance warlock started to use Drain Soul on Venruki, not once - but TWICE in the middle of a duel because he was flagged?
---
Yeah, the Alliance was the only faction that DINDU NUFFIN!
---
how long will the beta last ? until the release in august ?
---
Yeah, point me to the part where **I** said they need more testers. I'm just calling you out for not understanding how software works. It's fine to admit you don't know the difference between a 2006 client and a 2019 client interpreting 2006 data. It's really simple, but not everyone will get it, it's okay.
---
Out of curiosity, what do you feel like you’re missing out on by picking PvE instead of PvP? It seems like the whole reason to be on a PvP server is to attack random people who aren’t suspecting it, whether you do it at your own level or kill lowbies. If you’re looking for an “honorable duel” in the open world then at least on a PvE server you can be sure that anyone who’s flagged is ready and waiting for it. I’m not defending the gankers- i dislike it as much as anyone else- but as someone who is very decidedly going to pick a PvE server for classic I never understood the fascination with PvP servers unless you’re looking to either have this shit done to you or you’re looking to do it to others.
---
There was a player (I prefer not to name anyone) using that strategy and during one match he said  "..now my cds are back..". To me that is proof of an intentional delay. Maybe I'm wrong, it's just how it felt to me.
---
Enjoy another 2 month grind to 60.
---
Well then stop wasting your time commenting with your lofty too cool for everyone attitude.
---
lol okay
---
You weren't alive during CoD2 then. That was the peak
---
Thats nuts
---
No idea why you were downvoted for a compliment...
---
What about when you factor in yellow instant strikes?
---
I was so sad when they removed that.
---
it was tho
---
Undead rock out when casting.
---
Would you be friendly with ally at the same time?
---
Nah, but according to Soda and his chat he should've won.
---
I've been playing Fallout 76 recently. It's not a very good game, but it has its moments where it provides some enjoyment. The bad definitely outweighs the good and sometimes it's a chore to play, but I'm stubborn. I purchased it at release because I'm both a sucker and a Fallout fan, and I just want to get some of my money's worth.
---
I also started a character on a private server that my GF and I are playing when we're both available at the same time.
---
Don't forget that Warlocks get Charm/Fear dispel from their PvP Trinkets so even if you don't go UD you still have a way of escaping Charm/Fear despite not having WotF.
---
WotF is really all that UD brings to the table for a  Warlock. Cannibalize loses its utility after you reach 60 and the Underwater Breathing passive is bad on Warlock because you get a spell for that anyway.
---
The stun resist and extra pet damage is why I will be going Orc lock.
---
That might be wrong when u say NONE.  Pretty sure I read that China’s beta let them keep characters.   No source, can’t confirm.
---
That's cool that you found a server with kind people. I saw people like that playing the stress test. Really took me back. It's really hard to find nice people these days in retail. At least in my realm. I miss the community.
---
i remember punching my ctr monitor when i was much much younger .... i was like 18 or something when i kept dying in AV and punching my screen... lightly
---
Games out side of wow with a market like this are very rare. And with the addition of tokens and character transfer, it makes gold meaningless. This is a fresh start where there is literally no gold on the server.
---
No need to snarky, just trying to start up a conversation.
---
A zergling?
---
Yeah...I was. We were all playing medal of honor at that time
---
I get that... I'm more annoyed about not being able to transmog in level 60... But the game looks trash anyway so it's not too important I guess... Wish they'd allow us to use the new graphics,  without it forcing it to the people who want the full nostalgic experience
---
Can you even still use those anymore?
---
Pretty much describes the entirety of Family Guy for the last few years.
---
We dont know how long each phase will be it will likely be a few months. Having an alt several months later is realistic.
---
Didn’t know that part, awesome! I’m so amped, August can’t come soon enough. It’s crazy to think it will all come to fruition soon though!
---
Your mom’s shoulder is upstairs to cry on if you’d cone out of the basement.
---
I'd assume select items people know will sell will be held on to for a bit.
---
No point in selling an item worth 200 gold for 70 gold since that doesn't put you any closer to 1k for epic mount. 
---
I'm pretty sure things will sell for way under their price while most go for their 1k mount but the super items won't be up there for cheap.
---
But who knows what's going to happen... blizzard allows caravan botting in BFA for months on end so we'll see if they actually stop that from happening when they get consistently reported.
---
&gt; One rogue could force it on their own, but a sheep followed by a fear. That or have a priest mana burn them 
---
It is still awesome if you consider that you blow 3 types of CC just to kill 1 guy.
---
It invites a lot of problems.  Trial accounts for gold muleing, anonymous player harassment (particularly cross faction), botting, exploiting, creating some more of thise corpse logos for gold sellers in cities, unlimited personal bank space (just make free accounts and mule), like tons and tons of problems come with letting people log in for free.
---
If I had a fly hack and could make free lv1 accounts, why not goof around risk free?  I say why invite this problem?
---
But yeah, I also don't think Classic is a game that requires a trial.  Its reputation proceeds itself.
---
Deerlord with the sensible advice!  People complaining about the scuminess obviously never played vanilla originally. This has been happening since the game came out. Don’t like it, there’s the door to weenie hut junior’s...
---
Knowing each of these locations with nothing more than an icon on a map really makes one feel like a nerd
---
I had a similar guild that was very friendly for me. I had won rights to collect the shadowfrost shards to get our first guild shadowmourne during ICC and I was in the military at the time and was going to be traveling and gone for about 3 weeks which sucked. One of our officers logged on for my character each reset and played my guy to collect shards for me. I think I finished the week after I got back, but this was also more than half of the same guild that I played with in Vanilla, so I trusted them completely.
---
Who are you quoting?
---
Generally I agree but some cheap consumes are very helpful for certain classes.  
---
A few times I would buy lower level versions of the 'troll's blood' potion which restores hp/5, and get the cooking food as well that restores hp/5 for my warrior.  Find a nice spot to grind and you will easily make the $$ back in that time that you spend and make it a lot easier to sustain yourself in those fights.  Having some nice consumes can let you kill 5% or 10% more creatures over the duration of the buff, or keep you safer from dying, and that can be worth the small coin investment since you're looting more anyways.
---
I do feel like Chinese Gold farmers will be making a huge comeback in Classic.
---
Will people have the chance to download classic and setup their adding before the release?
---
Because during chromaggus all you had your mages and druids doing was literally mashing the fuck out of their key and cleansing the raid in a few seconds (because it was instant and off GCD).
---
Made one of his breaths an absolute joke. 
---
I mean nowadays the boss isn't considered hard, but back then your raid from ~25-40 were usually getting carried and struggled with simple instructions. So it was OP for them.
---
I did notice that there were no particle effects on hit in the stress test. Reported it as a bug.
---
How else will I get my character onto RPvP then it launches months after release?
---
Nice attempt at a high road bud, Omar figured out what they needed to get classic to launch in 2019 - don't be salty because you, like OP weren't invited to the beta where streamers are given priority :)
---
Heroic strike has a flat threat modifier in addition to the bonus damage. Weapon speed comes more into play with high rage situations.
---
This is why I enjoyed vanilla. You could have a whole bunch of gear that would be useful.
---
Rather than having one set of gear and having to search for one piece through rng means.
---
How did everyone get to this location? It says tirisfal glades but looks like it is not in the actual zone?
---
Bag Space should be considered, I already have to drop items a lot even without skinning
---
Wotlk was even better... Best wow Version, change my mind
---
If your PC runs all that then I'm almost 100% sure it can run 64-bit Windows. If you are still running a 32-bit version of Windows, you can just reinstall 64-bit version of Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10 using the same license you already have and you should be good to go to play to play Classic.
---
Does enemy faction can hear this ? Can you play this sound just after killing someone in wpvp ?
---
So we had a place where we could see the weapon skills we could learn.
---
Why take it away?
---
&gt; Blizzard has only 1.12 data, no earlier. Classic will be as Vanilla 1.12 was. The end.
---
Its funny that you say 'the end' when the reality of have no data of pre-1.12 mechanics opens up such a wide range of valid critiques and discussions.
---
OPs point alone is enough to want to talk about if/why/how when it comes to patch implementation on a vanilla server. Let alone all the itemization options.
---
Wands are a priests best friend. Also (not saying you did this, just PSA) don’t bubble the warrior, the shield keeps him from generating rage, which means he won’t be able to use abilities to keep threat.
---
Make a tailoring friend especially!  Exchanging stacks of cloth + coin for the thread for bags is a GREAT TRADE if you can swing it.
---
I've been reading up on legendaries in Classic and had a few questions in relation to them.

1) Who are the main targets to get the Hand of Rag on Alliance side? I've heard Paladins are a good candidate, and that is on my short list of classes. If I were to put the effort in to make it, could it be done? Or is there someone else who's better suited to getting it? Outside of crafting the Sulfuron Hammer, getting the Eye of Rag (whatever its called) is just a drop chance right? Feel like it'd be good to get for Ret for PvP especially, just don't know how realistic it is for me to do so in a non-hardcore guild. Assuming that an actual hardcore/prog guild it'd be less of an issue (as my friends and I might be making one).
---
2) As for getting Atiesh, how tough would that be? Lets assume I'm a good Mage in a decent but not super hardcore guild, AFAIK the shards are a random drop off each Naxx boss and the other pieces drop from C'thuun and KT. Is getting this going to be realistic this time around since (as fair as we know at least) BC won't be around the corner and more guilds will actually get to Naxx content? I really want to put the effort into getting it but I know its more of a group effort then not.
---
I love these threads lately seeing how people enjoy the game for such simple reasons other than endgame content. Very excited to see people play classic in August
---
While I enjoy achievements in retail, and loved them during wotlk/cata era, I understand why people dislike it. It might just seem like a meaningless innocent system that doesnt have an effect on you if you dislike it, but it actually does have a lot of impact on the game as a whole.  
---
One of the cornerstones of why vanilla was so good is because of immersion. You rarely spend time in menues and looking through pages of what ever. You dont need a list of achievements to guide your adventure. You dont need a checklist of: do this, and this and then this.   
---
I see you mention raids, but lol, nobody cares about that aotc shit. Rememember, barely 10% of the whole playerbase got to level 60 in vanilla. The reason people complain is because achievements is more artificial guidance on how to play the game. More handholding. I'll narrow it down to this: In vanilla the adventures and stories were yours. Unique to you and your group.  
---
Doing some wonky difficult achievement with a reward might be fun, but its still something someone else put in front of you. Climbing to the top of Ironforge for no reason but the fun and adventure of it? Aint no achievement for that, no youtube guide to follow or anything. Its an adventure you decided for yourself to go on, for no other reason but curiousity and fun.
---
What is a Bobby B bot? What meme am I missing.
---
I got ported by a warlock but yeah it’s a wall jump location i think
---
Yeah exactly. I think that if Classic is super profitable that especially will be a sing for Blizzard to just re-release old stuff (TBC) without touching it.
---
Unfortunately I don't think that we are going to see any form of classic like expansions even though it would be fucking awesome.
---
&gt;1.12 nerfs
---
The only hope now is for the original founders to RISE AGAIN!
---
the last thing they said was they were severely ramping down on the amount of beta invites as they reached the amount of people they wanted. it's not completely shut off but don't get your hopes up
---
AOE-Grinding requires ideal conditions all around. Things that will fuck you up royally include, but are not limited to:
---
* On a PvP server, any presence of the other faction whatsover. 
---
* On any server, the presence of anyone who intends to kill the same mobs as you do. You won't be able to collect enough mobs to make the frequent drinking pauses worthwhile. 
---
* Caster mobs. Being limited to melee mobs greatly reduces the number of available farmspots. See points 1 and 2 as to why this is a problem.
---
* Patrols and respawns. Would be a shame if a mob spawned under you while you're drinking. Or if a mob adds when you're almost out of mana. 
---
* Difficulty. It only makes sense if you're really good at it, otherwise it's on par with single mob farming. Something something overconfidence.
---
I am glad that a newer client is being used. I've been running the old 1.12 client on some private servers and the performance sucks even though I've got a Ryzen 2600X and a Vega 56.
---
My 51 point Balance Druid disagrees.
---
Only good thing about wotlk was ulduar
---
But he organized the tourney??
---
Blizzcon champion. Currently a caster for Wow Arena. Multi R1 Mage. Ironically enough he used to play on a 3v3 team with Cdew and Snutz. Pretty awesome.
---
Yah it's great if your a fan of over priced carnival food.
---
Oh wow it tastes exactly the same and is a dollar cheaper than the carnivale charges.
---
For two people the xp is split 50/50 with each getting half of the total. With 3 you actually get some bonus xp, but the mob density and respawn rates come into play and so in most areas it’s probably not worth the tradeoff of how much travel time it’s going to add between packs of mobs. Duos is pretty solid though, and warrior priest is one of the best combos.
---
"Because your fun isn't my kind of fun, I hope you get banned and don't get to play the game". GTFO, skank.
---
No, it made you hostile to everyone from what I recall (even horde guards and NPCs).
---
It was kind of fun to mess with friends, though.
---
I was saying this the other day when someone posted those ZG fist weapons that have a small % to proc and turn you into a tiger humanoid for a minute I think. 
---
Little stuff like this was what made vanilla so much fun, it was silly and unnecessary for sure but added a certain flare to every character, which is nice at a time when many classes are blending together, which is scary for someone who is an altaholic like myself.
---
Maybe I'm super naive because I don't interact with the WoW community much but I feel like there's a level of fun in natural pvp. If a guy even level to you or even just like 5 levels higher ganks you unexpectedly that sounds really cool personally. Even if you lose it's an enjoyable experience and it's definitely one for them too. 
---
A very clear line is drawn though when you're literally just sitting in a zone 50 levels below you killing people who have 0 counterplay and are new to the game.
---
Yeah, and Omar doesn't have the ability to test for bugs at the same level as, I dunno, the population of the beta server. Come on man, you're embarrassing yourself now, let it die.
---
To be fair, I've literally never even heard of that game once before reading your post.
---
Ah, that tired excuse for griefing. People used it all the way back in DAOC for ganking mid-levels trying to do quests in the Frontier areas--it was a lame excuse then, it's a lame excuse now, because driving people from the game doesn't make your faction stronger, it just makes the server worse because people go elsewhere and eventually you have no one but other griefers to play with. Just own your griefing and admit you like making lowbies cry.
---
EVE Online would be a better subject for such a study.
---
I mean kinda, but their presence there was annoying. Neither faction was far enough away, but the alliance's nameplates would fuck with competitors. There were a few duels where a duelist would tab to an alliance player on accident and waste a spell. I remember during Ven's duel a warlock was using drain soul on Ven to keep him in combat so he couldn't drink. The worst were those 2 tauren, but obviously a level 1 character is basically factionless and only chooses the faction that allows them not to be killed.
---
Honestly I don’t disagree even if I can’t quite agree.
---
I loved BC and I thought it had better class design better raids, better professions, better questing, better end game. It was just more complete. 
---
The problem with saying it’s “better than classic” is that it’s 90% classic. You can’t isolate it from classic because it’s only 10 levels, 10 talent points, some new spells and 2 races etc...
---
It was a good addition to classic. “Hey Siri define expansion”
---
Part of the problem these days is we see an expansion as a new game. And blizzard seems to reinforce that. We are stuck on that new island. Free from all the systems of the last wow game. Playing newly designed classes (or just pruned classes). We consume the new content and wait for a new patch.
---
They were all on the same team at one point as well.
---
Pop tart wasnt /that/ dry
---
I was planning on maining alliance in classic, but you are making me want to play horde now just so I can murder gnomes!  You don't happen to be wearing +charisma gear are you?
---
Except for the flying bit, yes.
---
Not sure if it was patched in Vanilla or a later expansion, but Mind Control people in Booty Bay and have make them attack the guards.  You used to be able to sit on the roof and guards wouldn't attack you.  You would always have to be careful in Booty Bay because someone would find a way to kill you no matter what.
---
Any sciencey guys care to explain what is actually happening here? Is it static electricity? This is awesome.
---
Who is Bobby B? What meme am I missing? Can you please tell me what this post was meant to poke fun at?
---
Does that belt stack with Druids water form?
---
Oh so it's "just the beta server" now... not additional testers or servers. 
---
Way to not contribute a single thing to OP... good job! Continue on your way to your next class!
---
Not at all. You can successfully jump the entire run without taking damage, though most times, you will get damaged once or twice - still nothing to worry about.
---
It was until the 3rd quarter. Wotlk introduces the things that killed wow.
---
Im not sure if I would call arguably the best pvp class's 1v1 experience an uphill battle, but basically just make use of consumables and engi stuff if you really want to dominate, a lot of warrior's drawbacks can be mitigated with obscure items, consumes, or engi stuff.
---
Life tap is part of why they have little downtime tho
---
You can’t read
---
It 100% isn't because Blizzard didn't ban them for it. They intentionally used vague wording in the TOS so they don't have to ban people for retarded reasons whenever a mob demands it.
---
Agreed.
---
There is no argument to be made you have a fear charm sleep break in the trinket and a 30 second fear immune with the blacksmith trinket. The stun resist helps agains warriors and rogues your toughest two matchups and also agains other classes and even engineering stuns which every serious pvper uses. Objectively orc is substantially stronger for min max pvp
---
GIVE HIM TEH BEAT,NOW
---
Burning crusade made the game feel more complete, it took vanillas faults and fixed them. Maybe I'm biased because it was a good time in my life and it was when I was hard-core raiding.
---
I appreciate that, I wanted to contribute what I could, I know I'd be on here 24/7 if I didn't get an invite, wanted to give back how I could.
---
Really hope invites continue to go out.
---
Why are you thanking a streamer on a totally separate site? Stop this nonsense.
---
I dunno, I grab all the Flight Paths in BfA since flying has been a no-show for so long.
---
I believe they prefer childfree rather than undad
---
“screamed like an autist”
---
i think it'd be great if they restructured TBC into Phases like they are with Classic
---
I hear that Chinese facial recognition software breaks when it tries to view Chuck Norris's face. The computer cannot calculate that density of masculinity.
---
Newton's Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
---
TBC was a good expansion.
---
If blizz decides to make a new expansion instead of TBC, and it's not as good as TBC, people are going to *pissed*, including me.
---
The only good expansion after WotLK was Legion. Cata was ok. That's not the track record I want to be following up classic. When we *already know* TBC was an amazing expansion. Plus, you got me, nostalgia. I'll be pissed if I miss out on it for an expansion that turns out to be as bad as bfa.
---
Oh. I don’t know what those look like.
---
ToC was the downfall
---
He doesn't have a point. He is just talking in circles and has no interest in discussion.
---
In my experience, they're the same people who whine like babies on forums and call for nerfs whenever they get owned by an equal (or slight inferior in level who knows how to play). They are very badass when ganking people 40 levels lower, of course.
---
The grind makes me wonder which classes generally do fine in PvP with PvE gear only if you can no life grind honor.
---
Soda used MCP during duels though? Or did you mean in the build up to tourny
---
Fall damage is percentage based, making player level irrelevant.  If a fall would kill a level 1 player, it'll kill a level 60.
---
You think daggers outclass swords at any point in the patch progression? Only on vaelastrasz, nowhere else.
---
Good luck: got lok'amir whatever (the spell mace from Nef) on first Nef kill. At that time it was the shit for holy pallies.
---
Bad luck: 53 MC runs for my tier 2 legs. Fifty three. It was our last official guild run of it when I got them. And first time we'd seen them drop. FIFTY THREE!!
---
I level holy priest easily with friends
---
No, I actually understand layering better than most people, being a goblin and knowing the ways to abuse it.
---
Layering exist on the same server as the other layers. When you attempt to login, no matter which layer you are entering, you are put into that same que. At the end of this que, you are then put into your layer.
---
You aren’t getting a separate que for each layer.
---
Meaning, when layering is removed, your que times aren’t affected at all, you were already waiting for them.
---
Layering isn’t being done to save you que time.
---
Yeah he's really famous for going down.
---
zugzug?
---
as much as I loved Vanilla I thought TBC was the best experience I had playing WoW. I hope they eventually do open a BC server
---
100% of my 'vanilla vet' time was wayyy before 1.12. I remember innervate being a 31 talent when me and my friends were doing level 60 content. It was completely different lol
---
You gotta enter ABACABB after the title screen. If the text turns red and you hear "GET OVER HERE!" you know you did it right.
---
"The end" in the sense that Blizzard will not entertain anything else.
---
Of course on a purely theoretical level you can discuss whatever you want about Vanilla/Classic.
---
But the purpose of Classic is to provide Vanilla WoW (as close as Blizzard is capable/willing to get to it). Doesn't matter if it's good/bad/indifferent. Doesn't matter how it "feels". Blizzard only has 1.12 data so Classic will have 1.12 data.
---
Carrot on a Stick GOAT
---
Yeah, I'm starting to see the arguments for TBC. 
---
I feel like I'm one of the few idiots that hasn't lost faith in Blizzard, but I do agree with what you say, if they go and make another expansion and it's not as good as TBC, I'd be let down as fuck.
---
Lol what are you even trying to say at this point? I was the first person in this thread shooting OP down. Your contribution so far is "but dey make game 15 year ago :(". Swing and a miss, try again.
---
I know it’s a pipe dream.
---
I’d really like 3 options after classic has run its course.
---
Keep classic servers
---
Character copy to TBC
---
Character copy to vanilla plus.
---
The armour textures look a lot more detailed in these shots than in vanilla
---
Yeah but you'd always use two of the same weapon to get more value from the 5 talent points
---
Pretty disappointed with what happened to Sodapoppin. I think he had a great chance to win the tourney if he didn't get fucked by fear RNG.
---
Biggest counter to endgame lock is full stunlock, so orc is generally considered better. Also I've found wotf lacking in most situations.
---
&gt;	you can shift to throw heals/innervate/rebirth sometimes but it’s rare that’s really useful in a 5 man
---
???
---
og\_jeffrey has quickly become one of my favorite streamers lately. His commentary is so great the entire time he's streaming.
---
i envy you ;)
---
One of my few good PvP memories (only rolled PvP due to friends back then) was killing undead in hillsbrad one day on my NE Hunter when I got angry whispers from someones alt account calling me out for ganking even thou I was only level 25-27ish. It was before the shadowmeld change so opening with a aimed shot was so OP back then.
---
r/classicwowplus
---
The best way to solidify your raid spot as any character is putting the maximum effort into learning your class, attendaning to raids and other events and being a friendly person. Sure, supporting the guild with donations also could help, but then you’d be better off playing a class which can make gold easily.
---
Yeah it was around then. I think it was LFG in combo with the absurd catch up mechanics that deleted earlier content. It isolated people and gave them no reason to do most of the content that required other people
---
That's the tricky thing about a game that has evolved so quickly. Some people prefer TBC, some people prefer WOTLK, some people prefer Legion, and some people prefer BFA.
---
For the people who prefer vanilla, a lot of us would like to see the game progress while still keeping the principles that were unique to the game pre-expansion. A lot of elements of TBC such as the complete gear and world reset, flying mounts, "casualification," and a bunch of other things are not in line with those principles. So advancing vanilla to something that includes those things is unsatisfactory.
---
Now? Greifing in mmo's goes back to EQ.
---
I did it once, and only once, in vanilla. Can't wait to go back as not-a-braindead-kid.
---
Venruki and Snutz...is it mid-2000s again? (I wish)
---
Im happy maraudon is out on release as i get to do it now while leveling
---
They're using the new API. That macro would look like
---
\#showtooltip
---
/use \[@mouseover, harm, exists\]\[\] Polymorph
---
This macro will cast polymorph on an enemy target that you are mousing over, otherwise it will cast it on your current target.
---
Yeah the classic leveling grind does stymy that a little bit, people will still probably do it (hackers keep buying CS:GO in bulk to keep cheating) but at least it’ll slow them down.

---
So you kept doing the same thing for six hours... is that how long it took him to get bored, did you have to log off for the night, or did you ever actually figure out playing an alt for a while?
---
I was more of a Battlefield 2 fan for multiplayer and Bioshock is my favorite single player FPS series.
---
yes, but if you're a lvl 60 priest buffing a lvl 20 Hunter, the % will be much higher (since you can max out his Buff limit at PWF 3, maybe 4). if you're a lvl 20 Priest buffing a T2-Warrior, it's not gonna have the same effect.
---
I used to kite the elite dragon in the cave in dustwallow marsh all the way to the crossroads and let his aoe fire breath kill lowbies there. The fun thing was that you could aim the fire by just positioning yourself in front of the lowbie you wanted to kill
---
To be honest, they barely mentioned the Dark Portal in Warcraft Orcs and Humans. I think they weren't entirely sure where they were going with it in Orcs and Humans.
---
Missed it again lol
---
Ah NPC only makes it not as fun but could still be cool. Do you remember what zone the quest was in?
---
&gt; cant handle fighting an equal
---
[laughs in BG achieves]
---
He said he made a mistake and said it was a horde paladin instead of Tauren paladin, and that’s why he quit. So why would he have strong knowledge of something he hardly played and quit? 
---
I said he could’ve BEEN hardcore, as in played classic hardcore, the game this subreddit is dedicated to. Not the later expansions, which classic has minimal relation to. Why are you guys so angry that he doesn’t know the proper class of a horde paladin when it has nothing to do with classic? Probably because you didn’t play it and go reeeee at the sight of someone bashing your version of the OG WoW. Calm down buddy.
---
Layering is allowing potentially 10k+ players at launch on 1 server.
---
When theat gets removed and playerbase degradation was overestimated, there will potentially be larger queues... especially on a streamer server that has thousands of viewers that want to play on that one server the now has one layer. (Unless the go back on their word and keep layering past phase 1)
---
Well for starters you need stop casting interrupts and main spamable spell
---
I don't feel ya brah
---
The leveling experience will always be there some people want to do end game first and then enjoy a slower leveling experience on alts.
---
There's also people that speed level like joana which I assume will be another group of people. He would race to 60 and then start over again... and again... and again. So he obviously didn't have the belief that the only game is end game since he spent the majority of his time leveling and also racing to 60.
---
Welcome home friends!
---
Redridgeboss hard at work
---
Would be cool for sure, highly doubt it's going to happen.
---
I actually prefer the original WC3 models anyway, I've played playing a little to get me in the mood.
---
It was the "Test of Lore" quests in Thousand Needles where you'd get the debuff if you answered the lore questions incorrectly.
---
Only reason to have alliance to make it feel "bigger and more epic"
---
outside of that it was a terrible choice, and even for a first event, they should have had really good spot picked out ahead of time.  This isn't their first time playing the game now...
---
While possible it's highly unlikely, personally I'm playing through the OG version now
---
The damage range per hit is what's used for abilities like Sinister Strike and Backstab, that's the most important stat when looking at weapons for your main hand. Slow speed is tangentially related to this stat but the listed damage range is actually what's most important.
---
&gt; I was also starting a new job and getting serious with my GF 
---
See that's your first mistake. You have A LIFE. If you want to experience classic wow in it's full glory you have to abandon such secondary things and focus on what matters. The grind.
---
But all jokes aside it was/is just an amazing experience from start to finish. The current games have become so bad/mediocre that people mostly talk about pvp or raids. Back in classic leveling was actually A PART OF the game instead of APART FROM the game. It was a living, breathing world where you would meet people to do shit with or meet enemy players to get killed by. Which for me was special, because it reminded me of my childhood days in Russia.
---
Everything you did felt like an accomplishment. Pulled two mobs and didn't die? Fuck yeah! Got that new sword? Fuck yeah! That shit will carry you for the next levels. Got that ring from a level 45 dungeon? Fuck yeah it's actually bis pre raid. Things matter. You can get items in the range from lvl 50-60 that will matter beyond hitting the 60 mark. Unimaginable today. Your profession progress during leveling mattered. Unimaginable today. The people you met mattered. Unimaginable today.
---
I could go on and on to be honest, but I don't want to leave o wall of text behind, so I'll just stop here. Overall I think the best way to describe the feeling that vanilla wow gave me is that of an actual virtual "reality" with actual people in it that do shit that matters. Back then we used to be nobodies doing stuff that mattered and now we're all heroes doing nothing.
---
I get that part, problem is hunter has a ton of key binds trying to shorten it down based on situation.
---
Couldn't agree more. People that coming with MW simply missed the peak.
---
Winter is better to keep the computer cool! I’ve got to pick up some more internal fans before release!
---
Not the last, but a big chunk. So Servers prob. full after wave today.
---
no, but I am talking about back in the vanilla days, we did use them.  I don't think we mastered 'lava-jumping' back then or maybe it did not work that well on slow computers.
---
This is genuinely on of the most exciting part of this adventure for me. I love the thought of the whole world starting on the same foot, 0 copper, silver or gold and rags on their bag and a wimpy weapon in hand. Each and every copper earned from quests and off of mobs is added into the economy after that point. And all the gold sinks in vanilla kept the economy quite healthy throughout. Love it!
---
I was just think about busting out the original WC3 and thought I should wait just in case they do something like this.
---
Starting bid of 50 schmeckles?
---
I wonder if it will be worth to just hold onto leather/cloth/herbs/ore until a month or so in then sell it.  I feel like at launch there isn't going to much money in the economy so this stuff will sell for more when folks are at capped and would be willing to pay more for low level crafting materials when they are trying to level their professions at cap.
---
However, doesn't PWF provide a fixed amount of Stamina and not percentage based?
---
Orc males look dumb in cloth: change my view.
---
Haha. No one is triggered. We're just making an assessment of someones personality.  The only reason people aren't like OP in real life is there are consequences to their actions. It's similar to how people will cut you off in traffic without a second thought but wouldn't cut in line at a restaurant -- because there would be confrontation and (normal) people generally avoid confrontation if they can. The internet allows you to hide behind anonymity and not get your face punched.
---
That being said, video games allow people to indulge in these aggressive thoughts from time to time -- which is a healthy normal thing, I'm not bashing violent games here -- but if the ONLY (or primary) reason you play games is to inconvenience others and make their day miserable, you're either A.) A dick or B.) Dealing with some sort of internal issues that you can only release in a video game.

Tbh, I really thought it was going to. What better way to get into classic immersion than by wc3R coming out like first week of August. Giving us time to play wc3 and tft. Then 3 weeks later see it all again “for the first time” in 3d. 
---
It’d be surreal purging stratholme in 1440p then seeing it a few weeks later, on fire full of undead. Queue Steve Urkel “Did I do that?”
---
"Aye, but they need masses of people bug-hunting as they are now in the 30 beta. No use having one internal team of 40 testing the raids in one way. People need to bend and break them."
---
Good try, no beta for you.  
---
Enjoy watching streams.
---
It is better to MC someone to the ocean, just before the loading screen. I used to duel people on zeppelins and did exactly this... so much fun
---
We would of heard about a beta by  now no?
---
Priests and Warlocks just kite to the edge and then fear. You can't really do anything about it. In a perfect world the tourney it fought in the arena where there's no forfeiting.. griefing would have been too prevalent though.
---
Won't, 84 days away.
---
I actually forgot about languages. I wish they expanded on that. It would've been really cool to learn the languages of other races.
---
Wrath was my peak time in WoW. I started about a year into TBC. I was able to go into Wrath at an even level with the guys who had been raiding in TBC. So I got to experience the dungeons when they were fresh and everyone was learning mechanics. Raided (new) Naxx and Ulduar. PvP'd a whole bunch in Wintergrasp. Really loved it. But by the end it was definitely a distinct turn away from an RPG.
---
- Wrath introduced the cross-realm random LFG tool about halfway through. Socialization ended literally overnight.
---
- Dungeons and especially dungeon trash became very easy. CC and pull management effectively became irrelevant. Instead tanks just pulled the biggest pack that the healer could handle and the DPS AoE'd them down.
---
- Classes began to meld together. Every DPS class got an AoE option (see above).
---
- The Trial of the Crusader was a fricken mess. Apparently introduced to bridge the gap to ICC.
---
- Vehicle mechanics were introduced. Quite possibly the most obnoxious game-play element Blizzard have ever done. Player base acceptance of this shit is why we have the utter crap like 'Beachhead' in BfA.
---
that was funny
---
Then why remove the functionality of the original Decursive addon? That mechanic completely nullified Affliction Warlocks.
---
Wouldn't that just put Orc at 30% chance to resist? Not 1/3.
---
Yea Activision will do whatever it does and that will be that.
---
Vanilla wow will still be discussed in how it should be implemented though, especially because of the lack of pre- 1.12 data. 
---
Private servers already 'debate' these differences by implementing their own solutions to it. That won't stop, especially if the majority of the players there prefer a more in-depth solution to vanilla's life cycle.
---
Just because Activision doesn't want to entertain those details doesn't mean the people playing on private servers won't
---
If the purpose of delaying is to get HP and CDs back, then it isn't against the rules. I didn't see **any** meaningful delay in the tournament that was for CDs only. If you are poly kiting long enough to get mana and HP back and you get a CD back as well, then its permissible.
---
What movie is that again?
---
One of mine was back in wrath where four warriors, one Druid one mage and myself a rogue held up in darkshire in against a mass of max level allies after destroying the town. Imagine going through the corridor into the Inn to four PvP geared warriors blade storming, myself using fan of knives and the mage with blizzard.
---
I will take it with tailoring. Going to sell skinned leather for money. Yea its not much but its honest work. Too much competition for herbs and ore. And there are beasts spawning all the time waiting to be skinned.
---
There are reasons why both the  Kopis and Falcata became obsolete before Christ was born, the main one being that a forward curve is worse than a regular curve in almost any way.
---
The only forward-curved sword that isn't some relic from antiquity that I can come up with is the Yatagan, which is barely curved at all.  
---
The only actual effective weapon with a recurve blade the Kukri (which is a knife and not a sword) where the recurve allows it do compensate a bit for it's smaller size.  
---
A recurve makes 0 sense on a large weapon because they don't benefit from the added mass or the wedge effect. Not sure why we're discussing this though as 90% of the weapons in WoW make 0 sense, even if wielded with orc strength/mass.
---
Have you watched him recently? I feel like years ago I used to dislike him for the reasons you said.. but he's matured a lot. I don't find him trolly or shitty at all anymore honestly. I'd give him a shot if you haven't in a while.. he's very entertaining and a great player.
---
&gt;Imagine being this much of a ~~loser~~ hero.
---
FTFY.  Guy provides endless entertainment via scrubs complaining because they're too stupid to go grind somewhere else for a couple levels.  Same goes for STVietnam, zone isn't as mandatory as whiners seem to think and it's hilarious that it just never occurs to some people that they can level elsewhere.
---
Hell, I'm probably gonna rock PVP-RP, so at least the gankers can sell me a back-story. ;)
---
What's the super logic in missing out on
---
Cloth armor looks stupid on male orcs imo. Females it's probably acceptable.
---
One thing to consider is that EVERY class can use grenades, and orc racial does increase your chance to resist it, even though it seems to behave like an incapacitate.
---
BRUH HOW COULD U NOT KNOW THAT THE GRAPHICS ARE TOP NOTCH IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A ZERGLING
---
Pfft, noob
---
I dont think it was just him bitching that made people hate, it's that he cried and screamed and used his streamer influence to get what he wanted...but again...idk what's true its just what people said
---
even r/classicwow thought this joke was too dated...
---
I did the same lol.
---
Had WotLK beta access, got 2v1'd by a ret pally against me (lock) and warrior who were both wearing full gladiator gear lol. Anyways heard they went on to be pretty op
---
Returned a few times but most significantly at the end of Cata and hear Lich King was excellent
---
I wonder if they're going to keep that quest in Classic where you could fail and for a time were shunned by your own faction's NPCs for a time.
---
I don't know if the Alliance has this quest, but it was certainly available to Horde players back in the day. It was just convoluted -- I had to read a guide to get it done. You could only do it once, and you had to answer a question wrong to get the Horde NPCs to shun you.
---
I actually did that quest on my last day playing. Went neutral, went to the XR, and killed what NPCs I could while there. Had some lowbies following me around screeching for my head, but it was a fun way to send myself off.
---
Bean almost beat Cdew in R1 and Jellybean almost beat Ven. It looks worse than it really was for them. Either could have won those matchups which would have changed the entire tourny.
---
I do think blizz can pull it off, but I'm just now willing to roll the dice on it personally. If they want to start remaking stuff after WotLK I'm all for it though lol
---
 /ignore is accountwide tho so if you ignore someone on their lvl 1 troll they are basically fucked if the whole server does it. This doesnt mean anything to a guy on Beta right.
---
&gt; a whole rotation
---
But wait, the retail babies said there were no rotations in vanilla?!
---
I meant throw the armor in the trash. I guess I could've been more clear.
---
Yes, they need the people in the beta bug hunting, because a small team cannot do it all. That's what I've always said. You having a stroke over there or something over there?
---
Can I be someone’s friend? No? /cries
---
As a rogue on private servers I have been sapping escort quests as they near the finish. 
---
Also I've been kiting the npc back to the start.. the people doing the quest follow me.. and then I vanish and the npc sprints back to where I attacked it and they fail the quest. 
---
Redridge mtns is contested so I've been having way too much fun..
---
Big ticket items: graphics and models. Keep everything else the same, just update those armour models etc. maybe the character models too. I hate the human classic running animation. Watch a male human run from behind and there is something really janky.. I played classic and I hated that part back then 🤨
---
Closest I could find:
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/DySsmuv8oYMTkqqC7
---
I know they have grounds to take action, but I don't think it would be a good idea unless they decide to enforce it in every instance even when it's not streamed to 100k+.
---
&gt;Harassment, “griefing,” abusive behavior or chat, conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others, deliberate inactivity or disconnecting, and/or any other activity which violates Blizzard’s Code of Conduct or In-Game Policies.
---
&gt;Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
&gt;While we encourage you to report players that are behaving in a disrespectful manner, falsely reporting another player with the sole intent of restricting their gameplay is also unacceptable, and will result in penalties to your account.
---
The way I interpret this is harassment and griefing more in the lines of spamming trades, hate speech, AFKing or DCing on purpose in group activities, throwing BGs etc. 
---
Ultimately the decision is up to Blizzard, and seeing as they didn't do anything either means they didn't know about the event, which they definitely did, or that they didn't want to intervene, which I think make sense.
---
Because it is simply a reference to Zin'rokh?
---
WoW has many jokes and references to mistakes they made.
---
I still don't see why people are saying the world is empty. I'm leveling a new character on Live right now, currently 109, and every zone that I've been to since level 20 has been packed with players. Maybe something needs to be done about all the low-pop servers?
---
1/3 is 33% ...
---
The workarounds explicitly target, cast, and re-target last target. So you should absolutely lose CP
---
I know you're asking about rogue, but if you're interested Joana talks about why he recommends *slower* bows and guns for leveling
---
He may just mean higher base dmg, but with how he explains it on his guide and videos it's more to do with the actual timing and speed.
---
Thought I should add this just cuz it's slightly related and kind of interesting :)
---
PvE server can protect the players but not Keeshan.
---
Super easy - barely an inconvenience. 
---
Only thing is world bosses that are more difficult for sure. At some point the guilds will cross faction come up with a rotational scheme based on first come first serve and it'll be less of a clusterfuck between fighting the boss and an opposite faction at the same time - with your own faction not helping since they hope you die so they might get the tag for next try.
---
It adds an element of fun
---
They can release what expansion they want as long as they let us continue playing classic without interference
---
I would hate to play on TBC it has all the things I hate about wow, flying, welfare gear, heroic modes, separation of pve and pvp, daily quests etc
---
I was in Ironforge and saw a message in general chat (not trade chat) so only those in IF saw it: “Quitting the game and giving away all my money. PM for invite. 
---
I got an invite and found myself in a raid group with about 15 other people.
---
He has us all roll 1-1000. I ended up winning and walked away with 2000 gold on the spot. Bought my epic mount and was free of money problems for the next year until BC came out. 
---
This is the only reason I got an epic mount. I was so poor and that a couple weeks before this I had to sell my novelty thunderstrike in order to repair for a raid.
---
Vanilla always was easy mode compared to mmos released before and to the following versions of wow. You’re just delusional.
---
LFM Friends PST
---
Yes, but it doesn't fill the health it adds, and fall damage is a percent of total maximum health, not unbuffed maximum.
---
Oh no ! what have we done?
---
My prediction is that whatever path or paths Blizzard chooses to go down we'll have various servers/realms on different paths. I would expect at least one realm to be a no-changes no-expansions realm.
---
Ahh I see where you're coming from.
---
That makes sense. I'm just assuming it's a given that others are going to put in serious effort to understand their class and have good raid attendance.
---
In comparison to others in my guild who may be playing on private servers right now, played private servers in the past, or played during Vanilla I feel like I need to contribute more to stand out. I'm trying to go into Classic as a fresh experience, and I'm staying away from private servers as a result.
---
While I may not be playing on private servers, I am pretty rigorously reading/watching guides as well as writing up plans and goals.
---
Ok, I see you don’t understand layering, that’s fine (as this has confused so many people, they really do need to explain this better)
---
So first off, let me make it clear, layering does NOT affect your server que time, at all.
---
What it allows, is for a easier leveling experience, and.. Blizzard knows there’s going to be people that quit after a few short months. If they made more servers to fit more people, a lot of servers would be left dead, or be forced to merge into other servers (neither being a good thing) the solution to this was to allow servers to have separate instances (layering) inside each server, so that it would replicate actual classic launch (3k-ish per server) per layer.
---
 However, with layering being removed (around when many people will be quitting, because classic isn’t for them) it will keep the numbers roughly the same, or in cases of the very big servers, above the (old classic) launch. Not leaving servers dead.
---
Layering doesn’t touch the login que. You would have to be logging into a completely separate server for your que to be different. (This is how networking works)
---
So, when layering is removed. The people you were already sharing the login que with, you can now see... but your que isn’t any longer, because you already shared it.
---
While I understand the need for phasing this is what makes it hardest for me I think. I love the feeling of seeing someone doing the same quest as you (or a quest you recognize in the area) and then the next day or later in the week you see that same person in another zone with you. Or maybe you do a dungeon with someone and then end up questing with them because you know they’re a good warrior tank and you know they could use the help. So much fun stuff that happens from these random encounters that phasing removes from the game (although I do acknowledge that phasing is very important for both the servers and general QOL gameplay)
---
Google: wow macros
---
So they think they want vanilla but they dont and want something rlse instead ? 
---
Hmmmmm sounds familiar....
---
Right!  I typed it that way to make it easier to understand where the numbers came from.
---
Because you think the tip of the blade would act like a spike or simply because you wouldn't glance off as easily?
---
The billhook-like part of the curve side would do both things better than the recurved part of the blade.
---
&gt;3th
---
thirth
---
Marking this to check after work.
---
A beta was planned for early 2019, I don't know if they are doing it internally or if the game is being delayed
---
I mean it’s not exactly nothing. Vendors still have an unlimited supply of gold with which to pay you for things (not only injecting gold into the game, but also setting price floors for everything but enchanting mats) and the AH is a monopoly, there is no competition towards the AH cut and it exists before the first item is even sold to vendors. Gold also exists from moment 1. A real burgeoning economy would start as a barter system until the trade network was large enough and there was a State of some sort developing a currency. 
---
There surely is an economy, but it’s not legit in the same way dumping 10,000 naked humans in some remote place they couldn’t escape from would develop an economy if left to their own devices long enough (assuming they didn’t starve and die).
---
D2 is probably a better model for an economy springing up. Since there gold is meaningless and it’s “rare” (% wise, not color) items that have value, a complicated barter system develops with floating prices based on relative market surpluses and shortages.
---
That macbook is probably twice as powerful as the first computer I used to play classic, so I guess it all depends on how updated the engine is. Like others said, i'd try running the regular wow client on low and see how that works. Depends on what FPS you want too, my usual back in the day was 10-20.
---
Yeah I live in d-ville and frequent the shop he works at.
---
There will certainly be people who play an unhealthy amount and be level 60 in the first 4-5 days. That being said, yes he meant /played.
---
I did one of the pservers at launch and some druid hit 60 on I believe the 4th day, I was level 25ish when word got around that he had hit cap.
---
Yes, of course, private servers are not constrained in the way Blizzard is constrained. Though I think private server discussion is more suited to /r/wowservers.
---
(OK, who am I kidding. The "discussion" in wowservers is not suitable for anyone with taste. Or brains. :)
---
Lawls. I actually didn’t know if that looks exactly like one or not. I really never seen one before. I only know they exist because people use the term ‘zerging’ in other games.
---
he and Serendipity got screwed.
---
it was a mistake to have the tournament in an uncontested zone.
---
I live in d-ville and frequent the shop he works at.
---
I got there on the stress test.
---
Lucky - I was one of the first hundred to get ZG raptor mount
---
Unlucky- We killed Vael over 30 times and never saw a Red Dragonscale Protector
---
I would actually argue against that. In my opinion live wow is a lot more "hardcore" than vanilla ever was. Sure, the leveling and the grind for consumables was a lot harder, but the raids themselves? Vanilla bosses had like 1 or 2 mechanics. Even the Naxx bosses are a fucking joke compared to current mythic bosses that have like 4 phases with a dozen mechanics each.
---
The problem is the selective difficulty and the bottom/top heavy game design. LFR is designed for actual blind people with an AOL internet connection that disconnects them half a dozen times during the raid. Mythic on the other hand is designed for CS:GO pros that have a reaction time of 10ms and the dedication to run the same encounter a hundred times an evening. The "average" player doesn't feel at home in any of those difficulties and tehrefore doesn't feel like he/she belongs in the game at all. Because clearing LFR didn't feel like an accomplishment at all. Normal mode felt like a challenge, but didn't motivate me to push for higher difficulties.
---
So yeah. It's not that live wow is only for casuals, but rather that live wow tries to be for "everyone" which just doesn't work. Vanilla wow had only one difficulty and it was for the average player no matter what anyone says. Even if the average player could never have cleared Naxx, it was still content that motivated him/her to push further and maybe one day be able to see the fabled Naxxramas. Nowadays you get to see it right away so everyone goes "ok I've seen everything there is bye lol".
---
Lol no. They have too much things to do and improve.  
---
It will release after blizzcon.
---
There has been very little news about Reforged since it's announcement. It's probably around a Holiday release.
---
There's a reason that went out of use centuries before Christ was born. Giving examples like this is like stating barrels aren't improved by rifling because muskets existed at some point in time.
---
Problem with your logic. Most peoples income hasn't kept up with inflation. So everything you need to live is more expensive, but you aren't getting the money to keep up with the increased costs.
---
I thought the entire comment in caps kinda made it clear I was joking but I guess /s is always needed on Reddit, 
---
Just feels like it takes away from the satire though when I have to say "HEY I WAS JOKING DID U GET IT? DID U? DID U GET IT?"
---
He already got what he was after: ad revenue.
---
Insects mandibles are incredibly strong, so essentially, the ant tries to bite the finger, and pushes itself away.
---
So it does matter. Lower level will have a higher chance of dying.
---
Give it to guildies while everyones leveling.  Those early impressions will help your endgame progression because ppl will be more inclined to offer help to you.
---
Well, they ruined it in MoP by introducing ridiculously overpowered trinkets and procs.
---
FIFTY! YEP!
---
Ok this is just rubbing salt in the wound for the majority, dicks.
---
I've tried this and it seems super mana inefficient. I'm sure it's better when you get seal of wisdom, but I couldn't keep up with the mana inefficiency
---
Would love that but I bet it's coming out November during blizzcon... They're just going to be like : you can download it right now
---
Personally I wanted nothing to do with hunters back in the day
---
I got the joke. I did a ‘lawls’. I was just clarifying further that I really had no clue what that was supposed to be.
---
Implement /train into your main ability. I did this while having emote sounds off and forgot about it, only to remember it when my arena partner went mad because he was hearing some strange noises.
---
annoyed the hell out of me lol
---
I am not angry about it.
---
As I said, I am just amazoed people don't seen to realize the primary purpose of this "Beta"
---
Anthem doesn't get 100k+ viewers on Twitch though. Currently it has 89 viewers lol, damn I knew it was dead but geez. F.
---
they should ban your account from official classic
---
I won Raptor with a 86!
---
I said it wrong.  Rogues by themselves can force the pally bubble.  Sheep/fear was because sheep would get trinket, 2nd sheep would be diminished on returns. So a fear would do it to pop the bubble.
---
There is nothing obvious here, other than the fact that you value your opinion above reality.
---
Oh my b  I took it as you further defending your not knowing, and I didn't want you to feel that was necessary lol

# Husband and Wife looking for PvE raiding guild.
---
# Guild MUST be..  
---
* **NA Region (**We *might* consider dealing with the pings that come with an EU server, but only in a glass slipper situation.)
---
* **PvE Server** (No PVP servers under any circumstances, I don't care how PvE focused you are, the gank squads won't either.)  
---
*  **DKP** (Some item reservations, especially legendaries and tanking loot are expected, but no pure Loot Council)
---
# We would LIKE a guild that is...  
---
* **Horde** (Though we do have experience on alliance side as well, we prefer Horde)  
---
* **Mature Community** (In attitudes, not necessarily age)  
---
* **Semi-Hardcore Pace** (A guild that expects to clear MC in the first month, rather than the first week or just the first phase)
---
# What we have to offer..  
---
* **Open availability** (We will make your raid times work for us.)
---
* **Genuine Vanilla hardcore raiding experience**. (Top 3 progression guild on Hyjal \~2005-2006)  
---
* **Recent Vanilla experience on private servers**. 
---
* **Decades of MMO experience \~1996-Present**  
---
* **Leadership experience in most, if not all, officer roles, including in hardcore progression guilds**  
---
* **Maturity and professionalism with a willingness to go above and beyond for guild progression**
---
We are willing to accept officer or advisory positions within a guild, if a guild thinks our experience would be useful, but we're more than content with a position in the rank &amp; file. My wife is firm on maining a holy/disc priest. I am more flexible and have experience raiding as Hunter, Mage, Warrior (Tank), and Druid (Heals). If you think we'd be a good fit for your guild, or have any additional questions, please shoot us a private message on Discord (Nafun#8400), e-mail us at nafunnufan@yahoo.com, or contact us on reddit at u/nafun_nufan
---
Can’t seem to get this doc to load.
---
If you think that WoW is a PVP game then live is probably better. But then again if you think that WoW should strictly be a PVP game you might have severe brain damage already.
---
Druid is actually insanely good against mages. I hate playing against them on my mage and I absolutely love the free HKs when I play my druid.
---
You can skip utility spells and get the important ones and you'll have the gold no problem. I did it both in classic and a pserver, banked 90g a couple levels before 40. Was rogue in classic and shaman on the pserver. 
---
Things like far sight totem, mind numbing poison, frost shock and gouge past rank 1. You really don't need those skills and you can just go get them after you have your mount.
---
Yeah, joke specs aside, my point stands undefeated ^^
---
The good ol' days.
---
You could shift bars, there's a key bind for that. Have melee attacks on bar2 and ranged attacks on bar 1
---
Except for the Flyers, Arena, and Pvp gear we agree. Those things are awful and have no place in an RPG though. Would love a TBC redux without those crappy additions.
---
Downtime may have been bad wording, what I mean is you just send in VW&gt;dot&gt;wand. This combination results in using very little mana. It's a stretch to justify cannibalize because of life tap. Not saying undead isn't good as I've leveled a warlock as both, just presenting that these perks are not really that impactful on a warlock.
---
I loved achievements (and will miss them for Classic). But I think they should have restricted them a bit more.
---
Just remove all the dungeon ones as they just turn into "You need to have the achievement already to join!" Or just impossible to get if you're not in a competent raiding guild. Remove all the PvP ones, at least from battelground, as they makes player play differently and not always going for a win but just fooling around.
---
Personal ones are awesome though and I wish they had a lot more of those.
---
thanks for the info
---
It's probably a wash. Considering PWF deranks automatically for lower level characters.
---
Lol i hate leveling and have been playing on private servers for 1.5 years in total. I've leveled enough characters over the years so I just want to be done with it and get to the fun part which to me starts at 60. People play however they want, mess around RPing in SFK or some shit dude I don't care. Ain't got shit to do with how retail turned out, so just mind your own business and let people do what they want.
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
That was my point.
---
This is the exactly the kind of attention they’re  looking for
---
&gt;  The "discussion" in wowservers is not suitable for anyone with taste. Or brains.
---
lol well I can't really argue with that
---
Loot council is where the big wigs in the guild decides who gets loot based on what is best for the guild
---
the actually process varies from guild to guild
---
No, I don't mean you. You understand exactly why they're doing it, though I do think you're downplaying the fact that it *is* still a beta, and that people are still finding legitimate bugs, and that streamers only make up a fraction of the test server.
---
If those are what you’re considering I would go skin/lw. You can make some ok gear for yourself to help while leveling. Also if you know what you’re doing you can actually make money (more than just vendoring the leather) just vendoring the gear you make. 
---
Granted it takes up craft time and what not. I usually use craft time as afk time or on days where I can’t really devote time to playing, but am home. I will log on and just craft then while doing other stuff.
---
On one guy I had enough gold at 40 to buy myself and a friend a mount with extra left over. Also was 3/4 of way to epic mount at 53. All from just vendoring the gear I craft.
---
That's... hilarious xD I thought "bread" was a typo! My goodness :D
---
Loot Council is when you distribute loot in the most optimal way.
---
Existed\*  
---
The examples you give are the same as stating that producing a gun without rifling aren't unreasonable because of muskets.  
---
WoW has blades which are centuries or even millenia old that have a proper design suggesting the technology of recurve blades is as obsolete as the Khopesh, Falx, Falcata, etc. would be in 12th century Europe.
---
Hi, /u/M109A6Guy
---
What region/server, if I may ask? I have/had toons on an RP server. Wasn’t going to re-up until Classic, but I’d be interested in playing with someone and making a new friend.
---
Sorry, been a busy weekend.

By far the biggest issue with it is that you have to farm a bunch of Manual Crowd Pummelers every week to make it work. It's got the same problem as feral druid dps in that regard, you have to put in a lot more effort to get just decent dps.
---
Marking to look at after work.
---
Don't forget the report feature is in classic. If your name becomes well known and you grief same faction often, RIP.
---
Purely on a lore basis, all of the major characters during the expansion were handled terribly -Kael'thas, Illidan, Lady Vashj, and so forth-. Blood Elves suffered some heavy flanderization, and were nothing like the Blood Elves they depicted on the RTS. 
---
The lore just went from downhill since TBC (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lorelol).
---
Other than the lore, though, I don't see much reason to not go for TBC. It was a solid expansion on all the other aspects.
---
Why is the warcraft 3 redo allowed to have good graphics but classic wow can’t?
---
&gt;You're in high end premade territory here.
---
More like just noob vs experienced players.  Rogues in bg would never target a paladin because most rogues just want pinpoint those cloth wearers.  But if rogues did their job, they could force those bubbles real fast.
---
As far as a mage goes, its almost the same.  Most mages in pvp aren't looking to counterspell, they are just looking to burst someone down real quick.
---
But back then, and even today I assume people are just too dumb to make the winning choices.  People just want charge in and pew pew a the first easy target they see.
---
what does that mean? no more stress tests?
---
Huh, attributes had maximum values? I'd love to hear the reasoning on that.

Hardcore | NA | Horde

Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST. 
---
ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset. Subsequent raids will aim to be fast and efficient each week Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST. 
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need some major poopsocking on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Since BlizzCon we've got:

 \- 1 additional art asset (Screenshot of the Gold Mine)
---
That's all.
---
I am not anticipating that we get a ninja release after months of zero communication.
---
I guess that's true, but shouldn't i be able to benefit from my potions if i'm an alchemist?
---
Sorry missed this. You sure..? This Legion video is showing exactly what we're saying, their whole body is turned away from the mob except the head:

---
That's what I experienced in the stress test anyway.
---
Was the loot good, from memory?
---
This is fucking gold
---
Funny how upvoted this post is and simultaneously how unanimously people agreed that guy trolling the PvP tournament was out of line.
---
A good Frost mage can easily beat a hunter if manouvering thro the dead zone
---
&gt; Banning people over emotions and not rules &amp; logic should never be allowed, it has bad ripple effects.
---
Thats why there is the line about "acceptable behavior is determined by ... Blizzard". Its not an auto-ban based on reports, and Devs can make logical decisions about the reports they get and if they should turn those into bans.
---
The guy trolling the tournament for 5 hours wasn't funny or interesting in any way, its completely logical to just ban him
---
A Beast Mastery hunter for any mage should be a no-no while leveling. Unless you can immobilize the hunter, get in his deadzone and nuke him before Pet turns red and reks you, then you should leave them alone.
---
1-10 with quests and you get enough gold from quests for skills

If PvE is just a chore for you then you might want to level your character to 49 and play in that bracket instead. Very easy to get BiS gear for and you have 99% of all the same abilities as at 60.
---
Lol. Tips talking to Venruki was for the sake of blacking out their screens and finding another spot to duel. He also wanted Snutzy to be in the call, but Snutz's couldn't since discord in Canada was down.
---
Can you confirm on the beta if you can create a mailing alt *AND NOT LOG IN TO IT* can you still send mail to the character and will that mail be there upon logging in?
---
I feel like it should be possible, but I would just love some confirmation
---
Pre-Beastial Wrath if you can poly the pet and immobilize the hunter and get in his dead zone, you have a chance ;)
---
RNGeezus would be the least used strategy of people actually wanting to beat content quickly.
---
Loot council will be most common among people trying for top 10.
---
in between DKP is most likely but the other 2 can appear.
---
A casual guild wont like to see loot council, except for certian main tank one of a time items like thunderfury, unless you are in some weird ass guild that shuffles around MT's
---
Also if you want anyone to get thunderfury that person almost needs to be designated ahead of time so that different people arent getting all the reagents. No one will get it then
---
Also don’t forget any tier after naxx at lv60 would  run into itemisation scaling issues. Our stats would end up far too high so raid mechanics would be quite fucky.
---
Alliance already ruined some of the duels. When people are fighting shamans or classes with pets they often tab target. The hunter who fought Venruki in the first duel I believe tab targeted and scatter shot an alliance player instead of venruki, making him lose the  duel.
---
Deleting my last reply as I was wrong. Looking a bit more specifically into the server queuing.
---
I apologize, everything I’ve read hasn’t touched much on the networking parts, which, under normal circumstances, would mean that each layer on a server would not have a separate que time. (This is how all networking works for servers generally) but blizzard HAVE mentioned that this will affect que times, so they must have separate ques (or, they are hoping it will reduce it by just existing, if that’s the case, then there will still be a single que. But I can’t find any confirmation one way or another anywhere)
---
However, it is kind of mute I believe.  Classic will be running on Servwrs capable of handling BFA’s population, so theoretically, once layering ends, the que time “tunnel” should be opened up a bit more to compensate for the increased traffic along the “single tunnel”
---
We should be fine.
---
Purely on a lore basis, all of the major characters during the expansion were handled terribly -Kael'thas, Illidan, Lady Vashj, and so forth-. Blood Elves suffered some heavy flanderization, and were nothing like the Blood Elves they depicted on the RTS. WoW lore went downhill from TBC (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lorelol).
---
if only they were able to kill him. then we wouldn't of ever had the cataclysm and the golden era of wow could have continued. i blame the ginger mage.
---
Engage.
---
Is the F&amp;f beta to lvl 60 ? are they doing raid testing ?
---
Sunken Temple has some decent loot. Avatar of Hakkar (hinterlands quest chain secret boss) drops some great clothie gear, and all the dragons flying around in the bottom can drop some good weapons/armor/jewelry at a low rate. Shade of Erakinus (last boss) drops a great shield and has a low chance to drop an epic 1h sword that summons whelps with its chance on hit.
---
&gt; Vanilla had no dynamic respawns so enjoy reporting it as a bug on release. 
---
Do we actually have concrete proof of this though, because Mark Kern himself seemed pretty confident it did:  [https://clips.twitch.tv/SincereSmellyWallabyBrainSlug](https://clips.twitch.tv/SincereSmellyWallabyBrainSlug)
---
Just from looking at this I can tell you're a level 20-25 Orc/Troll/Tauren who's finishing up Barrens and STM and just recently started progressing into Ashenvale
---
Vanilla is awesome
---
They improved a lot of aspect of the game (graphic overall), but the game feels so empty and boring.
---
I choose this shit old school game filled with emotion and feels instead of modern fast food style games.
---
I was 19 when WoW came out and I remember rolling an undead rogue and my current GF of the time asking me why blood was coming out of the skeletons in the starter zone for the undead.
---
It's a nice tool and all but does this need to be posted every day?
---
although /r/classicwowplus is more suitable for this kind of post, its not where classicwow fans are. In the images, it states I'm not trying to push for these changes, it's just what I picture my perfect wow. I don't see how its less suitable to be in this sub than a dog in goldshire ;)
---
Thanks, I was wondering about a 6 month discount sub.  Is there any confirmation this will be available for classic?  Or will retail and classic be on the same subscription?
---
Ya I'm agreeing. I was thinking about playing a mage main and druid alt, but the more mages and warriors around the better druid becomes. Could switch it back around. 
---
Hell druid isn't even bad against rogues. 1v1 it's a bit meh but in group play FF just dumpsters all over rogues.
---
I used to have your thought process then one day out of nowhere my name was taken on a game server. Some punk who probably saw it and complimented me on it took my name. Now I reserve my name when I can.
---
My end goal is the least popular pick.  Survival Hunter for PvP.  It gets crazy with T2 level gear.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
In vanilla you could F4 out of the game and when logging back in it would drop you at the next FP
---
In Classic there will be a button to do the same thing.
---
Cool, I'll be over here not understanding the "complex system that is layering"
---
Lul, oxygen must be nice all the way up there.
---
I have a total back story on my char for the last almost 15 years.  In my background story my warrior is from lakeshire and started adventuring after beating back the gnoll hoard in the near by woods.
---
[I got your back bro!](https://imgur.com/spOFL2G)
---
(Kinda regretting not buying MoP right when it came out and going digital for the last two expansions haha)
---
Buying blizzard friends pst
---
I loved the raids, lieing to my guild that I was over 18 but really I was a 13 year old and rarely talking on comms with my high pitched voice, I acquired hand of adal title so that made me happy to flex on my school friends
---
Who actually cares?
---
Let's not forget sharing quests in parties and battlegrounds.
---
Awesome idea. Will you run to your capital city to learn it right from the get go on launch day? 
---
Im going troll and I believe the trainer is in Org so I am not sure when exactly I should learn skinning to maximise gold making for level 40.
---
This looks more like a badly working private server.
---
Until classic actually launches, many classic posts are still over on /r/wow 
---
The same thing happened with /r/runescape and /r/2007scape , which now has twice the amount of members. A similar thing will happen with this subreddit. It will blow up in the months following the official release.
---
Another one converted, good job boys
---
Make sure the vendor isnt set to your spec. For me to upgrade a ring I had to set it from priest to all.
---
Hooray! Now people can stop looking and asking about beta invites - just like the first wave - if you don't know someone at blizzard and you don't stream - you aren't getting invited... wait for launch like everyone else.
---
&gt; why would you trust a company that has run this fanchise into the ground to make changes to Classic wow? They had 15 years to evolve the game and look at where we are now.
---
I don't like this argument because it's a bit lacking in logic. Every expansion post-vanilla was designed specifically with change in mind. 1.13 post-Classic content with be designed with a completely different philosophy in mind. How can you predict Blizzard to be bad at developing something they haven't really done before?
---
In fact, the only time that Blizzard has attempted to expand the principles of vanilla wow were the patches where we received content such as BWL, ZG, AQ, and Naxxramas. And those content updates were well received by the community. Plus, I always hear that Blizzard is still good at developing raid content in modern WoW and it's all of the other systems that are problematic. Classic WoW would never see those systems, so would Blizzard really be that terrible at developing further raid content in line with vanilla?
---
&gt;Finance: It would cost millions of dollars in development costs to provide something that would not generate new players.
---
I don't think anyone here really has enough information to be qualified enough to claim one or the other. We don't know what the development costs of classic WoW conten would be, nor do we know anything about subscription trends. However I will comment that it's not really about generating new players as it is keeping the ones who are still subscribed. I'm sure a lot of people, myself included, are going to be a lot less excited to go from Naxxramas to TBC, and we would be a lot more likely to check out some other games if vanilla WoW isn't continued. So the question becomes, would the development costs be worth retaining those subscriptions? And only Blizzard can really answer this, and they've pretty much already stated that they're waiting to see how Classic does before they commit to anything for this very reason.
---
&gt;Risk: This ties in with my first point. By adding new elements Blizzard would risk player outrage and dissatisfaction on a huge scale.
---
By definition introducing TBC carries the same exact risk. That's why I believe that Blizzard will launch new "fresh" Classic WoW servers at the same time they introduce any sort of post-Naxxramas content.
---
&gt;Community: It seems like Blizzard is actively taking feedback from the community and the overwhelming consensus is "No changes to Classic!"
---
TBC would included *a lot* more changes to Classic than additional content designed in the style of vanilla WoW would. 
---
&gt;Better alternative: A majority of Classic fans are also TBC fans.
---
Maybe. I've seen support for TBC and support for vanilla content split about 50/50. I also think a lot of people who would normally support additional content have been persuaded by some loud voices in the community that Blizzard is somehow incapable of still designing content in the same spirit as vanilla, which I think is absolute rubbish.
---
But only streamers got invited to the beta /s
---
Why is this being spammed daily?
---
Not just once daily either, several times a day.
---
wont that make you look like a fool since you misspelled "shield" so the macro wont work? 
---
:)
---
i mean you could just get the recipe and mats and find leatherworker to craft it for you?
---
Hi, /u/AHartleyGolf
---
These are the two classes I'm torn between. Rogue intrigued me since they have such a big toolkit. But ranged has always been my go-to in retail. Do rogues have trouble "keeping up" with ranged? Imp Sprint helps but it's just another cooldown. When it's down I feel like I'll always be lagging behind trying to catch up and open on a caster.
---
Yeah, and it's possible many years down the road if classicwow turns out to blizzards next cash cow. But this is just like all the videos on youtube saying how they would have ended GoT. Not gunna happen, but it's fun.
---
When exactly did you learn skinning? Did you just go to the trainer at level 1 or wait a few levels? 
---
I am going troll and I believe the only trainer is in Org so I am not sure when exactly I should go to learn it to maximise gold making for level 40.
---
The games not out yet
---
Difficult matchup. While leveling a BM hunter with bestial wrath off cooldown will absolutely shred you no contest. But if they don't have bestial wrath and don't manage to keep you at max range you can win by rushing them down and staying in their deadzone. Frost nova, polymorph pet, shatter combo. Then spam instants like cone of cold, fire blast, and arcane explosion while staying in deadzone till they die.
---
Its nice to just do your own thing and not being bothered by the other faction.
---
I do get why people play on pvp servers though. If I had more time I'd probably do that too :)
---
Depends on the guild, pugs will use masterloot with /roll.
---
If you are alliance and want an easy pet, here’s one:  
---
///Chicken repeated as many times as possible. Target a chicken near Farmer Salden and hit that a time or two while targeting a chicken until you see you can take the quest it gives you.
---
&lt;Nemesis&gt;
---
Faction: Horde
---
Server: PvP
---
Method : Semi-Hardcore w/ Loot Council
---
Raid Times: Monday, Wednesday at 8pm CST. 
---
&lt;Nemesis&gt; is a brand new guild created by long term players who raided into Naxx when Vanilla was live. More recently we have been playing on private servers. We are older now and realize that life sometimes gets in the way of this game we love so much. We can’t play at all times like we used to so we need to make the most of it. What makes Vanilla WoW so special is the journey and the community you enjoy it with. We are building a family and we hope you consider joining us if you’d like to be a part of that.
---
&lt;Nemesis&gt; will be focused on competing with three day guilds while maintaining a two day weekly raid schedule. However we are taking a few days off for the initial push to 60. We are currently planning to do Ony/MC exactly one month after launch. We will make the most of our raid times and expect all of our members to be prepared and consistent. We may not exactly be a server first competitive guild for phase 1, but we plan to clear all other phases within the first lockout they are released. As we evolve we will rival most hardcore guilds through later phases while keeping our raid days to a minimum.
---
We are recruiting both extremely experienced and newer players who are willing to grow and develop with our team. All members are expected to handle coaching well, and be patient with loot. It comes so slowly in vanilla but it will come. Every person in the raid team will be expected to come with consumables and flasks for progression. We do anticipate having some newer players in the guild so we need patient members who are willing to help guide and assist our newbies.
---
On our off nights we plan to do 20 man raids or PvP. We love both organized battleground teams and world PvP. 
---
If you’re interested in joining our team please contact us on discord for more information.

I've read ten of your comments so far and you have yet to give a real example. You just keep waving your hands and saying he's shoutcasting.
---
Am I alone in considering threads like this as barely veiled crying over not getting a bloody beta invite. Seriously guys it’s just a fucking game. Yes it’s thrilling to get back to the old Azeroth but speaking as someone with Aspergers you make me look in obsessive in my interests.
---
I started the same way. Was in a Walmart for whatever reason and managed to convince my mother to get that battle chest. I read through the mini-guides all the way home.
---
Sadly couldn't officially start as my parents didn't know it was a sub-based thing and didn't want to put dosh into that. Instead I just kept making trial accounts, playing non-stop for a week, then making a new one and repeating for ages until I was finally able to get an actual account.
---
Kinda his fault for scattering a ali, same thing could happen to anyone else
---
I agree that a lot of these posts are most likely BS. But at the very end of Vanilla you didn't need the ranks to get pvp gear
---
Whats the problem with having to log into it?  Just having to run to the first city to get to a mailbox?  Hell, even then you wouldnt have to do that part for...what, 4 weeks?
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
I tought december 2019 was the planned date for wc3 remastered. Atleast not planned but the deadline.

I was hoping it came out before classic...

**&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server - Early Weeknight Raids! (Tu, W, Th 7p-10p EST)**
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are building a community of like minded, mature players to enjoy Classic WoW and now is the time to join us!
---
**Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:**
---
* Druid (Heal)
---
* Hunter
---
* Paladin (Heal)
---
* Warlock
---
**Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!**
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

So, at lvl 60, we'd summon lowbies into opposite faction towns.  We'd start by saying "hey, we have a lvl 60 running us through this hard quest, anyone wanna join?  Can summon."  Then summon them into a town where they get corpse camped by guards.
---
It’s the F.N.G, sir.
---
So no then?
---
We got along just fine without guild banks during Vanilla and we don't need them in Classic.

Add one QoL improvement, then people want another, and another. Next thing you know things are back to being as bad as they are in Retail.

---
Yeah, garbage people all around.
---
I think you're undershooting with 50% increase from private servers. There are a ton of people who will play because its official. Very few players ever touched any form of private servers, even when retail was in a drought.
---
A great example of this is WoD had some of the lowest player numbers ever. However private servers didn't see a huge jump in players during this time.
---
**&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild**
---
* No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
**Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):**
---
* The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
**PvE:**
---
* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* Mature players interested in raiding and playing to support end game content.
---
* Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing later into the evening with a friendly group.
---
* It would be great to get several farm groups going, so even if you just want to goof off and get carried by the main raid team through BWL while we're farming our 12th Ashkandi for a hunter... come on by!
---
* We will also be pushing AoTC and Mythic+10 content Horde side on retail WoW, so that option will also be available.
---
* Anyone that is also looking to participate in both retail and classic, this will be a great fit for you (though it's certainly not required).
---
**General Gaming Schedule:**
---
* 8:30 - 11:30 PT Weeknights and Weekends
---
**Raid Scheduled:**
---
* TBD, though our current Retail raid schedule is Wednesday/Thursday
---

I'm not sure what that addon did, but in terms of addons in general, they said if we had the same system as they used to, we could automate classes with them only requiring for you to spam one button and you'd do the perfect rotation. The addon developers have become far better at it over the years.
---
The macro I used more than anything was one that started casting Immolate and told my Voidwalker to attack at the same time. Forgot how it's written, but I'll figure out once the game comes out.

Holy shit stop complaining like a little bitch. Honestly... just be happy people are organizing amazing events like this. People like you Will never be happy no matter what happens.

I agree with skipping spells if you don’t need them. Frost shock is great, though; let’s you kite mobs like a warrior as a shaman if you’re using a slow 2h wep.

Path of Exile leagues. Every league, something is changed, but we all enter the league knowing that some items will be expensive etc. The interesting part is watching how the market reacts to sleeper items becoming meta staples, and how it settles after a few weeks
---
Chinese gold farmers are wherever they can make a profit. If classic is as big as many believe it’s going to be, you can almost guarantee that the gold farmers will follow.
---
That’s a fair perspective; and I agree with the second point wholeheartedly- I’ve never understood why people enjoy ruining other people’s experience, so I try to avoid being in situations where I can encounter those people. I’ve never been that into PvP but I can definitely understand the appeal. 
---
And don’t consider yourself naive- Reddit is a small, vocal minority of the playerbase. I suspect most of the folks on PvP servers are looking for the exact same thing you are. It just comes with the added misfortune of having to deal with some bad apples. You’ll have have a good time on PvP servers regardless of what some self-impressed tough guys do to try and ruin your time with it haha.
---
Look in the LFG monday treat and see if there is a guild that fits.
---
There should also be a discord dedicated for LFGuild.

You could test your luck there.

I still fondly remember CoD United Offensive, that shit was amazing from start to finish.

# &lt;Tilted Gryphons&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore] EVENINGS EASTERN
---
Tilted Gryphons is a friendly guild which is looking for social and progression-oriented players in order to complete all the content in Classic, and have a rowdy good time doing it. We don't mind if you're new to Vanilla or played in 2005, we have room for everyone if they're willing to be a positive member of our community.
---
* Be one of the top raiding guilds on Alliance for our server!
---
* Be a welcoming and friendly environment that you WANT to play with every night.
---
* Clear all content as efficiently as we reasonably can.
---
* Have a dedicated PVP team past Phase 3 interested in getting titles for those who want them.
---
* Generate great content and wholesome memes.
---
* Emulate the Gryphon. Have a friendly attitude, don't be a dick, help the pride, but have drive and passion when called upon.
---
* For our raiders, the willingness to improve. Don't require previous experience, just the ability to better yourself and the raid!
---
* Be able to use Discord with push to talk if you're interested in being an endgame player.
---
We're thinking a 3 night raiding guild, likely weekends plus one or two. The days are not defined yet (we're going to wait a month or two for people to get their fall timetables for uni, work schedules, etc) but will be discussed together with the members.

DKP with loot council for MT/OT gear.

It wasn’t a forced forfeit, judges decided it would be a redo. But yeah he was 100% gonna win and lost cause of fear RNG. He got fucked in the redo as well cause of fear forcing him to run back instead of getting a quick drink off since he was out of bounds. I’m surprised they didn’t use gurubashi arena or something else enclosed as to prevent BS like that.

I'm sorry, but in what way was it worth it? Farming the same mobs over and over for weeks (or months) just isn't fun. And you're rewarded with anything other than a mount that looks slightly different? I will never understand it.
---
I can understand farming for something that's going to give you an edge in the game, and I can understand putting a bit of extra time into obtaining something slightly different and cool. But that's just insane
---
Looks like stats use to have caps? WHY did you get rid of this Blizz?! One of my favorite aspects of older MMOs was coming up with an amazing character template...or seeing how far beyond a stat cap I can push my character to do insane damage.
---
For all you DAoC players, I had a Cabalist that had 430 dexterity fully buffed. Had insane cast time. Or a wizard with 400 int that could one shot anyone who wasnt capped on their resists.
---
Blizzard is letting us create up to 3 characters per realm 2 weeks before launch comes out. One of these characters will likely be my bank alt.
---
On launch day, the servers are going to be pressured incredibly, and that includes the loading screen when you first log in, which may take quite a while depending on how stressed the servers are. Logging into a bank alt, just to wait 20 seconds to log back out, then spending another (potentially long) loading screen to log back into my main is really annoying when all I want to do is start leveling and pulling ahead of the pack.
---
It sounds super min/maxy (oh you only save 2 minutes in the long run) but if that's something that's testable now then why not? 2 minutes is the difference between getting to a named mob first or a loot quest first and not having to wait 5 minutes for a respawn while 20 other people have caught up.
---
I imagine they will do this alongside a random wave, but you never know. You can always verify your chances by visiting https://willigetbeta.com

My plan is to take LW and Enchanting upto 60.  Get a friendly LW to use my skins to make shit I can DE to level Enchanting.
---
ven deserves the win but snutz is a terrible warlock for losing to a mage...
---
There isn't any "low-pop" server because of sharding. The real issue they were getting at is that the people you see around you are virtually disposable. If you are new with no heirlooms then most people you meet will outlevel you and you won't see them again. Even if they don't have heirlooms or fp, you can't guarantee you'll see them again when you log in because of sharding. Plus there's like nothing to group up for anymore during questing.
---
It creates a feeling that nothing is persistent and everyone is disposable.
---
I’d put it this way. Raiding and dungeon mechanics are better in retail than Classic but Server community and the stories you can make for yourself is so much better in Classic. And before people a real lfr at me we all know that Mythic raiding is hard as all hell.
---
If you raided midweek instead of weekends you'd be a perfect match :(
---
Enjoy not being able to log on and having everything revolve around them then.
---
No one? I was giving an example of gatekeeping.
---
Just play rust if you wanna scam and loot other people's inventory
---
Also shit click to open was rather quick anyways
---
Don’t forget in the early levels, mages have polymorph and it heals enemies. That is some fun trolling.
---
How is repeatedly ganking someone a dick move? I’m not talking going to red ridge at 60 and ganking low levels. I mean someone is questing in the same Zone, competing with you for kills, ore, quest objectives etc. 
---
I see no problem chain ganking him till he leaves or logs. It’s part of the game.
---
If you don’t wanna get ganked don’t play on a pvp server. 
---
If it’s red it’s dead.
---
I mean I guess. I played Bc - MoP clearing raids at their hardest difficulty. I think I pressed Y maybe twice an expansion. 
---
If you actually play the game, they are completely meaningless and inconsequential to ones enjoyment or progress through the game so long as a person doesn’t arbitrarily feel compelled to “get all the points”.
---
I’m not asking for them in Vanilla, nor do I want them. But I really struggle to see the downside,if you don’t like the “completionist treadmill” don’t engage with it. I guarantee you can kill all mythic bosses you want. And mythic raiding is the only content on live you can’t easilly pug. 
---
That said, I’m sure to have fun, but it’s vanilla wow, released in 2004, most of us have played it before, that’s why we are here, there is no curiosity left in this game. Between vanilla to wrath and my time on pservers, I’ve been everywhere, ran around every tree, know the hills and how to break contact with pursuing alliance and get back to gromgol without agroimg raptors or crocs. I know where thorium and dreamfoil spawns are. I even know the spawn locations of Npcs so I can stand right on the spot to guarantee tags when areas are under heavy traffic.
---
IMO looting and inventory in vanilla are at a good sweet spot without skinning. Items have value, bag space has value, item stacks aren't crazy, and each looted mob has meaning (no aoe looting).
---
If I'm competing with somebody else for quest tags I don't want to decide between skinning the recently killed mob or tagging the next mobs plus keeping a mental list of all the previous corpses I left behind, when they will despawn, etc.
---
IMO finding an herb or mining node could take more total time but it's more gratifying like a treasure hunt.
---
I think this is highly subjective subject.
---
I main Healer/Support in about every game and naturally Priester and Shamane are much much easier, than Mage or Rogue, for me. Especially since if you fuck up as Mage/Rogue you can get under pressure pretty quickly.
---
My guess would be that, since many of those screens were used for promotional purposes, they either used a higher rez texture pack for those armor pieces specifically or they cranked up the graphical detail settings well beyond what was allowed in the final game.
---
A lot of the images also seem to be a bit 'touched up' with some sharpening tool and color/contrast boosting. Again, for promotional purposes.
---
Just looked it up and it was removed sometime before 1.12, sounds like he teleports you to camp t if you answer wrong now. Oh well, still neat that it used to work that way.
---
Eh, I don't think most raids would meet that standard. AQ40 came out 6 months after BWL. BWL didn't take 6 months for us to clear.
---
he looks like somebody i know named earl. is he earl? lol
---
This is going to sound very hypocritical based on my comment but, I didn't raid at all in TBC. Was an arena kid through and through. 8+ hours a day. Full neck beard and an overblown sense of pride about my arena rating. Which was high at 2375 but, no where near high enough to justify my arrogance. Playing 8+hours a day should have gotten me higher then 2375 lol.
---
Something about this screams that it wasn’t made by Blizzard....
---
I mean, who isn't gonna play classic at launch? Even those who don't stick around or aren't even all that thrilled about classic, are still gonna play it day one.
---
They real question here is how long do people stick around. A couple weeks and quit before cap? A months because they get bored after cap? A couple months if they run out of content before next phase, but then come back? Or Maybe some will just play indefinitely thru-out.
---
As a stealther team up with a stealther of the enemy faction.
---
Start duels with your faction members and stealth before the duel starts. Then have the other faction guy stealth around your duelling partner. When they see him they will attack thinking it's you and flag themselves. Works best with a high level enemy Rogue against lowbie duels.
---
I worked out exactly how much I needed for the training and knife (not at home right now but I think it was about 98c) and, yeah, ran to Org as soon I had it.
---
My actual route is going to involve running to the Tauren start zone where there will be 1/5th of the players, skinning critters and getting FPs along the way, but shhh ;)
---
Sony talking about payo's betrayal just before payo pops sprint to beat him to the mining node is too perfect.
---
Then you didn't read my comments.  No talking about Venruki csing the warrior to keep him in combat, Tipsout said pvp trinket was a 3 minute cooldown at 1 point.  I kind of tuned them out after a while because most of what they said was just filler.  The guy with Tipsout could have talked about what each class had to do to win.
---
that's really awesome actually, I have never seen those.
---
A lot of older MMOs had this. In fact I kind of prefer it this way. You had gear and other attributes though that allowed you to go beyond that cap. So let's say an epic piece of gear had something like (+20 to strength cap). Often times you would be over cap, so that epic piece of gear would bump you over the base cap.
---
This allowed for the creation of gear templates. It often was not easy or cheap to get optimal stat allocation.
---
Thank you. I prefer Horde (undead mage) and PvE for sure, EU.
---
Things should be okay but I thought maybe people will try to be considerable of others that aren't vets and know everything.
---

Shoutout to Boulderfist!!
---
&gt;Current high level content demands so much of players, and after 15 years, everyone has a basic understanding of the usual "trope mechanics" that comparatively Vanilla raids will be facerolls.
---
You are sort of right, but the difficulty in high level modern content is nearly solely based on the boss tactics, and maintaining a high level of DPS while dodging mechanics.
---
You can't really compare it to Vanilla, because there were so many more requirements than just knowing the boss strategy and turning up, such as resist gear, mp5, World buffs (in later tier). On top of that, the more people there are in the raid, the higher the probability of someone messing up and wiping the raid.
---
I'm not saying that it's going to be harder than modern mythic content, but it's a different kind of difficulty, and it may be slightly premature to condemn it as faceroll, when we don't actually know how modern players are going to respond to true Vanilla raids (not pserver remakes), with basic mechanics such as threat, and strict mana management, that have been forgotten with time.
---
gtfo
---
Character creation opens on August 26th, one day before launch.
---
30-40 is the first real hurdle in vanilla leveling. If you have the fortitude to make it to 40, you'll have no problem (except time) making it to 60.
---
This character is on Thorium Brotherhood, NA servers.  I believe this server is also tied to Farstriders.  I plan on releveling either a hunter, rogue, or warrior next and can start the journey with you!
---
People also forget creating new raids is expensive and before they created lfr a very small percentage of the player base ever cleared them. There is a reason we got naxx 2.0 after all.
---
How was the warrior leveling experience? I really want to roll a tank for my group of friends I’ll hopefully be starting out with, but I’ve heard it can be painfully slow. I’ve read here and there that you can tank in any spec, and some people even go through it as an arms tank. Any tips on that? Also- was mining profitable at all for you? I’m planning on grabbing mining, engineering and then cooking/fishing to supplement myself as I grind out to 60.
---
I remember that rogues and mages did very well in pve gear because their survivability is based on stealth and control more so than the stamina provided by pvp gear. 
---
That’s said, it’s still a bit of a “glass cannon” playstyle but no PvP team would turn down a naxx geared rogue or pom mage that can instantly dump ~3k dmg on a flag carrier or healer.
---
I literally forgot about that till just now
---
Yeah!  I particularly remember the guilds "Clothing Optional" and "Shaman r teh Overpower"
---
You could run to org at level 1/2 so long as you have the silver to train skinning and buy the skinning knife. In my personal experience it doesn't really make much different whether you get it right away or wait until level 6 when you leave the starting zone. I just wouldn't wait until level 10 to get in.
---
So when at the latest do I have to activate my subscription?
---
"And what made you decide to become a Skinner?"
---
Mr Krabs: Money!
---
Keep in Mind that in Raids you're not allowed to put DOTs up on Mobs.
---
The idea was good but sadly butchered. Would have been smarter to have the participants fly to a remote place where a lvl 1 couldn't get in an hour and have a backup plan accessible through a hearthstone previously set. Hope next time is less of a clown fiesta.
---
The character building mechanics are unlike anything I've seen in any other board game. They did a wonderful job re-creating the feeling of choosing how you want your character to play. The Shadows expansion adds some excellent additional diversity. The BC expansion's dungeons are a neat concept as well, though the Outland board appeals to me less.
---
Unfortunately playing a "proper" 6 person game is far too time consuming. Single-faction 2-3 player games where you just work toward killing the final boss are much more manageable for my group. Since we never found pvp in the board game very interesting it works really well for us.
---
I bought Shadows on a whim back when it came out and didn't get around to using it until a year or two ago. Very glad I got it before the price went crazy. ;)
---
Still great for pulling and bosses since it's a huge amount of instant threat.
---
Cringy as fuck. You are the kind of guy who would identify as a "gamer", are you not?
---
I was told that it will be free with a sub they didn't say that you even need bfa
---
lmao hell yea, tell him to pick something!
---
I seem to recall EP/GP being pretty successful in our raiding guild when I last played retail in Legion. Not like it really mattered at that time, though, since everyone had everything.
---
PVP-H-Warlock, semi hardcore looking for raiding guild. Vanilla raiding experience,  I am central timezone but would be open to others depending on how late they go.
---
You could wall jump all of vanilla.
---
It depends on your class and exact pathing.  The main guy putting together fedex guides did his run in the most recent stress test and posted the state of his character at the end of it:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buy7b6/results_from_my_110_fedex_run_during_yesterdays/
---
Basically he had all his skills, 3x 6 slot bags, a reasonably relevant weapon, and just enough silver left over to buy a 20 stack of water and start questing/grinding at lvl 10.
---
Would be a bloodbath on raid Bosses with All the warriors and rogues in the raid
---
I disagree, that's when it was most fun. Snapshotting all your buffed up dots and keeping them up for as long as possible as affliction added real depths to the gameplay
---
&gt; but I'm a tryhard weirdo who likes weirdo builds. It's an old game lets be creative and have fun.
---
He/she explained this in the first paragraph.
---
Are you dense? I essentially said I didn’t want anything done. 
---
I see griefing as a community problem not a GM problem. 
---
Don’t like some asshole griefing your PvP tournament? Host it in a contested area, and having security there to kill fuck heads.
---
There was some good gameplay by the competitors.  The Sodapoppin v. Snutz series was very good.  Soda should not have had a chance and he was within a razor thin margin of actually winning.  In that series for example Tipsout was announcing that Soda was getting his mana drained when he was in cat form.
---
Systems-wise classic is supposed be 1.12 
---
Content is essential all that will be implemented in phases.
---
Loot council. I would never join a guild with anything else.
---
My dream is wow. But the lore is rewritten to actually make sense. KT doesnt backstab illidan. Illidan isnt evil, but you can fight him if you side with shadowsong. Warden rep vs illidari rep. 
---
Horde and alliamce races split occationally. Maybe more factions.
---
I dont know.. i always had guildies summon me when i was leveling an alt. Just friendly people helping out. I guess i was in the minority there.
---
most people will play until the last phase when all raids are on farm status then it will be the same thing over and over, eventually blizz will have to do something. i think creating new content in the vein of vanilla within classic would be awesome tbh
---
And continue leveling after 40 without your mount because you won't have enough gold? No thanks, I'll take the extra time to collect my free gold after killing beasts. It's not all about min/maxing time throughout the entire 1-60, it's about the actual process of leveling including pre 40. Maybe the time wasted not having your mount right away at 40 is more than the time wasted to skin mobs pre 40.
---
In my experience DKP has never worked, just creates tension (Especially if you are not in a hardcore guild). Probably a combination of loot council and /roll
---
it’s just a beta dude. grow up.
---
That's assuming that trollgodx's main is Horde. Could've been an alliance griefing using a Horde lvl 1.
---
I won't rely on it completely, but it is something I really enjoyed doing.
---
Hahahah, I was suspicious while reading. Lack of empathy is so sad.
---
&gt; how it was basically spending a whole day with 39 other people for a small chance that something useful to me would drop.
---
People play on-line computer games for many different reasons. They play for the competitive aspect, they play for the shinies, they play just to experience the world and they play for being part of a team.
---
Current retail WoW caters well to the players who are in it for the gear as you describe in the quote I cherry-picked. Loot is personalized now and the gearing is designed to provide a steady drip of upgrades. It also caters to the competitive players. The recent rivalry between the top guilds for world first raid clears in BfA was actually something I enjoyed watching. 
---
Retail does not cater well to the players who want to be part of team or to players who just like to experience the world. Personally those reasons are why I played WoW. I loved passing a raid gear drop to a guildie because it was a small upgrade for me but a huge upgrade for them.
---
LFR (and LFG) and Mythic+ raiding have squeezed the middle life out of the raiding scene. You're either one of the top 100 or so raiders on your server or you LFR, which is some of the dullest gameplay in the game rn.
---
With the possible exception of MoP, the zones since Cata have been awful to get around in. I once ran, ran not rode, from Wintergrasp to Silithus just because I could. No-one goes to Deepholm, or Gorgrond or Volduun to just hang out. People avoid the Legion zones like the plague they are. People went to places in Vanilla.
---
&gt;Like getting the Undying in Naxx when it was wrath content, an actually difficult title to get.
---
It wasn't really, it was still possible to get the achievement/title when everyone was geared to the teeth with ICC gear.
---
It would have been difficult if they only made it available through T7, but I get your point.
---
lol no :-)
---
I will look into my language and writing as I do not think that I have a strange tone and accuse anybody. I was just making people aware that there are others who aren't veterans. Thanks and I will definitely look into it.
---
Had a misunderstanding here, english is not my native, i meant that you cant get improved sprint + prep, which is a must to even have a chance vs mage
---
I'm looking forward to old Sunken Temple so much. Has to be one of my favorite vanilla dungeon designs, though maybe I'm just some kind of masochist.
---
It is a good idea, though TBH I don't like the look of the Reforged graphics and have already just started a replay of WC3 will do Frozen Throne after in lead up to Classic launch.
---
Hahaha man there's gonna be a lot of suspensions and timeouts in Classic.
---
As it is only two months until august, I highly doubt WC Reforged comes out before classic. Probably a November, October release.
---
Jack Frost as *Blizzard*. I approve.
---
Because War 3 has been completely playable the last 15 years and WoW hasn't.
---
Why do people do anything in WoW? I found out about the mount, I liked the look of it, I wanted the reward, I got the reward. I still use the mount today. You don’t have to understand it, and like I said in my post, my guild mates thought I was crazy for doing it. 
---
Would it have been cool if they had removed the mount after Vanilla? I suppose it would make it a little more special. But I don’t regret grinding it out, even though it’s incredibly easy these days.
---
Why is this by spec?
---
Not happening. There's like been complete radio silence since Blizzcon.
---
Can't remember when they updated it but it was this year. 
---
Only doing it for raids since dungeons would be easy for guildies or friends would be able to need items they can't use in order to trade it to their friend.
---
I only played vanilla and quit in tbc but my noob ass managed a warrior in a little over 6 days thanks to guides but that was questing. But I am likely coming back with a friend and considering a mage this time around got any resources for the grind method ? ;)
---
I've been interested in trying out Suicide Kings.
---
Noob question
---
I saw a leveling guide on youtube the other day and he said you should get skinning and vendor everything you get. I was confused because I thought "shouldn't you sell it on the auction house?"
---
Is the auction house not a thing in Classic?? Why is OP and the youtube guy suggesting you vendor the stuff you skin as opposed to selling it on the auction house?
---
Did this place ever exist in live severs? never seen it https://i.imgur.com/o8M1dQj.jpg
---
Its funny I actually felt like 40-50 was the worst. Longer to level, quests start getting a little more sparse, it still feels like you have a solid ways to get to 60, and not as many awesome zones like STV, for 30-40 or Hillsbrad for 20-30. Just my opinion ofc
---
&gt; is that how long it took him to get bored
---
This. Also I reached auberdine where he couldn't attack me anymore without getting attacked by guards.
---
 I mean it was still my starting days. I didn't want to play an alt or logging off. It was my 2nd day playing WoW I was young and had a pretty hefty amount of free time. 
---
And in the end, I got my cold blooded revenge. It was before Patch 2.0.10, before mangle received a 30% damage reduction. I was abusing my higher level and that mangle damage.
---
They've added more info regarding this, only applies to soulbound items that drops in raids.

The relation between chaos and exalted orbs changes throughout the league in a fairly predictable pattern.

One has an entire team dedicated to recreating the art assets and the other does not.
---
Wow!  
---
This is a very huge collection of alpha images!  
---
Thank you for sharing these :D
---
&gt; do you have entire nights where you can't even get into the instance?
---
lol no you underestimate the freight train power of a 40man fully buffed raid group running to the instance.
---
You are wrong in everything
---
Azure Silk Belt is useful but I don’t see how that sword would be useful to anyone
---
Its a change to reduse the work of the staff. But they wanted to imploment it aswell in 5man. And that didn't felt right because its easly abusable.
---
They changed it to only work in raids and we are happy about that.
---
This was one of the first big changes they wanted to imploment and im so glad that after some discussion within the communitie they decided to change it to raids only.
---
But yea, I don't care if we ge it or not, im just glad its not that big of a deal now.
---
Leveling as a warrior isn't so bad, I don't find it too boring or too difficult or anything and I normally level solo. If I follow any guides or quest in a certain area, I will make sure that I outlevel the mobs there by a couple levels in order to make things quicker and safer. You can certainly tank in any spec fairly easily up until 60 (might start getting a little difficult at 50ish). When Classic hits I'll probably level as fury until 40 when I get Mortal Strike, switch to arms until 60 and then maybe switch to protection depending on who I am playing with. Your plan to get cooking/fishing as you level is good and will help you out a lot without too much time investment. Don't forget first aid though, it is a must, especially for warriors. Mining is always a good investment but you will likely be using all of your mats to level engineering unless you are mining like a madman.
---
Won't be that many pugs. Those group that will pick up random players are gonna consist of a core (10-20 people) from a certain guild that will organize everything and make sure to handle the logistics. Most likely there will be some kind of soft res/hard res system where some items will be reserved for the guild and the PuGs joining beforehand will be able to "soft res" an item, meaning that if the item drops only people that "soft reserved" the item will be able to roll for it.
---
Yeah the 8% are litterly the biggest thing to mention.
---
To live in the past.
---
Level 40 class quests 😈. So awesome
---
There is a huge difference between vanilla's "No flying, ever", and current "You get flying...3/4 of the way through the expansion, after jumping through a bunch of meaningless achievement hoops".
---
If you're going to have flying, just have flying.  Ding level cap, pay a nominal gold sum and be on your way, like how it worked for something like 4 expansions before they decided that nah we're gonna try to close Pandora's box.
---
King might not be allowed because of their subsidiary company that makes mobile games. Weird, but possible.
---
&gt; Just have fun mate
---
This is something that im actively working on rewiring in my brain.  For so many years on retail i was a 'gogogo, powerlevel' kind of person.  Just go to the next objective, queue up for another dungeon, etc.
---
This weekend i no lifed a little mage with zero help from my mains (BoA gear, gold, no pet battle dalies, etc.  I sent gold to my main from the alt when i trained riding for the mount i didnt have to buy.  No getting on my main to farm cloth for tailoring.  No sending over old mats i have on other alts for enchanting, etc).  Ive been keeping up with professions quite well (okay, fishing is only like 120...), though im not sure if im going to have enough gold to train flying at 60.  I think my enchanting/tailoring are going to be a bit shy of 300 when i hit 60, though i might just go to 275 since thats all you really needed to start using outlands stuff to level IIRC? (at least when i started in Wrath).
---
Not really sure yet.  
---
I also turned off quest tracking on my map and minimap.  Unfortunately some objectives still show up on the minimap when you get close, and the arrow is still there at times (i try to ignore it, but it doesnt work all the time).  Im reading every quest and using the clues in there to find the mobs...like i had to do on the stress test.  Its actually been a lot of fun!  Except for that one quest in...Swamp of Sorrows? where it tells you the objective is to the east and its actually to the west....
---
Im using minimal addons.  Unitframes, bartender, bagnon (because i cant play without that one), skada, and a couple other basic ones.   No NPCscan/rare finders, no quest helpers, etc.  
---
Its been a shitload of fun, and i can honestly say this is the most addicted ive been to the game in at least half a decade.  Its nuts.  I even joined some random guild that invited me in the mid 20s (almost declined.  I think guilds might give an xp boost, and they have the reduced hearthstone thing...but chatting is nice, and a new player would have those bonuses now anyways), and its been nice getting to know some new people.
---
I cant wait to get home tonight and hopefully get to 60...and then grind professions lol
---
Then its on to Outlands!  Man, i dont know if ive ever read those quests...
---
That’s a good reason.
---
Not everyone levels in snail pace
---
I can’t wait till alliance hold one of their own. It will be great to see them streamers drop like flies.
---
There are hardly any private server players on Horde most of them are on Alliance.... Horde has the retail players
---
I am so scared from BO4 I am not preording or buying the game until I see it. Cod has fucked me without lube too many times these past several years.

(NA/PVP/Alliance)
---
Who we are: &lt;Birds of a Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
What we are looking for: A person who is dedicated to the cause. We want people who show up to raids on a consistent basis (80%+). We understand things happen sometimes but just don’t make it a habit. We are looking for people who are more concerned with the progress of the group than the individual. We are serious about clearing content but can’t dedicated our lives to playing all day any more. We want people who are serious, on time, and want to clear content in a timely manner. This means when we raid at a certain time we are all in the raid at that time. Not all logging on at the time.
---
How we operate: We are ideally looking to raid two days a week. For three hours a night. Currently looking at Tuesday and Thursday 7/8-10/11 EST. For loot we run Loot Council. We prioritize giving loot to people who are actively trying to help the guild. This includes showing up to raids on time, attend raids regularly, help other guild members to get them raid ready, contribute items to the guild, listen to directions, etc.
---
What we are recruiting: Pretty much everything and anything at this point. You can check what we are looking for on our website linked below.
---
If you have any questions you can message our GM on discord @ frail_#3482

---
Well see, WSG won't be out until phase 3 which is going to be god knows how long, probably good +6 months at least
---
you know a guild bank can still be cleared of items when someone becomes corrupt?
---
I'd love if Blizzard would make a new mmorpg that has similar principles as in vanilla wow. Leave classic there as it is and create something completely new for all those people who want a little grind, constant small progression and community interaction. Vanilla dev once said that they would loved to make the third ''monster'' faction that would have specialized most in pvp and they could fight even among themselves. Now would be the time to make that happen in a completely new game
---
I guess i just dont really feel the need for my bank alt to have an awesome name, so i was assuming you'd have to make it that day.  Ill be using those name slots for a couple of main alts i plan on playing.
---
I had a Fiery War Axe drop in Tanaris off some random scorpid I was beating down. 
---
That thing alone helped a great deal to fund my 40 mount. Too bad the screenshot is gone.
---
I meant more like why are the players against classic wow having better visuals but okay with warcraft 3 getting new visuals.
---
They could easily port the models from retail into classic if they wanted/fans allowed.
---
It's actually [an April Fools joke.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/New_World_of_Warcraft_Player_vs._Player_Combat_Improvements)
---
I just want to say that Chernobyl is hands down one of the best productions HBO has put out, absolutely striking.
---
It all depends on the scenario. Whether it’s battlegrounds, world pvp, duels, it’s all a bit different. 
---
A good rogue will always beat a bad hunter. A good hunter will always beat a bad rogue (unless there’s a huge gear difference between the two).
---
Rogues are very cool down dependent. If you have all your cool downs you can beat almost anyone. If you don’t then it’s not as easy. The good part is that you usually get to pick your fights. Even then I didn’t find myself waiting on my cool downs to reset and just picked my fights according to what I had available. 
---
My hunter was my main and my better geared character but I found my rogue to be more fun in pvp. You just have so much control and i found it more fun to be the one chasing people rather than being chased.   
---
However it was likely that my rogue was more fun to me because it was newer to me. I had already reached exalted with all 3 battlegrounds and reached rank 10 before I started to play my rogue. 
---
I would suggest you watch some vanilla wow pvp videos from rogues and hunters to get a better idea.
---
early gurubashi arena
---
Traps in Desolace, Vile Reef quests in STV, Tidal Charm camping(!), just to name a few
---
&gt;Not because it was difficult, but because it was just time consuming. Classic is designed to suck your time out because it lacked pretty much everything else.
---
Well, it's sort of more because it was actually an RPG, which are more about building up your character to beat content, rather than having a twitch trigger finger when dodging mechanics on mythic, then being showered in titanmythicazerite900000 legendaries.
---
Indeed a lot of the screenshots are from early to mid 2004. However if you visit [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20071124103907/http://media.pc.ign.com/media/016/016985/imgs_97.html) you will see that it goes all the way to 2001. Unfortunately many of the images are no longer accessible. These two are the oldest ones that are available.

The reason why I've skipped some of the alpha and pre-alpha images is because they've been posted on this subreddit multiple times already.

As free as makes no difference.

Yesterday for example I stood in Boralus. I checked my map for world quests. Found one I wanted to do, jogged to the flight master, flew the nearest FP. Hopped on my trusty cat and rode to the WQ. Which was to heal Azeroth's woons five times. So I artfully guided my character to five glowy markers on the screen and clicked the little necklace symbol on my screen five times.
---
For which I got a 10 iLevel upgrade to something I forget. For less than 5 minutes of effort and with no possibility of failure.
---
Then I hearthed back to Boralus.

It's due to 'Movement Client Limitations' as the the 3rd tab of the google doc puts it.  By experience I learned that if I just ran straight into an area I could go some distance before being dismounted while if I was strafing or turned it would pretty much immediately dismount.
---
Though it didn't feel like 500ms, it felt like it was up to 2 seconds like the 'Out of combat timer'
---
For the wsg it definitely considers that part of the keep to be 'outside' if you look at the minimap.  Any 'indoor' area would have black space and only show the corridors instead of the surrounding zone.  As for whether that part was considered outdoors in vanilla I honestly don't remember.
---
What is it with all these mentally ill people like you coming onto reddit lately that cannot construct a proper argument if your life depended on it?
---
Instead of addressing any point being made you instantly default to insults.
---
As a healer, these stairs give me cold sweats.  It was also the most incredibly fun encounter!  I can't wait to do it all over again

All those items are easy to get preraid items. What is your point?

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Wed or Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: 
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing. 
---
We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST and will pick between Tues, Wed, and Thurs when it becomes more relevant. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first. 
---
Player Expectations: 
---
We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That being said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient. Players should also aim for at least 80%+ attendance.
---
As we will also wish to continue clearing the raids after MC, the number of players using meme specs will be capped and approved on a case-by-case basis only after you have shown that you are willing to go the extra mile that is needed to perform.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game. 
---
On Culture:
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit. 
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel
---
https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb
---
Man i remember getting absolutist wrecked my first few runs of ZF. Can't wait to do it again!
---
I could never get into arena in bc, felt too intimidated haha
---
Gonna be the same on classic at launch
---
Buff people with waterwalking right as they take a big leap towards a body of water. A little niche and more useful in TBC, but you never know.
---
If anyone knows what the Rank 11 mounts and Alterac Valley mount costs in the version we are playing please tell me! 
---
All I've found was for the update after the mount system version we're using.
---
Psychology isn’t a proper subject dude, no wonder you had to get a PHD to stay relevant.
---
^ this guy played DAOC me thinks. Yup, I loved that system in DAOC. SI itemization was great, and ToA would have been awesome if artifacts didn't blow up the entire game balance. 
---
@ /u/ghidawi, stat caps in other games allow the devs to strictly tune both PvE and PvP by assuming that players can basically not do more than X DPS or would not have more than Y HP or Z resistances. You could add gear that increased the cap, but that type of gear would be strictly controlled to prevent power creep and be taken into account for future itemization and/or balancing. 
---
Honestly, WoW would have hugely benefited from this design IMO. Lack of caps and vertical progression led to raid or die which arguably lead to where we are today (welfare epics, backlash to welfare epics, more accessible raiding, more raiding difficulties to appease hardcore players, LFR, etc).
---
Might be full PuG raids later on, probably running with a GDKP loot system.
---
Half Life 3 confirmed!
---
I wouldn't mind it if they released BC and WotLK.
---
WotLK was always my favourite time in WoW. If Classic will be as popular as I hope, and if we're looking at the subscriber numbers from back in the day, I don't think it's impossible that they will.
---
The amount of players increased all the way through Vanilla, BC and hit 12 million in WotLK. If Blizz thinks something similar could happen again, I can totally see them doing it.
---
But new content as you say would be equally good, if not better.
---
Hyjal would have been an ideal place. Big open spaces and once you're there you can summon the duelists. Good luck getting there as a level 1.
---
Yeah the same people that gave us BFA will definitely be able to deliver on the standards of classic wow we should definitely put our faith in a corporation like Activision Blizzard.
---
What is that?
---
&gt;How can you predict Blizzard to be bad at developing something they haven't really done before?
---
Well the change they had in mind was trash. The change they have in mind now is to make every aspect of the game about in-game monetization and most of the people who worked on classic WoW don't work for Blizzard anymore, so yeah, I'll take "Blizzard will fuck up" for 500.
---
&gt; Classic WoW would never see those systems, so would Blizzard really be that terrible at developing further raid content in line with vanilla? 
---
Because power creep is a thing. A fresh lvl 60 rogue does about 200 dps or so and around 450 with MC gear. By the end of Naxx the same rogue does about 800dps. A big part of vanilla was that a bunch of lvl 40 characters could actually kill a lvl 60 char or that a lower geared char could kill a highly geared char. If you add more raids and increase the power level of the characters all that goes out the window.
---
&gt; I don't think anyone here really has enough information to be qualified enough to claim one or the other.
---
I am qualified enough. Even low end developers at Blizzard make about 65k/a. It took them years to re-engineer Classic. New content will require developmend AND testing. If they have a team of 50 people it's 3.2mil a month and that's just wages and not accounting for the better paid leads.
---
&gt; I'm sure a lot of people, myself included, are going to be a lot less excited to go from Naxxramas to TBC, and we would be a lot more likely to check out some other games if vanilla WoW isn't continued. 
---
You don't have any numbers to back that up. I think if we made a pol TBC would straight up win, because in 2 years people will already have been playing classic for 2 years and probably want something new. I am also very sure that you are in the minority of players who would rather quit than join TBC. 
---
&gt; By definition introducing TBC carries the same exact risk 
---
Just no. TBC is a proven sucess story without any additional development costs. There is little to no risk at all. The best thing they could do is offer an optional progress onto TBC for players who want it.
---
&gt; Blizzard is somehow incapable of still designing content in the same spirit as vanilla, which I think is absolute rubbish. 
---
Yeah, Heroes of the Storm was a great game. Paystone is awesome. Diablo 3 is a beast and people can't wait for Immportal. Battle for Azeroth is amazing. They went from advertizing WoW with the subscribtion numbers to straight up hiding them after WoD. "But gais, Blizzard is a gud developer!" Give me a fucking break.
---
Guess what dude you can always go back and experience it on an alt.
---
So diabolical...I love it.
---
Thank you for an interesting response. I didn't see it like that.
---
I believe my existing ones are on Moon Guard iirc, but if we’re leveling from scratch that doesn’t matter much. I’ll take a look when I get home tonight. Usually am available 8:30-10:30pm central time on week days.. roughly similar time on weekends when events aren’t interfering.
---
Still Alliance? Is my usual faction, but for some pre-Classic fun I don’t care which. Race? Just to keep starting zones simple. 
---
I usually play tanks, but again for just some fun it doesn’t really matter. I also enjoy mages. Always have an alt priest for healing in dungeons and being social.
---
In short, I’m up for anything. Just waiting for Classic. :-)
---
People say play what race you think is the coolest, and I always agree with that... but it looks like, here, a race choice won a man 2,000 dollars.
---
Shaman r teh overpower” is a memorable name haha. I assume alliance from boulderfist will even remember that one.

 **What is &lt;Drive&gt;?** 
---
&lt;Drive&gt; is a North American guild focused on progressing through end-game PvE content at a reasonably quick pace. We are aiming to reach max level within 4-5 weeks of launch and will start progression rapidly after doing so. Our primary focus will be on PvE and, as a semi-hardcore guild, we expect our members to have a healthy thirst for progression.

Well, according to the generic wording of the ToS (and Blizzards actions historically) even killing and ganking can be griefing, but it would have to go on for hours or days against the same people/person. 
---
Killing someone a few times is part of the game. Using 2-4 friends to rotate camping someone 24 hours with a system of using alt accounts and stream snipping to permanently keep someone from being able to play the game will 100% get you banned.
---
When items were actually created by a person and not a spreadsheet.
---
Let's say you found a nice room full of respawning mobs that you could kill forever. It'd be more efficient to pull and start killing the next mob then it would for you to take the time to skin it. The go/h of just killing low level mobs and selling their greys is way more efficient than taking the 3 seconds to skin them while grinding.
---
Im extremely torn 
---
thats all I can say
---
You’ve been watching too much esfand buddy. All the horde players just went to bed that night, they didn’t “stop queueing”. Any time the horde has their main premade they won pretty much every game
---
Private server players have huge egos and they are getting shit on right now, feels good
---
Arguably (I'm planning to roll PvE) you're better off on a PvP server because there you can drive the opposing player off the node. Of course you do want to be decent at PvP (I'm not) and yes, a group is advisable.
---
r/woosh
---
You know what’s funny though is if you look it up a total of 4 people died in Chernobyl like 18 after radiation exposure. The previews for that show make it look like thousands of people.
---
There's no /startattack equivalent for Autoshot is there?
---
yeah I think they're missing as well
---
Ya because the summer by the calender doesn't end until September 23rd
---
You know lots of randoms got into the beta right? Like probably 90% of the people is people who don’t create content or have a connection at blizzard.

&lt;***Not Today***\&gt; - NA - Horde - PvP - PST - Casual
---
**Introduction**: Not Today is a *casual* PvP guild that plans to do a little end game raiding. The guild is comprised of members who played together from Vanilla through WotLK. Unfortunately, we are no longer in our 20's nor can we skip work like we did our college courses. Most of us are happily married and have families to provide for.
---
**Expectations**: Our typical atmosphere is light-hearted and laid back, all the while being competitive (as far as our time restraints permit). We expect everyone to be respectful, but if you suck at being teased every so often, then this probably isn't the guild for you. Raiding is not a requirement, though it is highly encouraged. We will be utilizing Loot Council. In addition to some end game raiding, we plan to spend a majority of our time engaging in PvP.
---
**Schedule**: Raid nights will likely be Tuesday and Thursday evenings, 7-10 PM PST. This is tentative and can change. The core of us have raided Vanilla through WotLK. Core members are predominately West Coast players.
---
We are looking for like-minded people. Causal, fun and laid back. Albeit short, if this sounds like a good fit, please apply below and we will get back with you shortly.

Re read the words right infront of plagueland, "speed running" I fully intend to be at EPL and WPL within 5 days.. wich means I have to solo it, I just did a speed run on a hunter on private and plaguelands was ultimately the hardest zone in the game, mobs HP is higher, mobs spawn closer together, quests there can be LVL 60

Once you get to the undead parts you xp per hour drops off hard

26th but if you want to log in the second you are able to then activate before the 26th.

Yup! I keep a /train macro on my action bar.

For the movement limitations section this was definitely on the same timer as the out of combat one.  In Vanilla as long as you didn't turn or strafe into an indoor area you could stay mounted for a couple seconds or get dismounted immediately.  500ms was definitely not the update rate.
---
Can we skip Crusaders Coliseum?
---
I'm not sure what's the fastest or the most efficient talent allocation for leveling but I'm just going to take my time and play what I feel will be most fun for me. I'll go down the holy tree with 3 in divine int and 2 in divine str, followed by imp sor and then consecration. From there on out I'll go down the prot tree and level with a 1h and shield. Yes it's going to be slow, but in my opinion, I'll feel more paladin like.
---
I've been through classic both 15 years ago and on private servers.  I'm not rushing and I don't care where I stand in terms of statistics on the server I choose to play on. Everyone has their own style of having fun though!
---
wouldn't have*
---
At the start of the server, people really aren't going to have the money to spend much on stacks of mats on the AH.
---
I want tbc with no flying mounts lol. I honestly hope they take this version of wow, and go a different direction that isn’t complete shit mount farming game.
---
Ok... I'll bite. Apparently you caught my very obvious initial joke then made a jab at psychology when I'm very obviously not a psychologist with a PHD? I don't get the joke.
---
Good to know. On occasion, right-click fails and I realize I'm just standing there not attacking. Especially in crowded spots with many mobs.
---
truth, there will be a ton of people just checking it out
---
and a big group that really decide its not for them a few weeks in
---
Yeah it does. Don't talk out your ass lol.

**&lt;Thralls Deep&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Raid times:** 8pm Formation, 830 First pull - 1130pm EST Wednesdays/Thursdays. 3 Hour raids max
---
**About:** Thralls Deep has a veteran group of leaders who have cleared most, if not all content in vanilla from private servers. We plan on raiding, ranking and hosting guild events throughout the life of Classic! We are looking for players who are looking to rank and have quick, clean and efficient raids.
---
**Recruitment:** We are recruiting everyone and all classes. We are looking for players who want to step up and be at the top of their game.
---
**Loot:** Loot council: rewarding those who are on time, who go above any beyond and have consumables. If you show up early, or on time, have consumables and help the guild as a whole, you will be rewarded.
---
**PvP:** We planning on ranking as well as hosting premades to be the top Horde premade on the server competing with the Alliance.
---
**Info:** If you are interested, feel free to message myself on reddit, or leadership on discord for more information.

I spent many hours here farming solo on my level 49 twink rogue.
---
they recently started added more things like that again
---
What has the classic team done to not deserve our trust?
---
I'm drawing a blank as well
---
that would show up as "DruidNature You’ve been tagged as “Away from Keyboard” please type /afk or be removed from the BG"
---
Gotta hit em with the old 
---
/e "has reported you AFK, type /AFK or you will be removed from the battleground."
---
Which would show up with 
---
"DruidNature has reported you AFK, type /AFK or you will be removed from the battleground."
---
Still happens regularly on the freeshards like Phoenix as well. XPing out in the frontiers is often ganked.
---
To be honest when the greifers got sent away it ran pretty well. So from the semi finals onwards it was a good watch
---
The same reason some people really want Classic. It's the version they believe is the best. Is your desire for classic just nostalgia?
---
I’m pretty sure even Chance himself would say he’s a douche. Stop getting your panties in a bunch
---
Hahahahahaha
---
I have been playing this game since day 1 of release and I have a collectors edition to prove it.
---
I suppose if you can find a grind spot that isn’t contested that would work great. We’ll have to see how many players per layer blizz will allow
---
I think hes jealous for not getting an invite and "playing the game for free". But seriously dude, this stuff is great. It's so reassuring to see that Classic isnt just "painted in rose tinted goggles", it actually was a different (dare I say it) better game than retail. Thanks for entry! Following you on twitch :)
---
i personally would prefer blessing of sanctuary
---
I see. Would you say it would be smart to hold onto the leather for ~30 days or however long until people start buying mats off the AH? Or just vendor it because I'll need the gold to level up?
---
I still had The explorer sometimes when I played in Legion! I totally loved that achie, it was amazingly rewarding to get it!
---
No I don’t think there will be geared 60s camping contested zone entrances on launch. And I don’t think blizzard plans to have layers with 7k-9k people on them
---
Thank you, I appreciate it!
---
Because TBC and WOTLK are better than classic. It's pretty simple.
---
I'm kinda with you here.  If TBC servers ever come up, remove flying, add in a few access ramps to the flying only daily locations, and let's get on with the game as if flying had never happened.
---
That being said, I'll gladly play Classic for a decade given the opportunity.
---
I’d argue that assuming all players who gank must suck at PvP is just as tired tbh.
---
P3? Wtf?
---
The Classic team is restoring an older edition of the game not writing and creating new content you dunce. 
---
It’s like you just wanted to reply without even thinking lmao
---
If you farmed 3x R14s in the past 2-3years, one can safely assume there is not much going on in their lives beside playing a 15year old WoW emulation.
---
Here come well adjusted people making *bank* like Sodapoppin and it has to breed envy.
---
Atleast I would be envious.
---
Lol nvm dude forget about it.  Sarcasm is too hard to detect on the internet but I don’t wanna be one of those morons who puts /s
---
idk if its clear, i dont really wants  gbank im pondering if its really not feasible to have certain officers hold on to things

TBC introduced flying, so no-one could possibly want it. Forget Kara, Eye and SSC, forget BT, ZA and Sunwell, forget all the amazing dungeons and heroics you HAD to do to get anywhere near the raids, forget the enormous, epic quest chains and that crazy progression flowchart everyone loves, forget meme specs actually becoming useful, forget EOTS, forget gemming, forget the dailies that actually felt optional, nah, forget it all. Flying sucks, take off your nostalgia goggles.

Which is more likely for pugs raids ?
---
Big mistake to plan your class comp around leveling. Most likely you won't level together during the majority of the time. Two people going 1-60 together is hard enough. Three won't happen.
---
5Head
---
But what about Pride?
---
but the first zone you can get ganked In you’ll be level 20-25 you know
---
Maintenance, bug fixes, customer support, server longevity, continued development towards a) patches and b) classic TBC.
---
You absolutely have the option to not pay to play. Private servers still exist and will continue to exist.
---
I agree they might’ve made it look like it was a massacre, but the reality *is* that thousands of people have died because of direct connection to said event.
---
WE HATE STREAMERS &gt;:(
---
Fair warning. Many of the mobs in Mulgore *cannot be skinned*.
---
I got to level 8 on the stress test and I don't think any of the mobs I met ended up being skinnable.  
---
The kodos, and definitely the northern creatures can be, but it's not like Durotar where even the level 4 scorpions can be skinned.
---
Just make peoples achievement tab not searchable. Make achievements non linkable. 
---
Youve eroded none of the personal satisfaction while also taking away the ability to use achievements as a gating system.
---
Anything but loot council. Yet to see a LC guild who doesn't develop a pattern of prioritizing friends of the loot council regardless of activity or performance. Saw DST go to an IRL friend of the GM who logged in about once every 1-2 months last time I tried.
---
Most people don't seem to pay enough attention to the social dynamics of guilds to notice this. If you've ever sat on a loot council you've seen this in action, people will find justifications that sound decent at first but in reality doesn't make sense in order to shuffle as much gear as possible to the people they prefer to play with outside of raids, creating a clique of 10-15 players who get first dibs on all the good loot.
---
being UD mattered zero vs rogue/sham/hunter
---
UD counters lock/priest and that's it (little bit warrior too)
---
'tain't
---
ahhh spreadsheets space, I love and hate that game. In rust we trust
---
THE LITTLE SNEAKY PAYO OFC
---
I did it at level 16, after maybe 6 deaths(or more?). Basically my success depended on not missing any interrupts.
---
Tbc brought about some much needed balance changes (particularly for hybrids), new abilities, rated PvP and a lot of cool new areas. The raids, especially Karazhan, were also fantastic.
---
Wotlk had a cool theme, the long awaited Death Knight class and more accessible dungeons (some do think this is a good thing).
---
Myself I prefer Vanilla, but ultimately it all comes down to what you enjoy as a player. There's definitely some nostalgia in there but there were some legit good changes in both expansions.
---
Found the trammy
---
I just hope they range IP ban china from EU and NA servers so its much harder for them to fuck up economy of the servers
---
Just to be clear, it doesn't apply to all of them. Perplexity is a chill af dude. Mn also doesn't salt that much, and if he does he's usually just baiting the chat. There are a few bad apples in the APES gang, but not all of them are salty.
---
Remove flying, remove heirlooms, remove argent tournament. Profit.
---
For the Horde!
---
That’s one of my must have items :)
---
At least I’ll be in our new house where the AC works and my room won’t feel like a swamp
---
Thank you my guy, best of luck out there. :)
---
I guess there are quite a few reasons that ppl want to play different expansions. 
---
Probably depending on when ppl started playing, which expansion they liked best. 
---
Old cities "deserted" for example was already a thing in Vanilla also, atleast on the servers i played Darnassus was a ghost town, Stormwind fared a little bit better but wasn't very busy at all, by far most of the ppl were in IF. 
---
One of the things i know ppl liked TBC for is a lot more specs are playable enspecially hybrid specs. 
---
But in the end different ppl want different things, its quite logical.
---
Not at all. I think most of the top guilds have always played on PvP servers anyway. People dont play on PvP servers to do PvP and people dont play on PvE because they wanna do PvE. For me it makes no sense to play on a PvE server, lets say PvP servers are more 'realistic'. I would never play on a PvE server when PvP ones are available and that has nothing to do with what i wanna do in the game, i was always a PVE'er first.
---
God damn dude. Ugh, it's painful thinking about how amazing BC is and knowing that Burning Crusade servers are probably 2021 at the earliest. The expansion was so damn good. What an experience.
---
Hey man I haven’t been on Reddit in a while but I never got the chance to reply, after reading your post history I see that your brain is probably too smooth to have a good conversation anyway but I just wanted to let you know your post didn’t even acknowledge the issue and I like how you skated around it.
---
Take some time off this website buddy.
---
Heart says Druid aswell.
---
So some guy acted like a complete asshole for the only purpose of trying to ruin an event with 100.000 viewers and is now surprised that being an asshole has consequences?
---
Hell no ...
---
Bleh. CoD 4 was miles better. Too much spammy killsteak and cheesy perks in MW2.
---
Using all the care bear tears in this thread to fuel my dark Rogue energies
---
I'd be curious to see that setup. Sounds miserable regardless. There's probably a plastic + in the middle of the "screen", and it would be horribly uncomfortable to view.
---
If I don't understand what you're saying, does it matter?
---
An above average mage like Venruki could probably still kick a (Naxx geared) warriors ass in a duel, while talking no damage. So it’s in tips best interest not to make a fool of himself in a duel.
---
Pretty common overlap.
---
Like the other guy said, I was talking about modern WoW. Besides, in Classic is wouldn't change much anyway, since, for example, you're unlikely to go to Desolace before Stonetalon, and would thus have the flightpoint in Stonetalon before going to Desolace.
---
Huh? The critters, wolves, adult striders and cougars..? You sure? That doesn't sound right at all. Not that I have any evidence, I haven't routed that on Classic yet. Did it on a private but we all know that's not super reliable.
---
Most famous for not pressing block against jungle cleave.
---
Yessss this is the dream!!
---
No one is or should expect Classic or any version of WoW to ever reach 12 million subs again.
---
 Hi, all,  my character name will be Rykestone or Cannae depending on what's taken at name creation.  I am a day one Warrior Tank from the original Icecrown server.  I migrated to a pvp server for TBC and tanked there for the server-first guild before rolling a Death  Knight during Wrath of the Lich King and returning to Icecrown to play with some real life friends.  My Vanilla experience is vast as I have done every boss encounter as a warrior main tank, off tank, and Fury DPS up through C'thun and The Four Horsemen in Naxxramas. I have also been a guild officer (Warrior class leader, and recruitment) as well as been at the bottom of the totem pole.  I do not desire rank or prestige.  I simply want a great group of people to experience the game with and a know something about Warriors.  I will be a Human Warrior during Classic WoW.

* Intended region is North America servers.
---
* Intended server type is PVE.
---
* Intended faction is Alliance.
---
* Intended raid times are between 0800 EST and 1500 EST Monday through Friday.  
---
* Looking for semi-casual raiding guild that puts community above progression, treats everyone fairly, and does not mind teaching new players how to be great raiders to progress through all content.  
---
Please reply with your guild's contact information if you have any openings.  Happy raiding!
---
I would recommend to play each class for a while to see what speaks to you.
---
Druid, to Warlock, to Priest, to Rogue and considering Mage now 😂
---
You used to be able to do 23 moving forwards instead of backpedaling.
---
Correct reply, only with tbc talents and mechanics will u achieve these firebolts with black book
---
My only issue with druid stopping me from rolling it is pummeler farming tbh
---
There's been a metric ton of graphical additions and changes to WoW since Cataclysm that it's kinda impossible to list. Check out the F2P stuff retail has and you'll notice instantly.
---
Well if your a streamer nothing will be RNG based for you. When you’ve got a Zerg of kids following you around giving you everything you need wow becomes a very easy game.
---
According to this article 31 people died as a result of the disaster and 29 from exposure to radiation afterword. The show might be awesome but I think it’s misleading.
---
https://ourworldindata.org/what-was-the-death-toll-from-chernobyl-and-fukushima
---
Just type vanilla wow mage aoe in to Google.
---
Not sure where you're getting your info from, 54 people died during and as a direct result of the indicent. As of 2006, the "official" chernobyl related death count was over 4000. Which is also debated with other health agencies saying that number is far too low.
---
So yes.. Thousands of people did die as a result of chernobyl.
---
Because they like TBC or Wrath.
---
I personally think TBC was the pinnacle of wow, although I prefer not having flying it doesn't ruin the game for me, it really doesn't bother me if other cities are abandoned, it happened in vanilla aswell so this isn't a shortcoming of TBC imo, the bases just moved from Org and IF to shattrath, which I understand could be frustrating if you like chilling with the boiz in the desert or a mountain.
---
 I think TBC surpasses vanilla in terms of class design and end game structure, for me vanilla is a 8 and TBC is a 9.
---
Read what you said but change TBC with vanilla, would you still ask if that's nostalgia?
---
It was a fundamentally bad EA game. The *only* redeeming features were the flying around and the combat. Everything else - progression, balance, competitiveness, PvE - were absolutely abysmal or nonexistent.
---
There are no other stats on it and probably its not as good for actual damage.
---
They went under undercity
---
That’s highly contested. I got my data from here. https://ourworldindata.org/what-was-the-death-toll-from-chernobyl-and-fukushima
---
Am going to play Horde, already on the pserver level to 15-20ish route. Druid, Priest and Warlock are done 'testing' I am at Rogue currently. Next will be Mage. I still have some time 😀
---
I will not accept that people will break the tos and get away with it.
---
The point of skinning while leveling is that you get extra gold from kills you are already doing. But since there are so many other people also doing this, there is no demand for low level skins from other players. You would have to sit on this skins for a long time before they came up in value enough to AH and that defeats the purpose of leveling with skinning.
---
I'm going indefinitely unless they pull out WoW 2 or something out of their asses. I just think retail is too far gone. Even if the next expansion is on par with Legion it still has too many fundamental issues that make it a meh experience compared to classic. Plus, I'm sure Blizzard will come up with a post-Naxx plan, whether it's new classic content or BC.
---
AV mount was 800g, but effectively 720g because of the honored discount.
---
I trust the Classic team but I don't trust the guys paying their salaries.
---
Seems like it. Don't think he makes tons of money though. Except yesterday lol.
---
Assuming we get one, anyway. Still holding out hope they'll reverse course on not having them at launch.
---
...which reminds me, it's about time someone made some more noise about that. First thing after work tonight.
---
I think anyone who were playing on private servers knows, how the economy will develop and will profit from it
---
lmao you are correct!
---
A good mage can get in the hunter’s deadzone and shatter them. 
---
A good hunter doesn’t let mages inside their deadzone. 
---
BM hunters just laugh as they get a very angry pet that does 50% more damage and is immune to *all* forms of CC.
---
SlowMAX?
---
Not thousands, It's about 54 deaths that can be directly attributed and an estimated 4,000 deaths that "could" happen. In reality the estimate of these 4,000 deaths is the result of poor models predicting effects of low-level radiation exposure using the linear no-threshold model. The 4,000 death estimate also ignores that the vast majority of the cancers caused by fallout are a type of easily treatable thyroid cancer.
---
Gotcha! Makes sense. Thank you for the explanation and response! &lt;3
---
3 months till release.. thats 1/4 of a YEAR. Sorry. It just takes long. Let it go and time will pass quicker. Go to the gym. Run 5k a day. Get fit before Classic so you can play all you want and do something useful while waiting
---
"if you look it up" - so, I feel like you didn't.... There's a nice summary, with links to sources, on wikipedia:
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths\_due\_to\_the\_Chernobyl\_disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_disaster) 
---
54 "short term" deaths, according to UNSCEAR; 4,000 deaths long term (though both numbers are disputed). Some studies put the number much, much higher - estimating almost a million premature deaths due to radiation exposure, ie more people getting cancer because of the disaster.
---
But, I think the larger context is that they only narrowly avoided a nuclear event that would have made huge chunks of Eastern Europe uninhabitable for generations. So, y'know, not THAT funny.
---
greens can have a lot of different stats on them. Some are worth a lot some don't.
---
Higher level greens 50+ can actually be BiS for many Classes.
---
Take a look at  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Item\_suffix](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Item_suffix)  for more Information about what can be on it.
---
obvious stuff to look out for especially on high level for raiding:
---
"of Healing" +heal
---
"of Frozen Wrath" + frost spell damage
---
"of Nature Protection" +Stamina + Nature resist
---
"of Fire Protection" +Stamina + Fire resist
---
i think Bracers / Boots / Belt / Rings / Neck are the most valuable since there are not as many blue alternatives but i might be wrong about that
---
on low level till high level some prefixes are pretty great for some classes
---
"of the Monkey" +Stamina +Agility
---
"of the Bear" +Stamina +Strength
---
"of the Gorilla" +Stamina +Intellect
---
and some other combinations of
---
Stamina /+Spirit or Str/Agi/Int + Spirit or Str/Agi/Int + Str/Agi/Int
---
since its classic and it takes a long time leveling, people might actually buy stuff to make it more effective. keep in mind you will spend about 10h+ on each level at 40+ so changes are that most visit the AH to check if some upgrades are available
---
No, smaller guilds tend to search for people in general chat. Of course you won't see stuff like Naxx, but MC and Ony are totally doable with PUGs
---
Mail it all to a bank alt and let it sit there until you need gold then sell the leather for how much gold you need.
---
Perp is the one that is often crappiest geared of the bunch and duels on servers like retroWoW where it does not suck out thousands of hours of your months for ganking level 48+ 3-5months straight like they had to on LH (they were horde with long queues) or ND (where they were alliance with long queues).
---
Perp is just skillful enough to farm T0/1, some epics and goes on a roll until the server dies like he did on K3.
---
That's awesome, so you could kill the NPCs in orgrimmar like the AH and the bank and the players would be able to do anything about it.
---
I do think so, they do have different teams for classic and bfa. The whole development principles have changed so much. I think if they have clear cut principles to follow then they can do it.
---
At the end of the day I want a fixed classic that stops at naxx. Tbc server. If they do make more classic content after naxx it should be separate from fixed classic.
---
TBC also had other negatives, like an alchemy lab in shat and resilience. For the goods, it introduced a lot of quality of life, class balance, and good encounters. 25 man raids were much easier to maintain, but might also be a negative.
---
In quality of life, they gave all professions benefits beyond what they produced, so things could be on equal level. They made it so you didn't need to stack flasks and tons of elixirs. You had limited amounts, requiring less farming. 
---
The class balance corrected the uselessness of many hybrid classes. This is partly a downside because it was the start of homogenization of classes, but it still felt good in the earlier patches.
---
The encounters weren't just tank and spank. They had a lot of unique quirks, even in 5 mans. There was a chess fight in Kara even. Bosses just had a lot more going on. They were also long and the class balance gave our healers the ability to maintain a 25 minute Illidan fight.
---
WotLK improved on some of these, but failed miserably, mainly by overtuning. One of the reasons I quit is because they shit out balance patches every other week and shifted the 3v3 meta mid season. The smart thing to do would have been to do the balance changes between seasons only. The bosses also kept the same fun strategy and intensity, but they made them too quick, which made them uneventful. Things like mana conservation went out the window right next to threat management. Also, introducing a new class still seems like it was unnecessary, but that's just my opinion.
---
One of my Fav instances!!
---
Just thank Elune that when Classic is a success, TBC servers are almost inevitable, regardless of what people think they're going to do about "new" content. My long-term plan is playing a hunter now so I can get a good raid guild slot and eventually get myself Thori'Dal. Keep the faith.
---
Did you even read that article? The first line literally says
---
In the case of Chernobyl, 31 people died as a direct result of the accident; two died from blast effects and a further 29 firemen died as a result of acute radiation exposure (where acute refers to infrequent exposure over a short period of time) in the days which followed.1
---
Your own source material is validating what I said.
---
Stress test access was removed from everyone since the first stress test is over. There are more stress tests, but it looks like we'll all have to be re-invited.
---
I think the problem is more that people in Classic didn't have any idea what they were doing so clearing raids took a while even for the top guilds. Afterwards Blizzard kept the difficulty around the same so competent guilds just blasted through content effortlessly. 
---
If MC was difficulty 10, BWL was 20, AQ 30 and Naxx 40, I'd say Black Temple was around a 25 or a 30. Being a guild who killed Kel'Thuzad way before BC release, Black Temple was a joke for us and we were all bored out of our mind. I think Blizzard should've had raids way up to the 50s or 60s at that point since players were getting better and better.
---
*LOGS OFF CAMPED ALT AND HEADS TO TARREN MILL*
---
It’d be a *shame* if anything happened to these lv 20 horde babies...
---
Man almost every raid in TBC was better than Kara.
---
There a big difference in the forming of the economy in original vanilla vs classic, and that is the change in 1.10.0 (Mar 2006) in which XP is converted to gold. This is a significant source of raw cash that did not exist before that will exist now so gaining gold will be much easier now.
---
If you can get to max very fast, and start stock piling rare items or mega expensive items, you will actually make more gold if you sold them later on than if you sold them from the start. For example, Mooncloth has a CD of 4 days, even months later, the value will just increase because way more people will need it than can make it. Whereas other items which are much easier to obtain will go down in value even though overall capital increases.
---
There really is no other way to get rich in vanilla than just playing a lot I guess when you think about it. In retail you can farm very specific content to get something rare and sell it for millions because there is an insane amount of capital just sitting around doing nothing.
---
Its easy to say "dont engage with it", but when your guild constantly ask you to help them to old achievments, all your friends do them and people in chat everywhere ask for help doing them.. well, it gets harder and harder to ignore.
---
You can say the same for a ton of features, like say LFR or LFD, but the fact of the matter is a lot less people are looking to do pugs, or forming pug raids these days because of LFR and LFD. These things shape the whole game and community, so its not easy to simply ignore all of these things.
---
I really do hope Blizzard studies classic as much as they possibly can and use that data towards their next big title. To me it appears that true in-game freedom is what makes an mmo game have a strong sense of community. There have to exist good things and bad things. I feel like in modern wow, the devs went on a crusade to remove bad/evil things without coming to the realization that for a successful digital home, you need to have freedom to be evil too. The community takes care of scum in their own way, which is a form of social governance. I hope Blizzard is approaching classic as an experiment this time around, rather than doing what they must to suck the dollars out.
---
Exactly this. I really never understood this idea that emotionally unstable players should be able to sit and grief everyone else with no consequences anonymously in a computer game.
---
Reap what you sow etc. It's obviouslt the purpose here was to try to ruin the event as much as possible. I am personally fine with excessive ganking and other activities that can be solved by players within the game, but things like this has no clear player solution and it's unreasonable to just let anyone behave like toddlers.
---
You are going to find a class that suits you, and so am I. I'm glad I'm not the only indecisive person out there 😁
---
Depends on what kind of raid content you want to see.
---
I fully expect that MC/Ony/ZG/AQ20 will be fully pugged and probably chunks if not all of BWL.
---
Why is flying in TBC such a sin for you? Isle of Quel'danas was not flying enabled. The entrance of Caverns of Time was not flying enabled. Karazhan was not flying enabled. You had to dismount to the entrance of SSC. There were places like Elemental Plateau or Netherwing Ledge where world PvP was happening. Considering how long it took to earn the gold to buy epic flying, meaning most people did not have access to it, it isn't the killer people pretend it is. You still had dueling outside Shatt. You still had people hanging in cities Shatt together. Flying really only got out of control once Blizzard stopped caring about PvP as a central pillar of the game and stopped designing the world around bottle-necking players into points of conflict, because flying only works when design the game around it.
---
Something I’m really interested in is seeing how profitable enchanting is going to be. Back in vanilla a lot of people just never bothered to enchant their fear. But now after years of the game being around, and private server min/max mentality, there should be a larger percentage of the population that wants enchants. 
---
Example is Snutz on the beta who has over 100g from selling people enchants.
---
I remember being disappointed when it released.
---
Then was stuck with nothing to watch lately and rewatched it, and it seemed much better.
---
I think the problem was it was way over hyped on release, and just need some time to watch it as is for it to become a good movie.
---
I don't think so. I'm not sure but I think you can already level a char to level 20 without an active subscription.
---
The premise of staying in lowbie zones was to avoid Alliance gank squads. (Horde would have to manually flag for PvP.) Ally would have been able to grief way harder than the tauren did even though they ended up being super cool when duelers accidentally flagged
---
 I love BRD just fine... but Sunken Temple was also a vast dungeon with cool events in it. I really liked Sunken Temple a lot, it really felt like dungeon exploring.
---
Hey if they decide to do that that’s great but I have no faith in activision blizzard to make a good video game anymore.
---
I agree though, I don’t care what they decide to do once they see that more people are playing a 15 year old version of a game and nobody is playing retail anymore, as long as they give us permanently locked 1.13 servers.
---
 "I told them how thankful I was and added them to my friends list so that I could come to them for any crafting needs in the future."
---
Christ that took me back.
---
Best comment is best. 😂
---
I love all the people who are just like "well take the things out that are bad!" No one is ever gonna be happy with anything Blizzard does or decides to do. This is why I'm  so extremely interested in this WoW Classic experiment even if I don't plan to play much myself.
---
changed my upvote to downvote, wtf would someone do this?  what a total loser.  Probably never got any sort of attention or accomplisment IRL so needed to make a fake story up making him even more of a fool
---
It's basically a loot list system, which works kind of like a round robin. It emphasizes fair distribution but won't see use in competitive scenes because 1. There is no incentive to perform better and 2. The loot won't always go to the best person for the raids progression.
---
He shoutcasts a lot of blizzard tourneys too.
---
Real shit right here. RIP Medal of Honor.
---
Questing + Grinding mobs inbetween points.
---
I wanted to do AoE really bad but after trying in the beta it’s just not plausible.  For the horde atleast every spot I would go to already had 1 or 2 people there just doing quests and as you start going to contested you’ll end up fighting people between every pull.
---
The Alliance streamers are almost all PVE guys so would be kind of weird if they don't get crushed.
---
This is gonna be so me aswell, problem is that I am old now and have responsibilities and not that much time to play. This is exactly what I want to avoid 😂
---
There will be pugs for sure with varying success.
---
Hahaha! This hits home to hard!
---
I mean WW was insane at 1v1 back then.
---
Mostly seening endgame dm farms im going to continue looking was just fishing for keywords like joana is for leveling guides with quests.
---
Do we like Tipsout now? Ive seen nothing but hate for the guy on here till now.
---
Thanks! Do you know how much the Rank 11 mounts were?
---
Give water walking to someone jumping into water. As long as they aren't looking down it's the same as jumping into solid ground.
---
No, I don't think they will reach 12 million. But I'm just saying that a high enough number of subscribers should be enough. What that number is, I don't know.
---
I do agree with you. It was a poorly chosen location. It‘s not their first time. They had one job and failed so hard. Havw to correct you there, we got two reloacations. That cost so much freaking time. 
---
Mulgore would have been a fine spot, if horde didn‘t attack the alliance there and screw it up.
---
Also gurubashi would have been a much nicer choice, each faction could have easily killed the unwanted trolls to secure the grounds.

I‘m pretty sure the community would have pulled on the same strings to keep the duels running.
---
Horde, no doubt
---
I really hope they flesh out the world a bit more in classic without changing much. A new raid after naxx is probably a bad idea since it drastically changes the meta again, but adding something like the card game Mark Kern talked about planning would be cool, because it only adds content, it doesn't remove anything. Also, filling in some of the empty zones like Hyjal or Twilight Highlands would be neat.
---
Not sure how it is on Beta, but in actual Vanilla you couldn't create characters of differing faction on PvP servers.
---
No Chernobyl spoilers pls
---
You can deal with ninjalooters by not inviting them into future groups. You cannot stop someone literally standing on top of you for hours on end.
---
Flagging for PvP means the tournament probably ends up getting griefed way harder than it did.
---
Seems like you’re trying to be SalBundry but with none of the humor or wit. What a failure of a Reddit account.
---
Orc is way better for a warlock. Undead is the most over rated race in the game. Orc stun resist is just too stronk and far more valuable to the class.
---
I think it's because people feel like tbc and wotlk are valid additions to the game because the classes are mostly the same and the expansions just builld on the original specs with new abilities and the talent trees just expand. And ofc the established story from WC3.
---
But cataclysm clearly marks a shift, with the revamp of the entire world and questing zones. Talent trees cut and class abilities taken out. LFR introduced, Void storage and transmogrification.
---
Personally I would like to see them try to remake the "original trilogy", but with the power of hindsight try to not make the same mistakes.
---
Surprised?  No.  Disappointed?  Yes.
---
MC, Ony, BWL can be done as pug. And will be done as well. ZG and maybe AQ20 can be pugged. AQ40 and Naxx will require a dedicated guild. However maybe in later stages when they are on farm by even the “casual” guilds they can become pug as well
---
You're lacking brainpower obviously. Enjoy replying back Mr autist fascist.
---
It made me smile, so here take my blessing to recieve a beta key
---
I dont know why you think you should have a god given right to be an asshole without any consequences. This guy knew perfectly well there's nothing anyone could do to stop him and he decided to keep it up for hours. A ban is well deserved.
---
I hated Wotlk I quit during it. But if people want it they should be able to play it. I get you don't like any expansion, but you others people have different opinions.
---
A good Hunter will have macros built into their scatter shot/feign death+trap that puts the pet on stay. Even if you taunt the pet on stay, it will not attack you. But if it's not on stay it will work.
---
You are absolutely delusional if you think Blizzard will allow you corpsecamp someone for 10 hours straight.
---
Why?  Because Wrath was the expansion of WoW where blizzard got things pretty much right.  Tons of content across all difficulty levels, some great raids, good open world, class balance was the best to date.
---
And TBC was overall an improvement on classic.
---
so i read thru the comments and it's been brought to my attention you're nothing more than a liar.  My question is why?  I'm actually quite curious to why you would make a post like this?  I need to understand this thought process of your  bizarre weirdness.  enlighten me please.
---
&gt; But for now the #nochange zealots won.
---
You mean zealots like that Ion guy?
---
&gt;The second we start to substitute our modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was, and making something different, and that is something we want to avoid .

Warr - Shaman - Rogue with shaman rolling on caster gear, heal + wf totem. Big advantage for trios is they can complete elite quests in most zones at the apropriate level to get more xp from otherwise impossible quests.
---
I believe the speed advantage Ret leveling has over other specs is much more pronounced 30-60 than 1-30. As a Paladin most of your damage is your weapon swings, especially early on, so 20 talent points isn't enough to make a huge difference. I would caution you from using the beta experience to assume that it would extend to higher levels.
---
Dipping 11 points into Holy to get Consecrate is fine, especially if you're playing with groups regularly. I'd recommend considering if that with the rest of your points in Ret might satisfy you if you don't like the idea of going pure Ret.
---
before christ was born? stop forcing your religion on people like its fact.
---
Suicide Kings, with separate lists for class tier gear.
---
Suicide kings is essentially, if you take an item, you go to the end of the list. Easy to maintain, transparency is pretty solid, and relatively fair. Some sort of decay on the list if you miss raids, we'll have to figure all the details out but pretty simple, not very time consuming
---
No,
---
As gamers we've progressed alot when it comes to understanding mechanics and our classes. While it wasn't the norm back in the day, we'll see a insurge of pugging throughout classic for raids, I'd be very surprised if we didn't. (Bare in mind I'm not saying you'll get through the raid with a pug, but they'll be around)
---
Literally every time p servers and classic are mentioned its somewhere in the comments.
---
So how would you specifically have stopped this player? I see no solution from you. Just bitching about how unfair it is that Blizzard bans a monumental asshole that spend 5 hours griefing everyone.
---
RIP what? Nothing will happen. Many guilds and people will think your trolling is hilarious
---
will messaging them about the Tienanmen square massacre get their connection pulled?
---
It is indeed a real pain in the arse, but ultimately it really depends upon how hardcore the guild you join is.
---
I don't plan on doing any pummeler farming, but I plan on raiding feral. It's just a case of finding people who are willing to raid with you!
---
I'm hoping to find a sort of "world PvP" guild who also raid.
---
Curious - how did DKP create tension in your case? I was a big fan of loot council, but would much prefer a rule-based DKP system for Classic.
---
Oh no! The boss killed my quest giver so I had to wait for 5min for it to respawn. How TERRIBLE..
---
As a priest, I liked challenging people to duels on zepps or boats, then if they were foolish enough to accept, immediately mind control them off.
---
I love bosanc but, there will be times when other pallies will miss raids and you won't get to use it. Also depending on how much you plan on tanking 5 man's you'll probably want holy shock more for the pulling potential. Also great for getting a clutch heal in pvp and if you care about healing meter then holy shock is great for heal sniping (don't recommend for the good of the raid since you're making the other guy waste his Mana but some of us are assholes.) 
---
So personally I would take holy shock since I'll get more use out of it. Also in 5 man's it's generally better to use BoW for less downtime. The only dungeons I would prefer BoSanc over BoW would be BRD and Strat live and only certain parts of them at that. (Lyceum for BRD and undead packs in Strat live.) 
---
It's all preference though. BoSanC is pretty insane for suppression room in BWL, AQ trash, and imps in MC. Don't have any experience in naxx so not really sure how good it is in there.
---
I am most likely playing Alliance in Classic because my husband really wants to be a paladin and gnomes are also my favorite race.  Whatever race you want to play I can hoof it to your starting zone so it doesn't matter to me what race you would like to choose! I should be free tonight, just add my character's name to your list and sen dme a PM tonight!  Ivolet-ThoriumBrotherhood
---
May as well turn this sub into classic streamers WoW or something 🤦‍♂️
---
Many people view cats as the start of the downhill trend, everything up to WotLK was pretty much the pinnacle of wow
---
Continent indeed.
---
Of course. There are plenty of casual raiding guilds out there that are not going to rush it, only raid 2-4 hours a night, and have alt nights to help those that are behind the rest of the guild on raid progression get geared up to catch up. Just shop for the right guild to find your fit.
---
This is the point, last paragraph. The show may be a little over-dramatic but if certain events happened (the nuclear lava going into the ground) it would have had extremely devastating effects that would have affected most of Europe.) Well, at least that’s what the show and the documentary that the show seems based off of, told me.
---
&gt;But I'm just saying that a high enough number of subscribers should be enough.
---
That goes without saying.. And they've literally already said that they'll make Classic versions of future expansions if this is popular enough and if it's something the community wants.
---
Any reason why? This was a thing in Classic so it seems kind of silly that it wouldn't make a return.

**&lt;FREE HUGS&gt;** [H] (PvP) [NA] 🇺🇸 *(Tue, Wed, Thur: 7 - 10 PM CST)* 
---
🔺 **INTRO** We are known as **FREE HUGS!** We are a semi-hardcore guild for those who want to spend their time raiding and obtaining those epic and legendary items. We are a newly formed guild that is looking for anyone who has a passion for Classic.
---
🔺 **RECRUITS** We are looking for people who have the interest and dedication for raiding in Classic. We are currently recruiting any class, regardless of age or experience. (We are in a need of Rogues and DPS Warriors.)
---
🔺 **LOOT/ROLES** We use a well developed DKP system to handle loot in raids. We also have positions open for Class and Farming Officers to help assist other members of the guild.
---
🔺 **SCHEDULES** We will raid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 7 - 10 PM CST. We also allow members to form camps for open world PvP or BGs. We will begin raiding once we get our 40 man group ready to go. We don't expect players to speed level, just have fun with it!
---
🔺 **GOALS** We want to clear all raid content, even through Naxxramas, at our own pace. We aren’t as hardcore as some other guilds out there, so we won’t be making any world/server firsts. However, we will be making sure everyone achieves their PvE and PvP goals !
---
🔺 **EXTRA** If you are new to Classic, Welcome! And fear not, we have experienced *Vanilla Veterans* in the guild who can give plenty of advice. We are a welcoming group and are here to guide you on your glorious Classic adventure!
---
If you would like to join, please send me a message on discord @NeonInuGanetto#3614
---
I have a strong feeling a lot of people (myself included) are going to be playing WoW at a much more semi-casual because of being adults now 
---
I plan on playing about 3-4 hours a night on Monday-Thursday and then will live my life regularly on the weekends and probably fill in most of my free time with wow 
---
I’m considering starting a guild for the hours I plan to play, and I don’t it will be hard to find one that matches the same playing time as you. I do mostly PvP end game so it’s not as bad on limited hours, but I remember guilds from vanilla that were filled with adults who had careers and family that is obviously a higher priority than raiding the same place for the 15th time 
---
I wouldn’t worry about it tbh
---
I personally want WoTLK because I felt like the Lore and Class fantasy was at it's best back then. I hated the new leveling zones, but as a whole the game felt very good and complete to me, but ofc, that is simply my opinion. We all have times in the game we felt it was best.
---
I loved EPGP (effort points gear points). But I don’t see a lot of others talking about it. It’s effectively DKP. But with decay. Your rating is a ratio between the work you had put in against what gear you had got out. Pure DKP favours hoarding points more than this I would say which is not great for progression. It’s also completely transparent to the guild so better than loot council for the common player who just wants to be rewarded for participation in a fair manner. 
---
It had a great add on for seeing where you were and helping calculate it all. I hope this is brought back, it was great fun watching where you were ranked and thus know how soon your next piece would be and it really made people feel like they got something out of a night even if it wasn’t loot. They would be moved up the ranks for the next night. 
---
I don’t believe this was around in vanilla. I implemented it in TBC so not sure if there was a reason for that.
---
**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore    
---
Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community. Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.    
---
**Who are we?**  Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006. Our raid leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, and have raided through Naxx on private servers. Others have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. In short, we raid to gear for PvP. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.    
---
**Who are we looking for?**  We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40+ man roster. Our current highest needs are for **Holy Priests and Rogues,** though we are accepting exceptional players for all classes. We expect our raiders to have extensive knowledge of their class and their role. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.    
---
**What will we be doing?**  We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use an all-or-nothing DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional weekend day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards.  We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process. Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.

Duel your own faction just outside gurubashi arena, use mind control cap and get them inside so you can kill them.

Sap people just outside the booty bay boat when they're about to get in. Make them miss the boat.

Can you elaborate on #18? How does that work exactly? My main is an UD rogue so I’d like to take advantage of this.
---
You’re supposed to be able to if they are doing no changes but currently the dungeon server doesn’t support it and every post I’ve made has been shut down by people adamant that it was impossible to do during actual vanilla despite there many multitudes of old videos proving otherwise. Hopefully this one gets some traction.
---
I was being facetious.
---
Seems like every other post here is some over the top mindless action paired with "so rewarding!"
---
I miss stranglethorn
---
Bro the nostalgia is leaking out me
---
I think you nailed it. From what I saw so far many seem to be underestimating the social dynamics of a 40man. I was actively looking for a guild with a DKP system again because anything else is a recipe for disaster.
---
&gt;teh dude who raided the funeral got permanently banned and their accounts deleted, why is everyone claiming that omergerrd sum1 raided a ingame funeral so everything is fine forget to mention this?
---
No they did not. Post proof. The funeral event was a PvP raid in a PvP area. It could have been solved easily by moving the funeral to a friendly zone or by fighting back against the horde.
---
It's an entirely different thing from someone griefing their own faction with no way of dealing it with.
---
It really depends on how transparent the rules governing the decisions are.  If it's all discussion "behind the scenes" then it can easily abused.  If there is easily understood criteria for how the council is basing decisions, then it can be fact checked and anything that doesn't fit the criteria can be called out.
---
For example, my guild uses LC, but we are very clear on how the decision is made.  When loot is up for grabs, we have everyone who needs it as main spec do a /roll to show interest and link what they would be replacing.  Criteria goes: MS&gt;OS, Core raider &gt; Casual/Recruit, biggest upgrade wins, if same level of upgrade then attendance %, if same attendance then the /roll higher wins.  It rarely ever comes down to the roll, but when it does one of the people usually passes to other or takes there name out of consideration.
---
To be honest, in 14 years of raiding, it's the most sane system I've been involved with.  The only complaint I've seen has come from new recruits who ended up not fitting in the guild regardless.
---
I mean the duel tournament was a pretty cool piece of user created content. The community aspect of he game is why people wanted classic in the first place. 
---
You’re also making a post about a question that has been answered. If you google or listen to any wow podcasts you would have been able to find your answer.
---
First of all - I'd like to see your source for 1.27 million subscribers.
---
How did you come to this conclusion? What metrics did you use? Did you take into account the Chinese market? And how is this calculated? Unique subscribers at a certain day? Unique subscribers, who subbed across a fiscal period? A year?
---
Let's assume you are actually correct with that third-party estimate: I guarantee you that the WoW subreddit does not have a nearly 85% representation of the current game's player base. There is a lot of people in there who subscribed once but don't play at the moment. There are also tons of people playing WoW who are not subscribed to the WoW reddit. Probably because they don't speak English.
---
Give some context for those crazy numbers.
---
I'm pretty sure this is it
---

---
I'm fine just playing dota until classic launches. Feels warcrafty enough for me. Especially with the dank ass new battlepass.
---
That sounds very wrong. How are wolves, panthers, plainstriders not skinnable?
---
If you do just play something else.
---
There is RNG yes but the RNG is more rewarding than in retail. You have to put in actual work and time for the best gear so when it finally drops and you win it it's super rewarding and it's gear that not everybody has. 
---
Retail RNG is just gifting you epics with random stats that the entire population of the game can obtain by just showing up. That's the main difference to me.
---
From the megathread on the official forums :
---
&gt;Blizzard has stated that they will be breaking addons that automate gameplay, such as Decursive, EZHealing etc. “Normal” addons will still be allowed.
---
Not sure where they stated this unfortunately, would have to hunt more.
---
best idea I read was getting a couples locks that are scattered all around azeroth. then summon the duelers and casters to that spot for their match. pretty much impossible to grief that strat.
---
Oh, I didn't know they've said anything about the other expansions.
---
That's awesome! Makes me very happy.
---
And ven 20g to respec
---
Good to know, thanks
---
This is a super common complaint of loot council, but I've honestly never seen it play out that way in years. I've both sat on a LC, and been a nobody member in guilds that ran LC, and it always seemed perfectly fair to me.
---
The ones who get the first dibs on loot are the ones who bust their ass for the raid. If something rare drops, its gunna go to the guy who farms his consumes and shows up on time week after week, not the guy who may or may not be pulling his own weight. In my experience (from both sides of the council) it seems much more common for prima donna players to throw a tantrum because they didn't get the item they feel entitled to, and blame it on "corrupt LC" rather than admit that maybe they aren't the all star they think they are.
---
Well thats even worse, your points are totally wrong. Also you got baited btw.
---
Is it by default or a setting? I couldnt find a non-shift auto-loot in the setting on the stress test
---
Yeah, so I hate to disappoint you, but the battlegrounds will be cross-realm.  Now, we don't know to what degree that will be, as there may not be enough servers for Battlegroups, but yeah, you'll likely still be dealing with Russian premades, unless they lock Russians to their own servers, which is doubtful.
---
Leather has a high vendor price, which also means a high AH list price. A lot of people will take skinning while leveling on a fresh server, so there will be tons of skins available. Also, skins aren't that highly used especially on a fresh server, since it's primarily only used for leatherworking, which many people won't be taking while leveling, and most that are will have skinning themselves. People also don't have too much gold to spend in the beginning. So you have high supply, low demand, low cash in hand, and add in a high vendor price and all the AH issues (time spent, AH cut, failed auction costing you a nice chunk) and it's often just to vendor Light and Medium Leather, and maybe Heavy Leather. Above that you can sell for a good amount.
---
Cloth is used by everyone for First Aid, and it's very high in demand for bags in the beginning. Mining materials are used for 2 professions, including most every serious PvPer for engineering. Herbs are also high in demand because you can never have enough of the consumables they can make, people will always use potions, thistle tea, blinding powder, etc. These materials as well as the unique crafting materials like Large Fang will be valuable, and are worth holding on to until process start going up once people have gold in hand and start leveling their crafting professions. I'd recommend sending them all to a bank alt and have it sit in the mailbox until you have time to sell them or need cash quick for skills or mount or a can't-miss upgrade (like nabbing a BoE world drop that will surely go up in price as the server progresses).
---
On private servers people are able to clear AQ40 in pugs. Haven't seen a naxx pug before so that's probably the limit. That being said private server people tend to already know the game fairly well so depending on the knowledge gap between people on your server I'd probably say max pug content for most classic servers will only go up to BWL.
---
Im torn on the beta invite thing. Do I want to get in there and get my fix? Or do I continue to enjoy watching and waiting because there really are some good streams out there exploring and finding bugs etc.
---
Not having an open beta is probably a good thing. It keeps people on point with their feedback. And I imagine it spares the retail experience until classic launches.
---
ahhh so it's 1200 tickets. or 1800 rugged leather.... that seems pretty impossible lol
---
Enchanting is only really profitable if you have rare enchants. Top guilds will funnel all recipes into a handful of people and they will see the most of the profits on the servers. Otherwise it is a tremendous gold sink especially when you are leveling.
---
I also would not judge anything off of the beta personally as it isn't permanent people take less care when spending their gold.
---
I think Classic will have x-realm BG's thiugh.
---
Did a search for it and all I really got was just people saying "No." without citing a reason why or citing a source so its hard to track down where exactly this was answered without going through EVERYTHING. 
---
Case and point, the "No." comment that was posted immediately in this thread.
---
After missing three nades in a row too.
---
Yeah, I main a druid in retail and I just love having multiple buttons and being able to swap roles, but I have a friend whos going holy pally and I think picking druid over warrior wouldn't be the best for us in PVP especially.
---
Have not watch Esfand recently, he been gloating a lot about how awesome he is at WSG. Although to be fair to him, he is pretty good but this make up for the fact he will have his ass handed to him if he attempts any sort of PvP with real duellers who know paladins major weakness.
---
Unpopular opinion, but you are right. TBC is great game but its great in different way. People who loves vanilla are ok with TBC and vice versa but its not the same and to prevail vanilla wow, its mandatory to do classic+ content instead of jumping on TBC
---
No riding turtle? Feels bad man.
---
23 easy steps to get people to become an outcast
---
I stand corrected then.
---
&gt; It's a free product included with a paid product. It cannot make money.
---
No, it's not a free product. It is simply integrated into the server infrastructure that runs retail. So instead of paying for two products, you can pay for one subscription to "World of Warcraft."
---
Which one you play is entirely up to you. You can pay for classic and never touch retail, which will show in their internal statistics. The other way around works aswell.
---
To say it's a "free product bundled into retail" is completely missing the point.
---
Mostly that you can't expect everyone in the guild to understand the system. People using all of their DKP on one time, frustrated on not getting more loot later. Frustration on how the DKP points were distributed and so on.
---
It'll be fun rediscovering these "predictions that ended up happening" quests.
---
I think the best ones will be Chromie's in Andorhal.  One of her dialogue lines is something like "Have we met? Are you sure you're not from the future?".
---
Kind of makes me wish the release schedule would have a level cap that goes up 10 levels every 2 weeks. Really give people the chance to enjoy their time at all of the mini-caps along the way, run dungeons, trick themselves out, PvP and duel.
---
I used to think about game dev stuff a lot. One of my better ideas that I still circle back to sometimes; an MMO where quests and activities give you a "rolling XP" trickle that lasts for days. The idea would be that you do enough things to get that XP rolling in at the maximum rate, and once you've done that, you're completely free to do whatever you want in the game without feeling like you need to be out grinding XP.
---
Now you can enjoy some PvP, level your professions, engage in all kinds of random social activities, try to push through a difficult dungeon, duel people, explore, farm specific crafting mats, reputations, help out other players, etc...and all the while never have to think about those things messing up your leveling rate.
---
I think it would make for a much healthier MMO with a more rich community.
---
Loot council and "hidden" DKP &gt; Loot council. 
---
The DKP helps to show that it is actually fair. Unless it is a well-established guild I feel it is the best way to avoid drama. 
---
If someone is bitching over loot, you can just point at the DKP.
---
The way it works in Classic is that, so long as the first quest can be picked up, so can the rest of the chain. the lists were accurate.
---
Well, it definitely wasn't impossible. It just flew under the radar. I don't believe hard caps for 5 mans were really introduced until TBC dungeons them selves and even then a mandatory hard cap on 5 players for Classic dungeons wasn't a thing till a bit later in BC or early Wrath.
---
This would be pretty cool but I think we'd be hearing about it more if that was the plan. But! People can still play the original version to get themselves hyped and ready for classic.
---
I dunno, I dont have that problem. Ive earned my spot as a raid logger, after being the guy on 15 hours a day every day for 10 years (slight hyperbole, but you get it). Others in my guild who still have more passion for the game do that shit. Ill help with the odd one when Im around, but I dont look to be around to help.
---
LFR is tricky. It was good in that most wow players never saw the inside of a raid till DS. So it made my favorite content in the game more relevant to more people which means blizz can devote more resources to it. Great. But in the current version of the game. LFR and normal as so close together, that people opt to not do normal, which means they dont do heroic, and assume wow is easy.
---
The current Looking for Group tool is awesome (the one for finding m+ or xrealm raids). They should drop LFR (or make it only work for last tier, but make it normal mode difficulty), and make normal mode (flex) the current tier lowest difficulty. Itll add in an element of socialization in the group formation, and people who only lfr cant really complain since LFR exists, just not till next tier. It will also force up the skill floor of the population since Normal does require you to keep a napkin under your drool (where as heroic mode just asks for you to not drool, mouthbreathing okay; LFR assumes drool will be all over the table dripping from your stupid slackjawed mouth; and mythic is for people whove mastered the grace of breathing through their noses)
---
For me personally, flying completely shrunk the world by reducing travel times, limited visibility of other players, and killed world PvP.  In fact I can't think of one positive aspect of flying.  Again, this is all my personal opinion.
---
Type of the server will be only factor for us. We are thinking about pvp or rp ideally rp-pvp if Blizz will provide one.
---
Problem is that the zone is contested, so they'd have to rely on all the alliance playing nicely.
---
Excited as well. I relly hope it will be possible to extract data in bulk from the AH to monitor this. I'm really hoping to get my hands on the data, because this is indeed very special.
---
Well yes, this is a community of more then 1 person. people are allowed to have different opinions.
---
People also avoid taking gear because they want the rare drops. It hurts the overall progress.
---
Farming for Dragons Call for endless periods of time because... Whelp I just don't know...
---
They do enforce it in every instance that gets reported. I think we pretty much agree on this. It's only extreme cases that get actioned, which are rare.
---
On demand cooldowns are better for 1:1 encounters (duels and world PvP), passives are better for groups (battlegrounds).
---
I lean towards undead because I like 1:1 more, but to each their own.
---
"sucking" in modern terms means "excellent" in actusl vanilla terms, and content was still easily doable then
---
So it doesn't matter if your suboptimal
---
Thanks, I'll work on Varigan's Fist for sure.

I'm looking forward to play it in any season. Shame they couldn't release it at least one month earlier so people could use the free time of actual summer to play the game, instead of having it right at the end just when people get back to school/work
---
Hype! With top 3 means prob. 1500+ people the Chance is almost 0 for randoms xS
---
Venruki has been a big part of the game for years. Always a top level mage and monk. Even has an NPC named after him in Ashran, Elliot Van Rook. Who if you kill him before he ice blocks you get the achievement "Down goes Van Rook" which is a reference to this moment during an MLG tournament  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q5pb-fEQhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q5pb-fEQhs)
---
Umm they pretty much give gold away now days, so flying mounts are very easily had. But imo flying mounts made the game way to easy, and way too small. It made world pvp almost impossible, and leveling pretty simple.
---
I hope to have a guild lined up by then and just go where they go
---
Gold in the short run will be in high demand due to purchasing skills and mounts, while it will also be scarce due to less max levels. This will keep gold supply low for a short while.
---
At this time it may be best to simply farm gold (literally, not selling on AH) if your gold per hour, translated into buying items on AH, is higher than simply farming the items yourself. There may be an opportunity here for a short while as gold supply remains low.
---
Try to acquire known materials that are used routinely in raiding and max level, and sit on them. In the long run, the gold supply will ever increase and these materials will have a healthy consumption. As such you should see these items inflate in gold price.
---
Remember sitting on a giant cash stack is never profitable in real terms. Keep enough cash for your liquidity needs (repairs, flight paths, ammo, food, etc.) and keep the rest in demanded trade goods that don't inflate nearly as much in terms of supply.
---
This is a lot of thought for some simple 5 mans....
---
Whereas if you get sanc you can be thr kings and sanc buffwr
---
If they do go this way, I hope they don’t have an overwhelming amount of daily quests.
---
Some dungeons like scholo used to allow ten players but it was changed later to stop people from mass grinding and farming. 
---
Same reason we have 5 dungeons per 1 hour lockouts, farming in dire maul as a frost mage.
---
RP-PVP...then based on population for me.
---
Do you know of where a list like this can be found?
---
Didn’t very early Alpha WoW run on the same engine as Warcraft 3?
---
Another major point is that you're just skinning what's already right in front of you, instead of having to go out of your way for a node, or waiting for a very specific mob to respawn like you do for something like Elemental Fire or whatever else you'd farm otherwise.
---
The idea is to get gold for skills, repairs and your level 40 mount, you're going to need gold as you level.
---
I thought it was weird too, but most of them were not skinnable. I think the first skinnable I found was the wolf Alpha.
---
I may very well have encountered a bug though.
---
I kind of disagree with everyone else here. You won’t be able to join a guild that immediately farms content because of the initial time investment required, and progression guilds demand more raid time than hardcore guilds. It will be very difficult to be a good main tank with only 2-3 hrs per day. 
---
If you were dps it would be easier to contribute with less playtime.
---
Don't be afraid to form your own opinion
---
2 people died from the actual explosion. 29 firemen and plant workers died from radiation exposure in the following days. It’s also estimated about 4000 have died from long term health problems caused by the disaster.

**&lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt;  NA // PVP // ALIANCE // Casual Raiding** 
---
Raid times:  **Alternating Tuesday and Monday nights @ 6:30 PDT**   (To be clear – this means ONE night per week) 
---
The main thing to note about &lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt; is the raid schedule.  The initial group is comprised of people that played classic together many moons ago, most of whom are too old to play like we used to, but are also unable to fight against pull of nostalgia.  As such, in order to keep our wives happy we'll be raiding one night per week.  To begin with we will alternate between Tuesday to Monday nights.  This way we can run the same raid timer twice without playing twice per week.    
---
Because of the limited frequency of our raids I expect us to run MC/Ony exclusively for longer than your average multi-night raiding guild.  A subset of the guild is welcome to start attempting new content as it releases, but my primary concern is getting MC on farm.  Once we come to a consensus that MC has little left to offer, we will shift to BWL, and so on.  Members will obviously be free to pursue other raid timers during the weeks where we return to a raid on Monday before the reset.  Once Molten Core is on farm (which I don't expect to take terribly long) we will raid every Tuesday instead, using each reset.
---
DKP for the loot system.  Pretty basic, blind bid, 10% decay every week, the specifics aren't nailed down yet but DKP isn't particularly complicated. 
---
The tentative date of our first Onyxia, and hopefully subsequent Molten Core attempt, is October 8th 2019.  I realize that giving only six weeks to level is counter to the whole casual appeal of this guild, if a member needs more time than that it's not a problem.  Many of us, myself included, are going to attack leveling with an unhealthy zeal that will only be able to last so long before divorce becomes imminent.  Our first run may include a few level 58 healers, it may include a few PUGs, these things should not be a source of stress.  We are not going for any records, the most important thing to start with is to get in there and start teaching the fights.   
---
One note on the casual nature of this guild: it doesn't mean I'm looking for lazy raiders.  We are casual due to frequency, that doesn't mean you don't have to know your class / at least make an effort on consumables.  Molten Core is not particularly difficult, but I would like to get to Ragnaros as quickly as possible.  In order to do this we will need to remain focused during the raids.  That said, we're pretty easy going. 
---
On that same note, I would like to run this with as close to 40 active raiders as possible.  Seeing as we'll only be raiding once per week – my hope is that the majority of members will be at every raid.  Life is never so straight forward, so I will be recruiting some alternates, but for the most part I'd like to keep the roster tight. 
---
We're all very excited, this should be a lot of fun.  Here's hoping some of you join us in the Molten Core and beyond. 
---
PM me if you're interested.    I will start an email list and keep everyone updated.  Because our schedule is so simple, I see no need to make a website, if our members want one I will make one.    
---
Right now we can take any class, if you're unsure of your class at least give me what you're considering.  Druid is the only class I'm almost full on, I can probably only take one more.  If you need help deciding, I am a fountain of classic knowledge.  Most notably I still need a main tank – who will be the one raider who gets loot preference.  As such this position is going to require a little more vetting, if you're interested in being main tank make sure to note it in your PM. 
---
Thanks for reading!  See you in Azeroth.
---
If you look at r/wow, bfa forums or login to bfa and ask, there are actually more wow players that dont even consider playing classic than this sub would make you believe.
---
I highly recommend Countdown to Classic episodes #38 and #41. It's a two-part interview with a real-life stock trader and economist who got his start playing Vanilla WoW as a kid. He talks a bit about the 'everyone starts with nothing' aspect of WoW servers and how they compare, and don't compare, to real-life economies.
---
In "real life" all opposing faction would be "kill on sight". Nothing wrong with this imo. If you don't want to deal with it take the rez sickness and move on.
---
If you know someone is camping your corpse and you don't stand a chance, just don't go back.
---
The trinket you could get from the quest, and keep if you didn't turn the quest in, was unique and interesting.
---
I plan to farm Lashers on my druid aswell. Saw a video where someone uses barkskin &gt; Hurricane &gt; Bear form &gt; swipe. Will try that or go into a full swipe/tank spec and just slowly kill them. Will have to try it out.
---
&gt; killsteak
---
&gt; cheesy perks
---
idk why but I could go for a philly cheesesteak right now.
---
what sub are we in again?
---
Ah, one of those times your knowledge of a dungeon's layout could be far more valuable to a party than your DPS.
---
More than just Scholo and those clumped into that group. As made evident by the video I linked. There are 10 players inside SM Cath. It was changed way later judging by the video. They're wearing Tier 6, gear from The Black Temple and Hyjal raids in The Burning Crusade.
---
Saved his Sprint + vanish for real life.
---
So why are you claiming twisting works if you did not actually test it? Sigh.
---
what about his enjoyment? that's the problem with nebulous language such as this. grow up
---
Shaman wolf form is 30, idk what travel form is for certain.
---
Just to be clear, that is the official statistics given by the USSR government. 
---
Its the total amount who died *in the incident*. Like the explosion and immediate aftermath. 
---
In reality? A report found an estimated death toll of 140,000, judging by the highly elevated cancer rates of those living near the incident. Those who came from all over the USSR to work on clearing the radiation had a life expectancy of only 16 years following that incident. 
---
&gt; "The report also concludes that on the basis of demographic data, during the last 15 years, 60,000 people have additionally died in Russia because of the Chernobyl accident, and estimates of the total death toll for the Ukraine and Belarus could reach another 140,000."
---
so strange how people act like vanilla is some perfect pristine epic gamer moment and then nitpick tbc with subjective criticisms while ignoring all the good shit.  liking vanilla more than tbc is perfectly acceptable and i can understand it completely (i hated tbc when it came out) but im so sick of the lazy hivemind criticism it receives.
---
Not being rude
---
We read a ton of guides back in Vanilla too. It was just a handful of guilds that had to actually figure out the mechanics of a boss. 99% learned it from videos and guides even in the mid 2000’s.
---
That’s last decade. The Chinese will just use VPN services, US based compromised botnet/computers, or even rent server space from some no-name US based data center and funnel their traffic from there. Cheaters/bots/farmers will find and make holes as fast as activision-blizzard can patch them.
---
You assume everyone actually cares about meters, as if classic is a retail game where progression tryharding matters and not a rerelease of a 14 year old solved game
---
Literally preventing players for actually playing a game they paid for isn't any kind of "fun". You GTFO you absolute mutt.
---
This guy goblins.
---
Good video, I would have liked to see locations for the earliest trainers you can pick it up at, and a location for knives because you usually have to get it somewhere else.
---
Is there a list anywhere of gotchas like this?
---
Yes, radiation poisoning. Not cancer, which is caused by the radiation. The rate of cancers rose dramatically in belarus and ukraine, especially in the areas closer to chernobyl, following the incident.
---
I don't have the time or patience to be a beta tester, so no I'm not jealous. I'll definitely play the game though.
---
Was removed prior to 1.12 which is (mostly) what we are getting.  The dungeons were also changed to balance for smaller group sizes (some packs/patrols removed).
---
Nightmare fuel.
---
Fell pregnant... good outlook there buddy.
---
"You think you don't, but you do."
---
-Someone else, for sure
---
Well two warriors won the first set of duels against a Rogue and a Shaman respectively.
---
24. Don't actually kill people. Let mobs kill them instead.
---
My personal favorite (on my Druid) is to find someone out in the open world, wait until they engage a mob, then open with Ravage or Pounce and get them low on health but not actually kill them. Then I cast Entangling Roots over and over until the mob kills them. When the mob gets the killing blow instead of me, they take 10% durability damage for extra punishment.
---
25. Kill Hunter and Warlock pets, but don't actually kill the Hunter or Warlock.
---
Ever seen a Hunter try to quest without a pet? It's not pretty. This is way more painful for them than actually killing them. Also, Hunter pets have a happiness system. Kill the pet enough times and they have to stop questing to worry about their pet's happiness.
---
Yes, we'll need a way to xfer off streamer servers
---
Rp-pvp.. if they bother to make one. Then the highest population one, unless there's a large streamer on it, which I doubt
---
Yeah but I specifically mentioned that as a skill you shouldn't buy ranks of past the first one, same with rogues gouge.
---
wtf was I just looking at :D Had to watch it 2 more times
---
Trio? Go for 2 casters, 1 melee or 2 melees and 1 healer.
---
Could be a combination of caster and melee with a healer, but spell/attacks do not work as well.
---
(example being armor debuff and a frost spell, no synergy).
---
Make your own opinion, don’t ask people how to feel about something?
---
Streaming is obviously an ideal job, but there's a lot of stress that comes with it, it's not as easy as sitting down, playing games. You have to pay attention to chat 24/7, constantly come up with improv-content, your life, your failures and mistakes livestreamed 6-8 hours a day for the rest of your life. One wrong move and your account can be banned. Tack onto that, money isn't steady, need to spend time moving youtube videos, merch, keeping up to date on all social media platforms..
---
This is like the bare surface minimum. Imagine being Ninja and having to play fortnite 8 hours a day, every day, for years. Yes, sounds amazing, until it isn't. You can get burnt out of playing games, just as you can get burnt out of any job after that long of doing the same thing.
---
It's really cool to hear them talk about not wanting to spoil content of Vanilla. I'm assuming this was recorded shortly before full release.  Lots of concept art and animation I've certainly never seen before.
---
Why does it matter if there’s a large streamer on it?  Is this a negative?
---
I agree, it would've been perfect, sold like hot cakes given people a taste for wow and restarted the game.
---
Curious, it's no more or less inefficient than Ret. You just gear the same, use a heavy two hander and use SoRighteousness instead of SoComm. Judge a mob, reapply SoR and melee it till it dies. The only time you use lots of mana is if you Overpull, and there you can drop consec for AOE if you pull 3+ or just save your mana for selfheals (getting a big free holy light crit due to divine focus if you have it).
---
I'm not sure why this uses more mana than the standard Ret style, you don't HAVE to use judgement on cooldown. You just need a good damage two hander of any speed.
---
No. Beta is not for *testing what you like*. It's for *finding things that don't work and fixing them*. This is precisely the kind of stupid misunderstanding of a beta's purpose people are calling out. 
---
Beta is a trial release where the testing group is supposed to find as many faults as possible so they can be fixed before a wider release. It has nothing to do with enabling you to "test what you'd like to roll."
---
Are you sure? Because they were fairly clear that it was only with 2.0 that the automation was removed.
---
[http://blue.cardplace.com/newcache/us/32184244.htm](http://blue.cardplace.com/newcache/us/32184244.htm)
---
This is probably one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen
---
I were also similiar to that at your age. Then things changed after 30...
---
he says 3-4 hours per night, its not clear yet how long raids will take in this new age.
---
I also think he is able to play more here and there and should be able to farm outside of his 3-4 hour raid window
---
Sounds good. Just trying to remind people that the objective of the beta is to hunt for bugs, test and report. I know I get downvoted here for reminding people of that but ultimately it will make the game better. The core focus of the beta should be bugs, ideally your write up here would have been about bugs and bug testing only.
---
But I get it, people are selfish
---
Was it though? In the video I provided, which took place on a Blizzard realm, there are 10 players wearing Tier 6 armor, which was available mid Burning Crusade, inside of SM Cathedral - a 5 man dungeon. 
---
This would indicate that it wasn't (entirely at the least) removed prior to 1.12
---
Go cry more. The worst part about anonymous Internet culture is that people think they can behave and act as antisocial as possible and face no consequences, even when their actions are to the detriment of other players that just want to play the game. It's a completely different scenario from f.ex ganking someone, since that usually lead to level 60's coming along to help, and world pvp emerge from it. In this there is no player action possible to stop people griefing so a ban is the right solution.
---
A ban like this is a GOOD thing for the long term health of the community. This thread unfortunately show there are a lot of neckbeards that are salty they can no longer take our their personal issues on other people through griefing.
---
I'll take "rhetorical questions" for $500, alex
---
I know this might come as a shock, but you can down vote posts you don't want to see. Considering this post is highly up voted, it means most people want to see this content.
---
If all else fails, you're allowed to skim past posts you don't want to read.
---
Is see a LOT of RP-PVP answers.  What do you see so positive about an RP PVP server? Do you think hardcore PvPers would gravitate toward an RP PVP server as well?

People who aren't subbed and don't want to resub.
---
I think these bosses have some good warrior loot in their tables:
---
Avatar of Hakkar - https://classicdb.ch/?npc=8443
---
Morphaz (there are 4 dragons, all with the same loot table) - https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5719
---
Shade of Eranikus - https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5709
---
You’re a retard, btw
---
Have a discrete zone where it's hard to guess the location would be smarter, and have just the duelists and the casters, that would be chill
---
Blind Bid DKP works best imo. All loot drama vanished the moment we implemented it.
---
It certainly is
---
There's not even honor until phase 2.
---
Three is not a LOT.
---
This. It was hilarious watching a rogue try and kill my pally, when I turned around, popped macros and sent his butt sprinting in the other direction.   
---
It's funny watching the opposing faction's reaction to your damage as a healer, lol.
---
I will be a Human Mage.. we must repel the forsaken scum!! For the ALLIANCE!
---
&gt; They're wearing Tier 6, gear from The Black Temple and Hyjal raids in The Burning Crusade.
---
that's because it's an event.
---
1.3 changed it so Blackrock Spire capped at 15 and Dire Maul capped at 5, but every other dungeon was capped to 10.
---
1.10 is when every dungeon, but Blackrock Spire were capped to 5 players.
---
You'd be surprised. Being good and making people go "oh shit that was good" takes no interaction.
---
Ever watched sports on TV? You don't interact with the players on the field....and you still watch. Streaming perks are you have the opportunity to talk to them.
---
Think the point is moreso the “0 counterplay” than the actual specific numbers. I mean if you’re level 20 I doubt it feels much different being ganked by a level 50 vs a level 60- after a certain threshold its just kinda a “yeah duh you win” scenario. Even 10-15 levels can be a massive power gap.
---
Seriously need PVP-RP servers. It would be a huge hit to the community if this is neglected.
---
That item is Bop I think either the streamer was wrong, or you mist understood what was happening
---
I’m just saying main tank requires more time investment to be effective than dps it heals. And his post is asking if main tank is a good spec for him. What is wrong with my honest assessment?
---
It would drive me crazy. Also I really doubt theres a setup that could push those frames at 120fps in any game thats more taxing than classic wow, league or the like
---
You’re pretty immature for someone trying to make a point about life.  
---
If you think it’s healthy to spout off bullshit with no real point, then yes I’m a huge fascist.  I believe more that you’re unable to process simple followings like the golden rule.
---
I'm not sure what I want. On the one hand being involved sounds super fun. On the other hand I heard it ruins like the economy or something I'm not really sure what it ruins
---
Really wonder what they are going to do about all the nerfs that happened over time ... are they going to recreate original difficulty and leave it there, patch it over time, or are we just getting the equivalent of 1.12 which would be severely watered down version of raids.
---
Streamers tend to have huge followers and are very trolly. It effects the overall quality of the server.
---
I really want to see TBC, Wrath, and beyond rebooted so to speak and keeping more closely to vanilla design. Something like the "pristine server" idea taken further.
---
I'd also really like to see the unfinished storylines originally meant for Classic, with a preference for horizontal progression rather than vertical. Other than finishing off all those Emerald Dream quest chains etc with one final Emerald Dream raid, I wouldn't want to see any new ilvl jumps beyond that.
---
It's tough to say which I'd want to see first. I think that as a classic fan who gets that it isn't "just nostalgia", and that I genuinely do like the place WoW was at during that time frame, I get why people would want other expansion servers. I really enjoyed TBC and thought it was a pretty sweet spot (except for flying) and Wrath had some good points, too, especially the story.
---
People want to see TBC or Wrath servers because those were their favorite times playing WoW. For some people TBC was the best, most balanced game, for some people that was Wrath, and for those of us who prefer the vanilla model, we still can't ignore the amazing storylines, dungeons, raids, etc they added.
---
I have enough retail gold to pay for my sub in Classic for 3+ years. Doubt I will need it anytime soon, so I may as well just play Classic for free.
---
Every ganker I encounter says that they want the 60s to show up, but then when I show up they seem to run away as fast as they can.
---
Theres probably a few gankers who aren't bad at pvp but literally every single one I come across is terrible. Whitegrape doesn't even know what BOP is lmao and on his stream last night some mage kept calling my blessing of freedom a FAP. 
---
I enjoy the cat and mouse game, but the mouse can't actually believe he is a cat right?
---
Do the guards not aggro u?
---
And then got married after because of it?
---
Granted, I'm sure there is much more to it than that, but the wording just seems a bit off haha
---
Each combo will have different niches to fit into.
---
When it comes to healers:
---
Druids can provide support with pounces, feral charges (if specced for it), rooting (which is great against horde with their lack of dispels/gnomes) and rolling those HoTs while pillar humping.
---
Priests are very offensively capable healers. They have always had great synergy with rogues and mages. Mana burn can be game winning. Power infusion makes spikes more possible. You've got to be careful with using your GCD on offensive vs defensive dispel though (especially dependent upon your faction)
---
Shamans provide so much to their teams with situational totems, offensive purges, and WF totem. They can have some mobility with ghost Wolf, but snares really hurt them, and they need CC backup.
---
Paladins are strong with general low level PVP. As someone else in the thread mentioned, if you know what you're doing, and force the bubble early and interrupt at the right time, a paladin can easily be handled. The strength of a paladin is in applying and reapplying blessings, empowering melee with freedom, clutch BoPs, and lots of cleanses. Pallies are all about positioning. That's the name of their game. They can be slightly offensive and definitely throw a hammer for that KB, but that should never be at the expense of maintaining position and resources (as with most healers).

# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
Right now, our core raid spots are covered, and we're seeking to expand our numbers - as well as potentially build a second raid to strengthen our progression. In particular, we're looking for **Holy Priests and Resto Shamans**, though other applications may be considered depending on their quality. Recruit prios may change from week to week so stay tuned!
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we're currently planning to raid from 8:30 to 11:30 CET. Earlier starting times may be considered for weekends, depending on players' turn-up.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to pop by on the discord server. When joining you’ll have a temporary rank and only see a public chat to counter any potential shenanigans.

Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild. 
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random.
---
Raid Schedule: Tuesday / Wednesday / Thursday 6 - 9 PST, 7 - 10 MST, 8 - 11 CST, 9 - 12 EST.
---

Druid: Open (Healer)

Hunter: Open

This would be an alt group we would make specifically for this purpose.
---
If it's that easy, go for it! I think you have absolutely no idea how hard being a profitable streamer is.
---
Most hardcore PVP'ers would go for a PVP realm. A RP PVP realm basically aims to cover the whole content of the game and allows things like player-organised wars between factions. Something less present on other server types due to different mentalities and server mechanics.
---
If they make an rp-pvp realm, it will probably only be one, since last I heard the devs has said they don't plan on making one at all, and if there is one 100% streamers will be on it, I've seen multiple videos from big streamers asking for one.
---
I played since start of vanilla, and quit near the start of BfA.
---
Druids were very much in demand in vanilla.
---
In raids, they are considered to be healers (your tier gear is designed around improving your healing). Priests will beg for your Innervates. You are the only class with battle rez. You can also off tank in a pinch.
---
In dungeons, stealth runs consisting of a feral tank, resto healer and some rogues are quite popular.
---
Druids are great healers, decent tanks, and poor DPS (feral kitty and especially balance) because of low DPS and lack of CC.
---
Is there a source on the event being something specifically causing it? Even in the comment section, the actual hunter whom had the Ashbringer states that you could raid SM with a group of 10, regardless of having the weapon back then.
---
What are you even talking about..
---
I will probably be leveling normally until late 40s and early 50s when quests are not as plentiful.  Might do some AOE grinding then if I find zones are not heavily contested.
---
Dunno how 50k people can fit in lakeshire. Even all the major towns in WoW together couldn‘t inhabit so many.
---
Why would you go for a melee and 2 casters instead of 3 casters?
---
100% agree

**&lt;Heralds of Norgannon&gt; | US-PST | RP-PvE | Horde | Social &amp; Raiding Focused**
---
**About Us**
---
&lt;Heralds of Norgannon&gt; was founded by Players who are getting older and want a more relaxed, community focused atmosphere. We have jobs, families, and other commitments that prevent spending large amounts of time online, so we need to make the most of that time. To that end our focus is on both Raiding (Non-Hardcore) and Player-Driven Content such as Roleplaying, in-game events/contests, and so on.
---
**Raid Information**
---
Tues/Thurs - 7PM-10PM PST
---
Optional Raid Night: Saturdays - 7-10PM PST
---
Loot Rules: Loot Council
---
**Why Softcore Raiding?**
---
Vanilla Raids have been cleared for well over a decade with many configurations and strategies, all of them public knowledge. Vanilla Raids are also a large step down in mechanical difficulty compared to even those of TBC and WotLK.
---
We do not anticipate needing to dedicate hours upon hours of play time to Raid successfully, a Hardcore mentality is likely to lead to burn out and/or boredom as the content quickly topples. We are treating Raids as a piece of what makes Classic special, not the entire pie.
---
**Roleplayers**
---
We plan on having Roleplayers as a significant portion of our Guild because Roleplaying is an endless source of content. We will have regular RP Events and Contests once everyone has settled into the game, these will also be open to anyone on the Server as part of our Community focus.
---
We are not out to alienate those who are not fans of RP. Roleplaying will take place in its own channels and will not be part of our Raids and there is no requirement to take part in Roleplaying if you don't want to. We offer it as a source of content and an outlet for Players who enjoy it, not something to be forced on everyone.
---
Please check out our website at https://norgannon.enjin.com/
---
A loot council is much harder to understand and follow than a DKP system. The DKP hoarding can be discouraged with DKP decay. Worst case an item gets rolled away to those for whom it would be an upgrade and all who are eligible lose the same share of said item's DKP to the raid. 
---
In my book all those things are smaller problems than the drama induced by a controversial decision of the loot council. With a good group of people who trust each other: loot council all the way. With a newly founded 40man of people who don't know each other? Yeah, I'd rather not.
---
Haha
---
Hoping they release where the servers are located so when we reserve names its on a server with good ping.
---
Ayyy lmao a clicker. 
---
Don’t worry, I was too back in the day.

Yes it is, specially on an Rp realm. Just look at their behaviour towards RPers in retail. And that's ignoring all the other detriments they bring with them, such as zone flooding and node apropiation, economy management, and overall toxic behaviour. It's just something I don't wanna experience, even less on Classic
---
&gt; killed world PvP.
---
I just disagree with this notion.  Yes, it eliminated the impromptu battle of two people (or groups) running passed each other and a fight breaking out.  But we still had epic battles around raid entrances, daily quest hubs, world bosses, and the PvP specific areas in each of the new zones.  Raids on the major cities still happened.  Plus, it was at on of fun trying to figure out to get a dismounted off of his flying mount while slow falling to safety.  
---
I think it moved and altered world PvP, but it didn't kill it in my experience.
---
the one hander from the dragon had a chance to summon a welp to help you out. Was pretty fun irc
---
I'm so glad and not at all surprised you're Alliance, and a *warrior* to boot. 
---
Some make dreams come true, some make stereotypes come true. You are definitely in the latter group :p
---
"They don't think it be like it is, but it do."
---
I am hoping there will still be fun in exploring the world, though I am concerned that it will be short lived.  Not every where was a joy to visually see, we all had our least favorite zones that weren't as exciting.  I am relying on a few features and aspects of the game such as needing to discover flight paths, having to train skills each level, finding the hidden entrance to Undercity, for example, will prolong my enjoyment for more than a month or two.
---
MANY WELPS HANDLE IT!!!!
---
NA, PVP, Alliance, any day except saturday CST, Hardcore pve,pvp, loot council 
---
Friend and I come as a bundle, a little about ourselves:
---
Both taking 2 weeks off work to speed level at release
---
I plan on going gnome mage.  Played vanilla as horde druid killed everything up to/including twin emps. Friend is going dwarf holy priest, some private server leveling experience, hasn't played much wow but he's good at any game he plays.

This is what happens when the Immovable Object is hit by the The Unstoppable Force.
---
Thanks for your comment, that's a really good suggestion! I'll try to include more info like this in future videos!
---
I get that. This ”stream sniping” is something that should not be punishable in any case. Nobody is forced to live share their location to opposing faction. Why act surprised when someone comes to kill you, when youve basically set out an open invitation to the public
---
Well if that happens, by my logic it would force Blizzard to open another one, since it would be expectable that large streamers would bring at least a few thousand players into that realm, potentially making it high pop/full.

DKP means noone will take semi upgrades. Loot council means every item goes to someone that needs it. 
---
Sure, if you dont have 100 % attendence, you wont get your bis gear first, but you will get semi bis items.
---
Aq mount?
---
Yeah, the 6 slot bag drops on private servers is nuts.  8 slot and higher seems normal but 6s are out of control.
---
Not op, can you explain or give me a reference to learn more?
---
Closer to 1/3 than 1/4.
---
Pros and cons. You'll have more community events such as the tournament duel held on the beta last night, on the other hand you'll have to deal with streamer fanbases.
---
Yeah perfect response Mr Krabs haha
---
Close enough.
---
"As someone who has played arenas extensively"... Then you go ahead to make a comment on it after removing your basis for any ability to have a real opinion???
---
also seems to suck away all his free time..
---
Run away from him and setup a duel somewhere else real fast.  *shrug*
---
Moved to an area where he would be unable to venture to easily.  Taken the streams offline so he can't easily see the location (streaming isn't granted any specific right by Blizzard).  Gone to a contested zone so alliance could kill him.
---
Not really a cliff, though. 
---
I wouldn't expect something reasonable to happen if I traveled to the end of the universe and crossed the threshold to literally nothing.
---
50 DKP MINUS! FUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKK!
---
How is it alliance fault that the hunter targeted wrong player? Sure the duellers move around and the crowd stood still sometimes, but it's not really anyone's intentional fault.
---
Honey, you got a big storm comin.
---
same in beta. only one faction allowed.
---
Read the post lol
---
streamers aren't the problem, their viewers (and the people who hate the streamers) are.
---
Yes they scale very well.
---
I wanted to like it so bad, I just couldn't deal with Cockney Accents on Russians.
---
I am guessing that they will reach level 20-30 tops before they leave.
---
Reaching level 60 "Out of curiosity" is not something that I see people doing from Retail, especially if they do not like leveling from 1-120 which is much shorter.
---
Because it was changed in a patch before 1.12.2
---
That Belt... So handy week after week swimming to that bloody island
---
And then it gets given to a rogue :(
---
I guess it doesn't really matter if I make the bank alt on the day of release, I just don't want to be logging into it until I need the mail from it. That's why I wanted to know if the mail can be sent to the character before actually logging into it once
---
It's an ancient sword in WoW too, isn't it?
---
Professions are an obvious example of this, but in BFA they are much more useless. This makes leveling a crafting profession like blacksmithing much more worthwhile and a guaranteed reward based on the time you put in.
---
I mean thats what every streamer will do until new xpac comes out then theyll jump on that while waiting on the next phase.

    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)   
---
While wanting to relive past    heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress    at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our    raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to    maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have    minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and    coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of    skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week    raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be    spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course,    doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to    burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming    consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over    rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders    of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of  leadership   experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!   
---
    Loot Council   
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.   
---
**Core Raider Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

I'm just going to copy and paste my reply to Boduar here:
---
Was it though? In the video I provided, which took place on a Blizzard realm, there are 10 players wearing Tier 6 armor, which was available mid Burning Crusade, inside of SM Cathedral - a 5 man dungeon.
---
EDIT: Hell, got the players Armory, verifying this happened on Blizzards realms. https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/emerald-dream/lakron
---
it might, or, because they're so high above the dungeon level, it just lets them in as a raid instead of trying to force them to downsize to complete it.
---
Your experience differs from mine.  I simply gave my opinion, and I'm not trying to convince anyone else that it's everyone's truth or some unassailable reality.
---
Everyone has a different perspective, and that's fine.
---
Heh. Yeah, I remember when you had to go out to the most remote frontier keep to get materials for skiling top-tier crafting, and having an infiltrator pop out of the forge and stab you was a regular thing. Don't know how it is now, but back then Alb infiltrators were the OP flavor-of-the-year class, so you had a lot of them thinking they were god's gift to PvP because they could grey-gank sitting crafters. Most of them weren't actually very good (Pro tip: when chasing the Hib bard, don't turn your back on the Hib champion they're running with, because that rear-stun style? Really sucks to get hit with. After he's debuffed you with his shouts, of course).
---
A way larger group of people have decided BfA is not for them after a few weeks of trying. It has only 1.7 million subs anymore lol.
---
I honestly posted it for a laugh, because fear was doing all sorts of stuff during this tournament (likely because of the zone, no doubt). I didn't mean for it to be thought of as a bug or something. I probably should have thought through how people would view it. Hopefully some of you lauged with me though. :)
---
The items that requier a proffession level will be labled so.
---
Same, lol. I remember only that I enjoyed it. But I was going through it with people who already knew basically where to go, if memory serves.

This story I have about the Sunken Temple says something about vanilla grouping as a whole. I was running it as Horde (not that it matters) and we had gotten to the center circular room and were clearing it out. It was around 6 or 7 IIRC at night and the druid just sits down and says, "Mom says den den is ready, be back in 15 minutes." We actually waited, took a bio break, and the druid came back after 15 minutes and we continued like nothing happened. Most dungeon groups stuck together no matter what in vanilla, even if they were bad or just had to go AFK.
---
I mean good for you. The game is still in a good spot for raidloggers, but casual players that enjoyed simpler things like the old school rpg vanilla was has mostly quit now. BFA is a game only for the most hardcore fans, the casual playerbase quit years ago.
---
Yeah especially with addons that act like raid finder.
---
Seems interesting, honestly thinking about it you would probably want to dual wield deathbringer and hakarri manslayer with double lifestealing and use dragonbreath chili. Spam wing clip for procs and threat. Not sure about armor but, with those weapons even shaman gear would be good for the threat aspect. The biggest thing with this is you'll probably go oom pretty quick though. Obviously you'd have to find someone willing to give you those items but there are always gbids. 
---
Personally I think I would go for wyvern sting just cuz I think it would be great for pulls though I see why you would go for intimidation. Nice long stun and threat for your pet is nice. Might level a hunter on a private server now since I also like doing stuff like this. Tanked a few 20 man's on my pally for fun so trying to make the unoptimized work is fun for me. R.I.P. other players lol.

I never used it because I felt so bad for Eranikus. Ah, to be ten years old again.
---
I think there will be a minor increase in light RP. I know I'm interested but can't stand the idea of playing a PVE server. However, the biggest reason I've seen for them is that many people are convinced they will be streamer-free. If I don't have RP-PVP though, I'll just play a PVP server like I always have and move on with my life.
---
Allied Assault was my gateway drug into pc gaming.
---
It was added in the BC prepatch IIRC.
---
&gt; Well the change they had in mind was trash. The change they have in mind now is to make every aspect of the game about in-game monetization
---
I already explained this in the post you replied to, but I guess I'll try to clarify a bit.
---
The things you mentioned are principles of modern WoW, but vanilla WoW would be developed with the principles of vanilla WoW in mind. So there's no fear of things like the cash shop or other elements of modern WoW seeping into the game. Additional content would really just be new zones, raids, and gear which I feel the current developers are more than capable of designing. 
---
&gt;Because power creep is a thing.
---
Yes, additional tiers of content introduces more powerful items. It's a tradeoff that always has to be made. How many players do you think would prefer if the game was capped at AQ or BWL instead of Naxx? Probably not many, because most players are willing to make the tradeoff for additional content. Also, some of that content could be horizontal stuff that might, for example, introduce sets focused towards offspecs like Prot Paladin, Enhancement Shaman, Feral Druid, etc.
---
&gt;Even low end developers at Blizzard make about 65k/a. It took them years to re-engineer Classic. New content will require developmend AND testing. If they have a team of 50 people it's 3.2mil a month and that's just wages and not accounting for the better paid leads.
---
I'm skeptical about some of this, but I'm at work at the moment so I don't have time to look into some stuff for a response. I will say though that you're leaving out the most important part: profitability. This is what they meant when they said that they're considering post-Naxxramas content but they'll have to see how Classic turns out first. No one know how many subscribers Classic will bring and retain. If this content "only" retains a half million people, that's still "only" $7.5 million per month in revenue. That would pay for 1,384 of those low-end developer's salaries each month.
---
&gt;Just no. TBC is a proven sucess story without any additional development costs. There is little to no risk at all.
---
You may love TBC and that's great, but there are many people who do not want to see their accomplishments in WoW Classic be made completely obsolete, Azeroth abandoned, several elements of the game designed more towards casual players, flying mounts, or the other gameplay changes that TBC brings. To suggest that absolutely *everyone* wants TBC is ridiculous, and can be easily proven wrong just by reading this subreddit and the posts that people have made critical of TBC.
---
&gt;Yeah, Heroes of the Storm was a great game. Paystone is awesome. Diablo 3 is a beast and people can't wait for Immportal. Battle for Azeroth is amazing.
---
This is just a completely irrelevant tangent.
---
The event itself was triggered by the person with the Ashbringer walking into the zone.  That changed the zone from the dungeon to the event itself, though I don't recall if there was a limit to how many people could be grouped to enter.
---

Looking for 2-3 night per week raids.  Around 8-11pm est or 9-12 est.

Min-max type player (maybe not for racials cause I want to have fun with my new vanilla toon).  Posted some top 100 dps parses in Wrath, heroic server firsts, top 500 kills.  Haven't played WoW since mid Cata.  Looking to jump back in for Classic.
---
Anonymous internet culture...  Why do you think so many people enjoy WoW?  They can pretend to be whatever they want.  That's what WoW launched as.  William Shatner was an Elemental Shaman, Mr. T was a Nightelf Mohawk.
---
You keep responding like a lost puppy, please fascist. Learn some self control.
---
&gt; In fact I can't think of one positive aspect of flying.
---
Outlands is massively huge. It's enormous. Hellfire Peninsula is just a giant beast of a zone, not to mention other zones like Blade's Edge, Nagrand, Shadowmoon, and Netherstorm (Terrokar and Zangarmarsh are more "normal-sized" as a bit of relief after being overwhelmed by Hellfire Peninsula - again, BC is a master class of design). These designs wouldn't have been created like that if not with the knowledge that eventually you could traverse them with a flying mount. Look at later expansions they designed with "no flying" in mind - the zones are relatively tiny and unimpressive in the grand scheme of things. Keeping flying off doesn't make them feel bigger, it just feels annoying. 
---
Outlands, and also Northrend, were "epic". They were truly expansion-worthy, and a big part of that appeal was that these places were just huge and meaty. 
---
----
---
I don't disagree with you that flying has some problems though. I don't agree at all that it "killed world PvP", because world PvP was 100% still a thing in TBC, but I do agree that there were problems, and some of these problems were compounded in later expansions by decisions made by what were essentially a different team.

Not all items are BoP so they can trade them to their main. However if the person is trying to get the BoP items on their main then they are in for a sad surprise once they put in all that work.

BC/AD is litteraly the most common way of denoting time in the world. Go be outraged elsewhere you snowflake.
---
I think all level 60 dungeons are capped at 5 man except for UBRS like you were saying. However, pre-60 dungeons were capped at 10 players I think. Hardly anyone did it though because it was not well known + leveling dungeons weren't that hard. It would gimp your xp gain and lower your chances at loot. It's also possible I'm remembering this wrong.
---
I don't think it will ever be lackluster but it might not scale as well past AQ because the set becomes pure healing in Naxx and AQ focuses on hybrid spell/melee stats.  Whereas everyone's stam gets really high in Naxx gear.
---
If *all* you do is gank lowbies while playing the OP flavor-of-the-month class, people might wonder about your skill.
---
It is your fault for thinking this is as simple as looking at what a calender says. There is astronomical definition and meteorological definition for summer because there is seasonal lag. And you forgot August. People consider the warmth around June/July/August as Summer because that is the meteorological definition and that is what they mean.

He was also too busy with reporting players by using the right-click option while also making a video to condemn such an action on the side.
---
Four people died from the initial explosion, but many more died in the years following.
---
cat form DPS as restoration with rogue gear is... ok. you'll just have to make sure you shift out to apply moonfire/insect swarm when they drop off.
---
Priests can heal dungeons just fine as Shadow up until around BRD without issue. BRD is when dungeons start becoming somewhat challenging.
---
you could always go 31/20/0 as a Priest and level that way.
---
If you had zero aoe it was a wrap, might as well let them Duke it out and wait until the boss was left around.
---
Yea that was the premise of exploiting underneath UC in the last half of the tourney. As big as WoW is, it's still pretty hard to find somewhere with:
---
Nowhere to LOS duelists
---
No NPCs 
---
Not difficult to run to as a level 30
---
I got mine before my mount. It's a super hot trinket.
---
This happened to me, too. I had a name for years that didn't exist (according to armory at least) on any other server. Then one day I got a PM asking me if I also played a hunter by the same name on X server. Same thing happened to my druid, I had a completely original name that I never saw (even if I armory'd it) for several years. Went to roll on another server and it was taken, looked it up, belonged to an active high level character lol.
---
I'm hoping to get them reserved asap this time around just to be safe.
---
Yeah, that's why I see bug as "this isn't a bug, this is by design" because it really is.

Quicktip for early skinning as orc/troll. Before leaving the valley towards Sen'jin, take the path you go for the shaman earth totem, jump into the water and swim to Ratchet. The flight path to Orgrimmar is already unlocked so fly there, learn skinning and hearthstone back.
---
You’d gain a main tank in your group
---
Warrior/Feral Druid/Paladin, Mage/Lock/Hunter and then a healer who can supplement more damage like a priest or resto/balance Druid or even ele shaman too will minimize total overall downtime. 
---
I would say mage is a must just for free food and drinks for everyone.
---
What are the better AH add-ons?
---
Yeah some people seem to believe that Retail world champions skill/talent isnt applicable to older versions of the game.... This is the WoW that they first played, they arent just talented at the expansions, they are good at WoW fundamentally and will probably be the best players regardless of Vanilla or any expansion. I agree I think we are going to see a bit of a new age where this skill level of player sets their focus on Vanilla gameplay.
---
Thing is, the raids could be the best in WoW history, but if my class continues to feel like ass I still won't want to play them. Not adjusting classes, or removing more of the dreaded GCD just feels like a waste.
---
Most profession gear doesn’t have profession requirements. Engineering is considered a “money sink” because most its products are not really sellable/usable to non-engineers. The items will be labeled so no need for confusion. 
---
Most gear (crafted or found) does have level requirements so a level 1 cannot be overpowered.
---
For some reason I thought you could go in but you couldn't get loot if you were in a raid.
---
I fucking love this. This is the kind of guides I want
---
Ya good video Vanilla-Wotlk was not meant to be played with any sort of melee leeway at all breaks the game at every level. I'm hoping Blizzard announces they are working it soon!
---
I feel like thats all speculation. I was hoping for more of a concrete answer. I'm actually a bit surprised that I've brought forward something that is potentially a feature that got glossed over in regards to Classic with some form of credibility that it was a thing much later than 1.12. 
---
Perhaps I should open a Ticket? Although I almost feel as if a random customer support specialist working with Blizzard likely wouldn't have the answer either.
---
My guild managed just fine. Loot council decided whether the upgrades were massive and if they weren't, just /rolls.
---
Never had loot drama and still pushed for top 3 guilds on server (small server)
---
This. Although I remember a previous poll done here on this subreddit showing that RP-PVP seems to be a more popular choice against pure RP realms. (Indeed 20% People said they would play on an RP-PVP and only 3% on an RP one )
---
Now to answer u/Rebugamer I don't think hardcore pvpers gravitate towards RP-PVP by any means, I would even go as far as to say most of them don't like RP at all. 
---
In my personal case, I will go for RP-PVP because I currently play on an RP realm on live, and can just turn warmode on and go kill hordies as I please. Which is an advantage I won't have in a Classic RP realm, since I would only be able to attack flagged players, thus denying myself of a big chunk of world pvp experience.
---
TL;DR: I like RP, I like PvP, hence I'll go for RP-PVP
---

As a central bank economist, this is one aspect of the game that I'm eager to observe over time and between phases. Compared to Vanilla...players are much more knowledgeable about items/gear, farming, locations; they also have a plethora of databases and guides that have been tested and improved over the years)--so it will be interesting to monitor market efficiency, how resources are allocated, and overall player behaviour.
---
But they designed it before they 'fixed' it, I don't follow that logic. It's obviously a reference but if it was a reference to a mistake, then they would have fixed ZR right there and then.
---
Ohhh I overlooked the tabs
---
Sure, but it's harder to justify taking out 20g/day when there's documentation on everything.
---
Have an upvote for starting a really interesting thread about game theory!
---
Just to make sure we are covering all bases... 
---
Are you planning on having 2 separate shaman toons? Because respeccing gets very expensive very quickly. I thought I remembered respeccing a lot in vanilla, but on the beta I went to respec my Druid and was somehow surprised that it starts at 1g even though I was like level 20. Like I remembered it being bad but I didn’t remember it being THAT bad THAT early on (and while you probably wouldn’t be respeccing until end game, it still gets from 1g to 50g quicker than I remembered) . 
---
If you’ve already considered this then power to you, but I just wanted to mention it in case you had forgotten like I had.
---
I heard there weren’t going to be any rp-pvp realms?
---
Bid with class restrictions on gear was the one that seemed to work best for all the guilds I was in during vanilla. Raid leaders would allocate what classes were allowed to bid on stuff and items would have a certain minimum bid, and members would bid as much or as little dkp as they wanted for a specific item. There was minimal loot drama with this method and the only people that complained about it were people who were late additions to the raid group who were just expecting loot handouts while we carried them through 40 mans.
---
nowadays it's mostly skalds and minsts ganking greys. after that, it's "insert stealthy here". inf/ns/sb/rang/scout/hunt. Yea, that was Annihilation I think? Such a beast style. On the private freeshard server, champs get access to shield so they can get the anytime 42 shield stun O_O
---
when leveling as ret you should not use judgement 
---
 you only use lvl1 Seal of Command 
---
You get into group as easily because specs doesnt matter til 60 
---
there's no reason to level as holy unless you think it's fun to be even slower
---
They arent just "retail" players.. these guys have played since Vanilla and have been the most skilled/talented players in WoW regardless of expansion for years. Its not surprising that they are going to be the best at Vanilla too if they set themselves to it. THey arent the best "retail" players, they are the best PvP WoW players.
---
That‘s plain wrong. All of the beasts, atleast around bloodhoof village and thunderbluff, were skinnable in the stresstest.
---
Better itemization, some of the best looking zones and slightly better raids. Aside that... I think tbc brought tons of problems. It made old world and old content irrelevant, separated 1-58 (leveling) and maxed players to different worlds, brought arena and inevitable need to rebalance and make every class like each other (to a point how every class feels the same in bfa now), flying which broke the open world. You weren't part of it anymore but some outsider that tries to go from one point to another as fast as possible (essentially skipping everything and going straight to a new instance: queable lfd and lfr is just one step ahead this)

They have already announced they are not using the same names
---
I'm not implying something shady actually happened, all I'm saying is that it's not professional for a tournament's organizer to have private conversations with the finalists.
---
Your xp gets converted into gold!!?? At what rate? how does that work? Just quests, or killing mobs?
---
Rp-pvp for me.
---
Paladin - Cast Divine Intervention on a cloth-wearing character of your same faction when you all are attacking.  Enemies will just sit around the bubble, waiting for it to end and then absolutely pummel the bubbled fella.
---
Also, I hate when people do any of these things listed.
---
I remember things like this. Also a lot of 'I gotta go' and abruptly logging out or d/c.
---
No it wouldn't, you'd have to do a pulling motion. It wouldn't penetrate as easily
---
What does this mean? Can undead talk to alliance?
---
So my presumption is correct. Have they said what they will be doing instead?
---
Kinda weird how they decided that shadowmeld was the OP racial
---
Idk how many servers are in beta but if he mains on another server then he wouldn't have anything stopping him from trying to ruin the streamers event
---
I think when they use their influence to put together fun in game events it’s awesome, one of the reasons why i wanted to post this. They do have they’re draw backs
---
I don't think so.
---
I remember sapping people in TBC and it didn't even flag me into pvp.
---
You know, he’s not actually asking for it..it’s a rhetoricsl question
---
They refrenced Manrik during the interview so probably just names like that
---
Well put.  I was just offering a different view.
---
And if it wasn't a mistake they wouldn't have fixed it all.
---
Or are you proposing that the version that was implemented was inversed by mistake?
---
Yeah I suppose.  Ganking is just part of PvP servers to me though. No problems.
---
Hogger PvE Lv1 raid server.

Layering will help dont worry too much about "the pack"
---
With the yellow latency bar. The true vanilla experience.
---
Loot council. If people complain and don’t understand they leave. And the loot whores aren’t the ppl you want anyways
---
oh no!!! Someone made money!! On an event that over 100k people watched! NO!!!
---
&gt;But we still had epic battles around raid entrances, daily quest hubs, world bosses, and the PvP specific areas in each of the new zones.
---
Yup. Honestly, this is why talking about this stuff online is pretty annoying. People on /r/classicwow often straight up just lie to make a point about how glorious vanilla was and/or why expansion X is bad. There was definitely world PvP in BC. It wasn't "a different perspective", it absolutely existed, but someone can talk out of their ass and somehow we should take them at face value. It's absurd.
---
I didn't kill anything and TB, but if the ones around Bloodhoof were then I was bugged to shit.
---
Probably just an alexensual fan
---
Yea, I'm thinking of waiting until I can at least get a gold for a stack of Copper Bars before I start selling.
---
They are incredible with endgame gear. Problem is the PvP gear is often a weird hodge-podge of stats so to get the real BIS gear you will need to raid. Its a catch 22. Some near BiS pieces come early like Lok'Amir (Nefarian), Nelths Tear (nef), Zandalarian Hero Charm (ZG) and the Augurs Hauberk (ZG quests) but most of it come in AQ 40+. Stormcallers(Aq 40)/Elemental Fury Pieces(Naxx)/offset AQ40 pieces (gauntlets of Kamindor etc etc).
---
So you will need to PvE to get the PvP pieces you want. Id go with the lock so you can focus on just PvPing personally.
---
Fuck yes I'm definitely rolling on the Billy Maclure pie server
---
You have no fucking idea you're talking about moron, but still thanks for responding to one day old comment.

---
that spectator UI though
---
&lt;Get of Fenris&gt; - Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
**What’s it mean?**:
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
**Our Philosophy**:
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.
---
**So what about loot and stuff?**:
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart**:
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such ***we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).*** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
**A Brief History**:
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
**Raid Times**:
---
TBD but likely evenings during the week, and early day during weekends (to allow for night activities IRL)
---
**Guild Priorities**:
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).

Drop us a line and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
Not sure Id use those descriptors, but I get what youre saying. 
---
BFA is a garbo game, and its only fun for about 6-8 hours a week. but i needed a sub to play beta. 
---
BFA may be a game for hardcore fans, but its not a hardcore game. 99% of it is super casual. 
---
Classic wow, as compared to retail wow is much more hardcore in nearly every aspect. 
---
I enjoy both aspects, I like grinding my face into 500 wipes of H Lei Shen, as much as i like 4 hours of grinding the turtles on the shores of Hinterlands. I like the slower pace of vanilla, but it is cool to see the vast array of art styles and color palettes as you so easilly hop from zone to zone, expansion to expansion on live. I like that I can easilly hop into an M+ and start hitting my buttons and doing stuff, but I also like having to handpick my group and travel to the dungeon and be measured (to a degree) in my pulling. 
---
its a fools dream, but i want vanilla/bc design philosophies, with wrath - mop class design (excluding tanking an healing, which Id like closer to vanilla--mana management and threat management) and bc-today encounter design. Id also like no flying and no dailies (but id be willing to compromise on those last two, the current system on live of gating flying for 1.5 years is pretty good).
---

I refuse to enhance my fears

Uhhhh yep pretty much nailed it. 21 (tad shy of 22) Orc Warlock following Joanas Horde guide. Just got to the first Inn in Ashenvale...
---
The Wiki doesn't specifically state that it allows you to bring a raid group into the instance or that it converts the instance into a whole separate entity or exception to run the event. So I don't know if its fair to call that a source.
---
Meridian 59 was before Ultima Online, and never gets the respect it deserves.
---
Garbage items that add flavor though. Crazy huh? Things in the game that are just for fun and not min max tryharding
---
Blizzards auto ban system on people that get mass reported will happen.
---
Same. I used to be a hardcore vanilla raider, but now I’ll be coming back more casual for the reasons of having adult-ed
---
Warrior definitely has the short end of the stick on leveling / farming, but it's doable. Level as a DPS spec and acquire tank gear from 5 mans and UBRS, all of which are easily tanked by an arms or fury warrior.  Also 3-4 hours a *night* isn't really casual. If you plan on playing every day thats over 24 hours per week. You could probably get into a friendly/progression raiding guild and clear a few raids a week with that schedule.
---
You're talking about adding like 2 hours to your levelling man. It's not a race for most people.
---
As someone who has been I charge of gbanks in retail vanilla and various private servers, I cannot tell you how much time is wasted moving loot or trading loot to a guild bank. And often you have 3-4 guild banks because of all the crap you farm
---
Subscriber numbers in burning Crusade were higher than classic. Subscriber numbers in Wrath were higher than burning Crusade.
---
I want them both because they were fun as heck
---
Damn dude you make it sound like 100-200g/week is the end of the world.
---
Indeed, I seem to remember it being the same way. As do some of the people in the comment section of the video I linked. 
---
Could be remembering it wrong, but I mean, I can clearly see 10 people in an SM in that video.
---
Ok, my bad, didn't know that. But still, games &gt; books, and I'm pretty sure there were many of WC3 fans for whom Deathwing was quite a noname in the beginning of Cata. But on the other hand, only lore geeks speculate about the lore of the upcoming expansions, so you're right :D
---
Yeah exactly, but while I play I’m still gonna be a try hard 
---
I believe the term now is “a sweat”
---
Simple: Dont stream.
---
I just want my death knight back
---
If you want gear yes, if you just want to see the raids no. Undergeared dps is better than no dps.
---
Same.  “a sweat”?  That’s a new term.
---
!RemindMe 84 days
---
Not a mage and will likely never be a spellcaster again. From what I gather on private servers, most mages will spec frost and AoE farm.
---
Yes, it looks boring as hell and has no iota of originality, but it is what the mages like to do.
---
That has no impact on your character being temp banned or muted from report spamming what are you on about?
---
Turtles: hight gray sell crap + lots of leathers will pay your mounts+skills. You are welcome
---
&gt; brought arena and inevitable need to rebalance and make every class like each other 
---
What are you talking about? Class homogenization was a result of "bring the player not the class", not arena. Asymmetric balance has always been a part of PvP. WoW is basically a strictly PvE game in retail and the classes are more similar than ever because they want to make every class and spec a competitive option in every fight. 
---
If anything, Arena and PvP made classes more diverse. Shaman and Paladin were pushed further away from each other by BC's increased focus on PvP - whereas in vanilla, which was more raid centric, they were made more similar to appeal to raiders looking for similar utility (Shaman having to get a threat reducing totem to compete with Salvation for instance).
---
Very niche, but just make a Druid named Brokentooth and wander around in cat form in the Badlands. Hunter will shit themselves when they see you in their Minimap.
---
I really like the hair/beard combo on that human warrior (paladin?)
---
&gt;won’t ever play longer than a 4 hour session at most
---
Because cheaper laptops can't work for 6 hours straight? :P
---
I can't answer you, but hope my Acer Aspire 3 for $300 will be able to run Classic on min/avg.
---
1000 should get you an i7 and dedicated graphics card. That’s all you need really. SSD would be a bonus
---
I love classic, but feel the TBC was probably the pinnacle of WoW gameplay (though I quit in Cata and only returned for a bit in BfA so I did miss some good xpacs).
---
Classes closer to balanced (hybrids in particular), outstanding raids, ranked PvP, cool lore, etc.
---
WotLK is probably peak WoW from a storytelling aspect, at least for my generation of players.  I played WC2, WC3, and FT.  Those are the background for how I got hyped for WoW in the first place and to have to opportunity to experience and "participate" in the conclusion of those stories was absolutely incredible.  It took our guild to the very end, full buffed, in ICC to get the LK and it's still my single favorite moment from all of WoW and possibly all of Warcraft.
---
Of course, if it were me, I would probably not do flying (use point to point flightmasters where needed to access content).  I'd also remove or significantly reduce the Argent Tournament event in Icecrown (which iirc was only added as a delaying move because ICC wasn't ready yet).  I'd also remove LFD.  There's probably a few more tweaks I'd make (it's the same for Classic, honestly) but #nochanges is probably best since we'd never all agree what to change.
---
With all that said, though, if (and it's a huge IF) Classic is so successful that we get through all the content and are finally asking "what next?" years down the road, I love the idea of 60 and Azeroth-centric "expansions" and content rather than TBC and WotLK.

Yes, I’m sorry. So Blind DKP works like this:
---
1. Everyone earns DKP by whatever the Guild decides.
---
  a. Raid attendance 
---
  b. Boss kills
---
  c. Consumables provided
---
       1. My guild just did attendance 
---
2. DKP was tracked with an Addon (I forget which) and before the raid everyone new what their DKP pool was.
---
  a. The addon would send the info in a /w
---
3. Loot drops and those who wanted it would bid an amount up to their current maximum DKP pool.
---
  a. The bid is /w to the Loot Master (while the raid cleared trash to the next boss)
---
  b. The winner was announced as well as the amount of DKP spent.
---
       1. In cases of a tie usually the players would work it out, and only one time did we do a roll off because they were both replacing the same item.
---
  c. Example: “Icosiol wins Tier 4 Shoulders with a bid of 850 DKP.
---
      2. It was announced so nobody would think they were cheated since they all know what they bid. People who lost would actually be happy for the person that one. It was remarkable.
---
Best system I ever used. DKP should be used only for casually serious raid teams. Those pushing for server firsts should be loot council, imo.
---
Like you are sweating because you are trying so hard haha
---
Yeah, well blizzard specifically stated at blitz on that they were going to keep a tight lock on addons that break vanilla feel. I’m sure that this would be one of them. 
---
That said people use discord/forums/tradechat/etc to host weekly MC or Ony Gdkp or roll runs and that will be easy enough.
---
Don't want people to find you? Don't broadcast your whereabouts.
---
I do not know a blizzard employee and am not a streamer, have had beta access for weeks. And now I don’t even play it while I wait for release so suck on that crybaby!
---
Bring on the downvotes
---
It's a source for my first statement, that it changed the nature of the zone which is what I thought you were asking for a source on.  My second statement recognized that I didn't recall any limitations on how many people could enter.
---
i wanna click those name "buttons"
---
Ooh, nice! I can still remember that Deadmines writeup with the Dwarven group, with a cliffhanger at the cannon door. That got me fully sold on picking Dwarf on launch.
---
They would never believe us back in Ironforge!
---
While I absolutely agree that the devs created something incredible, I think naming the realms after them would take away from immersion.
---
The first lich king  heroic kill was 21 min, normal kill was also 21 world first illidan was 22. You may be right on PvP balance but some of the raids in wrath were the best ever created. Ulduar especially is regarded by a lot of people as the best raid. Where wrath is weak was the filler raids like totc and  naxx. But as people have learned in the beta, the reason naxx was undertuned was because people were not good in vanilla and a couple of the fights were very weak when ported to 25 man content.
---
This brand.  It's based on the Clevo frame.

Use a third party like xoticpc.com.  I don't know how they are now but when I bought gaming laptops these guys had the best customer service.
---
I think spreading mats around the officers could just exacerbate the "problem" because people often aren't all on at the same time. It's mildly frustrating to have to wait for somebody to log in to give you mats, but I mean it isn't game breaking. If your bank alt person/people aren't on daily consider re-assigning their stock to somebody else who is. As somebody who has played nights due to work I do think more guilds should consider giving somebody late-night access too if possible lol.
---
I don't have a strong opinion on guild banks. I don't think they're a game breaking addition. People could use them on their own bank alts to cheese the storage limits, but you can do that with multiple alts and the mail system, too. This isn't really a "change" in that regard.
---
One concern I saw raised was keeping some sort of inventory maintained and updated for guild members to know at all times what's in there so they can ask for it when somebody with access is online. To this I say "there will probably be an addon for that". Those with access to the bank alt can have an addon installed that dumps a list of banked items in html with color coding preserved that they can then paste to the guild site, or probably even link in discord. Easy peasy.
---
Another concern that I frequently see expressed is that without guild banks one person has full control of the bank and the potential damage corruption can cause is quite high. I hate to burst people's bubbles but that same potential exists with guild banks. Ultimately one person has all the power--the GM. Anybody with unrestricted access in fact holds the same "unsettling" amount of power over the guild's contributions and work.
---
I don't think guild banks are necessary. The only perk I see is that you may not have to wait for an officer to come online to access certain bank tabs.
---
I think an addon that keeps track of inventory--like Altoholic etc do--is sufficient.
---
The coolest game developer many people never heard of.

Never heard of hidden DKP before. Do you just mean something like an attendance tracker? Because I think a lot of loot council guilds do that.
---
One of the more effective guilds I played in had "DKP" but it was really just a numerical score of your raid attendance and contributions to the guild and that number was part of loot council's decision. That guild also had members submit lists of the top items they were trying to obtain so the council felt a bit less like a shadowy cabal and more like some friends trying to help you get the items that you wanted.
---
To be honest though one of the best parts of playing in a loot council guild is the player filter it creates. Players who care more about themselves and their own gear progression than their guild and its raid progression tend to avoid loot council guilds, which is totally okay with me.
---
Ahhhhooahhhh, uoohhhh...

I believe you could still get loot, you just couldn't complete quests in a raid group that weren't raid specific nor would you get a whole lot of EXP.
---
Pugs will be a different animal in classic than on live. Without a cross server LFG there won't be the same anonymity there is on live. People will gain reputations and you'll know which pug leaders have successful runs and which have unsuccessful runs. Also, pug leaders will know which players are good and which aren't. You'll want to make sure you stay running with whatever turns out to be the reliable (and honest, when it comes to loot distribution) pug on your server.
---
Someone looking for a friend? :)

Tbc introduced dungeon finder not wotlk
---
there is literally crossplay between warcraft III and reforged, you can play either one online.
---
I think he means that OP is a bit of a dick. 99.99% of the readers here know no one in Blizz. It's just rubbing salt in the wounds indeed.
---
Playing a lock so I'll pickup tailoring and skinning. Craft what I can and when raiding likely switch to herb/alch
---
No it didn't
---
If the names are changing anyway I’d argue the immersion is damaged in the same way. But I do see your point.
---
I remember this happening to me back in the day, I was so pissed whispering the guy to give me my gold back etc lol. Huge noob lol
---
Literally who cares about streamers getting griefed/killed by their viewers? They are making the conscious effort to broadcast themselves to the world in a game that is player vs. player. Blizz shouldn't do anything about it. Don't want to get ganked? Don't roll on a PVP server. That simple.
---
&gt; And often you have 3-4 guild banks because of all the **crap** you farm
---
cut down on crap?
---
That's not true. It's based on a ton of different things like how prevalent crafting is, what map setups are meta, and what zana mods are available. When meta-crafting weapons was popular, exalts became much more expensive early on and later dropped in price, mostly due to reddit posts.  If Belfry is meta, exalts are worth more and don't increase in price as the league goes on after price settles. If Arcade is meta, exalts are worth less but increase as the league continues and people break their shaped setup or quit. There's a million different factors.
---
Well, I only mentioned it because of the fan unit possibly playing a role in the purchase
---
Just look at the patch notes man. All dungeons except ubrs/lbrs being capped at 5 is in there before 1.12
---
This. I hardcore raided through TBC and WoTLK. Even when I was obviously being favored (WotLK Nax 25 man, I was server first to get full 5/5 as a mage) there were never issues. Proper rule sets, a good council group, and being open and talking fixes anything. In my case I remember my GM telling me I was top DPS on the server at the moment, and he would funnel the 25 man too me. My payment was to help carry the others through our 10 mans and passing on all loot. Surprised at how many people are encouraging DKP over Loot Council. Loot Council only fails when the raid/guild/people are failing.   
---
DKP has inherent flaws you have to deal with. Loot Council has flaws that are all based off of us, the humans, and that can be fixed.
---
Thing is they had like 2-3 weeks to get better, it just shows how retail knowledge gives an edge to understand how the game works. Its not like they picked random Joes from Pservers, those guys that were in the tournament are marked as "good players".
---
Do you -really- think that Blizzard goes by the Astronomical definition of Summer?
---
You just wrote yourself that August counts as Summer, the Calendar says it's Summer hence its a summer release.
---
I really do not understand why people are trying to argue against that when it's a fact that you only confirmed with your Wikipedia entry.
---
It doesn't mean jackshit if the Summer only lasts "for a few more days".
---
This is why there are stream delays.  Don't want to get sniped?  Add a delay.
---
There are bound to be similar minded people that will form bonds over this. Remember that the funeral crash is still celebrated to this day.
---
Outcasting behavior is Ninja looting, Spamming, Cheating, etc.
---
because this set of classic wow servers are intended to be a museum.
---
Im all for updated models, textures, class balance, bug fixes, and QOL adjustments like a guild bank, auto stand when casting a spell  from seated, auto dismount when casting a spell...
---
but thats in 2021. When I am sitting at my computer in 2020, I shouldnt be able to tell the difference between now and 2005. 
---
But if blizzard wants my sub after I finish naxx, they need to do something. Im not playing and paying for vanilla all the way through for a 3rd time.
---
Normally i would say stream sniping is bad, but for some reason i think it should be ok in WoW. I don't have a justification for it.
---
They scale really well. Aq40 set / naxx off pieces are really good for them. HP doesnt scale as much as dmg in high end gear scenario (recent private fun server exp). "Later phase" vanilla PvP is all about deleting/globalling ppl down and ele sham excells in that regard.
---
Was the addon by chance called EPGP? Thanks for sharing!
---
Only a sith deals in absolutes.
---
A brand new WoW account that subscribes can download and play classic once it's released. Downloading the modern game isn't required.
---
I am looking forward to WoW Classic like my 2nd trip to Las Vegas.  I know it will never be the same as that first trip.  Nothing can replicate that feeling.  Yet Vegas had a vibe to me that felt welcoming and inviting.  I enjoyed the trip, but it was less on the WoW factor and more on the feeling the atmosphere again.  The sights don't impress me anymore there, but *the atmosphere*, how the city affects all of your senses, is what draws me back each time.  There is a sense of wonder that always awaits, even though I go back for nostalgia.
---
I hope WoW will keep that feeling for more than a couple dozen levels.
---
lol...it was the exact opposite in reality. I knew dozens of "Rank 14" PvPers (nevermind they only got R14 because all the better players already got the title and then stopped competing for Honor Points) who literally never broke 1800 ratings when Arenas came out in TBC.
---
Turns out it's actually not super skill dependent to queue into BGs with 10 people and squeak out wins against randoms...and it's sure as hell a lot easier to succeed when you're not competing against the top players on the dozens of servers in your Battlegroup.
---
I was in a great PvP guild back in Vanilla, was an early R14, and I definitely found Arenas WAY more challenging and tough than BGs. Don't think I ever actually managed to hit Gladiator once, though I'm happy enough to have been playing in the 2700+ range.
---
Honestly Shamans only real weakness while in resto isn't that they aren't amazing. It's just that they are a piss poor substitution for paladins. Because paladins are super unfair in high level organized pvp. Other then that. They are truly monsters.
---
Been using the same name for ~20 years at this point. Only about say 6 years ago did I find a game/server where I couldn’t use it.
---
Definitely reserving it on classic.
---
Anything with a 8400/9400 i5 cpu or better.  
---
ie.) 8500, 8600, 8700, 9500, 9600, 9700 (any skew would do fine)  
---
Probably want a 1060 6gb or better.  
---
ie.) GTX 1060/1070/1660/1070ti/1080/1080ti or RTX 2060/2070/2080/2080ti  
---
\^Those GPU are listed in ascending order of performance but broken down into two separate generations (minus the GTX 1660 because that is a turing architecture card.)
---
That was indeed Annihilation. I remember my 2H champ fondly. I wish we'd had tmog or appearance gear in DAOC back then, some of the TOA gear was gorgeous, but fell behind the Dragonslayer gear in terms of optimal stats.
---
Skalds were always great solo gankers.
---
I have an Lenovo ideapad Y700. Bought it 2 Years ago for 800€ and I use it mainly to Play WOW. Works flawless even on highest settings and should be in your pricerange. (+ It Looks Really cool) It hast an glowing Keyboard and an really good Sound for an Laptop. Only downside is, that it only has 320GB memory and no possibility to install an External SD memory card. ( the slot Exist but it isnt wired inside dont ask me why) Sorry for the awkward Caps german Autocorrect xD
---
Nope not a thing if you don't want to be sniped don't stream.
---
ya for sure. i started with wc3 and had no clue what was going on. even in wow i was totally lost story wise but loved it anyway. i only learned this stuff recently cuz ive been playing through/reading everything that came out before classic launches.
---
**Please refrain from talking about other loot systems. This is strictly a DKP discussion.**
---
@mouseover is critical for healing, on live as well (assuming you're not using mods to do the same effect)
---
Classic should’ve been a remaster and not rerelease. Missed opportunity.
---
Thanks for your opinion. Pretty clear it worth less than zero.
---
And that's totally fine, as I said, you can use Smelly Pirate Cave for all anyone cares. The point is that the original and correct term has always been DM, and that is all anyone was saying. Most of the people calling it VC are trying to assert that is the original name for the dungeon and it just wasn't. 
---
What logical reason would you call it VC for? It would make sense if Maraudon was out at the same time or first to differentiate between them before people started using DM:E, DM:W and DM:N, which is the case for some EU servers as I mentioned, but it makes no sense at all otherwise. It's like calling Maraudon "PT" because you kill Princess Theradras at the end, or calling Blackfathom Deeps "ATD" because Aku'mai the Devourer is at the end.
---
Project much?
---
I'm sure there will be addons so night elf girls can ERP as having horse wee wees in classic.
---
That’s how classic should’ve been. Toggle better graphics if you want them.
---
Don't be a clicker.
---
Private servers get shit wrong.
---
I will get downvoted for it but mechnically retail is a lot more challenging.
---
Classic has more keybindings though (like 10x more for some classes)
---
I used to hit the basilisks in shimmering flats because they spawned so plentiful.
---
There are people who can load up a spreadsheet with economic values and predictions, racing to red maps and selling red maps, investing in rare or well rolled items early, combining div card stacks to upsell basic item, and take a small fraction of currency conversions. They can make hundreds of times faster currency than someone mapping efficiently, it's impressive.
---
What an asshole
---
Oh, my bad then. I misunderstood. 
---
Thank you for clarifying.
---
&gt; we're using a known and proven solution.
---
Correct. You are using a known a proven solution to solve a problem from 12y ago making it something different.
---
i also jsut wanna know what is so important to be stored?
---
Like in retail guildbanks dissolved into consumes people were willing to share, and then useless junk
---
woosh
---
I mean, it existed in classic.
---
1.3 instituted dungeon caps at 10, 15 for BRS. 1.10 capped the 60 dungeons at 5, strat scholo and Brd (DM was always 5) and 10 for BRS. 
---
Given that theyre doing 1.12 balance, pre-60 instances should be 10 man if theyre not already.
---
I plan to write an addon to introduce fresh characters to lore of their race. Did the core and part of human "lore test" already. God, it's a lot of text, even if I try to only say something very brief about all the Seven Kingdoms :D
---
I know you can I leveled like 20 people before I bit the bullet and resubbed
---
I mean, its easier than deleting the char and regrinding it to 60
---
Didn't he threat to rape a YouTuber who didn't like the idea of Classic?
---
Thats the dumbest advice, no one can remember how wands worked on Retail Vanilla. Why not make sure everything is right? Why not ask the question of wand scaling? You know blizz could have forgot or made an oversight, or they could be right. How would anyone know? 
---
Literally scared of questions.
---
**Exactly that :)** 
---
I mean, a person that plays 100 % perfect, but has 70  % attendance, shouldnt get prio on BIS gear over someone that plays 80 % perfect with 100 % attendance IMO.
---
Why would you tab target a mage ?
---
How bad? Do you think it should it be bannable offence in other games? And if so why not in wow?
---
no when the immovable object is hit by the unstoppable force the unstoppable force just goes right through it
---
you see an immovable object and an unstoppable one are both the same things: something outside forces cannot interact with
---
this includes each other so they would just pass through each other
---
Oh, man. I forgot about this place. 
---
SUPER STOKED!
---
What's crazy to me isn't that they got 110k viewers. It's that the community managers response to trash like TrollgodX was. Nothing we can do sir. At the very least they need to add a system where by inspection. We can see peoples entire character list. No more hiding in anonymity.
---
I don't consider stream sniping to be cheating. If a player wants to voluntarily announce to the world where he or she is, or what cards they're holding, whatever, then they assume whatever risks come along with that. 
---
If they don't like it they can either not stream it put a delay on their stream.
---
I'm not saying it's not poor sportsmanship, and that it shouldn't be frowned upon, but it's certainly not cheating.

Ofc loot is RNG. The difference is that in vanilla you can actually get your full BiS gear for example. In Bfa you cant, regarsless of how much time you invest in it. Just one of the many examples
---
Classic wow wont have what most people define as pug raids. At most a pug will be multiple guilds/groups working together. I dont remember actual pugs being able to succeed until BC, and that was only 2 world bosses and Kara. Due to attunements and the mechanics that went into ssc/tk/bt/sw it was fairly impossible. And even then a pug group generally was half of the top raiders on the server with pugs only filling out the extra spaces.  
---
On the small chance there are some successful pugs, it will be /roll with some items 'claimed' for the MT or RL/ and etc

Have been hearing this around lately. Worth watching forsure?

Relational DKP/Ratio DKP/EQ DKP.     
---
 - Each item won worth 1
---
 - Each hour raiding worth 1
---
 - Ratio = Hours Raiding / Items Won + 1     
---
 - The highest ratio wins.    
---
 - This means if you won 10x items, and raided for 30 hours your ratio is: 2.72
---
 -  If someone else won 9x items, and raided 30 hours their ratio is: 3
---
 - Therefore 3 is higher than 2.72 and wins the item.    
---
 - Each new expansion divide the hours and items in half this keeps the ratio order the same but gives newer members an easier time catching up.   
---
This has low/no drama (since there's no decisions/favoritism, it is mathematically decided). You can and should publish the current ratios/loot histories/hours. This allows newer guild members to gear up sooner. This also doesn't require guild leadership to assign arbitrary worth to a specific item.        
---
Used this for ten+ years. No drama. No problems. Other guilds literally were born and died from loot drama while we just kept doing our thing. Any system that requires individuals to make value judgements about either players or loot is doomed to drama hell.
---
Downvoting this post to prevent more people seeing this and getting ideas.
---
You mentioned spiritual focus, did you skip picking up imp SoR? I guess 15% on something that is already around 10-15% of your dmg isn't that great, just curious.
---
My reply to your comment wasn’t directed at you but rather most the people in this thread up in arms about his “griefing”. Some people even calling for a permanent ban, not just from beta.
---
I completely agree. Griefing (unless extremely serious griefing) is a community issue. The mmo genre as a whole has really moved away from that stance, really since WoW first released.
---
This is the type of douche that will be complaining on his stream (of classic wow).

Just because he was good at arenas on the disaster that is retail doesn’t automatically make him competent in vanilla.
---
Also, is he paying you to fondle his sack or something?
---
All those things are available with any Triple A released game.  That's what you pay $60 for, not a subs fee for.
---
Tbf frost mages shit on warriors
---
Yeah quests like retail.
---
It pet them whwn they arw sheep. 
---
Poly blink up to them pet them usually gets the message
---
When it comes to Pallies vs. Shamans, paladins have the defensive advantage, but shamans definitely have the offensive advantage. Shaman can purge magic buffs, and is one of the only classes besides prot warriors (lol) that can do it. It's surprising to me how many shamans forget they have this incredibly useful ability. Couple that with their ability to spot heal, interrupt spellcasts at range, slow targets at range, and drop windfury totems for geared arms warriors and they're a force to be reckoned with. Play a shaman like a support class and you will make the difference between your team winning or losing.
---
ESO with my old Wow friends. They have zero interest in Classic.
---
What? I’d need a source for that...
---
The issue is on private servers you hold onto things that later in game will become valuable or needed for raiding. Will be the same for when classic wow launches
---
I suppose you're right, playing Mage for years and expansions on end probably makes it a lot more obvious how to be effective with minimal effort, whereas other players with different experience might have a completely different view on these things.
---
Shamans in particular I find to be pretty hard when it comes to PvP, considering the vast amount of options offered by totems. Same goes for priest for me - they're so versatile, so it's hard to tell what's right. Do you dispel defensively, offensively, do you heal or squish in a mindblast - really hard to tell for me. Then again, I suppoes both classes can be played pretty effectively without utilizing all their tools. Guess you're right, it's a subjective thing.
---
We won't use DKP. That bring said, the big disadvantage of DKP is saving up DKP for the big items and also which classes should get what items? So if you can fix that, very nice! Most guilds I've seen just use a flat cost DKP which is the absolute worst.
---
1-5 maybe. That'll get you through the starter area.
---
I just feel like for RP a Druid wouldn’t attack anyone who had respect for Elune/Earthmother. That would include druids and shaman. Maybe I’m wrong.
---
CoD2 was fun but BF2 had a lot more depth at the time.
---
Of course there isn't a source thats why its a rumor. If there was a source then it wouldn't be a rumor
---
But I dont like orcs at all. Why should all be orcs? I would see it as extremely boring to choose my character only based off a racial skill, not the race itself.
---
Lmao, you're in for a rude awakening when classic goes live, especially since blizzard wouldn't have done anything if this was a regular player being trolled. 
---
Player: "GM help! A level 1 is jumping on me!"
---
GM: "He's a level 1, have you tried going literally anywhere else?"
---
Dealing with assholes was part of vanilla, get over it.
---
You just never actually played vanilla.
---
this is not true in classic, a level 1 can receive the max rank of fortitude.
---
Who voted yes and what crazy reason could one possibly have for that, and please also tell me what the punishment should be?
---
Here’s a tip: it’s based on the name of the dungeon
---
Look I am not saying shamans are bad they are amazing but, the issue with them is simply that paladins happen to be OP. Not complaining as the only way to fix it would be homogenization but, the comparison to paladins make shamans a piss poor substitute.
---
Yep. I got tired of MC, BWL, ZG, AQ, Naxx...but the entire time I was still queuing into WSG, AB, AV. Those never really got old, and I'm assuming the same will be true in Classic.
---
He has been one of the best to ever do it since BC. You're literally embarrassing yourself son. Vanilla has a lower mechanical skillcap so once he learns the nuances he will own. Dogshit pservers players will get stomped.
---
&gt; character creation will already open up a month before the game goes live?
---
Two weeks before. August 13th.
---
Any cutting attack involves a pulling motion because you want to maximize the shear stress on whatever you're cutting.  
---
If recurved swords made more sense, there would've been more recurve swords in later time periods. All but one recurve sword (the Ottoman Yatagan) became obsolete in the face of straight en regular curved swords because the latter were more effective. And maybe even more importantly: swords were never designed to go up against plate armor. If you are designing a weapon to specifically penetrate heavy armor, you aren't going to end up with a sword. The result would be something like a pollaxe.  
---
Tl;dr: Recurved swords are ineffective weapons in every aspect.
---
Darkmoon Faire is Phase 3 (BWL &amp; BGs).
---
Which streamer shit in your Cheerios this morning?
---
Warrior, Ele/Resto Shaman, Feral Druid. 
---
Triple Tauren and you can even start together. I initially thought enhance shaman, but it would be pretty taxing on the mana to try to keep 3 people healed.
---
The synergy is pretty awesome with these three. To name a few: MotW, Thorns, Leader of the pack, Windfury, Battleshout, Rez, Brez, Cures (Curse, Poison &amp; Disease), Chain heal, Innervate.
---
You get 2 heal button classes, plus, both melee can tank. Instant dungeon group, or even outlevel them a bit and 3man dungeons.
---
Almost no loot competition (especially at 40). Int Mail, Agi Leather, Str plate.
---
At 60 the feral can tank and let the warrior wreck things. Shaman is a plenty competent healer, especially with innervate.
---
Biggest issue is waiting for the warrior to catch up once the druid and shaman get wolf/cat forms. This could be solved by swapping warrior for Hunter. A little less synergy, but everyone gets a nice move speed buff and the cat/wolf can shield the hunter from daze. Downside is that you don't have a super buffed wreckingball of a warrior, so I think the wait is worth it.
---
Well again, it depends on what you want to do as a paladin. Holy shock makes you well rounded. Great for 5 man's,pvp and has its uses in raid. Also if you're doing Kings then you aren't doing sanctuary. If all you care about is raids then yes, being the guy that has sanctuary might be the better option but, vanilla isn't just about raiding and people want to experience different things. I just listed some of the cons to going BoSanc so OP can take that into consideration when making his decision. 
---
If he plans on tanking a lot of 5 man's then holy shock might be something he would like to invest in. If he wants to be the homie with sanctuary then he can also do that. I like my paladin well rounded so I can enjoy every aspect of the game. But another thing I just thought of to add is that BoSanc is great for AoE farming so it's also something to consider. In the end it's OP's decision, I'm just listing the pros and cons of each so he can make an informed decision. I love tanking 5 man's on my pally on private servers so my input is coming from someone with that type of mindset. 
---
He could also go full prot with illumination in holy, worse for most dungeons since you lack a pull but great for strat live speed runs, better for pvp since reckoning is a thing but you lose out on raid performance. There are many options and different options will appeal to different people.
---
F&amp;F is the same old beta streamers are in. An internal only would be to 60. I'd wager just devs and qa on that one.
---
Yeah, any guilds I was in, the banks had some useless shit (but it's rAaAAAaAaAAre!!) nobody could/would use, and crafting mats/consumables, most of which you could farm yourself if there hadn't been guild banks.
---
I get wanting to be able to go in and pull out black lotus or something in the middle of the night when you're the only one on, but the overwhelming majority of "this is why we need guild banks" aren't actual problems that need solving and I'm not convinced the one niche situation (the only one online and no bank access) justifies adding them.
---
Like every other poster has said. Stream sniping isn't bannable on WoW, or almost every other game. And it shouldn't be.
---
You can use delays, overlays to hide info, hid loading screens, etc/etc/etc.....A game company shouldn't/wont care about grief through stream sniping if the griefing they do isn't bannable. They dont care how the person is griefing you, only what the grief is. Take Starcraft for example. If someone is streaming, and get sniped by a viewer, the ony person they can blame is themself.
---
Things can still be rumors to people who haven't seen a source yet. Not mutually exclusive.
---
You can heal in raids as your pvp spec, 30/0/21, as long as your guild isn't going for world firsts and you have some mp5 gear to sub in.
---
For those that don't know, he isn't involved in WoW Classic at all (aside from handing in a petition to Blizzard to get it started).    
---
He **was** Lead Director when WoW was originally in vanilla. He hasn't worked for Blizzard for years and doesn't now.

With engineering, some items just require the engineering skill to be a certain level to use the item. There are 2 schools of engineering, goblin and gnomish. You can only do one unless you want to unlearn, then re-learn engineering and go the other path (and level it from 0-300 again.) Gnomish engineers can use goblin engineer devices and vice versa, but you can't make goblin stuff if you're gnomish and vice versa. 
---
You can't trade BoP stuff though so you'll have to go X profession if you want to use X profession's items.
---
Sure, but getting there is exceptionally difficult at level 30. I feel like they could have finished half the tournament with nobody disturbing them.
---
No, let the dickheads get themselves banned, then we read their QQ post on Reddit about how they did nothing wrong, then Blizzard with their blue Reddit name swoops in and calls them out on why they got banned and putting them on blast.
---
this was posted before I'm pretty sure?

It looks like everything i want is covered. Immersion/Storyline was something I was scrolling through that site trying to find recently and its already listed. Clique is already there. WA is there. If TukUI allows you to change the shape of your action bars/ unitframes, then i'll be using that instead of ElvUI I guess.

I agree 100%

I mean, sure Asmonbald will get his thunderfury, but it still has to drop. That thing can take years or both pieces can drop in a single raid.

CoD 4 promod was an alright fake Counter-Strike... a little bit like Rainbow 6 Siege is today. That and CoD 2 were the only good ones, after that they went all out on the casual and console market.

Not true. Blizz have announced that, if you are subbed, they will open up name reservation, and possibly character creation, on the 13th.

---
Imagine being able to enjoy the game as you level
---
The definition is from google so yes that might actually be the case hehe
---
Its actually not! Here are the only two patches that make any reference to the dungeon cap. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0
---
It would appear that all the leveling dungeons have a hard cap of 10 players and should have that in Classic.
---
RP-PvP and I'll take any population I can get at this point.
---
I assumed it because i heard the lead team dev say that they thought about implementing a minigame sort of hearthstone that you could play at the inn with your friends, which would have you collect cards from mobs.
---
Take skinning, vendor low level leather. Farm devilsaurs at 60. Profit
---
\*Ud/orc soul link warlock :) come come mages :) come come
---
No how do people even think this?  
---
What did you get banned for?    For watching a twitch streamer while I was playing the game at the same time.  
---
Crimson (Horde-PvE) is recruiting.
---
We are a group who have been playing and raiding together for several years now, and are looking to step into Classic and progress at a quick pace. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding but go hardcore preparing for and during raids to make quick progress.
---
To be the best guild on our realm, and one of the best in classic, while we maintain a good quality community of friends.
---
**What we are looking for** 
---
Solid players who want to push the limits of Classic and their class, while also being reliable and able to make our raid schedule.
---
**Looting** 
---
For our 40man raids, Loot council is current plan, though DKP is still on the table. In 20mans, when available, we will generally roll for items except a few exceptional items.
---
**Schedule**
---
Our tentative raid times are Monday: 19:00-23:00 CET Wednesday: 19:00-23:00 CET Thursday: 19:00-23:00 CET Sunday: 19:00-23:00 CET
---
We shall use extra raid days to do guild dungeons, 20man raids, and farming when 40man raids are cleared for the week.
---
We require 90% Raid attendance.
---
If you are interested. Message me on my discord Oulous#4513 or you can apply via our google doc https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11JF0rQKy_JjLpj32w1uO-fxZrCyi-rj2Rh9fQ_cCIgc/edit
---
Oh. In that case, sorry I misunderstood you.
---
For other classes that can't heal it's not really that useful because you can't eat or drink food underwater.
---
Well it’s all to do with vanilla unholy trinity, warriors, mages and warlocks. 
---
Although Tips being a bit of an idiot rolled orc rather than undead so subsequently has no tools to deal with fear at level 30.
---
Yep also a lack of guild bank could also allow more cooperation. Imagine having to talk to someone to get something or have them help you
---
Why does this have so many upvotes? You didn’t have to watch tips, in fact bouncing around to whoever is dueling’s stream was a much better experience. And the whole “Pschero” thing was just dry humor, not serious.
---
I mean, it is not, and also that breaks a rule.
---
Make a party with a warrior friend and reserve expensive items in dungeons and farm money that way, or pick up gathering professions.
---
Gonna disagree with you there, because they're basically yin/yang classes. Paladins have better defensive buffs than shamans, but shamans have better offensive capabilities and can purge everything a paladin can put on his teammates. Your argument is basically the fox and the grapes. The grapes you can't get aren't sour, they're just out of your reach and a little bit different. You will likewise find alliance players / paladins complaining about windfury, purge, grounding totems and shocks (also a fox and the grapes situation.)
---
I hope you get your TBC server but, my big fear is Classic progression into TBC. That would be a disaster to me. Basically I hope you get what you want but, I hope to god they keep your chocolate out of my peanut butter lol.
---
i just found my battle chest it still has the two guides
---
i remember reading them while the game downloaded and i saw that druids could learn flying at level 68 so i went with a druid
---
turns out something was changed during wotlk and it was changed to level 60 like everyone else
---
You can bop whoever’s carrying the flag to make them drop it. If you’re a priest, fear bombing the opposite faction when they’re trying to summon people at the stone is a good one
---
Enemy boat spotted
---
From what I understand, this is not the case on Classic right now according to a post in this thread, but you are correct. According to patch notes, all the leveling dungeons should have a 10 player cap on them.
---
former lead director. come on man.
---
What’s the parry news?
---
A mix of DKP and Loot Council with MT Priority. 
---
I plan on raid leading and Main Tanking for our guild. Spent to long regearing tanks in vanilla when our main tanks got poached for other guilds. Happened like 5 times and partly because of that we never cleared AQ40 before BC. As guild lead and raid lead having me Main Tanking will help eliminate that problem. 
---
MT Prio for tank gear. This includes Tanking Plate, Resist Plate and Thunder Fury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker. After MT gets TF, it goes to the loot council to decide. I will not earn nor be able to spend DKP. Yes I plan on PVPing as Tank spec too. I won’t be eligible for any DPS item unless it’s getting dis-enchanted. 
---
Loot council for Legendarys/mounts. Will be a loot council comprised of role leads Raid Lead(Me)/Healer Lead/DPS Lead. No DKP cost for Legendarys. I will not be eligible for mounts or  Legendarys out side of TF unless it’s going to be vendered. We don’t plan on trying for Scarab Lord. If we do it will be a vote from all raiders on who we are going to try and have bang the gong. 
---
DKP Silent bid system for everything else. 
---
5 DKP per boss kill. 10 bonus DKP for being in raid from first trash pull to finish. 20 DKP bonus for guild first kills on Ragnaros and any bosses after. 5 DKP minimum bid. Roll on ties unless high bids are willing to bid more. If you were not a high bid you won’t be able to rebid or roll. Going to have a viewable google doc to view current DKP. My Wife who is going to main a hunter will handle loot/skinning bosses and updating the google doc. Any crafting materials gained can be petitioned from the loot council to craft gear. 
---
Will probably do strait up rolls for the 20 mans. 
---
We don’t plan on raiding more than 2 days a week as most of us are married in our mid to late 30s. Guild as it stands is comprised of RL friends and family. Most of us played in Vanilla and are coming back for Classic. I’ve tanked on a paladin or warrior in every expansion at different levels going to main a Human Warrior. Going to fill the remaining raid spots with recruited players as we level to 60 and gear up for raiding. 
---
Id love to hear pros and cons of this set up.
---
Items that have random stuff like speed boosts, professions boosts, breathing, or something unique are interesting. Cloth that has agility and strength on it just feels bad.
---
Loved the chrome quests.
---
I sort of feel the same way.  The main reason for me is because in other games where stream sniping can be a problem (fps, for example) it ruins the whole game.  The streamer can literally be killed by someone they never have a fair chance to see.
---
In WoW, they can simply roll a PvE server or add a delay (though that's not as big of a help given the slower pace of play in WoW - if you put a minute or two delay on, I can still find out what zone a person is in and then find them the old fashioned way).
---
If they chose to roll PvP, then they inherently accept the possibility of stream sniping.  They're not new to the business and I'm sure they get that.  And honestly, the streamers have their own unique advantages so who really knows how that'll end up turning out.
---
As many stated it is more a question of how far you wish to raid. If Naxx is your end goal then you'll have to join a guild.  If AQ20 is good enough you should be okay.  Just be prepared for the loot drama and possibly losing it to the raid lead's friend.  Not to say guilds are drama free.  Quite the opposite.
---
I liked it. which episode is it?
---
Yaaaa idk about that. It's their livelihood. You can't just say deal with as they lose viewership or tell them not to do it. Thats like saying its the cashiers fault at a grocery store for all the Karens of the world trying to start shit in the checkout line.
---
It is a tricky subject and I understand that argument but idk.
---
How do you easily kill someone who sits in the arena as a ghost and then res during the duel to get a hit or two in on either player? Oh that's impossible isn't it? 
---
It's not as easy as you think to get the "perfect" spot. Griefers will find a way. They handled it well enough as the event was a large success. 
---
Maybe just enjoy a casual event that was for fun.
---
For some reason I want to say I had different ranks of spells that I would switch depending on my mana left or if I didn't want to cast a high healing spell on someone, I'd have a rank 1.
---
Am I making this up or did I really do that?  I can't remember.  Been 10+ years.
---
Haha these are hilarious.
---
TBC was the herald of doom for wow.  Old players began to shed off and the new came and filled the void, it just wasn't the fun it was before.  It progressively got worse as we moved towards WotK as communities became less and less important to game play with shrinking raid sizes and easier dungeons.
---
WotK killed so many guilds it was astounding, the everyone gets a trophy attitude in game difficulties and participation rewards in arena, devaluing the hard work and effort of those devoted to achieving things as a community.  Instead handing it all out like participation trophies.
---
The joke of a raid that was new Naxxramas...  This raid single handedly destroyed my raid guild, not because it was hard, but because it wasn't even a shadow of it's prior glory, we cleared it within a day of the world firsts.  We all began searching for something new and challenging.   
---
By the time we got our hands into the Trial and we're once again chasing world firsts, we had already merged 2 other raid guilds into us just trying to keep actives on to do the small raid.  Looking back at that versus the days of having a waiting line for the 40 man raid was heart breaking.    
---
TBC was only a marginally ok expansion.  And it was the writing on the wall.  Wotlk was the four Horseman of the apocalypse for wow, that was where the game really began to die.  It was no longer the same community, little more than entitlement whining, migrating like ants to new content areas never looking back.  Never helping anyone because they could just do it on their own now, leaving behind ghost towns in it's wake.
---
The shrinking of raid sizes and diversification of role requirements by class caused the game to enter into what could literally be called high school like clicks.  10 man groups would just shun out others who weren't the core, the need to grow players and community and competition died away.  It became simply cherry pick your small team and fuck anyone who didn't make it.  Besides, they could just pug much of it later anyways.
---
It's the community, the game dies if you push it on to the mindset of singularity.  A strong community makes a strong game, not a strong individual.
---
You will have to duel them for your gear back
---
in AV for I think Christmas they added hard packed snowballs, basically you looted them all over the map and threw them at people and they'd knock them back quite a ways away. on horde side we'd always collect them and find the afk'ers in the cave and be like "Hey can you see this quest back here?" and lead them to the back of the cave. Once they were there and trying to get a quest that never existed we'd chain snowballs on them to knock them out of the portal and give them deserter.
---
So that is the experience I remember. Being like lvl 40 something and realizing that I should have been leveling my cooking/fishing/first aid this whole time and going back to early areas to collect materials because I just spent all my gold on my mount. I guess the game is just not similar at all anymore.
---
this was already posted a few months ago
---
I wish retail players would stop pointing out that you can't shadowmeld while in combat.
---
WE KNOW. WE ARE THE ONES WHO PLAYED DURING VANILLA.
---
I was a clicker in Vanilla. Recently I got an "mmo-mouse" with basically a full numpad on the side. I remapped my abilities/consumables there and have never looked back. Next up might be some shift macros.
---
i made this very point in the beginning of my post.
---
The insane reaction to the tauren guy disrupting the dueling tournament tells me that many people here have a very different perception of what classic is supposed to be.
---
Just one (admittedly autistic) guy blocking view for a couple of streamers generated multiple hundreds of angry replies calling for bans - imagine what a 24/7 redridge griefer will get.
---
Thanks for this
---
The leveling of warrior has been severely exaggerated in my opinion.  Perhaps I’m misremembering but I didn’t find it to be particularly challenging.
---
&gt;little to no downtime while pulling 1 or 2 mobs at a time at max level while farming solo for rep/gold/etc.
---
Hunter is the best class for this, and its not even close.
---
 Hey all!  
---
LF EU Guild to participate in both PvE and PvP.
---
Class- Considering Rogue, Hunter and (somewhat less seriously) Mage/Warlock
---
Faction- Alliance or Horde
---
 Gameplay- Looking to see as much of the game as possible so doing both PvE and PvP
---
First started in TBC and managed to level a Pally and Warrior to about 30 before my sub ran out and i was too young to afford any more. Next played seriously at the end of WoD, raided in Legion and quit in BFA as nothing about the game seemed to hold my interest. I've always been gutted i missed out on some of the games best years (when the RPG in MMORPG actually meant somethin) so i'm determined to make up for that this time around, i definitely don't have the Classic knowledge others have but i'm always happy to take advice and i really want to 'main' a character in Classic and get good with them. I've got launch week off work to no life level up and i hope to do that with a friendly bunch of people to make real social experiences that i've missed out on in my time with WoW. Unless i get lucky and get a beta key, until launch i'll mess around on pservers somewhat and try and learn some early levelling routes and finalize what class/race my character will be. 
---
Hope to see you in game!
---
Of course not. If you choose to advertise your exact location all the time on a PvP server then that's your problem
---
A passing quip like a long thought dead enemy being alive and attacking a city isn't foreshadowing -.-
---
Actually, further researching it, it wasn't! 
---
In 1.3 all dungeons had minus 1 high end dungeon had their player caps set to 10.
---
In patch 1.10, Strat, Scholo, and BRD had their caps set to 5. The leveling dungeons retain their 10 player caps. This was the LAST patch making adjustments to player caps, and you can read the patch notes from the following links:
---
I say that in a blue post they talked about the parry chance being 14%, opposed to it being 6% in private servers. It could affect the threat generation of feral druids, making them less effectively overall since that was the best reason of having a druid in your raid team.
---
I miss people being patient and understanding bio breaks and or dinner breaks and WAITING...
---
You’re my hero.
---
All I've heard mention was that it's a friends and family invite round.
---
This is really unrealistic. Anywhere you go someone is going to be able to get to as well.
---
You will never be able to stop a troll, either it is a tauren sitting on a tremor totem so the people dueling cant target it or just have invis enemy faction use any ability on people dueling.
---
The only way you wouldnt get any trolls is to do a 10v10 premade WSG with premade alliance and horde but even then you can't duel in battlegrounds.
---
You’re not shouting loud enough
---
Yep. Going to make an absolute fucking killing lol.
---
More so than anything look up what items and corresponding reagents are needed corresponding to the phase releases.  
---
PS: Blarval Blasid
---
My argument isn't "fox and the grapes" it's based on over a decade of high level pvp expiernece in classic wow. The idea that shamans are a great class is not controversial. How ever the idea that paladins are a far better support isn't either. These aren't my opinions these are the opinions of pretty much every skilled classic player.
---
Think about it this way. How many times in group play. Has hybriding as in doing two things. Turned out to be better then simply doing your role to 1000%. The answer is never. People want specialists and while Ele/resto is very good. It's not half the defensive specialist a paladin is. 
---
Trust me bro when you start playing and, your priests get sheeped and suddenly half your sqaud is eaten by debuffs and various forms of CC. Your going to wish you had that unkillable cleanse spamming goon.
---
Makes it even more lock friendly with the self healing/life tap
---
The problem with it is that it gamifies something that doesn’t need to be gamified. Exploring the entire world is already an achievement in its own right. Why do you need points for it? If the game is good you shouldn’t need to be given artificial incentive to do things in it. Your accomplishments should speak for themselves.
---
i mean surely it comes with being a streamer? people know where you are and can gank you from it, don't like it don't stream. not blizz's fault you chose to stream and, to my knowledge, there is nothing in ToS about it so who cares if someone is stream sniping someone.
---
and its hardly cheating in a game like wow, i get in something like cs:go or overwatch it can be considered cheating but this is an mmorpg people stream sniping dont really gain anything from doing it
---
I really want to know, too. People answer this question based on what the 1.12.1 client runs on, but the Classic client is based off the modern client, which may alter its hardware requirements. I'd like a difinitive answer. Anyone in the beta playing on a toaster?
---
The current retail client isn't a very good comparison, either, because its requirements are based on running the later expansion content as well, which is jam packed with higher poly models, higher res textures, and more clutter and doodads than vanilla and even the cata revamp of the vanilla zones utilized. Best bet would be to log into the retail client (I believe you can log into any toon under level 20 without making a new trial account), set everything to the lowest settings, and see what performance you get.
---
I have to get my PC fixed soon, either way, because my only other rig is circa 2008 (e8400 wolfdale CPU).
---
Siphon Life also heals you: This means it generates a LOT of threat if you DoT every mob with it. Your tank 
---
Also this spell is expensive manawise. While *Corruption* might be OK to use thanks to its relatively short duration + manaefficiency + nightfall procs, Curse of Agony and Siphon Life are a waste in dungeon where stuff dies too fast.
---
I love this dudes energy.  Fun to watch when he gets into a panic. I almost died watching him defend in WSG
---
But fuck that keyboard makes me feel better about myself when i thought i was messy LOL
---
it wasn't that bad...
---
As a shaman, (or anyone who can grant water walking) buff your teammates with it as you guys do some large falls into water (the end of WC or near the final boss in Maraudon)
---
They take fall damage when they hit the water and die :3
---
You never played the original unreal tournament then
---
As a tank who knows all the routes of sunken temple from memory, I look forward to ruining your dreams of getting lost.
---
I didn't find it hard at all.  I mean it's not hunter leveling, but it's not bad.
---
I'm as clueless as you're on what you're talking about. Arena had certain compositions that worked really well and because of competitiveness it brought more pressure for devs to make others work better so people would not cry. Because of that Blizzard has moved towards that bring the player, not class, and everyone has started to resemble each other. Arena was a mistake or competitive ranked arena at least is my take on TBC. There are so many other things that I didn't like as well but many others did because in general TBC fixed so many of ''vanilla's problems''.
---
I had the best time in TBC during my wow history but it wasn't perfect. The downhill and problems started there and that's why I don't want TBC back as much as I want classic and a fresh game like vanilla wow. It doesn't have to be warcraft title but it would be great if it had same principles
---
But you could get all of that with a holy pally, but with a warrior tank, so now the healer doesn't get killed at all since the warrior can just taunt the mobs off of them.
---
change this for mechenar, and substitute sun eater.  ran that heroic everyday for 3 months to get that sword.
---
Bio breaks are fine but making people wait while you eat dinner is just rude and inconsiderate.
---
wow, that's a good point.  as a warlock I didn't realize others have to eat / drink more.  we can indeed get by for long times, just by drain life / drain mana and life tap.   (I forgot if you can bandage underwater or not)
---
&gt; plainstriders
---
I don't think that birds were ever skinnable
---
I have yet to see a loot council where they distributed fairly based on attendance and effort  and performance. It usually is just the circle of officers that get their key pieces even if they only attend 75% of the time. People with 100% attendance and good players will often have to wait for their set bonuses or BiS items until the officers and people on the loot council or possibly even best friends of the people on the loot council to get theirs first.
---
DKP isn't much better though, 9/10 times people of the same class have worked out who will get what first to conserve dkp for bidding on multiclass rings, trinkets and necks or weapons.

How to stop collusion and half the guild buying uncontested at minimum bid while others are in competition? What do you do if your only 2h warrior bids minimum for his weapon, that should be uncontested, but a hunter bids on it for shits and giggles? Every time I've seen silent bid it's caused gquits. Were these guilds just doing it wrong?

Happy to see that you are enjoying it man! I know you are extremely hyped up for Classic release and I can't wait to enjoy WoW with you once again, just in a different setting! :D

Been wondering the same and I asked this from a lot of the beta streamers in chat. The only real answer I got, was that junkboxes drop a lot. Would be cool to know how much you get silver per mob, also wondering what rogue’s diaries will vendor for
---
Maybe don't be a shit head and roll PVP if you have a stream, there are plenty of opportunities with BGs to PVP, or roll after the ntial hype up. Way too hard to prove to the point there is a way bigger chance of it affecting innocent people.

Ok kid, clearly you're better than a 2 time blizzcon finalist.

Agreed. I think a huge part of that "stick together" mentality was because of how hard it is to get a group, get everyone over to the instance and get into the instance (many portals were hidden away in maze like areas). Just gathering a group and getting to the dungeon might have taken upwards of 30 minutes so people were more invested. Now, it's so easy to find another group that people just quest and requeue. They get into a dungeon, it falls apart, they get instantly taken back to where they were and carry on. Back then, doing a dungeon meant stopping questing and often travelling a long way from where you were questing.

Hi, I would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders to you. We are a casual, family friendly guild. We will complete all end game content, but at our own pace. Our guild website is bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.com. If interested hit me up on my battle tag: Breakout#1905, or on discord: Algammon#1375.
---
They added transmog to Phoenix but you had to earn currency to get them, which was cool. You could add toa skins even though it was on an SI patch. And you could add those amazing glowy effects to weapons which was the bees knees in daoc!
---
Glad to see the vanilla community living up to their friendly, helpful reputation.
---
Loot council is the easiest to understand. Person X received Item Y because the council felt that that decision was in the best interest of the guild.
---
The better guilds are usually happy to explain decisions in private, but the answer is usually the same factores, ie. attendance, performance, attitude, etc.
---
Warcraft 1 hasn't really aged well enough. Warcraft 2 plays a bit worse then say Starcraft but its worth a play imo. I don't think either is quite as good as Wc3 however
---
Warriors will get parried a lot too. Both classes will be very RNG-dependant in the start.
---
Dualwield warriors will additionally get parryhasted like crazy, and healers will need to try even harder to keep them up. Shield warriors will again get more parryhaste because they attack more often than bears. 
---
If anything, the news make bears (slightly) more viable, IMO.
---
It does come down to what you're playing for, rank or competition. But eventually it all leads to the latter once you hit max rank.
---
When premades dodge, and pug stomp, there's a lot of classes that are ResidentSleeper. Druid flag carriers? All you're doing is running back and forth for the cap with support along the way. You may not even get touched because the pug is getting GY farmed. Anything can be seen as "high impact" in that scenario. A rogue defending the flag room, locking down some pleb coming in? Mages nova'ing, CoC, and sheeping targets? Where do we start to categorize the value and impact? You don't, because you are STOMPING a pug. You don't take a team of adults and beat a childrens team in baseball and begin to tell the adults who is the most valuable. Only on an even playing field can you be told where you're valued and had the most impact.

**Goals:** Long-term friends to do content with, clearing Naxx, and reaching Rank 11 in PVP. Listed in order of importance.
---
**WoW Experience**: Two of us have raided through AQ40 while the rest of us have BWL experience. We all took a break from the game soon after WotLK and dabbled in some raiding in Legion and BfA.
---
**About us**: We’re a handful of MMO veterans who have grown up playing MMOs all of our lives with varying levels of intensity. I’ve participated in World Prog and Speedkills in other MMOs while some of my friends were more interested in the PVP aspect of the game. Because we’re older now, we’d like to classify ourselves between Midcore through Semi-Hardcore levels of intensity.
---
**What to expect from us**: We plan on getting to level 60 within the first month and to get into dungeons ASAP. We all plan on being self-sufficient in regards to consumables, have fights researched ahead of time and to show up early before each raid. We’re also not adverse to sitting on the bench if our classes/roles aren’t needed with the understanding that when it comes to farm content that we’ll be considered.
---
**What we expect from your guild**: A willingness to improve and to adapt. We expect leadership to help out players who are struggling but to also be able to make tough calls if things just aren’t working.
---
We’re open to most loot rules so long as there is a means of addressing concerns about cliquey Loot Councils. Ultimately, the more transparency there is behind your loot system, the better.
---
And **most importantly** we expect your guild to be *FUN*. If we're going to be spending a significant amount of time together, I'd like to at least be friends with a lot of you guys
---
**Contact me**: Either DM me here on Reddit or message me on Discord@ Leukos#7410
---
How do you handle class specific items? Like rogues rolling on Hunter weapons? Since you probably have 50+ people attending and 10+ have to sit, do they still get credit for hours?
---
High pop PvP realms tend to stay the longest over high pop PVE realms.  The community gets stronger and they tend to Foster better raid guilds. In old wow up and through TBC there were pugs clearing raids on servers like Stormreaver, where jumping down to the old RP servers it required dedicated raid groups for guilds only with only a couple guilds actually doing content.
---
Usually the RP servers are much weaker in player strength and communal drive.  Why I cannot tell you, but I played many servers on vanilla and this held true for most.
---
On PVP servers it wasn't unusual to have battles hundreds of players strong each side and zonewide several times weekly in Silithis etc. This is because a call for help goes out while a raid group forms, and an opposing is forming as well, when someone throws gas on the fire.
---
Let alone the assaults on other cities, epic in scale and at the time, computer crushing.
---
he edited it in, 100g
---
I would believe that if you would have said ad or bc. Thanks for calling me names though. Proves my point.
---
&gt;when you start playing
---
I played back in vanilla in my server's premades. There were many a time where a good shaman was the difference in whether my group (alliance) could take the opposing team down (horde.) I'm not saying Paladins aren't amazing. I'm just saying they're not as amazing as you think. Outlast the bubble and you can wreck the paladin. Force an early bubble by spamming CC's / stuns / interrupts on the paladins. Have your druids root them to make them waste blessing of freedom (which you can then purge) on themselves instead of their team's warriors. Both classes are great, just in different ways.
---
So I found myself in a similar situation as I hate ret, and the worst part of paladin to me is leveling because I have to level ret.  
---
My solution is to level with a warrior whose schedule and matchup to mine.  I was debating going imp SoR holy, or early ret for SoC.  
---
So far as I know, no one has suggested that SoR is bugged on private servers, so I went on a test server and used sor on a target dummy with no spell power for every speed 2h I could find.  Recorded a few swings to get an average(more swings would have been more accurate) and divided that number by the weapon speed to get the DPS gained by sor.  I did that for every rank.  
---
[SoR chart](https://i.imgur.com/SBB0WdJ.jpg)
---
2.5, 2.4, 2.3 are missing because I couldn't find a 2h with those speeds.  There are some inconsistency within a rank, but I think that is just because I didn't take large enough sample sizes to get the exact average.  
---
To compare to SoC you need to know a characters crit chance(I assume 10% with the 5% from ret talent), and their dps from their character tab.  I looked up weapon progression, default strength and AP gain as you level, AP gain from might(wisdom is common, but I will level with a warrior so I'll have bshout), and took some guesses on average strength from gear per level.  Then found some screenshots of people leveling to make sure my guesses were reasonable.
---
[SoC Chart](https://imgur.com/a/dkr0jHw)
---
This is a little messy to read sorry.  Top line is weapon speeds, line below is calculated SoC proc rate for that weapon speed.  First column is your character level, second column is assumed on character tab DPS.  Levels 1-19 are grayed out since you can't yet spec SoC.  The red areas are where there is SoR is better or at parity(&lt;15% difference, so speccing imp SoR would be better).
---
With the exception of when you first get a new SoR rank, **SoC is consistently about twice as much dps gain as SoR.  Overall damage increase of almost 15%.**  That is not taking into account the extra damage from JoC on stunned targets, or its x2 crit vrs SoR x1.5.  
---
The real answer is probably higher then this, as I kinda assumed that I would always be a bit slow on weapon progression, and I only looked at lower ret.  The numbers get even more in favor of SoC with 2H spec, sanctity aura, and vengeance.  
---
I still hate ret and can rationalize going into holy since I will be leveling with a warrior.  He gets whirlwind at 36, so I figured by then I want to be able to consecrate for aoe pulls, and heal a bit better.  My final plan is to go 13 Ret for SoC and runspeed.  Then go Holy for next 17 pts getting consecration, 12% healing, and imp wisdom.  Illumination is not very good while leveling since you have very low crit change.  Then finish off putting point into ret so I can be helpful in doing damage when heals are not needed.  I will do fillers in imp might and imp ret aura and skipping sanctity since I will be duo leveling and I want the warrior to be getting hit for rage.
---
oh wow how did i forget this one. i'll add it to the main list, since this is a classic
---
Of course they shouldn't WTF. Surely none of the streamers are even stupid enough to think this. 
---
You make a living playing the game, you have an army of little zoomers voluntarily toiling in the virtual sweatshop to farm gold and mats for you. You don't have to deal with a lot of the hardships everyone else does. 
---
This is the small price you pay. Don't like it? Play on a PvE server.
---
Couldn't agree more. I'm actually not going to play with my old peeps from back in the day because i know they will be hardcore and I just want to quest, loot and adventure. Starting from scratch.
---
Who is deciding the loot you get?
---
It's also not blizzards problem to care about the streamers viewership, it's the streamer's and Twitch's.
---
Oh sure- if you sign up for a PvP server you take the bad with the good. I can understand the frustration though- even if you’re expecting it it’s definitely one of those “aw come on” sorta deals haha
---
The item is also supper nutty until you get t2.5
---
i think someone found on the stress test or the beta that there seems to be a 5man limit on all dungeons other than UBRS now, not sure if this is true as not in beta to test
---
The only thing they'll allow you to copy &amp; spread freely.
---
It may be the melee leeway or the hitbox, both possible.
---
Multiple classes can global each other instantly with Naxx gear. Shamans are one of those.
---
All the videos easily seen on the internet showing shamans blowing everyone up should make that clear.
---
Stam has not nor ever will scale high enough to counter a late AQ and Naxx game. I ponder how this is a question with the existing LONG TERM evidence for it.
---
As someone who was an administrator on one of those servers for years, I sure hope not. The communities centered around these servers have always been horrible. They're worse with cliques and toxicity than retail is, and full of cringy custom lore/ERP. Moderating these communities to Blizzard standard sounds incredibly difficult. 
---
The server I was administrating had like 100-200 people at peak. And even with other administrators I found it to be a gargantuan undertaking that sucked a lot of my personal time away. We even had extremely liberal, offhand rules. Now imagine Blizzard's rules combined with thousands of people. They're going to need an absurd amount of GMs if they want to maintain any semblance of order.
---
Possibility aside, is it even a good idea?
---
Retail RP is great because it provides a structured world where no one can truly lord over someone else or dictate how their character progresses. Everything is connected and we share the same world. Not to mention things like RP during questing or such, which you can't realistically do on a GM server. 
---
Classic especially will be fun to RP in because the world isn't as jammed with quest NPCs, has a lot of open spaces, and you can't fly. There's more room to RP and there's a very high chance you'll encounter other RPers as you're doing things. I expect there will be way more world RP in Classic than BfA.
---
My question wasn't should I be a main tank,. my question is with limited time and cash flow can you realistically raid with the amount of gold and upkeep it takes to do so as a casual player
---
You can tell this was alpha/beta because of the random whisper being responded to with a polite useful answer.
---
Oh didnt think like that. Idk the numbers, will check em up
---
Yeah I learned about this in school. It’s mainly when a family member dies. But classic wow works too
---
Personally it was just I felt the "Time to kill" was perfect. Compared to Retail.
---
SS is really only good for PvP. It's too mana intensive to use between mobs.
---
Its a british term used to descibe someone who got expectantly became pregnanant, nothing wrong with my outlook
---
After reading, this is the first time in BfA I want to resub
---
Would be nice if they opened the beta up to more players willing to test stuff like this. Feels like things like this just fly under the radar.
---
**GLAMORAMA** **(Alliance EU - PVP) is recruiting!**
---
**Classic is coming! We are already over 80 people but 1 DPS Warr, 1 holy pala, 1 warlock and 1 holy priest**
---
Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!
---
We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to **clear all raid content**, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
**Our background:**
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
**What we offer:**
---
\-          Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and Thursdays at CET 20.00 -23.00
---
\-          Knowledgeable and experienced raid leading
---
\-          Balanced raid groups
---
\-          For those interested we will run 20-man PVE and PVP content on other days
---
**What we require of raiders:**
---
\-          Average attendance 1.5 times/week 40-man raids
---
\-          Suitable PVE spec, consumables and knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We **strongly** believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be **“geared and cleared”** of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are most welcome!
---
**Loot rules:** We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: *https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing*
---
**We look forward to your application. Contact us on discord** [**https://discord.gg/92V5CCD**](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD) **, send us a message or comment in the thread if you have any questions.**
---
**Sincerely,**

**Glamorama**
---
\&gt; So I only sell the good ones while vendoring the bad ones 
---
Personally, I always made an alt to lvl 5 and got him Enchanting, and would send all my vendor worthy BoE's to that toon, because you'd make a fair bit more with Enchant mats on AH than vendoring it.    Just my personal opinion though, no data to support this.
---
Signed up a week or so ago, fun group of people - seems like there's a good bit of experience among the team.  Excited for the future!
---
Thought it was 50?
---
We never wanted to get married origionally but decided after 11 years now was the time to do so
---
i like this. added.
---
no they cant
---
damn brits
---
not max rank, but usually pretty high. believe me, it works pretty well ;)
---
If they confirm or deny BC that would change which class many people choose to main.
---
TBC has 90%+ of the appeal that Classic has (vs retail) while also including the biggest/most important update and genuine QoL-without-overstepping changed.
---
WotLK at the end got sorta? Bad but like, more or less the change thing. It wasn't until after WotLK that WoW lost the intial appeal. Also, I think WotLK might be the expac where most of the millenials that layed the game actually started to be more hardcore/good/got to experience the game in full. (like me, I played off and on low levels in Vanilla and TBC but WotLK was def my heyday) 
---
I think TBC of the three, is the best overall choice. Though I would have a reallyreallly hard time NOT picking WotLK, if it was up to me and there could only be 1
---
POGGERS IN THE CHATTEUH
---
Priests can spam offensive dispell as well.
---
Absolutely! As others have said it does come off a bit dramatic but I genuinely feel like the suspense and drama is absolutely warranted with how disastrous the situation was and still is to a degree.
---
I wasn't asking if I could farm content or anything of the like, I was asking that with limited play time and the upkeep cost of rolling a tank is it even possible to make enough gold to cover the wipes,flasks ,potions ect
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
In wc 1 you cannot box your units. You have to shift click to control more than 1 unit at a time (a max of 4). In order to move your units you have to use the hotkey m then click. Same with gather and harvest (h).
---
WC 2 aged way better and you can control your units decently well.  Right click to gather and boxing units. 
---
I'm pretty sure blizzard invented fog of war.
---
They pass the time but WC 3 is probably fine by it's own.
---
I was a big fan of zero-sum DKP.
---
An item costs 40 points.  Anyone who wants it whispers the master looter, he checks the points totals and awards it to the person with the highest DKP.  You then take those 40 points and divide them among the other 39 players.
---
I felt that it rewarded people fairly, and (of course) the more bosses you saw downed, the more DKP you earned so it was loosely tied to attendance, but also to success.  We also used a single pool for multiple raid tiers (so you could farm DKP in MC and spend it in BWL) but higher tiers cost more (say, 60 points).  That helped us keep interest and full rosters in the farming raids.
---
Shards and other things like BoE and crafting mats went to the bank where they could be purchased though I don't really remember how we worked that with the zero-sum aspect.  We had an addon to parse the loot and a web app that would take that parse and update everyone's DKP but unfortunately I don't remember what any of it was.
---
Never played on private and not on beta.  But I remember pickpocketing a lot in vanilla and it was not very lucrative.  The silver you get is nominal.  What you really want are the lockboxes since they always contain a green.  Lockboxes dropped pretty regularly as well, way higher percentage then just looking a green for sure.
---
But will you find enough of them to make the whole thing super profitable?  I don't think so.  The gold is ok, like I said, not super profitable.  Plus, there was a 5%. 
---
Best place to pickpocket IMO isn't even an instance.  It would be in the western plague lands.  There is an level 55ish elite area in the mid northern section.  You should be able to pick off and solo a bunch of stuff after you pickpocket them.  Each mob gives 20 silver.  I used to farm this area on my warrior for about 25g per hour.
---
&gt; There are MANY FACTORS to consider while leveling, and thing is as a holy paladin you will find groups in a blink of an eye.
---
This isn't really true because really until 50-60 there's no reason to be holy spec as it doesn't help a group any more than being a ret pally in healing gear does.  Your group wont even realise you're holy other than if they notice your blessing of might is giving them less AP than that other paladin they had yesterday who healed just as well as you are but was deep ret.
---
&gt; You do not need to level solo
---
True, and if you are going to level 95%+ with at least 1 other person (who is also a dps class, ideally) then sure go for it.  It still doesn't really make much difference until 50+ though and it would be faster to be ret spec or hybrid ret/holy contributing to damage while equipping some +int items to keep the heals flowing.
---
&gt; The time spent by a DPS looking for a dungeon group also means "slower leveling". 
---
I mean you really should be questing / grinding while waiting for grps.  But lets assume you're not for some reason like you suggest, ok but why are you as a ret paladin joining groups as only dps?  You should be joining as Healer OR dps (or tank if you have the gear).  If you think people are waiting for holy paladins ot heal their group, again I mentioned that already, they're not.  Every deep ret paladin out there will be holding on to a set of healing gear to do dungeons because they're not stupid, being able to perform two roles is always going to be beneficial in group finding.
---
&gt; Just have fun mate.
---
And more power to you.  Just don't try and act like it's somehow not terrible, slow and ultimately a pointless waste of time to level as holy when you could be ret.  If you have fun by gimping yourself to make the game unnecessarily harder than that's great, you do you.
---
You may wish to add an "on time dkp bonus" for people in your raid and those who show up but are extra/uneeded aswell. encourages people to show up to ensure you have a nice full roster. Even if its 5 dkp. 
---
To prevent hording you may also want some decay.
---
Just to clarify, are we talking about same faction griefing or PvP stream sniping. I might've misinterpretted things here. 
---
In the case of same faction griefing, yes stream sniping should be punished as it is against the games ToS as far as I'm aware and already is punished regardless of whether the person is streaming.
---
If we're strictly talking horde parties corpse camping asmongold for 3 hours then ya have at it. That's the game.

Thick Leather and Rugged Leather will auction for more than they vendor for, guaranteed. In general you shouldn't wait to sell anything. Vendor or auction it right away. Prices will not rise significantly as time passes, and if they do it's generally only matching inflation. Only exception is a player who has no present need for gold but will need more later for consumables, in that case it's wise to invest in items that will be needed in later content patches like elemental earth for AQ.
---
Sweet glad you had fun. I have been hoping and praying for an official legacy server since the middle of Wrath. I played in the stress test both weeks and It was almost as awesome as logging in that first time in 2004. I spent more hours playing in the stress test than I have the past 6 months in BFA. I scared the crap out of my husband when I got to the character select screen and squealed, “omg female gnomes are cute again, no more ugly new models”.  I cannot wait til August 😊😊😊😊
---
Str is alright but it's better to stack agi for crit/dodge, and so you have a higher uptime on flurry procs, which is nice on a slower weapon, getting it to around 3.00 speed. Str is nice when you grab like 15+ on one piece of gear like scarlet leggings or executioners axe.
---
I'm not projecting, tis you, the fascist. 
---
Let's have a 30 minute video skype conversation, record and it let the internet judge who has a boring, generic personality. I'm a world class mothafucka, mothafucka. I bet you have an anxiety attack at the thought of even interacting with a person online in live/video form. Go back to the dungeon.
---
You'll have way more fun as a mage, warlock or shadowpriest in PvP
---
Yep. It's almost like Vanilla wow PVP is a team effort where every class brings something to the table :)
---
If YOU can believe THIS, I bought Warcraft : Orcs and Humans the week it released in 1994, and played it modem-to-modem against my friends. That was followed by Warcraft 2, which might be my favorite game of all time. The days upon days I spent creating custom scenarios for that one....anyways. Then Warcraft 3 released and of the three it felt the most polished and balanced (the success of Starcraft as a competitive game had Blizzard thinking more along those lines at this point). 
---
Okay, nostalgia trip over. To answer your questions :
---
Warcraft 1 has definitely not aged well. I bought it on GoG and played through it not long ago. Basically, it tells the story of the opening of the first Dark Portal, and there’s a mission where you go into Karazhan to kill Medivh that plays like an old-time dungeon crawl that’s pretty cool. You don’t really NEED to play through it, but watching a play through on YouTube or, if you’ve less time, reading through a wiki is definitely worth your while. 
---
Warcraft 2 received a couple facelifts, and is definitely not only playable, but still fun as hell. You’ll meet  several relevant lore characters from WoW’s history/lore (Deathwing,  Anduin Lothar, Cho’gall, Turalyon, Alleria, Khadgar, the original Gul’dan) and you’ll get to see Eastern Kingdoms pre-Lich King, and get a feel of what kind of places that Stromgarde, Alterac, Gilneas, Dalaran, Kul Tiras, and Lordaeron used to be. 
---
Warcraft 3 should really not need any explanation. It leads directly into WoW. 
---
I hope you enjoy these old games as much as I did, man. They’re truly some treasures and relics of a time that good companies didn’t need to say a game was a “love letter to our fans”. It was obvious and understood.
---
Sunken Temple was like WoW's version of Spinal Tap, where the band gets lost on their way to the stage. You keep backtracking and checking the map and somehow it seemed like you kept ending up in the same place over and over.
---
Seems fairly well structured to avoid loot drama. 
---
Is it only mounts/legendaries that will be handled by the council?
---
Also you can't do quests with more than 5 ppl
---
That is quite simple to explain really. All you need to do is remove an L and a G from Elling Trias and add a Y, R, O, N, N, and T to it, rearrange the letters and you name "Tyrion Lannister".
---
I think he meant enhance your beers
---
I dont know why im crying at the club right now
---
You've got the cast time on skinning wrong. Starts at 2 seconds, increases to 3:
---

---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10768/skinning
---
I loved TBC, but to this day Mt. Hyjal was one of the worst raiding experiences in WoW.
---
yeah they can
---
Shaman scale better than any other caster. Lightning Bolt is a 3.0 second base cast time spell, which means it scales with 85.7% of your spell power. That's the same as Frostbolt. However, with talents, the actual cast time of Lightning Bolt is 2.0 seconds, which means you can cast 20% more spells than a Mage using Frostbolt
---
They actually nerfed Shaman scaling in TBC because it was too good. By TBC, Lightning Bolt was 2.5s base cast time and 2.0s talented (71.4% scaling coefficient).
---
Google "how to talk to other factions in WoW".
---
There are certain phrases that bypass the faction language barrier (this is reportable btw but I've never been reported for it before). The phrases are different from alliance to horde and vice-versa, and even differ based on which language you're speaking (Common, Orcish, Gutterspeak, etc).
---
All Common -&gt; Orcish phrases can be used Gutterspeak -&gt; Common.
---
Because while you liked vanilla, other people liked BC, or WoTLK, or hell I loved MoP. You arent the only person with an opinion man.
---
&gt; Since you probably have 50+ people attending and 10+ have to sit, do they still get credit for hours?   
---
Yes. Standbys get equal hourly credit (in particular as it isn't their fault they aren't in the raid).   
---
&gt; How do you handle class specific items? Like rogues rolling on Hunter weapons?   
---
You don't make value judgements like deciding which weapons are for what classes and who it is the biggest upgrade for. That's just a rabbit hole of drama and favoritism.    
---
You do less. It might sound hard, but actually doing less is the easiest thing the world. If you "main spec"/"off spec" you aren't even making a value judgement there either, just asking that main set bids are used for future raids.     
---
As I said we did this for years. It was never a huge problem. Most people don't want to spend 1 point if it isn't an upgrade, and would prefer to wait until they can get it on discount/off-set. Plus occasionally people step aside based on discussion in their class chat, but that's voluntary and doesn't involve the raid leadership getting into the weeds of who gets what.
---
Haven't even released classic yet.
---
more per tick
---
FROM DA FUCKING NORTH CORNER
---
TO DE MIDDLE
---
ALL DA WEY INTO THE WELP CAVE
---
IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY IMAGINABLE
---
It's certainly bannable, but it doesn't have to be enforced. If Blizzard wanted to, they'd be in the right to ban him or at least suspend his account, but they decided to be merciful.
---
This I can agree with.
---
I do miss the old days of when we played games to have fun. Not meta game internet points.
---
69%
---
Combination of spell batching the player’s location at the time the cast went off, and the Tauren large hit box.  
---
The fact he’s on a gnome makes it appear even larger I think.
---
I believe Blood Fury only gives melee AP and not spell damage.
---
There will be no TBC and there shouldn't be.  It's called wow classic.  The people returning to play classic would leave if they added TBC at any point, myself included.
---
Interesting, I'm surprised there were so few mounts in classic. I guess mount collecting wasn't really a thing back then due to bag space.
---
Thanks for the info, good stuff!
---
your line is different from others'
---
Yup. I think some screenshots of the internal editor have been made public before, but it very much looks like an evolution of the WC3 editor. And obviously has been updated a lot through WoW's history.
---
Increases the amount per tick.
---
There is a discreet formula for it, but might be slightly different in the new classic build versus vanilla.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit
---
I hope you have a speedy recovery (and a painless insurance experience).
---
Thanks for sharing! :)
---
Works in a game sense too. Its exceedingly hard to kill a druid as another druid. Best to just nod and go about yalls business. Aint no one got time for a 90 minute pvp engagement.
---
If you are basing your experience on Retail classic. This will not be like retail classic. I have almost zero retail classic experience so I can't tell you for shit about whats correct in that. However by patch 1.12 the meta shakes out with the alliance being the better organized pvp faction because paladins are better then shamans for that.
---
Again to be clear. That is not me saying shamans are bad. It just that as most people who have premaded on private servers will tell you. The order of whose the best support goes. 
---
1. Paladin
---
2. Priest
---
3. Shaman
---
4. Druid.
---
That's not a controversial list. It's not based on me being an elite player either as I am an extremely good player but, not an elite one. It is however based on how the elite players order them. I would look some stuff up because, what I am saying is pretty well and excepted and in no way controversial.
---
As my boy Trump would say -- WROOOOOOOOOOOOONG.
---
Another notation.
---
*A regular weapon*  \-  *The Unstoppable Force*
---
Tbh any guilds going pure dkp aren't serious, so I think you are on a solid route with a hybrid solution. 
---
You might also want to consider a loot index, where items are grouped into viable MS loot segments so you gear main specs over off specs
---
Yeah I remember that too. Same thing happens if you're doing world quests in a raid group (even if that raid group is less than 5 people.)
---
If classic turns out well there's a very good chance they'll do BC and Wrath later.
---
So softcore raiding but with hardcore loot distribution. Sounds like it will be wonderful for you and awful for everyone else.

Large chunks of WC2 are non-canon and honestly I don't exactly love the gameplay. WC3 on the other hand - https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/a08qm8/warcraft_3_reign_of_chaos_still_holds_up_to_this/
---
My advice is just play WC3 and WC3: TFT, since the lore is still all considered canon and the game is a 10/10 masterpiece. WC3 basically built the foundation that WoW was able to stand on and the world-building of vanilla is largely rooted in what is established in WC3.
---
Agreed that the gnome makes it look crazier. 
---
I know cast start time can affect an ability landing if a person jumps but I've never seen it affect people who stay on the ground.

In WOTLK while leveling i found the spirit beast pet...Mid tame on him i suddenly took a GIANT chunk of damage and too my horror, watched as a random human mage named tupac killed me, and then the rare
---
it took me three weeks of flying circles around his spawn areas at max level  (which incidentally was right in the middle of a super popular mining path) to find it again :(
---
my rage for tupac the human mage knows no bounds
---
Great idea! I'm currently working on re-working the UI to include this and more options :)
---
I can’t wait to get killed by this guy and watch him eat my corpse.
---
I am the Altoholic too. Alts are drugs. If you have one...you need more
---
(not op, and not someone who had used the system in the past but will be using it in classic)  
---
If someone decides to bid on an item for shits and giggles or to stop someone else from getting it you have a different problem that no loot system will solve. At that point you don't have people who can trust one another and is that really a guild you want to be part of?(especially considering you are going to be putting hours and hours together raiding and farming)   
---
Same goes for collusion, if people want to be fuckers not much you can do realistically. Plan for the middle and deal with the problems as they arise imo.
---
Yes and no.

When I was 16 I finally convinced my parents that “Yes, it IS rude of me to ignore your request to join you for dinner, I should at least grab my plate before it gets cold. However, I feel it is even more rude to ask X other people to wait on me, since I cannot simply pause the game.”
---
Then my mother decided I needed a lesson in time management and wouldn’t let me play games til after dinner, which backfired when I offered to start cooking more.
---
It’s tricky, everyone has different living situations and different wants and needs throughout the day. This means that the rights and wrongs of group etiquette are a little more subjective, rather than simply stated and understood. The rudeness from the above example really began when the player joined the group knowing they might be called away to dinner (the lesson my mother was trying to teach me), however I think it would be equally rude of the players being delayed to direct any sort of vitriol toward the poor kid getting forced into a 15 minute break. We game when and how we can, and when we’re schoolchildren that means sneaking playtime in around family and other life obligations.
---
Shit happens, we’re all children, some of us have just been around a little longer. Life becomes much easier when you realize that you can more or less dictate your reality, and one of the biggest mistakes people make is judging others for how they choose to exist. Again, shit happens. Live YOUR life; worrying about the choices of others is often an excellent way to invite all sorts of unnecessary stress into your existence.

Neck: Barbed Thorn Necklace (blue BoE from Dire Maul).
---
Ring 1: Songstone of Ironforge (quest item)
---
Back: "of Nature's Wrath" random green item
---
Trinket 1: Briarwood Reed (UBRS)
---
Trinket 2: Royal Seal of Eldre'thalas (Shaman class trinket from Dire Maul)
---
Could last you the life of the game. All available by phase 2. The second ring slot is the only tough one - you might just use a healing ring unless you can get your hands on the Ring of Spell Power from MC.
---
Hogger raidz 4 lyfe
---
Fucking Payo
---
Lol. Yep that’s about right. Warriors are very gear/weapon dependent which is why I am leveling a lock first so she can go back and solo lower dungeons for warrior gear/weapons that will make leveling easier. My raiding warrior was an alt turned main and I a believe that will happen again 😂😂
---
As an endgame noob, why the T2 sets? Are they stronger/easier to obtain than T1 or T3 sets?
---
Nothing wrong with that my man, the was it was worded made it seem like you were only getting married because she got pregnant. Good to know I was wrong! :)
---
Yeah, that is correct. Normal quests cannot be completed in a raid group unless the quest states otherwise. Doing a 10 man in say, deadmines, would also yield less experience overall as well.
---
There is only 1 PvE and PvP server, last I saw.
---
Subs definitely tripled when they announced beta
---
I leveled my paladin as prot in vanilla. I think it was probably holy to consecrate, then prot to holy shield, then back to holy for illumination. I have read that I’m wrong, but it didn’t seem that much slower than ret to me? And I loved the feeling of e.g. AoE grinding STV gorillas. I don’t know.

Here’s a thread from 11 years ago that confirms it did indeed add spell damage.
---
Yes it has... And yes it will... And I'm not interested in where that quote is originated: it fits current wow so well so why not use it to describe it. The point is that the moment arena became a thing, and especially ranked, the whole thing became competitive to a whole new level and caused whinging. And because of that evergrowing whining devs changed the game slowly.
---
I don't mean arena is the sole reason why wow is what it is today but it's one of little things that eventually caused the downfall
---
they really do give beta to anyone with a stream dont they
---
Its not like he went Troll or something. Hardiness is really good too
---
any chance you may have swapped layers on death/rez?
---
Maybe it's just because I've done it so many times, but ST isn't one of the really one of the instances that I think you're prone to get lost in.
---
I think Gnomer, Ulda, and BRD are all worse.

Hi, /u/bigshortsfeet

If I ever pissed off an employee of blizzard ... this is karma.
---
\[NA\]\[Horde\]\[PvP/PvE\]
---
Hard Core Warlock with a really open Schedule looking for a hard core raiding guild that i can get a raid spot.
---
Also I have a small group of friends with a discord of about 4-5 people looking for more to Dungeon with, help each other out with random stuff, world pvp / battlegrounds with, and as well join a guild together
---
Looking for good personalities and people that are fun to be around but also play the game as hard as us
---
If you want to be a part of a small but knit close discord for premade dungeon groups etc and or want to talk to me about joining your guild Please add me on discord: Still#0196
---
Have you looked at blizzard stocks over the last 365 days? Blizzard need some good PR right now.
---
The things to focus on early is money for bags and mounts, and it will be easier at higher levels to grind those mats to toss on the AH.  
---
Having the money earlier rather than more money later will mean a few things:  
---
1. getting bags. Getting bags sooner means you'll be able to collect more greys and mats before hitting a vendor.  
---
2. getting class skills. Getting your important class skills earlier means quicker killing of mobs.  
---
3. getting your mount at 40. Having a mount means less travel time, which reduced your levelling time.  
---
All of the above means that you can hit your level cap sooner, and it's much easier to grind out mobs and mats at 60 than it is to hold on to those mats as you level.
---
The fire resist materials will come out the gate really hot.  They always sell well due to price of entry to molten core gear.  
---
After that EP mats and raid consumables for the future, weapon enchants, etc.
---
If you want to really make bank, get to farming Furlblog and get there fast, get the agility recipes at max rep and get Krol Blades as you farm that rep.
---
As the server ages the price of those enchants and items will go down, but the head start will be huge.
---
Your a dick. I spit protein shake all over my computer lol. I dunno why I thought it was gonna be an actual chart.

420 with realm name "Blaze it"
---
**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**TL;DR**:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm preparation now. 
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website [http://epochofthought.shivtr.com](http://epochofthought.shivtr.com)  
---
You can also jump on our discord at [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT
---
**Join us!**
---
Chance, too! He threw multiple fits.
---
So you're freaking out that a business saw a demand and moved to fill that demand? Really?
---
the catch is private servers are very successful, and there is an obvious market, people will play and they have some rough estimates
---
What? All of this is perfectly allowed.
---
I know I fucking hate it when people do this shit for some reason.  Like I played during vanilla and I didn’t do anything spectacular I only got to like level 50 but when someone comes in here who started in like fuckin mop and acts like they got rank 14 and even puts it in their profile description it pisses me off.
---
Go to STV and do the Big Game Hunter quest line.  the Gun from the reward is BIS.
---
Repeating, of course.
---
**&lt;Ascendance&gt;,** ***casual/Semi-Hardcore Raid guild \[PvP\].***
---
**Region**: EU
---
**Server**: TBA, PvP
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success.
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
**Raid Roster needs:**
---
* Hunter: Full
---
* Mage: Full
---
* Warlock: Full
---
* Priest: Full
---
* Rogue: Full
---
* Paladin: Open (healer)
---
* Warrior: Open (fury dps)
---
* Druid: Open (feral)
---
We still accept classes where we are full, but we cannot guarantee you a raid spot unless someone leaves. 
---
**What we expect**:
---
* You to play your class well and have knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
* We do not expect our members to spend exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid, but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions, bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM)
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)
---
We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it’s important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.
---
**You can find us at** [https://discord.gg/X3eXFue](https://discord.gg/X3eXFue)
---
Be aware that most content in our Discord is hidden for non-members. If you want to reach out to us, or just chat you are very welcome to drop by.
---
&gt; They always sell well due to price of entry to molten core gear.
---
Will that still be the case today?  On my first 60, I remember fire resist being all the rage.  But on my alts...I don't ever remember farming any?
---
Racials are literally the only reason to pick different races other than looks
---
Why should it be nerfed when every Horde is rolling Orc because they are still widely considered to be better? Just seems like an unnecessary Nerf to me. Kicking a poor cow while he's already down.
---
I think its a pretty well agreed on thing that when people cry about streamers, or more people not being in beta is normally cause they want an invite. Otherwise they wouldn't care enough to post a thread
---
It'd be enough that one alliance "guesses" the location.
---
Nice maths
---
Obviously, it will depend on your server.  In Vanilla (and through Wrath) I was a member of a medium sized guild (not large enough to raid on its own in 40 and 25 mans) but we could field 15-20 raiders.  We had a formalized raiding alliance with a half-dozen other small to medium sized guilds.  We had a unified leadership drawn from all the guilds, a charter, website, DKP, the whole 9 yards.
---
This let each guild in the alliance keep the feel and structure they wanted while giving them access to a consistent way to progress through end-game content.  Honestly, it was pretty cool and we developed a pretty tight knit community.
---
At our peak, we had 2 farm raids and a progression raid each week.  That got a lot of access for a LOT of people who would have otherwise been stuck trying to PuG in a weak PuG scene or leave the smaller guilds that they loved for other reasons.
---
I forget was mp/5 a stat in classic? I remember it in TBC but I'm not sure if it were a thing in classic as well.
---
Think of a nummer. The double it. Then forget that one because WE DONT KNOW! CHECK THE LIST OF THINGS WE DO KNOW FIRST
---
I think a guide on wowhead said it best- you go holy for the first 11 points then respec to ret when you start getting meaningful DPS increase and abilities.
---
I feel I might want to go this way however I will try to run as many dungeons as possible and stack on healing gear then go holy at about level 54-56 and start running Scholo, Strat, LBRS and UBRS as a healer until I hit 60.
---
Back in vanilla I still remember getting to 60 as a mage and I couldn't get into good groups right away because my gear sucked while my priest friend was already healing those dungeons since 55 and making important level 60 friends in big guilds as well as stacking up on gear on the go.
---
The issues with feral tanks was never threat gen so no this doesn't impact them, they won't be viable main tanks either way.
---
Oily Blackmouth was a premium one that I remember.  Any others in particular?
---
It's not easy to understand if it needs a private session to explain it (not even mentioning that these sessions usually end up as the loot council trying to convince the raider why he's wrong). You're not going to convince me that the comparison of several BiS lists across classes, attendance, preparation, and attitude is in any way simpler than a system that boils down to "you get points for being there and you spend points to get items". 
---
The system might be easy in theory, but the superficial simplicity distracts from the vastly more complex decision mechanism behind it. None of which is objective, by the way.
---
dont forget to shove shaman totem's up your ass while they are dueling
---
I'd give you a beta for this
---
There are specific enchants and patterns that drop of specific mobs in zones (not world drops, but on specific tables) that do exceedingly well on the AH.  
---
As others have mentioned, fr sets do well. Crusader enchant is a big one. Once you get to 60, doing runs of live strat for orbs are huge. Dreamfoil is a biggie.
---
I mean 33.3 and 30 is a lot when you do it as a fraction, 3/9 or 3/10
---
As far as relevant DPS stats, the Amulet of the Darkmoon is:
---
* 20 AP and 0.95% Crit for Warriors
---
* 29 AP and 0.66% Crit for Rogues
---
* 38 RAP and 0.36% Crit for Hunters
---
In comparison, the quest reward, Mark of Fordring, available from launch instead of at Phase 3 is:
---
* 26 AP and 1% Crit to All
---
At Pre-BIS, 1% Crit is worth ~23 AP to Rogues, ~35 RAP to Hunters, and ~20 AP to Warriors (I could only find one source on the last one, it might be more).
---
So the Mark of Fordring is 18% better for Warriors, 11% better for Rogues, and 21% better for Hunters
---
The Amulet of the Darkmoon does scale with % stat buffs and I don't feel like calculating those all out, but there aren't many of them and it's safe to say that Amulet of the Darkmoon is not pre-BIS.
---
if a blizz employee ever ran into this [situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAi0piyfPGU) I would gladly be their friend.
---
It's a buff for taurens. Also anyone rolling druid will have to be tauren :P
---
Too many duels, not enough warlocks.
---
Firefin snapper, and to an extent deviate fish
---
Swords.
---
There's lots of stuff that will sell well for every profession. Pick the profession you want to grind and look up the high-selling items for that profession. Check out Frostadamus video series on WoW professions for ideas on each one.

---
As I mentioned in another comment, this isn't how it's working in the Beta.
---
\&gt; "BFA may be a game for hardcore fans, but its not a hardcore game. 99% of it is super casual.
---
Classic wow, as compared to retail wow is much more hardcore in nearly every aspect."  
---
I understand what youre saying, but I think these days many games fall into the trap of becoming so casual, it alienates casual players.. ill explain. Lets use pokemon GO as an example. One of the simplest, most casual mobile games around. When it came out everyone was playing it. It was super simple, you just go out and catch pokemon irl. Everyone "got it" instantly. (more or less)  
---
But today? Now we have 15 different systems for catching up to long time players, raids, ex raids, pvp, weekly challenges etc. etc. Many of these systems are there specifically to help casual/new players keep up with hardcore fans. But what happens instead is the game is bloated and more complex, driving new players away. Constant events and new things.. it becomes harder and harder to get into, despite most of these things being added to help "casual" players.  
---
The same thing happened to WoW. In Vanilla you can hop on, do a couple of quests and log off happy. When I was 12 and began playing (end of vanilla/start of bc) I could only play 1 hour each day. House rules set by my parents, but even with 1 hour to play each day I could progress meaningfully each day. Every day I got further, and it felt great.   
---
If I started playing in BFA.. well first of all id probably quit before I even got to cap, because levelling is so god damn boring now, but moving on to the "actual game". I would probably try to do my emissary before anything else. That alone would probably be my hour, without getting to do anything else. But then I have warfront to do. I also have weekly quest. I have dailies to do.. I also want to do my daily BG for bonus points. And I want to do every mythic 0 before weekly reset. I also want to unlock dark iron dwarfs so I try to do as many world quests with 7th legion rep. I could go on..   
---
You see what im getting at? All these systems are in place to appearently help casual players keep up with hardcore fans. Bonuses everywhere for doing daily activities, but in the end I can only do so much, and I probably wont get any meaningful progress done. Compare that to vanilla where a couple of bars of XP was worth its weight in gold. If I was 12 and had 1 hour to play I know what game I would pick.
---
WC2's atmosphere and music were amazing. The story it tells is also awesome... but if you're playing it because you're a WoW fan, it is kind of an "alternate history" version of the Second War. They murdered my boy Lothar and yet WoW says he was killed in an "honorable duel" with Orgrim Doomhammer. You really have to enjoy the RTS gameplay to play through the entirety of WC2 given the fact that the lore is only a loose representation of what it looks like now, after all the retcons. 
---
Maybe I have to go back and give it another go, but I know personally I wasn't aching for it compared to WC3 (which still holds up in every way, and the lore has largely been respected by the WoW team).
---
!remindme 5 hours
---
Maybe people like when someone does something enterntaining and dislike when the same person does something that they don't enjoy.
---
Thinking something like "X person did something I don't like, I refuse to enjoy anything that involves him" is dumb
---
Do you do commissions?
---
Even 15% on a max rank SOTR is like 6-10 extra damage on hit, definitely not worth, especially early levels.
---
I go swords. You can do either. I think swords beats daggers at least until you can get the MC daggers. It probably comes down to individual player skill more than anything. Go daggers so you don’t take my brutality blade.
---
This is going to be required at the beginning.  Eventually gear power overtook the need of the fire resist.  This is old-school, that gear doesn't exist, there will be no bypass.
---
This in unreal.
---
Ok, sounds great! I usually play humans, occasional dwarf. I did the Nelf start once, ages ago, pre-Cata, so that’d be a total unknown to me. Any work fine though. I’ll log on and look once I’m able to sit down tonight. Thanks!
---
The many articles covering macros can explain it much better than a reddit comment. Am I going to have to press this guys hotkeys during raid too, or should people be expected to put in, idk, literally any effort on their part?

His name-calling is irrelevant to your point, and BC literally stands for Before Christ. I would assume he wrote it out as he did to make the sentence flow better, as it wasn't a specific date, but just prior to 0 BC/BCE.
---
I play both on Horde- and Alli-side, the ganking while playing Alliance is nothing close to severe as it is while playing Horde.  
---
I'm walking my levelroutes and the moment I step out of Barrens all I can line up for is Michael Jackson's Thriller.
---
Thats the problem though, you have 12 buttons and only 1 finger to press them. I feel like what makes or break a good keybind setup is the ability to press important abilities at the same time with different fingers (you dont have to choose one or the other)
---
Pretty sure it comes out December something. I think its gonna be the main blizzcon hype game this year.
---
And since you'll be Noggenfoggering or Savory Delighting your way through raids anyway, Racial Skills are the ONLY reason to pick different races.
---
&gt; appearently help casual players keep up with hardcore fans.  
---
The biggest failing of wow encapsulated into 9 words. 
---
Hardcore players being on a different plane was never a bad thing. Blizzards belief that it was, is the root cause of wows problems.

Swords are better (not by a crazy amount) but every raid has at least 1 dagger rogue. Up to you.
---
The burning epic 44ish axe? Found that while farming in Felwood. Sold it even though I was playing a warrior at the forefront on a brand new server. Also got both pieces of sulthraze but it was truly junk
---
I believe it dates back to the troll empire's war against the Qiraji, so thousands of years before wow takes place - although my knowledge of that far back in wow lore is admittedly rusty
---
Oh I'm sorry. I forgot this was the forum for tryhard mim-maxers and 60-rushers, and not the forum for people who want to just play the damn game.
---
Seriously now come on. Why would anyone spec enhancement and not *play as enhancement*?
---
I'm pretty sure blizz confirmed that the tauren and gnome sizes and hitboxes were correct between their 1.12 client and the beta. I think warstomp has the same range as a warrior's thunderclap which is based on the melee hitbox as the point of origin for the ability. In Grandpa MMO terms it's called a "PBAOE" or "point-blank Area of Effect."
---
Add some type of decay imo. I personally prefer Loot Council, but if you are going to do a mesh/mix, you want to try and cover the 'flaws' DKP systems have.
---
1. Dont do a /roll for tie bids unless both of the people with a tie have the same dkp. If a person wants an item and its up for DKP, they should have to spend more, not spend the same as others than /roll.
---
2. Add a decay mechanic. At the end of the raid after you have taken/given away all the DKP and its correct, everyone should get a 5 or 10 percent 'tax'. This promotes using the dkp you have and not hoarding it. People who hoard more and dont spend will see higher taxes.
---
3. Investigate how you reward and charge dkp. Looking at what you have Id create a more detailed reward system. +DKP for being in raid at start, +DKP for each boss kill, +DKP for every hour in raid, +DKP for staying until finish, +DKP to those who came with full consumables, etc. Possibly look into how you charge as well, setting a flat small amount of DKP for each item might not be ideal, you might look at setting items to certain dkp amounts (like rings cost 10 as starting bid, chest cost 50 as starting bid, etc). I've also seen DKP setups where you have to spend all of your dkp when you get an item and start back at zero, which might sound bad but its pretty good way of making sure items dont all go to the same few people.
---
4. Id recommend having more than a 3 man loot council, and I wouldn't make you part of it if you are doing priority holds on certain items for yourself. IMO Loot Council should be 5 officers from the guild that are not the Guild Leader.  
---
Sorry for long post. Just make sure you have a system that doesn't allow for abuse easily. IE: You have a main dps with you for 6 months raiding, you get a new raider who is starting out at zero---make sure the system doesn't make the new raider miss every single drop for weeks on end.
---
What's absolutely striking is that no one cared about the disaster of Chernobyl until HBO made a show about it. We should be teaching these things in school, like a high school science class. Instead we learn about history whenever HBO feels like making a new documentary. Failure of the American school system.
---
I'd have a set of class leaders as part of the council. Before you as an MT take an item, verify with the council. At a certain point, your raid progression is going to be hindered, and off-tanks will feel demoralized showing up to raids and not gearing up but incurring the same costs.
---
What about a realm that doesn’t have many people drop off? People talk as if every realm will drop off equally in pop. It’s possible there will be a realm that sees very little population change. So we have a 10k pop realm and a bunch of 3k pop realms? That 10k realm is going to have hellish q times.
---
Implying that everyone will be part of organized guilds.
---
Streamers already get special treatment. If they don't want to be stream sniped, put a delay on or don't stream.
---
Noice!
---
Those lockboxes, are they a good way to level up your lock picking as you level?
---
If they don't like it then don't stream.
---
Yep I need to stop thinking about it.. Praying for beta access is torture and its making the waiting go by slower just hanging out in this sub..
---
no it won't LOL
---
Focusing gearing up your MT is a smart move. The system is smart because it helps with the "trust" aspect of looting systems in game. You know these people from prior experiences so they won't shaft you. To me this is a great strength and will give a huge advantage to the success of any loot system. 
---
I would be wary of how outsiders take it however, it may be difficult to retain people outside of your friend group as they see the potential for "cliqueing". I've had this happen in guilds and reading your post it was the first thing I thought of. In my case there was around 10 people in a guild that included the Raid lead, and 4/5 spots on the loot council they were using as well as other officer spots. What it led to was these people getting ridiculous amount of gear. I mean no joke 75% of the drops went to these guys in one form or another. I stuck around for 4 raids and then gquit when I saw another guy who I'd been raiding with get kicked from the guild after he complained about the loot system lacking transparency. Obviously it sounds like your system isn't setting up this kind of situation, but I think a lot of players have had this experience in one form or another and it comes to mind when they see a guild made up of a large number of IRL friends. 
---
Maybe add a rotation to class/role leads so that the spots are constantly open to outsiders, giving people who aren't in your friend group some form of buy-in to the process so they don't feel disenfranchised and starved of loot. DKP is a great system because it is very equal and rewards consistency of play. I would look at an "upgrade over DKP" rule just to keep the gear trickling down to newer raiders and keeping more than just 40 people raid ready.  I've seen rotating role leaders based on last weeks DPS chart work fairly well, as long as those who are racking up the meters are good at communication. Just my two cents OP I think you've got a great system here and I wish your guild the best of luck :)

That's funny
---
It absolutely will if they don’t increase respawns rates. You might get 1 tag every couple minutes.
---
Dark runes.
---
Good to know. This sounds more fair than any system I've seen and still allows negotiations, such as between the aforementioned hunters and rogues. 
---
How does it handle bindings or other legendaries? 
---
How does it handle the main tank? 
---
Are there any other offspec conditions with warriors? I know there are at least going to be 4 or so warriors that are almost always fury but will want tanking gear for 4 horseman. Of course, they probably don't want to spend their points on that offspec gear when they've got each other and rogues in competition for the same weapons. Do those T2 pieces just get sharded or do some get given away for free?
---
Bringing up fury warriors again, they are one of few selections which won't really ever pursue tier gear. This means if you pick up every single phase BiS item as a fury warrior it's 28 items, as opposed to rogues 44 or so. Though no one will get all of them, this would still result in pretty much every fury warrior getting weapons before any rogue. How does this work or in the long run? Do you let the rogue that refuses to take a single Naxx upgrade prior to KT stick around? At what point do you refuse to shard T3 rogue gear or tell him he needs to get his damage up?
---
I know the answer for most of these is probably the simplest approach of bid or don't, but couldn't that slow things down overall, or even stunt growth against difficult content?
---
people like us that just want to test aren't free marketing like streamers are xD
---
I hope. I feel like that won’t be the case since blizzard expects a large population decline. They have layering and that makes me think small number of servers. Guess we have to wait and see but I want smaller populations too.
---
It's less about people afk is cities and more about world pvp. Some guy in full tier 3 transmogged into tier 0.5 to fuck with people etc..
---
just look what your guildmates are picking, you want both in the guild so u dont fight for drops as much
---
Hell yes
---
Tank upgrades. Only loot I would get. So me. 
---
I see how that could be viewed. I will have a prio list from each raid. If an item is not on that list it gets bid on for DKP and I won’t have an ability to pick it up unless it’s being dis-enchanted.
---
I mean the math is different depending on which source you view, I got my original numbers off Wikipedia. Some figures seem to not include the firefighters as a direct result since they came after it happened.
---
Either way, over the years thousands have died from chernobyl related issues.
---
That came in TBC.
---
Depending on your skill, yeah. It's often better just to find an area where boxes on the ground spawn and just make loops of that area until you've maxed the skill or they've all gone grey in my experience, but I pickpocketed probably every humanoid I came across back in the day and it helped.
---
This

Back in Vanilla this was great with my Alliance Rogue.  When I moved to the Horde side I made an equivalent one for Enhancement Shaman that I'm sure hasn't been touched in years (although someone added it to one of the WoW wiki sites.  I can't seem to find it now, but if I do I'll repost it.  
---
The added bonus is I was compared to Hitler by an angry player who said that my formula was wrong because it didn't take into account individual classes you'd be fighting and that he hoped I'd get cancer and die. Ah Vanilla, how I missed thee! ;)
---
They are pretty much the only way to up your lock picking.  That or be an engineer and build your own practice locks, but that a waste of mining materials.  Just remember to always pick pocket as your level up.  Otherwise, you won't be high enough to lock pick the higher level boxes.
---
I think it existed on a few items in Vanilla, but wasn't nearly abundant as it was in TBC. I also remember a few odd pieces of gear having Hp/5, like one of the trinkets from Ony or Nef. It's been many years, but I recall having a stupid set made up on my warrior back in the day with Hp/5 gear on it for some reason.

It does not add spelldamage in Vanilla.

---
Kind would like to see the classic team reach out to the old devs on what they were planning and maybe after a few years start adding it into classic. No level increase, no system changes, just more stuff to do that doesn't invalidate any previous content
---
2 options beyond start zone     
---
A) exploration / fedex    
---
B) group outside start zone and kill mobs
---
I think he meant enhance your queers
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
Please stop being so delusional, even diehard classic and nochanges fans acknowledge how ridicuolously easy vanilla was, your retort doesn’t even make sense.
---
Face reality mate.
---
Any vanilla mage shits on warriors. All they need is to keep rank 1 Frostbolt on their hotbar to kite them indefiinitely.
---
Not if you want to make a melee Mage. Don't let your memes be dreams! ;D
---
Honestly, until at least 2 months into Classic the AH isn't really going to be stable or accurate.  
---
Holding onto your gathering resources to sell later will be a good idea.
---
Otherwise anything that is BOE or a recipe, just hold onto it and check if others are selling it or if wowhead states its a good item. There are quite a few BOE drops that can net a good amount. Just remember classic wow wont allow people to save thousands and thousands of gold easily, and you may even be vendoring items that youd sell 3 months after the start of the expansion, since the silver it will give you will be needed for talents and bags.
---
Lol. In vanilla servers had a cap on around 10k players with 3.5k online at the same time.
---
With just Reddit subs that's 12 servers that are completely full, and it's quite obvious a lot of people don't use Reddit.
---
The forums (especially on us) are more active on classic than retail.
---
Even if it's just 40k players total it's still a success that bring in a lot of money for blizzard.
---
Your same faction sniping could be a /who. That's not stream sniping.
---
Honestly, you can't prove steam sniping in any respect and taking action against it will just get people playing the game banned for no reason.

---
\&gt; 5 DKP per boss kill. 10 bonus DKP for being in raid from first trash pull to finish. 20 DKP bonus for guild first kills on Ragnaros and any bosses after
---
OK cool, but you're definitely going to want to hand out DKP for wipes too, not just kills. Imagine you repeatedly get rag to &lt;10% but wipe all night without an actual kill. That'd be pretty demoralizing. If anything, raiders should get more DKP for wipes/progression than for kills.
---
Yeah only loot council items would be those and MT prio list.
---
&gt; but also will the hardware/datacenter bill.
---
Hosting costs are miniscule right now. Like 10% of your monthly sub goes to pay for that.

These are alternative leveling routes. If you plan on completing all the quests as if it were your first time playing, you might be in trouble.
---
If the mage doesn't hit the giant cow wielding a two hander with his frost nova.... Hit box or no You getting that nova. Being a tauren true believer because I'm a child in side and need to be the size of a house. I can tell you for sure. The amount of times you get that extra swing off on a dude while they running, is a huge positive.
---
Thank you for your input! More excited to play it when I get home from work! Hehe.
---
xd
---
Damn son. I hope I luck out and get a chromatic carapace this time around. Always wanted one in vanilla until I got the rank 13 chestpiece
---
i plan on tanking as it is my favorite thing to do. I also decided i should Guild lead then as well. So now id be Guild Lead, Raid Lead, and MT, with loot prio. It would come off as fishy which im hoping it doesnt, cuz if this wasnt the case, someone like MT could leave and then your guild is screwd
---
I have a similiar plan but id have DKP and it can go negative, but i automatically get everything from a list as well.
---
Much better in multiplayer than CoD2.
---
It's an exaggerated issue people create in their heads to complain about retail.
---
After MT is geared from the tier will the other ranks get priority first or will it go to a normal silent bid system for tank gear? 
---
Also... are you recruiting ahead of time by chance?
---
Blizzard's goal is to leave each realm with a stable ~3.5k concurrent players on one layer around Phase 2. 
---
We don't really know how many layers a realm will have or how many people will be on one layer, but it's same to assume the total online population for one realm at launch will be much higher than 3.5k.
---
If Blizzard guesses wrong about how many people play the game after Phase 2, we either keep Layering, have long queue times to get into the server, or possibly permanently split realms.
---
Yep, that’s 15 years worth of content right there, easy.
---
I was going to say this. Back in vanilla when I raided, invites started at 7:30 and stopped at 8... at 8 PM everyone \*in\* raid (not just online) got a bonus "on time" DKP.  Then invites continued after that was captured until we were ready to do first pull.
---
Especially if items start at 5 DKP, and you get 5 from just being on-time.. would hate to have someone keep out-bidding you because you're late all the time.
---
That's sort of in the ballpark of what I would do, except I'd take Master of Deception over either of the tier 2 subtlety ranks... Being able to cut corners closer without aggroing is usually faster than being able to run faster while stealthed, in my opinion. Also, for whatever reason they have Hemo instead of Prep, that's completely wrong. Hemo daggers is even worse than Hemo swords.
---
The order you take the talent points is kind of up to you. The whole point of this build is to get by with crappy gear. So instead of going combat, which is all about going toe-to-toe and doing what you can to mitigate the damage you take, you rely on big hits between stealth and stunlocks. 
---
The nice thing about this is that the build more or less works without the 21-point talents, so you don't necessarily want to bee-line down Assassination or Subtlety as you level up. IIRC I took Master of Deception first, then Improved Eviscerate, then Improved Gouge.
---
Playing 21/8/22 at level 60 was more of a thing earlier on in vanilla, it was great for running instances all the way up to UBRS, and in a casual guild you could get by in MC with it... And at the same time it was great for BGs. Later on, as rogues got more geared, Seal Fate and combat builds got better.
---

---
My guess is that they would rework items and creature health/damage. One of the biggest things IMO that made TBC really soulcrushing was people replacing T3 with lv62 green items and being immediately on par stat-wise with everyone else.
---
I think scaling properly and leaving daily quests out of the game are the best things they could do.
---
Depends on the market but most likely yes. The problem with being a tank in your situation is wether or not you will be consistent with raiding. Having a tank that doesn't show up is going to be a pain in the ass for any guild and not worth investing into. I would suggest doing dps instead since you aren't such a heavy piece of the puzzle then. But 2-3 hours a night should be enough to farm for consumes and repairs.
---
What Dafran did was atk the nearby alliance with a raid of mages he formed. That was at the start, before the entire duel tourney even happened. What Trollgodx and Trollgody did was from the very beginning of the actual tourney to the time they were banned. Approx 6 hours. And Staysafe is defending the trolls/what they did and placing blame on the horde players. Wow.
---
Don't be an asshole in this sub. We're all on the same team, this should be an asshole free zone
---
Lol this isn't /writingprompts
---
Gnomer is like a small city so definitely one of the tougher ones, but I agree, I’ve done ULDA so many times (unfortunately) that I can run through it no problem
---
Why awful for everyone else? Can only see conflict with other tanks.
---
It absolutely can be I'm just saying thats bannable regsrdless and that I agree with everyone else for PvP ragging.
---
Depends, sometimes a run in classic runs a LONG time (looking at your BRD) and you wipe a few times etc so if they REALLY have to go I never really minded, especially if they're kids.
---
Mount Hyjal was easy. While annoying that you couldn't speed the raid up it was so easy that you didn't have to pay much attention.
---
That's a fair point, but if you manage to be a dedicated OT or even MT of your guild (a boy can dream) as a Druid tank, then you could make a strong argument for speccing full bear. Even then, HotW still makes you a very formidable tank and formidable healer in endgame content ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g) )  
---
I have to disagree on the cat+bear versus full bear, though. Assuming this build:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZtx0sfddtV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZtx0sfddtV) You're only losing out on 15% bonus damage to ferocious bite (pure cat) and some incidental armor (if I recall correctly, thick hide is not multiplicative with your bear form scaling... it only gives you a flat increase to your caster form armor, just like a green armor value on an item versus a white), as well as a 100% guaranteed chance for 5 additional rage on every crit (bears are rarely rage starved). So the difference between pure cat and pure bear, while significant, is not so significant that you couldn't be like a fury warrior, outputting more than sufficient dps and also being a very, very capable tank.  
---
I may not be understanding you correctly, though.
---
Every xpac had warts, but to ignore it's best features is just short sighted and/or ignorant.
---
Vanilla was great, but TBC and Wotlk were the true golden age of WoW. Don't @
---
I didn't really care for ST much. Loved doing it on my Dragonscale LWer though. Every run made me a ton of money so that alone made it worth it. My other toons didn't really see much benefit.
---
The layout was neat though and lots of dungeon events. I would rank it fairly low on the end game dungeons though of Vanilla. Undead Strat or Scholo being my favourites with BRD also high on that list. UBRS also up there though not sure it really counts being as it was a 10 man (as was school initially I believe).
---
No blizzard should do nothing to stop stream snipers. Streamers get a ton of stuff handed to them. You don't see them whining about the benefits. Live by the stream, die by the stream.
---
Or the large realm will just keep Layering. Or offer free realm transfers.
---
scouts for tanking raids? not gonna do much. when rogues pop up to gank duelists while they’re at 15% you’ll see why this wouldnt work.
---
*laughs in priest and shaman*
---
Oh I may be
---
Sorry, nothing beats the ZG fists for tigerform meme power. Meow.
---
I’d rather have the more info. Thanks for the input
---
I just remembered running all around that dungeon for everyone’s quests lol
---
Or you just get banned and you're not sure why. Then you try to appeal and they tell you stream sniping someone you've never heard of before, streaming on a platform you don't utilize or have an account with. Any attempt to enforce stream sniping will just get random people banned for playing the game regularly.
---
It would also be abused, as I can accuse you of stream sniping me on my 1 viewer channel. You're guilty until proven innocent. Now go prove you didn't do something while I flag the next 10 people that gank me.
---
Idk. Try on the PC if you're on mobile
---
I ran sunken temple so many times we had a warrior who dual wielded the epic swords.
---
I've seen "but every raid has at least 1 dagger rogue" a few times, why is this? The raids just need one rogue to take the dagger drops so that swords aren't as contested?
---
I can't believe they wouldn't just roll on PvE servers.
---
I think this is an improvement that should be included in Classic. There are plenty of horror stories of Guild Masters straight up emptying the gbank and server transferring (Was even worse during Vanilla). I feel like Blizzard would rather use guild banks rather than dealing with the aftermath of support tickets and complaints when someone decides to screw over the entire guild, than try and appease the no-changes crowd.
---
They are already using the better mail system, so this is just another QoL improvement where there is a very good chance they will implement and make more sense. This is nothing like Transmog, reforging, ect. Its a system that is already tried and true and better than the alternative of no guild banks.
---
Remember, they will not have nearly as many employees to deal with support tickets and forum posts for classic as they do for retail.
---
All you do is speak in hyperbole.
---
I wouldnt be surprised if they taught it in university. What went wrong in chernobyl involves a lot of more advanced nuclear physics concepts that dont get introduced until first/second year science classes. 
---
As for the history part, that should absolutely be taught in high school, since it gives really good insight to how people live and act in the soviet union.
---
The ambient sounds when going into Undercity (Lordaeron) just after the courtyard you can faintly hear the sounds of the day Arthas betrayed the Kingdom.    With everything low and Ambient sounds up full, you can hear echo's of the now fallen bell ringing overhead, as you step further inside you can hear the ghostly crowd cheering welcomes to Arthas, and standing in the throne room you'll find the echoes of the final confrontation between father and son. 
---
To this day, every single time I walk into Undercity I stop to listen to this.
---
There are some problems though. It is almost an arms race, right? Cause if you are same faction griefing me, there isnt much I can do but to shame you and grief you back.   
---
There is no way to confirm a bounty (like an ear) if I were to put one on a griefer through /2 or the forums. "100g a kill, 10 kill minimum on xxlegolasxx."
---
There is no way to embargo griefers--or people I dont like--from purchasing my goods for sale on the AH. To punish them, I have to pull my goods off the AH and sell through trade.
---
There is no way to go same faction hostile so I can kill the fucker. At least if he can toggle hostile to me, I can treat him no different than the opposite faction. Cross faction "griefing" is just pvp. 
---
The only thing I can do, is just exclude the guy from my formed groups. Which is a no brainer anyhow as odds are he wouldnt want to be a part of my group anyhow.
---
Dick bags and assholes in real life have real concerns they need to manage. A white guy probably wouldnt go to the Bronx and scream N\*(&amp;r at everyone he sees. But what stops him from doing so online? 
---
Most people struggle to systematically rip off old ladies who are barely thinking, it goes against their conscious, thats why so few people abuse them--relative to the entire population. Yet online, killing those who cant defend themselves is pretty common. 
---
I don't know the solution, but what is certainly most frustrating is people on your own faction griefing you and there is nothing you can apparently do about it.
---
When I ran my guild on a vanilla private server if something like that happened we’d give it to the class that needed it more. And depending on how out of hand the one of a kind classes get with dkp we would increase their minimum.
---
Would be shitty when each time a item of gear only 1 person could use and would spend the minimum then had way more than the average member to be able to bid on items that were more universal between classes
---
Of course you can but a main tank with more time will simply be better for the guild. Regardless of skill.
---
&gt; If this was a live server, everybody would eventually know who they were and when your name turns to shit like that,
---
No they wouldn't have, because they were trolling on level 1 alts made specifically for trolling purposes. They weren't using their lv.30 mains. 
---
And I agree with the above, I would have banned their entire account.
---
Oh it may be lol.
---
I just remembered running all over that dungeon for everyone’s quests lol
---
I got bored around lvl 27/28 the first time with a fresh breeze at 30 in stv. Then again around 45 to 47 (i don't like Tanaris), just grinding levels in Aszhara and Jadenar, until I can make it to Winterspring to grind the remaining levels out (i don't like Plaguelands neither)..
---
Juist in my humble experience..
---
Clearly you’re retarded if you think he did anything extra special above what anyone else does when they pvp on warlock in vanilla.
---
But he did fuck up in ways only noobs fuck up. Lmao.
---
I don't want them to remake any other expansions other than classic. I want to play vanilla as it was, and I want them to make retail good again, and worth playing.
---
I agree with /u/Pull_The_Curtain - In vanilla/classic Blood Fury only affected melee damage. Not spell damage or ranged. The links you posted are from the TBC era.
---
MadSeasonShow notes this on his Horde race picking guide :
---
https://youtu.be/wnZQzO9h-ek?t=109
---
let's not kid ourselves though. The chaos:exalt ratio is also highly influenced by when the bots are set up, and when there's a banwave. And market hype whenever /r/pathofexile is spammed with new posts about bot banwaves.
---
The PoE economy is volatile and highly influenced by emotions. I love it! But it's also a major reason why I don't touch standard. PoE without the chaotic market (pun not intended) is just not PoE to me
---
I’m going to have a Prio list for each boss. If it’s not on that list it goes to DKP bid.
---
If you want to be a raid tank then no. Casual is not an option. All the people in here telling you that casual guilds will accept you. Are completely blowing past that casual guilds move through raids and content at a glaciers pace. If you wanna be casual I would highly recommend a new class. No one is going to want the lynch pin of their raid constantly calling it.
---
In retail your equipment can't get broken(yellow, red) anymore? Really? I quit when they changed the talnt trees.
---
I honestly don’t remember. I was 27 back then. Now I am 41 and getting senile. I’m sorry.
---
The thing is, we don’t know how long it will take to make
---
It will very likely take less time than making classic, but still if they want to release it around 2 years after classic release, then they might have to start thinking about it now. Not decide on it, but at least think about it
---
Like if they want to realise it 2 years after classic release, and TBC takes 1.5 year to make, then they have to be ready to make it half a year after classic release
---
These are just made up timeframes, but the point is, since we don’t know when the decision has to be made, we don’t know when it’s too early to talk about it
---
Oh - is the sitting for reckoning procs not a thing in Classic? That's too bad. That was literally my plan to level past 30... damn it.
---
I always used it for awhile, started feeling bad, then finished the quest chain
---
&gt;This is an amazing idea and I hope it grows in popularity.
---
Uh yes it is. Asmon even brought this up today. If someone is griefing you, ask them to stop, and they don't - report them and talk to a GM about it (this was all told to him from a GM). Ofc its situation-by-situation but depending on what happens or how severe, yes it is bannable. As in this case, trollgody and trollgodx were both doing it for HOURS. Trollgodx was doing it for approx 5-6 hours.
---
nah
---
Because these are creative and often lead to player death. There's nothing creative or funny about just blocking someones view.
---
I leveled 3 Warriors on Nost and Ely and decided enough is enough. I rolled a Warlock in the Beta and will do the same at Release.
---
Leave 1 stone on the 2nd hit of every mining node, stealing the skill up and most of the ore, withoutnrisking despawn
---
Pinch every penny until you get your Epic mount post 60. Anything before then, fuck em.
---
time to learn how to hamstring kite
---
Well it's got stam so it's got that going for it, which is nice
---
Blizzard's goal is to eventually convert every Classic player over to Retail. Why? Microtransactions, which make up over half their revenue.
---
That's why they added Classic as a bonus freebie in with a Retail subscription instead of it's own subscription. They're looking for Classic to make money, but not in the way you think.
---
I'm proposing that when they originally designed the weapon, the design was intentional. My point being that the fact that they went out of their way to design a 'companion' weapon which dropped from a related troll raid, and shared that design. If Zin'Rokh was originally designed incorrectly it would have been at this point that they fix it, and they would have designed Jin'Rokh the other way round. The fact that they designed Jin'Rokh the same way as the original Zin'Rokh means that they knew of the orientation, and decided to keep it and in fact create a new weapon with the same orientation.
---
However, in Cata, when they re-added the weapon as part of Archaeology, a decision was made to flip the weapon - probably by someone who thought it was a mistake/bug who wasn't involved in the design of the original weapon or aware of the 'companion' weapons which were designed with the same orientation.
---
... yes?  It objectively is still summer for the northern hemisphere.  The season isn't determined by what the weather is doing, otherwise we'd have every season every month here...
---
Very powerful stuff. Agreed.
---
The ol' Crescent Staff. Great work!
---
Back to r/wow you BFAtard
---
For warrior at least, in phase 1 fury preraid it lists Lionheart helm, which is going to be impossible to get until the pattern drops from a raid boss. After it becomes available it's bis, but this isn't realistic for pre-raid gear.
---
For tank it seems to be overvaluing defense at the expense of threat. Threat generation of a tank wearing the recommended gear here will be shit. The only item it recommends with +hit until phase 5 is satyr's bow. Ideally you should be looking for threat from item slots like cloak, ring, neck, trinkets, ranged weapon, and wrist for most encounters. The stats on overlords embrace are wrong. This item has bonus armor on it which is not shown on this site, which is the only thing that makes it arguably better than redoubt cloak (1% block for a warrior is literally worthless vs a single target). Also, wtf no thunderfury?
---
Blood fury does nothing for warlocks
---
How so? Aren’t they allowed to reroll class?
---
Yes it is. It wasn't for 10-15m either. The dude was there for more than a few hours and even showed up to the 2nd spot they moved to. Disgusting, hope the dude got dealt with/beta revoked. He is a stain on the representation of the wow community.
---
Someone posted this elsewhere but to quickly train skinning when starting in valley of trials, jump over the wall where the earth totem quest is and swim to ratchet. You already know Org FP by default so you can fly there and hearth back to valley of trials.
---
&gt; Holding onto your gathering resources to sell later will be a good idea.
---
Well yeah, that's why I'm asking lol.  Space will be at a premium, so can't save everything.
---
Hello!
---
I am looking for a semi-hardcore raiding guild that wants to progress through end-game content, but not necessarily push for any world or server firsts.  My biggest focus is finding a laid-back guild that wants to progress but have fun while doing so.  I am a new father with a full time job and can't put in multiple hours a day, but should have no problem making raids (barring an occasional miss here and there).  Below are some details regarding my preferences / availability:
---
Intended Region: NA
---
Intended Server Type: PVP / PVE
---
Intended Faction: Alliance
---
Intended Raid Times: Su/M/Tu/W/Th should all be available days for me, but I'm looking for a guild to raid 2-3 days per week.  Starting times between 8-10 EST would work, but I would prefer 8:30 or 9:00 EST.  I should be available most F/Sa as well, but wouldn't be able to make those as consistently as the other 5 days (out of town fairly often visiting family on weekends).
---
I'm leaning towards (dwarf) priest right now, but am still considering a pally / druid.  I am 100% looking to heal.
---
Preferred Contact: Can either be via DM on Reddit or Discord (Bosshog51#3563).
---
Please stop giving this man attention and read up a bit, you blind fanboy brainlord.
---
maybe griefers getting hate isn't such a bad thing :D
---
I’m in the same boat as you. Skinning and mining till ~mid 50’s as soon as I can start skinning heavy leather I will be saving it. 
---
Reason being is Throrium Brotherhood rep requires 1200 heavy skins. I’m going to play my part in funneling heavy skins to a guildie for faster nightfall/fire resistance gear.
---
I think as a warrior come level 60 you’ve got plenty of options for gold farming for epic mount. 
---
Especially those willing to tank.
---
Two Blizzard solutions:
---
1) Involve a GM and have them port the contestants to a non-accessible area. Port out anyone who interferes with the tournament.
---
2) Add a 40-man raid zone (stormwind player housing portal?) that is just an empty zone and allows duels inside the raid group. This has some minor game impacts in common with player housing such as pulling players out of the contiguous world, but might be worth it.
---
Also can put it this way.
---
* More DPS in threat/DPS gear
---
* More tanky in def gear
---
* More utility (Anni, Nightfall, Sunders)
---
* Larger toolkit (DW, Reck, Last Stand, Mocking Blow)
---
* Maybe slightly more threat because it's multiplicative
---
Looks shitty for druids, right? And now the threat cap drops by about 10%. Every little bit of threat now counts, especially on Horde. So the tables turn.
---
I personally wasnt spoiled but I think butting a spoiler tag in the title and not spoiling it directly in the title takes zero effort and should be the norm
---
Its your opinion that it is a better game than live.  That is subjective. 
---
IMO I don't miss vanilla and don't think its a better game than live.  Its a different game from live.  There are things about it better than live and vice versa.
---
However, and again this is subjective I understand, but IMO TBC and WotLK where substantially better than vanilla. PVP was better balanced and rewarded skill more so than vanilla.  Raids were better designed and balanced with a wider variety of mechanics, locations, designs, etc. 
---
They increased the amount of content available with keeping dungeons semi relevant through heroic mode, had better designed zones, world pvp objectives, faction balancing (through the addition of shaman to alliance and paladins to horde. This was huge for raid balancing), arenas for rated pvp, additional battlegrounds, etc. 
---
They weren't perfect for everyone - and I'm sure there are some people which don't like them - but, in my opinion, they are better than vanilla.  As a summary, they balanced the grind for reward and made it more approachable for people to get involved in a bunch of things.
---
I'm sure people here disagree with this sentiment because this is /r/classicwow , but I think classic is more nostalgia than not.  There are some things I liked about classic - the connections made, the initial wonder at the world, the people, the fact that your reputation matters, etc.  But I can't recapture several of these.  
---
I won't have the same wonder at the world.  I wont get the same sense of achievement of (re)clearing the raids that I did the first time.  I flat out don't have the time to do what I did in classic - be in a top end guild / pvp grind. 
---
All that said, I hope that classic wow succeeds because of several reasons. First and foremost, though people may play different versions (retail vs Classic) the way to keep the game supported is to keep subs going.  We all obviously care about the game in some form.  So it is silly to wish anything other than success as it does support me.  
---
Secondly, if Classic succeeds then it opens up opportunities for other Legacy servers which is what I would want.  I enjoyed TBC / WotLK arenas the most.  I would be ecstatic if I could go back and play those.  I still keep in contact with my arena partners, and went to one's wedding.  We would get back together and play this again and I would love it.  It is partially nostalgia - yes I agree but, in my opinion, it was a better / healthier game.
---
Of course he didn't, god forgive Blizzard loses a sub nowadays.
---
Uhhh no, there's still almost another month of summer after that.
---
Just because your "summer break" is over and you go back to school doesn't mean the season is finished.
---
Well I don’t see my Beta/stress test on my battle net anymore... can’t imagine getting invited to the official Beta.... Sad 🐼
---
not sure what you're seeing, this place is mild compared to much of reddit
---
How is the talents buffed compared tocbefore?
---
You should LC Hakkar and Jindo loot as it's BiS for casters until AQ40 (which means that for some of your casters it's the best they may ever realistically get).
---
From the perspective of mages and warlocks, you really don't want Touch of Chaos or Cloak of Consumption going to someone who isn't going to show up for 40man progression. Don't freeroll those.
---
Nah, not in the Alpha. I would just be a lot more hyped for its release, if it wasnt for Classic, and the pay to win mechanics.
---
loved Diablo/Torchlight I &amp; II
---
but they fucked D3 and it looks like theyre gonna fuck Frontiers
---
We may look at a larger loot council. My guild in vanilla had a class lead from every class and then the raid lead was the final vote for Legendarys. All other loot was DKP.
---
Lol you cant tame that beast brother, just like the song saids “ Haters gonna hate hate”. There always will be drama as long there is a place to have it.
---
No game rules forever, my son.
---
Myself and 5 friends are resubbing for Classic.
---
Sunken temple is one of my favorites. Such an interesting and well thought out dungeon. I can't remember the name of the sword but there is a sword that drops there that has a chance of spawning a little welpling to fight with you and it wasnt BIS or anything but damn did i love that little welpling lol
---
Big problem is a lot of post are post that have been said a million times. I don’t disagree with you on people being dickheads but when the thousandth post of “TBC should be next” comes around you kinda get irritated.
---
Once the game is out for everyone then the community will have the ability to thrive more.
---
We never had that problem. We were raiding with the casual 3-4 times a week for 4hrs, but at a more serious level (not hardcore), and everyone was trying their best and wanted others to succeed. There were a couple times when the winner would ask who was second and if that person needed the upgrade more they would let the second bidder win the item. We had a very good team, and that is the system that worked perfect for us.
---
I might be shooting myself n the foot for even atemlting Hunter with my motorskill disabilities, but I DO think I can be at least above avg if I take the time and Im smart about a class I really wanna be invested in. Mages are just gonna be so completely overwhelming rolled, shamans way too complex with buttons, locks too in pvp. And horde cant be pallies. Priest kinda need an alt for farming at least. So here I am ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt; just when people get back to school/work
---
Serious question here:  do you actually take the whole summer off?  I worked through the summer since I was sixteen, and since I grew up and got a real job, a two month break every year is completely out of the question.  Are you just like independently wealthy or something?
---
You scared?
---
So people only get gear based on their attendance? Pass. More than just showing up should go into who gets what gear. 
---
Loot council&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Even PvP it's very meh sometimes.  Specing into Nature's Focus on my Druid never feels worth it.  Even as deep resto.
---
Hard core PvPers tend to regard RP'ers as fodder, so many of them love to target RPPVP servers for some easy kills.
---
Rotation: When you can stand still in PvP, you use the standard PvE rotation typically starting with aimshot to maximize your burst damage.  When you're moving in PvP use arcane shot and find times to pause while kiting for auto shot and multi shot.
---
On progression nights I could see bumping the First pull to finish bonus higher to recon with that problem.
---
You'd probably want to make a priority for your main tank aswell, also I'd say 6 points could be far too low, people would very easily go weeks without any raid gear they need dropping, if that happens you would realistically have multiple people rolling with full points, which kinda makes the whole system pointless.
---
Good question. We quit after Ywain's population collapsed to the point where there was no action in Molvik anymore, and precious little in the Frontier. Haven't been back because there is no F2P or even limited trial option like WoW has, and I don't want to commit to a game that may or may not still be any good without at least test driving it first.
---
Imagine being in a streamers community lul
---
If daggers drop, might as well respec and use it
---
Stick with us brother!
---
Not if you play on the right one
---
It’s called world of WARcraft. Not world of TIGHT KNITcraft
---
Imagine thinking classic will somehow be different from other games these days. It's gonna just as toxic as any other game in 2019.
---
I usually only bind spells with cooldowns (or the GCD) on my mouse anyway, so that's not an issue.
---
Yeah I would gladly take one for the team and be the dagger rogue, they’re much better for PvP
---
Yeah, that 100 HP is really gonna make a difference in comparison to a large damage boost. /s
---
To be fair most of the big streamers are horde.
---
Not that it's the streamer's fault, but it's attention seeking viewers who were the wants wanting to ruin it.
---
To be clear, those are junkboxes, the things that contain junk, that you pickpocket from mobs. 
---
If classicdb.ch is to be believed, It's not even clear to me that it's POSSIBLE to pickpocket a lockbox (the ones that have high value items and are worth asking a rogue to open for you). 
---
Junkboxes, on the other hand, start showing up around level 21ish and are what you do to level your lockpicking skill. But have little if anything of real value.
---
what were you farming?
---
I'm not in school... but since you brought it up there's another reason it's bad it's releasing so late.  You'd get a LOT of kiddos subbing and playing a lot inflating numbers over the summer.  Instead Blizz is going to see a drop a month after launch.  Good business sense.
---
PS try not to be so toxic as you will get reported at some point.
---
The most drama here is when people repost and ask questions that have been asked tens of times already. They don't use the search function.
---
Other than that, we're pretty tame tbh.
---
They will never get any of the decent AOE spots to themselves on release or in the weeks after it.
---
Mage will be my second character (if I ever make one) by which point I’m hoping it will have calmed down.
---
Songstone of IRONFORGE...
---
Shaman...
---
Thinking....
---
Where's the video from the druid's perspective?  It'd be interesting to compare placement of players between the two videos
---
One word.
---
Lifebloom.
---
Swords are better by miles if played correctly
---
Also it works better if you have separate DKP pools for farm and progression. It's lame when someone who shows up for every farm raid but no progression raids glides into the raid that just made it to farm status and scoops a ton of upgrades with DKP they pooled from easier raids.
---
Hey, I just thought I would let you know that the google docs application link seems to be broken.
---
When have they ever taken action against a player standing on totems or disrupting duels by standing inside the duel area?
---
Players do not have and should never have the power to have another player removed or banned from the open world because someone else have "claimed" an area for a community event. That is simply ridiculous.
---
They didn't intervene last night, they won't intervene the next time and they won't intervene on live Classic and they're right in not doing it.
---
Either add dedicated servers or instanced area or some other solution to combat an issue that wasn't present in the original game or stay out of it and let the players deal with it.
---
Google it. Pretty drastic.
---
There, there, come and sit down M. Icosiol. The Raid leader can't hurt you anymore have some hot water.
---
I just want to add that people like MN (Monkeynews) have said time and time again, these retail people are good for a reason and while it might take some time to adapt to Vanilla, there's no doubt they'll show up as strong contenders for about anything PvP related. This is just to tell people that there's plenty of people, including people from APES, who's giving them the praise they deserve.
---
Okay calm down, his comment was amusing.
---
I think the opposite, that designing the world with flying in mind ruined it as opposed to helped it. 
---
Flying is just so out of place, and detrimental to that "classic" experience. 
---
"Huge and meaty" is hardly true, it was more like "Annoyingly huge with mob placement as an afterthought" particularly for wrath. It just felt like they were trying to out do what they already got right in classic. This is \*just\* commenting on the questing and world experience for those expansions.
---
How they handled the expansions as a whole was badly designed, it wasn't future proofed. Keep adding 10 more levels and making old content a pointless chore was an obvious oversight when making the system. Even when you disregard the other negative or positive changes, the core expansion system was doomed to decline, at least, the leveling experience. To further support that point, one of the main reasons for classics greatness was the leveling experience, when we look at the current wow, we can see the havoc the doomed to fail expansion system wrecked on it. It seems like blizzard completely forgot why WoW was so good when you look at the changes throughout the expansions, that goes for all of them. I say it as if it's objective, but I haven't forgotten it's all subjective.
---
My alternative:
---
I think adding more to the old world, as opposed to making it irrelevant, is a much better tool to combat stagnation, SPECIFICALLY (This is vital.) with a progression through previous content. Keep \*as much as possible\* relevant. 
---
Obviously this leaves a lot to be desired in terms of direction, but I think keeping this core design philosophy moving forward would at least be better than the current "expansion" system.
---
Ya I think a key here and with most systems is that people always save up for the really rare and op items like weapons and rings. 
---
The problem comes when ppl pass on items that they actually need cuz they don’t wanna lose a few points or Dkp or be moved down on the loot chart.
---
It's a dumb rhetorical question. He's popular among some people, and unpopular among others. There is no hivemind opinion. Everyone here is an individual who can decide these things for themselves.
---
That’s awesome, how do you do it?
---
in a 40 man raid you are going to have ALOT of people with the same amount of points. 
---
There is no encouragement to stay. I need an item off the frist boss. I show up, get my 2 points. Item doesn't drop, I'm out. 
---
If someone has 0 points since they won an item with need early in the raid and then need another item can they get it on "need" with 0 points? 
---
Your system has some of the drawbacks of DKP, and none of the strengths. And this seems like Mainspec/Offspec Need/green roll with extra steps. 
---
No thanks.
---
In this case it was 100% the alliance’s fault. The alliance rogue was stealthed in the middle of the dueling area and Jellybeans (the hunter) detected the stealth right as he scatter shot and it targeted the alliance rogue. Maybe it was in Jelly’s macro, but that doesn’t happen at all if the rogue stands in the crowd with the rest of the alliance.
---
Maybe it’s not intentional, but it wasn’t really respecting the dueling area and it messed up the duel. Other than that I don’t think the alliance interfered with any other duel.
---
Not even true, they are very different and its all preference. Sword hemo is more consistent damage and dagger rogue is more cooldown based burst.
---
im saying clearly it wasnt a main and its a name meant to hide the real person
---
This might actually be the way it was.
---
I remember for Devo Aura, if you had Imp Devo Aura talent, with the 55 Armor Libram, The Tooltip would say 918 (Base+talents), the buff would say 735 (Base armor from untalented Devo Aura) and the actual armor gain was 973 when you checked your stats (Talented+Libram).
---
Im not sure whats affecting BS though other than talents.
---
??? Company makes game, you ask there’s a catch?
---
Why can’t a company make a game for its fans without there being a catch? Of course they want money but who doesn’t?
---
It’s still funny though
---
Because its too hard to have your whole raid of rogues fighting over swords, if daggers drop someone has to use them
---
Yes. It will be smart to invest in whatever you can that you know will go up in price after the economy it's established. It'll take foresight, work, and patience. But you can get ahead pretty well with the proper planning.
---
Agreed, plus this would encourage people to skip a few nights when working on a harder boss, then show back up when they think the group is going to clear.
---
The problem was there was no really good way around that because of how much gear inflation there was at 60.  Either content would be trivial for people in Naxx gear or it would be impossible for the majority of people who didn't clear Naxx.
---
Calling him an asshole based on a humorous post is kind of an asshole thing to do.
---
Hope so
---
They don’t want to level twice. So they will want to choose the class that’s best in the long term. 
---
If there is no plan to release Burning Crusader then I don’t think I will level a paladin.
---
The UI for the new Classic LFR/D looks like it's coming along nicely /S
---
This is fucking epic.
---
Follow around lowbies (preferably whilst stealthed) with an explosive sheep out.  I usually do this in lowbie zones and try to get them to flag.   If you wait until the contested zones they'll have too much HP for a 1-shot.
---
Can you share this list?
---
i dont feel anyone needs a guild bank is my point. its useless junk, tha t could be delegated out to class officers to be dispersed.
---
Ah fair enough, I never played around with the hemo specs much
---
That's also a good point, eventually you'd have to force people to take items and then that gets super messy, I've never been a fan of point based loot systems because of the attitude it causes.
---
Banish elementals people are farming.
---
Enslave Demon on Demons people are farming.
---
He's a rare spawn, not up often.
---
To add on this. A very good shaman ring is the one from farming silithus bosses around AQ patch if you gbid enough for it. I think it’s called elemental focus band.
---
Hardiness is more useful at level 60, having a fear brake is more important at level 30 since you don’t get berserking rage till level 32.
---
Imagine how challenging it will be to navigate around frost traps and a larger distance you have to run to avoid getting sheeped or r1 fbolted.
---
I see your situation but imagine a paladin with imp concentration aura ..
---
Guild: From The Ashes
---
FTA started in vanilla on Bladefist EU. I was a guild leader between TBC &amp; WoD which is where I quit. The guild is alive and kicking. 
---
However, I'm going to re-ignite the guild for classic wow. A few of the players I played with during my time as GL are coming back too. 
---
Details
---
- Prob raid once a week with a 2nd night for more casual runs. 
---
- Mostly UK &amp; Dutch
---
- A bit crazy. But we are older now. 
---
We are building up in a new Facebook group. Anyone interested send me a PM.
---
So where the road forks northeast of helms bed there are enough gentle slops that you can walk up to get onto the mountain ranges surrounding the zone, from there you can go a bunch of places but the flight point in searing gorge is the most useful. There’s also a cave north along the mountain ridge that makes the game think you’re somewhere in silithus and changes the audio and map and everything.
---
He was the first guy to come to mind when I imagined what that guy looked like. It's probably fairly accurate.
---
[Loot Lists](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/) for the win.
---
Show up to raids for 24 days straight, get one piece of loot, and now the guy that shows up once gets the next loot first? Nah.
---
Plus, you'll have class sets and other items only one class wants only ever in the Greed category. The rogues (and all others) will figure out who gets what amongst themselves and make sure they never step on each other's toes. That way they keep their points for items other classes want.
---
Nah, you gotta get that Peggle addon and just play Peggle for 30 minutes and not realize your flight path ended 25 minutes ago.
---
Oh it most certainly is. I'm sorry, I admit I didn't phrase that very clearly. What I was trying to suggest is that in the Warcraft universe, people should've realized recurve swords were an inferior design before this sword was created as they have "proper" swords dating back much earlier than this example.  
---
But it seems I was going off a quite incorrect assumption that this sword was one of the very few recurved ones which could've been relics of a begone era. Scrolling through the appearances tab proved me wrong quite quickly though.
---
It kind of pissed me off that DKs started with every flight path in the 1-60 game, despite not having physically been to each flight path - the justification was that the account already had at least one 55+ character already. Another step in the downward spiral of retail WoW, imo.
---
Eye of Orgrimmar is the Horde version. Identical stats, same quest chain.
---
Not while leeway exists haha
---
IMO these kind of events will happen on servers but only those present will no about it. Kind of makes it better IMO.
---
You're going to be waiting a very long time I think.
---
If you're really serious about your partner actually liking the game. Don't oversell it. Let them explore the parts of the game that they want. Don't explain everything. And if they want to take a break, let them.
---
Playing on a PvP server might be a mistake aswell, or not, you know your partner best.
---
Me and my partner met in wow, so we never had the problem of not playing together :) We're going to roll alliance on a PvP server and reck some faces.
---
You can mail stuff to alts. Infinite space and 30 days to clean it up.
---
“Parry this you filthy casual!”
---
That sounds good to me, not sure how people would like it these days, but I actually prefer a hard level cap that just stays for a long-ass time. I played FFXI for about 7 years, and from the 2nd to 5th expansions, the level cap stayed at 75. There were new items that were added to the new content, so level didn't actually matter, you still got all the fun and progression without having to struggle through the leveling process each expansion that honestly, most people don't like to begin with.
---
&gt; It's a buff for taurens.
---
It's *always* been a buff for Taurens, since day one. What's your point?
---
I’m gonna wait til new players run for a chest and get in combat so I can ninja the green and leave the hunk of bread. The. /spit as I run away
---
I don't fault them too much but they were standing too close.  This was the issue with everyone though, not just alliance.
---
For duels and 1v1 wingclip is more useful, but for bgs entrapment. At least that is what I've heard, and it makes sense to me.
---
I got this as a fury warrior in vanilla. When the carapace dropped I bribed the other contender 2-300 gold (can’t remember) to pass while threatening to have my friend need. Couldn’t believe it when they accepted and I won. Me and my friends spent the day combing EPL for bloods. Played WoW for almost 15 years and that item is probably the one I got the most excited about. I can still remember getting constant whispers asking where it came from and how to get it.
---
And it's really sad to see ally not even trying to crash this little party.
---
I think transparency is super important for this.  There have been a few good suggestions but one thing I would recommend is picking either raid lead or guild lead and not both.   A lot is involved with raiding and with guild leading and it could cause some burn out on your end, or people leaving from a variety of issues.  I also think MT should not be on the Loot Council if he has loot priority anyway.
---
You will probably do better to just have separation of jobs.  You can MT and raid lead.. make sure everyone knows the fights and assign CC / pulls / etc.  Then defer to class / role leads for individual problems.   The loot council should be those leads.  You could be just the tie breaker but not have a vote so as to not look like you're influencing the council.   Then have someone else lead the guild.
---
Also I would keep your wife away from any class lead or loot council positions.. being 2nd raid lead is fine if she is managing the DKP system and the gathering of materials for the guild bank.  
---
I also think the guild bank should really have a dedicated banker so maybe just make her the "Banker" and have her control what goes in and out.. maybe on your guild site / discord there is a channel dedicated for just requesting items from the bank.. but keep a copy of what is in the bank at all times.. and a transaction history.. if it gets sold in the AH or what not.. even if it's just a spreadsheet.. i'd even show the screenshot of it listed on the AH so guild can ensure the price is there and not you sold it for 500g but claimed it was 300g and pocketed 200g.   There are a lot of people in a 40 man raid roster so ensure everyone is aware of their resources.  With gbanks having to be on alt characters it helps to keep all that information visible. 
---
With the bank too some things will be mandatory to give out (like the onyxia scale cloak) that the guild will have to craft for everyone.  The order (albeit loosely) should be defined ahead of time. Or if the guild wants to sell some cloaks early on for gold in a hope to buy some later at a lower cost to buy more consumables or craft FR gear or something then that should be outlined ahead of time. 
---
Also with a 40 man raid you will have some people sitting on the bench.  I would give a Bench Bonus for those who have to sit out but are still there on time and another bonus if there were online the entire time and ready to go (even if they are PVPing or doing 5 mans or something).  It helps to reward the bench too (albeit in smaller amounts since there is no per-boss or end boss bonus) so when they DO get in they have some incentive and chance at gear. 
---
I saw mention of a tax to avoid people hoarding DKP for say BWL when they're in MC to get the boost on that gear.  There may be special occasions that you want to put a freeze on the tax for certain individuals or when a member is at a certain threshold.. maybe someone gets married and goes on their honeymoon.. don't penalize them (since you said you're an older family guild).. but I would make sure all those fringe cases are documented somewhere ahead of time so people can't accuse you of cheating the system. 
---
There is probably a lot more involved but I think it's a good system and it can work out for your raid.  Best of luck out there!! :)
---
Baller.
---
Loot Council is garbage too. It's full of bias, especially towards the core group of friends.
---
Much harder to do on the beta vs a private server.
---
Use the melee macro
---
5-man dungeons in vanilla can take hours though
---
This made me try and go back and find my guilds website on there, found it but none of the assets were still there.  Sad, all my 2005/2006 achievements are lost forever.
---
I loved AV hard packed snowballs.  I would shadowmeld on the bridge with my prot warrior, Intimidating Shout to hold one horde player still,  /point, /laugh, and punt them to their deaths.
---
Huh? They did take action, they teleported the guy away. Read the ToS, griefing and harassment are clearly forbidden. Just because you've never seen someone banned for it doesn't mean GMs won't take action to stop it.
---
Griefing on this level is very rare, meaning it's also rare for players to get actioned for it. That's a GOOD thing.
---
Players only have the power to get each other teleported away if they decide to spend several HOURS doing nothing but harassing a single event. Is this really the hill you want to die on?
---
If what I have heard is correct, classic beta is doing something wierd with attack range: if your target is running away from you, your attack range is increased, as compared to a target that is standing still. So it may be either drastically less effective or outright impossible to hamstring kite in classic. 
---
I am really hoping that it works, but I haven't yet found any classic beta footage of a warrior actually hamstring kiting.
---
On the other hand, most of the warriors I have seen so far aren't even trying, like baron/cstrike gaming, for example.
---
The caster very clearly said it was unfortunate but not Alliance's fault
---
Actually it's a lot of fun. I hope that someone gets the opportunity to show you how much fun it is. You're one of those people who don't want dps meters in games "because it kills build diversity". Fuck off, skank, go back to eating your dinners alone, while wondering why you can't get laid despite being just SO nice!
---
It's what I'm talking about 🙌😭
---
i'm sorry but fire resist gear for MC is a bad meme from 04. Nature/frost is a different thing.
---
There is a bug that allows you to make an alliance toon if you have horde. i'm not going to mention how just in case it hassnt been fixed yet but i'm sure google will tell you.
---
grow some thicker skin
---
you need to read the quest in order to know what to do
---
With retail, Blizzard is in a bad spot with that. They don’t want people to fly over all the new zones and miss everything, but they can’t outright remove a feature that’s been in the game for 12 years without upsetting a significant portion of the player base.
---
It's textbook cognitive dissonance.
---
People hold a very idealistic view of Vanilla WoW in their minds, and on this, and other, forums, that idea is constantly challenged by people who have different ideals of it.  With wow being such an integral part of a lot of people's youth, a lot of people subconsciously identify with wow on a personal level.  So when their ideals are challenged, they tend to feel personally attacked, and lash out much more strongly than if it were something lesser.
---
Also some people are just trolls/assholes.
---
You should level your reading skill irl. That way you don’t waste much time role playing and more time killing boars.
---
I belive scarlet monastery required some serious swimming to get to too.
---
I really feel when I've killed the final boss of the expansion and I'm carrying his legendary bow around, I'm not gonna care about 1 slot not being 0.5% better, man.
---
That's because you're only AoE damage died 3 seconds into the pull. Where was the frost nova?
---
Isn't the stone usually worth more than the ore though?
---
This is gorgeous. &lt;3
---
As long as you have one class capable of healing (priest, druid, paladin, shaman) and one class capable of taking a hit (warrior, paladin, druid) you will have easy time with questing and finding groups for dungeons. Keep in mind you should go DPS spec for all of them and just collect healing gear on a side for druid, shaman, and paladin for dungeon healing. 
---
Something to keep in mind any three classes will be able to handle group quests of played correctly, but it will be harder to find a dungeon group as three DPS.
---
Some classes do have better synergy
---
Warrior - benefits from any group and significantly changes the leveling experience for everyone.
---
Rogue - front loaded damage, really benefits if can use backstab, low utility for the group.
---
Mage - has a bit of unload-recover kind of gameplay, great cc and utility with major city portas, food is nice but as a group you will not need it.
---
Warlock - back loaded damage, really efficient if all dots do full damage, requires smart group play, offers amazing utility via summoning portal (who is going to say NO to a dungeon summon) and a free health "potion" as a healthstone.
---
Priest - actually suffers from group as it relies on killing blow in order to trigger spirit tap, the main leveling talent.
---
Hunter - brings no benefits and after level 10 has a capable pet tank, actually suffers not being able to use aspect of the cheetah for traveling.
---
Paladin - being second slowest leveling class really benefits from the group and has good group buffs.
---
Shaman - insane benefit to a warrior and rogues but has zero synergy with casters. 
---
Druid - the king of group synergy, best most universal buff in the game, can "backstab", frontloaded damage, can heal up between mobs, tank if pulled too much, tank, heal, or DPS in dungeons. Suffers the most since can't really use travel form, can't stealth past enemies.
---
First time leveling is much harder so pick a class you like the mechanics of. 
---
Have fun.
---
you weren't downvoted for reminding people of the 'objective of beta'
---
you were downvoted for being a condescending prick to someone for sharing a wholesome story about their nostalgic experience. which is the objective of classic wow as a whole
---
Loot Council and /roll are the most common.  Traditionally speaking my guild ran /roll with only legendary components being loot Council restricted.  Certain roles did get priority in a sort of loot Council /roll hybrid where for example only Tanks who main tanked were allowed to roll on Tank BIS.  Same for healers.  There are a couple gray areas to navigate but that's typically the safest.   And be vocal about it.  People need to know that if that tanking helmet drops only the tanks get to roll, if they pass then it goes to offspec rolls etc.  
---
This method ensures the whole guild is on equal footing, knows that gear is going towards progression, and it builds teamwork and friendships inside the guild as often for example tanks again would discuss which upgrades in advance they might pass to the other for being a greater upgrade.
---
After MT prio it will be DKP. Yeah we are. We hope we get an RP PVP server. If your interested send me a DM.
---
Spits better than mumble rap
---
Added to my list to check in the next stress, thanks!
---
Hell yeah dude, nice line work on this one!
---
No you don't, addons will do the work for you just like they have done since original vanilla.
---
Not sure where you got the idea that vanilla was some wonderful fairy tale land where everyone greeted each other with a smile and unicorns ran around farting rainbows.
---
Excellent answer. They are also not cooldown reliant like other casters and have their burst readily available to them as long as they've got mana.
---
Good point.
---
Main, alt, and bank alt! Perfect.
---
I was watching some kind of stream with some dude named Kargoz and 3 other streamers for Classic Wow.
---
Kind of a "Test the waters" type deal as I usually hate streamers. And boy, was I right.
---
The most toxic, entitled, bratty group of people I've seen in a while.
---
Depends on the node type, server, whether or not aq gates are going in, but the sentiment stands
---
I think the point cap and value per raid would definitely have to be increased for classic. Priority for MT is a great point, this is exactly why I asked. We didn't have a 'main' tank back then, we had several tanks and everyone rotated. I can see this being a problem in classic though.
---
Thanks for the thoughts!
---
It will definitely slow down your lvling but I've done it before and it is really enjoyable, it's like a whole different game. You get lost a lot more and it usually comes down to asking people you see around for directions.
---
&gt; ~~This sub~~ Reddit is a fickle as the wind.
---
So tl;dr: the "fix" was actually a mistake.
---
It sure is plausible. Guess we'll never be 100% sure.
---
I was shocked that hollywood actually gave an accurate representation of how top down command and control collectivists handle adversity. Usually it's the utopia treatment
---
IM leveling a rogue on the beta now to figure this out.  She's 15 right now so a bit away from 30 but so far:
---
Level 1 Mobs:  1-3 copper
---
Level 10 Mobs:  5-9 Copper, some vendor greys.
---
level 15 Mobs: 8-14 Copper, some vendor greys.
---
Vendor greys so far seem pretty rare but ive gotten everything from tough meat at 1c vendor to some bone thing that vendored for 45c.  I want to get a bit higher and test out stockades and see what they have too.   
---
I will say though that with the auto-loot enabled by default (interface options) , it does auto-loot your pickpocketing too.
---
Agree
---
seems kind of weird. Items should cost points. not all of your points.
---
&gt; Actually it's a lot of fun
---
Yeah, very fun for a person to waste both their time and money just because some basement-dwelling neckbeard didn't have anything better to do than to corpse camp them for several hours.
---
You fucking nutcase
---
i agree they shouldnt do anything, but considering the only reason that tauren got moved by a GM was cus the streamers complained about it, and that is just fucked
---
I climbed on top of the Goldshire smithy and MC'd class trainers right before lowbies clicked on them.
---
I've noticed this on pservers too (although with other classes/skills). The buff value reads low (IIRC I had talents to improve  it) but character sheet was right.
---
I think alliance have a couple of good players but clearly it's very horde dominated
---
how was main tank not a thing in BC but is now in retail?
---
&gt; rushing 11 holy to Consecration means you can easily tank any instance when levelling.
---
I wouldn't tank in Classic as Prot while leveling. Surviving dungeons as a Prot Paladin is hugely dependant on talents. This means you can't put any points in Ret first. Paladins don't have a passive / spammable Threat generator (Bear Form, Sunder Armor / Taunt.) You must get Divine Intellect + Divine Strength and then the eleventh point in Consecration to hold multi-mob aggro. Just keep in mind that Consecration will use up all your mana in two casts.
---
If you're getting Cons this early then you'll need Redoubt, Shield-Spec, Toughness and Sanctuary, so say goodbye to any Ret talents because you're going to need those Protection skills to handle getting slammed by 5+ mobs.
---
[11/33/7](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVGxI0zEoVb) ~ This is pretty much the optimal AoE Tanking / Leveling build. Consecration is *key* to this, which is why mana is going to be your biggest limitation.
---
You absolutely need Imp. Righteous Fury—but it doesn't stop there. The tanking effectiveness of Warriors and Druids depends almost entirely on the Warrior or Druid themselves. Paladin tanking, on the other hand, depends about 50% on the Paladin and 50% on the party. 
---
This means party members need to throttle their DPS, pay extra attention to targeting down marked mobs, reducing AoE to a minimum, understanding how BoP works, preferably having a threat meter, and eventually putting up with Blessing of Salvation (something Mages especially whine about.) 
---
Additionally, a Protadin has to sit to drink after every pull while a regular tank w/healer might not have to. Players might not realize it, but this adds *waaaay* more time to every dungeon run.
---
This sounds fun and interactive, and I’m open to the idea that in a consistent, committed guild group it could be, but—and I know I sound like a broken record—I would never recommend leveling as a Protadin thinking you'll be PuGing dungeons regularly.
---
&gt; I was intending to spec the 30/21/0 spec that lets you heal as well as a holydin but everyone says you HAVE to level as ret spec or Paladin sends you to sleep.
---
You don't need to go full Holy in order to effectively heal dungeons. Most talents past Illumination are strictly raid-only talents. They won't help you healing much because you won't be hitting raid-like damage patterns. It sucks to see precious skill points wasted.
---
Another thing to clear up is that Holy is still a melee spec. Holy Shock is so useless to Paladins that in Vanilla guides many authors even suggest not taking it at all (super inefficient DPM/HPM).
---
Let me recommend a build that'll make you the most effective healer *and* be able to deal as much damage as necessary: I guess you can call it a [“Holy/Ret hybrid”](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzMwAAEMONzzQ) because healing dungeons is the most efficient way to farm the necessary 2H weapons to make leveling as Paladin the most satisfying experience. Thankfully, dipping 20 points into Holy does little to affect your damage because your DPS comes almost entirely from the top-end of your weapon.
---
The first 11 points in Ret are the “damage” package of Paladin builds and gives you the most bang for your buck: *Benediction -&gt; Deflection -&gt; SoC.* Because of a mechanic called [Parry-haste](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry), you should pick Deflection instead of Imp. Judgement (which is useless with SoC) and Imp. SotC (also worthless.)
---
This means healing with a 2H, or switching to a 1H + Healing Off-hand for dungeons. Wearing a shield is going to do very little for you. Unless you care about the aesthetic of running around with a shield.
---
#Talents:
---
**Imp. BoM**
---
This is a waste of talent points since [it doesn't scale well](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a93mk8/paladin_levelling_talents_benediction_or_imp_might/ecgiude/?context=0). Mana is always going to be an issue so Benediction is your best friend here—you'll be Sealing and Judging *a lot*.
---
**Seal of the Crusader:**
---
Seal of the Crusader is obsolete in patch 1.12 [because of a bug that they probably won't fix.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ak3qqw/should_all_bugs_be_fixed_even_if_they_were/) Don't even buy SotC from the trainer, it's pretty much always a DPS-loss. 
---
**Pursuit of Justice:**
---
After SoC I'd recommend PoJ since distance will be your biggest efficiency-killer while leveling. Can't stress the importance of +8% run speed.
---
**Sanctity Aura:**
---
Mathematically, Ret aura beats Sanc aura because of poor stat scaling while leveling.
---
**Imp. Judgement:**
---
You should be using rank 1 SoC to level, which means never Judging it because you actually lose DPS by doing so. Not Judging SoC makes this talent worthless.
---
**Healing Light**
---
You might as well get this to improve your dungeon healing (you should be building a healing set with +Healing cloth pieces and off-hands) and then two points into:
---
**Imp. Lay on Hands**
---
This is the most controversial choice but Lay on Hands is so much better on Tanks than BoP since BoP suspends threat and only causes another party member to get one-shot instead. Giving your tank +30% armor for 2 minutes in addition to the emergency heal is more effective than Consecration or two points in Divine Strength.
---
After this, get Illumination. I'm skipping Consecration since it's useless while leveling as a non-tank. It's insane how inefficient Consecration is. I think a lot of people are blinded by guides that glorify AoE grinding around level 50+. AoE grinding won't be a thing while leveling at launch because grinding spots will be contested by other players (especially Mages) who can AoE much more efficiently than you.
---
**Illumination**
---
This talent is all you need to heal effectively until 60. Get Divine Intellect and Spiritual Focus because this becomes your most powerful healing combo with Concentration Aura (spell pushback is huge in Classic.) Avoid Divine Strength because you won't be getting enough Strength rating on your gear for this to scale well and since you're not equipping a shield it won't help you mitigate damage either.
---
#Additional info:
---
Don't waste gold on the following spells / ranks: Seal of the Crusader, Exorcism, Divine Protection ranks, Redemption ranks, Turn Undead, Hammer of Justice ranks, Lay on Hands ranks, Seal of Justice, Holy Wrath, Divine Shield, Blessing of Sacrifice. You won't stick around undead areas long enough while leveling in the early levels to justify the Undead-only spells. Maybe once you start hitting EPL you can pick those up.
---
#Stat priority:
---
+Healing  &gt; +Spell Crit &gt; Mp5 &gt; Intellect. 
---
Keep in mind that at very early levels you'll be mostly aiming for Spirit &gt; Intellect &gt; Stamina. Don't worry about Strength because most of your damage will come from the top-end of your Weapon.
---
Back then i got good gold by farming essence of fire/wind. Also if you play rogue,  dark iron has a good value at the beginning.
---
I would read it because that's part of the game and you might as well enjoy the full game!
---
Esfand wasn't in that group
---
I think most European countries have 4 to 5 weeks vacation days per year. But for me it doesn't really work well to take them much later so the late schedule to release classic is kinda a bummer for me
---
Loot lists seems the most hardcore, and hardest to adopt
---
I missed the end of the tournament. What happened to him?
---
https://discord.gg/XN9NrYC
---
There is the link to rules and information for you. Breaks down the guild and who's playing what and doing what. We would love to have you, check it out and if we are a fit for you, go ahead and register under the blue hyperlink.
---
It was never good but some people romanticize it. Doing a 4-5 quest chain and getting something like that just felt bad and there's no justifying it behind some lazy excuse for RP.
---
Yes i agree, although everyone else can see so I could see it just being a bit of an inconvenience for everyone. I guess free action pots are pretty big tho so I'd be up for them allowing pots
---
We were bad and should probably feel bad too.
---
The same right as you do. Stop crying geez.
---
oh damn thats crazy
---
Is she actually interested in playing?
---
There salty about losing bgs all the time so they like do shit like Shadow meld at the valley entrance of Stonefall while their pet just murders you repeatedly.
---
That's when you call your higher level buddy to come counter gank the ganker. Then you can /spit on her corpse and then all is balanced in the world. 
---
God damnit I love Vanilla.
---
here's what you should do. go on youtube and google warcraft 1 and 2 lore and watch the videos. if you have warcraft 3, play through the campaign and pay attention. it's a good story. in world of warcraft, read the quests. also supplement this by watching vanilla lore videos. the warcraft universe is actually good, and it makes the game more enjoyable when you're aware of what you're accomplishing
---
Honestly, I wil have an alt character on his realm and I will just log in when he streams and I will troll him so hard. lmao that guy
---
What happened?
---
Fire resist will still be needed as a crutch for a lot of people early.  And he asked what sells well, it sells really well early.  Everyone will be starkly reminded of this the first couple goes before they start getting gear and are melted by it.  They will outgrow it quick enough.
---
Later, as stated the prices will fall off.  Basically, anything associated to the raids will command price.
---
Nah it will be Diablo 4 !
---
Is this a bug or working as intended?
---
Because some of the Alliance, along with some horde players, were spilling into the duel area instead of keeping a respectable distance. The alliance that got scattershot was a low level rogue that was stealthed right fucking on the hunter. Some also tried to kill JellyBeans after the duel ended.
---
There was a clip but it got deleted. It's still on the Jelly's vod starting at the 02:07:00 mark.
---
No, what is he is saying is right.
---
OMG Viva Piñata! I played the shit out of that game.  Idk why
---
If you are knowledgeable about the quests, you can get away without reading them too much.
---
LMAO that people consider wow a hardcore game, EQ and UO are hardcore games. WoW is the weenie hut junior to those games.
---
I've thought about Warlock, but I don't want to get to max level and sit in Org for 45 mins looking for a tank.
---
Easy with the name calling there, hoss. A quick glance at your comment history tells me that you literally are a basement wizard lol. And the point is that it isn't a waste of time for the griefer, because he is having fun by not letting you have fun.
---
I like loot council. It keeps new people from falling behind with low dkp, and also rewards your star players with bis pieces for consistent performance.
---
We did DKP for forever until the couple responsible for calculations weren't completely honest with it. Loot council fixed everything and worked well through every expansion from TBC to middle of Legion when the guild fell apart.
---
Too bad no one will ever use them cause they're next to worthless.
---
Make interesting items that are also strong/have such good utility you want to use them. Don't make shite flavour items next to no one will use.
---
Played the original Unreal and UT. Not a fan.
---
Quake 3 rocket arena is more my speed for fast gameplay
---
The 1 hour everyone has to take to make a list will save countless hours in raiding.
---
You could make a WSG premade without Paladins before you could make one without a Druid. 
---
I agree that overall Paladins are better for the team than Shaman. But Shaman are more fun for the person playing Shaman.
---
Honestly, I’m scared to broach the subject. I just can’t imagine hearing the words “World of Warcraft” drawing interest. Maybe if she saw it ahead of time, perhaps.
---
I thought about doing that, but with a hunter. I don't think I have enough time to do that and instead learn how to dual box with my wife's priest.
---
The USSR has a long storied history of fabricating reports
---
Is that a Vanilla Blood Elf? Or High Elf?
---
Did he get banned? Didn't see him at the end of the duels, thankfully.
---
They don’t have a right but since people dick ride then so much, the majority can sway blizzards opinion
---
True. I was talking more about the historical event that happened and not so much the physics behind it. Just as how 9/11 will be taught in schools without going into any details of the physics. I am a chemist that works in a lab for a reverse osmosis water treatment plant and the word "Chernobyl" was not mentioned once in any of my years of studying.
---
Probably cause then the Horde viewers couldn’t do anything about it.
---
Hey, the website links returns error 403 for me
---
It's griefing and Blizzard will react just as they do when people do the same to roleplayers. When you cross the line from actions that could to be incidental to clearly intentional then Blizzard will act on it.
---
Verrry different style of gameplay
---
~~I taught my brother~~ ruined my brothers life by introducing him to WoW at a very young age. I swear to god he used to roll a new character daily. Frustrated the fuck out of me because he'd always be so jealous of all the shit I have, and I'd tell him to just stick to a character and he'd be there soon enough.
---
It took him getting a few years older, but he finally maxed out a character. Probably because you were able to pay to do it by then
---
My main will be a leather worker, once my warrior alt hits max I can just give him the devilsaur BiS
---
It's neat, but it would be so much more interesting if stuff like this existed at max level, or if it was a bit more common rather than being a one-off thing.
---
It’s amazing!
---
I'd also like to know this
---
I'm not entirely sure. Some say he got put into a different layer, but there's a screenshot floating around where the guy whispered Sony (or someone else) that he got ported to Winterspring, so it was probably GM interference if that's true.
---
there are some odd hit box things going on.
---
Esfand did a duel where he and the opponent stood facing away from eachother, a couple of yards apart. even just using fists, they were still hitting eachother. it wasnt like they were running through eachother or something, literally just standing still.
---
He didn’t even play vanilla or tbc.  His character is linked somewhere in this thread.  He has barely played this game at all and just farmed up old vanilla mounts and items and claims he did these back in vanilla
---
I did :P Honestly is surprising how many MMOs did not adopt this style of itemization. Not only did it allow to personalize your character more, but like you said...it helped with balancing and power creep.
---
dueling tourtament was disrupted by some lvl1 who stood on totems for hours.     
---
GM came and removed him.     
---
Asmond things GM should have.    
---
Staysafe said just move to a place they can't go, or they can be killed.     
---
Asmond is a snowflake, thinks he shoudln't be griefed.
---
It is totally fun mate, more likely when they mine the wod char name with tier5 mog and not the original one, goodluck and see ya in winterspring!
---
Warriors are painful to level (on a PvP server) until around lv54. Unless you have pocket heals.
---
They can have dueling tournaments all they want. But they should have to put up with any grief that WoW allows. If GM's are watching these and using their god powers to teleport players away who aren't breaking any rules, then that should be stopped. GM's should not be doing that. This isn't a Blizzard sanctioned event, and if GM's start going out of their way to help/support streamers that'll cause some strife
---
how is this implemented tho? seems like it takes way more than 8 hours.
---
Huh? I did a school research project specifically on it because I learned a little about it in school and thought the topic was amazing. I want to say I was in middle school, did a bunch of research, even interviewed someone. I'm not sure where you're getting the generalization that no one cared about it or learned about it before HBO. It's just pushed out of the public mind because it's not a topic that needs to come up often. *Of course* it's going to be more popular when there's a good show about it.
---
There's been enough nuclear accidents that you can learn about the topic from several different angles and not necessarily cover Chernobyl, the most recent one in Japan springs to mind. Chernobyl was kind of the OG though. If you're interested in the topic of nuclear accidents I highly recommend "Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety" by Eric Schlosser. It's less about reactors and more about weapons, but it's pretty amazing how few accidents we've actually had.
---
The most toxic people are the ones crying about toxicity. You're a disgrace.
---
Same faction griefing has always been one of the top ways to get banned. It's considered even worse than cross faction girefing.
---
&gt; How does it handle bindings or other legendaries?   
---
With Atiesh specific rules were created. Essentially:

 - Higher than 80% attendance to bid, normal DKP ratio rankings after    
---
 - [Splinter of Atiesh] was counted as 5 items but you'd get all 40 Splinters before anyone else could begin    
---
&gt; How does it handle the main tank?   
---
Unless it was progression limiting (which only happened once or twice) the normal way. Specifically the MT got some resist gear and a shield first but it was actually already hurting us from beating encounters. It wasn't a secret/loot council thing, in fact a thread was created on the guild forums discussing it (since it was super atypical).   
---
&gt; Are there any other offspec conditions with warriors?    
---
We had OTs that also had DPS raid sets. Only unusual thing is they could "main spec" bid on either one.    
---
&gt; Do those T2 pieces just get sharded or do some get given away for free?   
---
Never free. It was either 1 or 0.5. Otherwise it got sharded. Free creates a justification to never bid on off-set. I wouldn't recommend it.    
---
&gt; How does this work or in the long run?    
---
Our fury warriors were picking up OT gear which largely offset the cost savings and both classes were competitive for weapons. Plus attendance plays a big part here, and it is harder to generalize that.    
---
&gt; Do you let the rogue that refuses to take a single Naxx upgrade prior to KT stick around?    
---
If people weren't performing they were more likely asked to sit on standby. Regardless of DKP, if your DPS falls off because you don't want to buy anything, it will negatively impact raid progression, and players who help progression might do more fights than you. If people had low DPS and it was a concern typically the class lead would "council them."   
---
This came up a couple of times. But more often it wasn't DKP related but rather people not bringing their A game. One person was simply just burned out and wound up quitting.    
---
&gt; I know the answer for most of these is probably the simplest approach of bid or don't, but couldn't that slow things down overall, or even stunt growth against difficult content?   
---
Could it? Perhaps. Did it? It did not.   
---
Ultimately a lot of these same issues/problems exist in other DKP systems (non-ratio based). Ratio fixes some issues, but it doesn't fix them all. Sitting on your DKP until ULTIMATE ITEM drops will always be a problem. But if you have a progression focused guilt, and a lot of competition between DPS/healers/etc, often people won't want to fall too far behind/too low on the meters.
---
It depends:
---
 Do you like doing good damage and don't hate fighting 8-10 other people for weapon drops?  Go swords.
---
or
---
Do you not mind doing less damage until a few raid tiers later?  Daggers.
---
Really, every rogue and warrior is going to want to go swords, so if you have a lot of them in your raid group, you will be fighting for loot.  Daggers aren't that far behind, and end up doing pretty well around AQ, and you don't have to try to get upgrades against a ton of other people.
---
I think they said in their blizzcon panel that this created some weird interactions with their graphics engine when they tried it. So they could choose between old models only, new models only, or adding a whole lot more work.
---
It's called network compensation, and it's been in the game since classic.
---
Things I didn't have to worry about in vanilla: planning PTO around major released 😂.  Adult life sucks.
---
First off, don't assume she will want to play Hunter or a healer. It's just an irritant, and won't help. Let her look at things, read descriptions. Show her fun mounts maybe. You can always play on a PvE with her and PvP with friends. I've always tanked, and my bf was largely dps. Whatever works! I hope she loves it!
---
Makes some friends and join a guild, then you won’t have to.
---
I'm not sure if you watch Kargoz, but he has a solo/duo leveling breakdown video. While pallies are generally the slow solo, and Holy/prot pally + lock combo with rain of fire is supposedly the best/fastest squad you can get.
---
* You can instantly queue for tank/heals + dps for any dungeon.
---
* Warlock imp gives a fire shield + blood pact that returns damage to enemies and boosts hp. Combine with Ret aura and Consecration and Blessing of Salvation =aoe tank + rain of fire farming. You can pull a ton of mobs EZ.
---
* The lock can dot pull and once you have improved Righteous fury, one consecration can pull everything off of the lock. He can wand/bolt the runners.
---
* Both classes get free mounts.
---
* Cloth/Caster weapons + mail/plate and melee - no conflicts.
---
* Seal of Wisdom/Light for mana/heals on top of Warlock drains means the lock can be tanky if needed.
---
* Gnome Warlock + Dwarf pally = Dun Morogh, said to be the quickest starting zone due to mob density and distance traveled.
---
* Concentration aura + holy skills = uninterrupted casts, same for lock.
---
I myself have always planned on maining a pally. I'm searching for a CST player who would be down to run a lock for 3-4 days straight on launch. If this duo can reach the Tanaris pirates first, they will leave everyone in the dust. Pulling 20+ pirates per pull in a never-ending loop with little downtime is gg.
---
he was teleported to winterspring by a dm, and the duel moved to a glitched area
---
As long as griefers can take the fact that getting reported and suspended/banned for doing it is part of the banter, I'm down
---
yeah mb, was staring too :(
---
Wowservers and Livestreamfail got drunk and had a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome = Classicwow community.
---
Exactly ,   I stopped streaming hearthstone at legend rank because my only viewers were my opponents from time to time checking my battle tag on twitch to see my hand    I didnt want anyone banned or anything it was my choice to stream it.
---
You should join the Classic Hunter Discord https://discord.gg/n8364tU
---
They have guides and list of macros/ add-ons and they would know better where to find other info you want.
---
I remember running strat and scholo with 20+ people before they capped it at 10.
---
This x2 OP
---
The tauren hitbox only looks bad when you pit two tauren against each other.  Otherwise it's really not too bad.
---
Lol wow, the only asshole here is you. You need to calm down chief.
---
I also leveled 3 wars to 60 on those servers, Classic will be my 4th. Once you go war you dont go back. Leveling is honestly not that bad.
---
If we get enough players for it to really matter. Players that show up for progression nights get priority on coming to farm nights. Farm nights in Classic are going to be pretty important I think. I’d want to encourage people to show up for farm nights to make them go quick and easy.  The more bosses we can clear on farm each week the better geared the team is.
---
i dont think this actually matters, since the GM intervened thats that.
---
That would be awesome.  I have legion but an inactive subscription.  So assuming you just need a general world of warcraft sub, I would be good to go with a 6 month discount subscription to play classic?
---
Oh so it was essentially him acting like the world of Warcraft wasn’t a free space? That the dueling “grounds” were sacred and no one could disrupt the made up tourney they had going on?
---
How about you actually have a conversation with her? And if she isn't interested in playing, she isn't interested. Oh well.
---
Because when you call your buddies to tell them that the world is packed and they should hop on, when they do log in and go to the same area they won't see anyone due to sharding.
---
Good read really looking forward to experience levling and dont just rush myself to 60
---
OP is Tips' alt account.
---
/cast auto-shot?
---
I like how asmongold brags about trolling and griefing all the time. But as soon as someone trolls him they should be banned for it.
---
Honestly I agree about the PVP vs PVE aspect. My fear is she gets ganked and corpse camped by some guy named lolusuck and it’s curtains for her WoW career. But at the same time I can’t subject my friends or even myself for that matter to a PVE server. Maybe a stealth class may not be a bad idea.
---
you clearly have never spent time in the old school barrens chat or world chat.
---
Because BC was the balls and the shaft
---
oh so its a system? or an addon?
---
someone is gonna have to do all the attendance and book keeping no? Way more than 1 hour
---
And then watch your rears.
---
Literally says level 70 in the first comment.
---
Back in 2010 I travelled for my former company and used 3G (I think) to play on free time. It was doable for leveling, but latency sometimes was above 300 ms.
---
I have been using this to help me get ready.
---
http://www.vanilla-info.com/hunter
---
yeah this is a bug.
---
surely you guys know the thruth so enjoy the wod tier5 mog run and datamine the recovered r14 + bigvoodoo matching RP piece armory &lt;3 can't wait
---
GLad i can finally hear him not seem like a retail shill
---
Pugs will clear MC, Ony and AQ20/40. Possibly BWL late on. It’s not 2004 anymore.
---
Even a fresh 60 warrior is solid dps.
---
tell people that a spec is not viable for raiding and watch the heat you will receive
---
The key thing to remember is that lockpicking skill increases by 5 for each level gained, so topping it off after gaining a level is a good use for the pickpocketable boxes.
---
i remember retail vanilla...it was full of assholes
---
Each offense should be a case by case decision by blizzard, Theres no fine line.   If someone is spending up to 4-5 hours on a level 1 character with his only intention is to grief others, Then I think blizzard at least messaging the guy and telling him to stop is fine.  If he doesnt then sure he can receive a suspension.   If any single one of these details of the infraction were different then it should be judged differently.
---
Nope.
---
I love the idea of the mounts, maybe even show some screenshots of classes at later levels. Moose helm was always a big hit for everyone in classic. Maybe priest angel shoulders too.
---
Loot list seems legit but that might be too much upkeep for casual guilds.
---
Because some of the books existed before WoW
---
But often enough your guild mates or friends are busy and then you sit there and wait looking for a tank.
---
Indeed, even tho I signed Nost petition, I've never played on private due to fear of character loss. I can't wait to go back home after all these years.
---
Since classic? so the beta? or do you mean another word? like vanilla?
---
Looks like I'll be living in UBRS for a while then lol. I've reconnected with some old vanilla friends so if I'm fortunate I'll have a good pool of players to do guild runs with.
---
That's not what I meant exactly, my guild didn't use a MT. Not sure what other guilds did. For all I know we should have had a MT in BC too!
---
*trys to use gun in melee range*
---
another classic i forgot. added.
---
High elf. Blood elves weren't in Vanilla.
---
It's possible that I misremember.  My memory is annoyance that it got so much harder, and I stopped raiding before TBC.  Maybe they nerfed it a little and then broke it further it completely later?  It used to populate a list and all you had to do was push a button and it would decurse the top person on the list.  Afterwards it still had a list, but I think I had to actually cast the spell on the person.
---
I was the Raid Leader...and Guild Leader. Lol
---
Despell the camouflage of people doing the cancerous In Dreams quest before they talk to the guy, so they get rekt by the scarlet elites. Most likely they need to get res sickness.
---
Of what?  You think we would have a civil conversation over skype?  I really don’t feel like a shouting match where nothing is heard by the other person.  At least when I type you’re forced to read it when I respond.  I’m a rather realistic person that talks to people for a living.  You’re an over the top buffoon on the Internet.  You mean nothing to me.  As described by you earlier “the people who care about you” nonsense that meant nothing at the time.  Give me another hyperbolic response.
---
Glad he is at least organizing stuff like this when he s\*\*k in the game as "best na warrior dueler" ;) rip karma for sayin thruth
---
Some of us do remember how things worked in Vanilla, and the private servers have all types of tweaks from increased damage to faster XP, etc.  I seriously doubt Blizzard forgot how things worked in their game originally.
---
Yeah I hosted soooo many UBRS runs until I finally got my carapace. This questline was one of my proudest accomplishments in Vanilla. I used that chest for so long as well cause I was never able to get a might chest. Might have used it until Wrath chest dropped.
---
Woah, so it will just cast the relevant spell based contextually on whether you're targeting an ally or an enemy? That's clever.
---
i bet u won't even be able to get on his layer
---
Loot list seems really interesting, I hadn't heard of it before. Thanks for the idea!
---
They still do this If the ticket is submitted on an RP server, and it's AWESOME.
---
&lt;Suboptimal&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Hardcore
---
Schedule: Split Raids (Sunday 12 PM EST) (Tuesday/Thursday 7:30 PM EST) You are not required to attend both no worries
---
Introduction: We are a small guild coming over from the private server scene, that plans on being hardcore PvPers through the first few raids, and hardcore PvEers through AQ and Naxx. We have a dedicated group of officers and GMs that have all have years of raiding and pvping experience in Classic. We love really good players and new players that have a lot of drive.
---
PvE Plans: Suboptimal is looking for neckbeards and social players to join our ranks. We are a guild dedicated to promoting a chill atmosphere while still crushing all of the content. We plan on downing rag in the 3rd or 4th week, downing Nef in the first week, everything in aq(maybe not C'thun) in the first week, and progressing through Naxx at our own pace for fun! If this style of guild interest you please hit us up.
---
PvP Plans: With ranking coming out in phase two, we are going to be running a bunch of PvP specs through MC/BWL while still clearing it. Almost all of our officers and many of our core members plan on ranking between 10-14 and all plan to do it before AQ comes out, where the guild will shift more towards a PvE focus, but if you are a hardcore PvPer and like to win, you are going to want to be a part of our premades.
---
Expectations: We will have different ranks with different expectations, if you are a raider or a core raider, we expect you to show up consumed and know your rotation curses ect which will be assigned from your class officer. As a social or member of the guild we have some guidelines laid out, but pretty much just don't be a jerk. 
---
Discord: We are going to run everything through discord to keep it super simple for our raiders and PvPers alike, so no digging through or signing up for websites and all of that.
---
Thank you and we hope to hear from you soon!
---
Comment below, send me a pm, or give me a shout on discord Gnarkansas#6161
---
Bloodfury worthless but stun resist OP
---
Is this your screenshot?
---
I’m trying to remember the name of the add-on used for the 3D character models (inside the name plates). I think it was Kerp UI, but I’m not 100%.
---
Don't be a dick and none of this is an issue.
---
Every system has to keep track of attendance and loot rewards at minimum.
---
The point is, keeping track of this stuff doesn’t need to happen during raids. You collect all the loot and give it out at the end of the raid, which takes all of 5 minutes, while another officer clicks one box to label that person as no longer on the chart for that piece of loot.
---
This x3 plx
---
Same was warr twice once on illidan H one on dragonmaw A. Levelled a rogue in beta, and am enjoying how broken my class is.
---
The final battle between Illidan and Arthas in WC3: TFT is called "A Symphony of Flame and Frost". Blizzard is way more overt with nods to characters than a random single-name of a random NPC guard.
---
1. What right does anyone have to do anything in WoW?  Blizzard owns the game, and only allows up to play it.
---
2. A person can SAY whatever they want, it's up to other people if they chose to listen to them.
---
3. They didn't  Everyone expected the alliance to cause a lot of trouble, and other than one of two the casted a drain soul on Venruki when he accidentally got flagged for pvp, the alliance acted very appropriately.  It was the HORDE player that decided to troll.
---
4. It absolutely what classic WoW was.  If you act like an ass, then the community will respond.  TrollgodX acted like an ass, and not just Asmon, but pretty much EVERYONE present felt the same way.
---
The only snowflake I see here is you, who feels like everyone should play the game the way YOU want them to and throws a hissy fit when they don't.
---
I mean vanilla, my b sorry lol
---
okay i agree. While MT didnt become lessened over time, its highly important and a person that should be kept very happy in your guild lol
---
now adays you have tank swamps, so 2-3 tanks needed to be just as good and ready, so 1 tank leaving wasnt a huge deal.
---
And even worse so in retail everyone can just swap to tank spec and the gear changes too
---
uh u know u have an infinite amount of space via the mailsystem?
---
When the scout see a raid, you go into the town. If rogues gank a duel, redo the duel, and camp the rogues.
---
See if she's into RP'ing high fantasy in the bedroom. It will go one of two ways. Then you'll know.
---
This is how it's always been, and it's super satisfying when your opponent's frame goes red due to range but your arrow/spell still finishes casting. 
---
But it's absolutely always been like that.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler, its a cheesy piece of tech from Gnomergagan that's a 2.1 speed 2h weapon that has a 3 usage charge for a 30s 50% attack speed buff. All procs made with MCP are at a 2.1 speed, regardless of the haste, and seeing as we dont stack STR, and get most of our damage from proc on hit magic effects, MCP is looking like BiS or second BiS no matter how we run sims.
---
Jaw droppingly good
---
I introduced my girlfriend to WoW and she got to max level on retail. She's normally the type to scroll insta while watching grey's on repeat. Does this count?
---
&gt;Do I sit next to her and answer questions? Do I buy her a guide?
---
No.. don't do either of those things.
---
She'll just get frustrated when she can't keep up with your 'help'. Remember that things you take for granted, are going to be a challenge: movement, looking around, clicking on things, learning the UI, learning to cast spells, health and resources, bags, map and mini-map. So you may have the best intentions of helping her through her first 'quest', when you're actually rushing her through so many things to learn about controls and UI.
---
Your best bet is to let her go at her own pace. Let her spend hours reading classes and races to choose one, and designing her character's appearance. Then show her the absolute basics of movement (WASD and mouse) and let her go on her own. The first play session may only be creating the character and running around like a drunk toddler for 10 minutes, and that is fine. The more you let her discover on her own, the more she'll desire to come back to discover and learn more.
---
When she asks for help, try your best to keep it short and directly related to the question. If she asks a simple question and you dive into your intimate knowledge of 40-man raid metas, it's going to be too much. Remember that no one held your hand when you learned this game, she won't need it either.
---
That sounds optimistic to me, but thats why I threw in the sentence at the bottom. If Pugs do come out, it'll be masterloot with /roll, and the RL will probably list items before the raid starts that are 'claimed'
---
Same for me. I am a nobody and I been playing beta for weeks. It's so odd to see people say it's only streamers and their friends on there.
---
If you have a level 60, just enchant Crusader on some white weapons and mail to your Warrior ftw. Two white Crusader weapons is incredibly OP up until at least the early 50s.
---
&gt; You collect all the loot and give it out at the end of the raid, which takes all of 5 minutes, while another officer clicks one box to label that person as no longer on the chart for that piece of loot.
---
But there isnt loot trading? and if there is its a 2 hour window.
---
its amazing people cant seem to get this through their heads
---
Don’t be late.
---
Yep even starting with WC in the beginning. I can almost remember every dungeon name while leveling in Vanilla but can only remember a handful of other dungeons from other xpacs. 
---
Farming dungeons for very big upgrades while leveling in Vanilla is so much fun. So many SM runs and so much good gear. Simple dungeons, but they are fun because they can be dangerous and challenging.
---
Perfect! /dances and jokes might help. Anything you think she might really enjoy. Just don't over do it haha. I literally went tauren druid, but wanted a raptor, so I pvp'd my heart out for the black one since it was all they could use. I picked it almost 2 years before I could play. You just never know what might spark that love. I hope to hear later that she's happily playing along side you.
---
Trueshot Lodge and Warcraft Hunter's Union are also nice.
---
Once I get a bit higher level i'll try and do a bit of pick pocketing in deadmines and stockades (since im alliance) and let you know what it comes out as.
---
Oh hell yes, a play through on wc3 reforged and then jumping into classic would be perfect
---
So the question is asked @ 13:27, and i don't hear them mention any numbers at all? Where are you getting the 15k from?
---
Wow I got you writing so much. Man up already, let's go.
---
You could probably find it in Soda's stream. I only saw where Soda watched the clip I linked. He was the one that brought up the point of it being a bad thing for tauren players.
---
I was a really good warlock in vanilla and TBC, I had tanks whisper me the second I logged on. Never waited for a group.
---
1. Hand of Rag is a PvP toy. Paladins and Shaman probably deserve it the most because the dedicated Warriors are (hoepfully) going to get the other legendary, Thunderfury. But guild politics and your group's dynamic matters more than anything here. It has 0 effect on progression.
---
2. Start your own guild and plan on playing the game at a high level regularly for the next 2 years if you really want this one. Once your group is in Naxx, it's more or less guaranteed that someone will get this one eventually. Getting to Naxx is the hard part. It's not easy. Raid leaders will want it for themselves (or their closest friend) as a reward and you can't blame them for that.
---
So was hamstring kiting a thing in vanilla retail? I didn't start playing warrior on vanilla until private servers.
---
We used the same system and it was amazing. We however had fixed prices for all items if only 1 player bid. 
---
And the price was always like 2nd highest bid + 50 or something. So if you really wanted an item you could bid all your dkp but not lose all of it, made it a bit more fair.
---
Best system tbh.
---
I can't say anything about the experience but I can say that gaming on a cell connection is surprisingly easy on your data. Shouldn't be too worried about data unless you're patching or something.
---
No, it's not "network compensation". The state of classic beta is no where near what vanilla was like. Compare [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw8-FRJYgOg) and [this.](https://www.twitch.tv/norththemage/clip/AssiduousAmericanHyenaArsonNoSexy?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)
---
Of course.  I knew a guy that would camp winterspring where hunters had to solo that demon for their epic quest and purposefully ruin it for them for no other reason than that he thought it was funny.
---
Some people just get off on putting other people down.
---
This dungeon here was where I built a lot of my reputation on my server/faction back in the day. So many people had no idea how to do the puzzle to summon the boss in the middle of the bottom floor.
---
Being someone who was constantly raising alts and who had a Skinner/LW, people learned that I was pretty much always willing to run ST, and I could work the summoning puzzle in my sleep.
---
To this day, I don't know why more people weren't able to figure out the right order to click the totems/shrines/macguffins, and I don't really care. That knowledge, and my obsession with collecting ALL OF THE KEYS (RIP Keymaster achievement) earned me plenty of raid and dungeon invites in Vanilla and BC.
---
Alas, the introduction of the LFG tool pretty much got rid of any of the positive that came from such a reputation.
---
There *is* loot trading and no raid in Vanilla requires more than 2 hours, but even if you're reaching that point, you just stop, give out all the loot you have, and then keep going.
---
The reward though is the best class in the game at 60.  Best DPS and Best Tank.
---
Oh god, it's worst than I was expecting!
---
#**NURSE BRING THE SEDATIVES**
---
But can he sing?
---
We let everyone bid on anything they could use, but let main specs have prio and some classes have prio on obvious bis items (weapons, trinkets, rings etc) for their class.
---
Everyone was Okey with that.
---
On the beta Duskwood is pretty bad actually. Way worse than Stonetalon, the barrens, or 1000 needles. It's STVietnam levels of bad
---
OP comes off as a manipulative "nice guy".
---
Let gasp!
---
&gt;Top 3
---
What's this?
---
#11. It says peeling the onion was added in 1.13 on your Wowhead link
---
Yeah but the draw of a lot of those private servers is that they also put  twist on traditional play. E.g. classless servers are, IMO WAY more fun than normal because of the sheer flexibility offered in how you play.
---
Mouse overs macros, imo, are terrible. Keyboard turning is bad and you almost always want to use your mouse to maneuver.
---
Gods speed my friend, gods speed.
---
This iteration of spell batching isn't vanilla. That plus taurens hitbox is what's in question. Not taurens melee swing distance (vanilla).
---
I don't remember anything like this warstomp happening in vanilla.
---
Um, no, that was never correct.
---
Has it been confirmed that they're implementing this from the start?
---
Top 3 on a blizzard employees friends and family list.
---
Why do we need proof, everyone with a brain knew they would be sending more invites out eventually
---
PvE you do need them, fights like Vael and Firemaw, you become a hard carry without them. While most fights the talent has no bearing, if none of your healers have it, youre not getting past Vael.
---
Diehard idiots that never played the content while it was relevant, and only played on pirated servers.
---
I remember I tanked it for the first time with my friends, took us hours to get to the final boss only for him to put me to sleep and absolutely shit on the rest of the group while I could only watch.
---
The only thing you also have to implement is a min bid for certain items as well so at least items are going for almost nothing. My guild also did a silent bid system for gear but had a min bid based on the item. Weapons and trinkets would be worth more than armor. People are always going to try and cheat the system and fix bids regardless and you can't stop it, so having that min bid helps to keep things somewhat fair.
---
I know xPerl had 3D models. I never used Kerp UI but hopefully this helps.
---
He didn't play by Blizzards rules. They don't allow same faction griefing.
---
What do you think it’d accomplish if I called you?  Now you’re acting like some idiot bully.  You have a shallow mind
---
yep, IDK how it slots into the beta level 30 meta, but it's SOO useful in the full 1-60 experience. It can easily last you until level 35, and there's the arcane damage proc sword from Duskwood that can replace it from there too. Once you get Varigan's, the upgrade path for pal is pretty straightforward. 
---
Duskwood, Plaguelands, and subzones full of undead are fantastic for Paladin too, Exorcism hits like a fucking mac truck, so if you can focus on undead and demon mobs, that makes gameplay a bit more exciting too. 
---
Paladin won't really hit its full stride until about level 35, beta level 30 paladin seems kind of weak compared to level 40 paladin. idk what beta meta looks like exactly, but I do know most of the ins and outs for Paladin.
---
Deus Vult, brother.
---
Eh, I leveled a warrior to max during BC and did go back
---
For the first 3-4 months I played wow back in 2004 I remember I just added new spells and abilities to the right of the current ones on my action bar. 
---
I was a warrior so instead of making things make sense as to the order I clicked them (yes I clicked my abilities for a solid year before I learned to keybind), I instead would have to move the mouse along the action bar to find the correct ability lol.
---
Gosh those were the days!
---
Someone get a GM to ban all these people please
---
Not every item needs to be perfectly min-maxed
---
The beta has been great for finding these things.
---
You attack.  Snake dodges.

Your skill in Two-Handed Swords has increased to 2.

You miss Snake.

Your Rend misses Snake.
---
Your skill in Two-Handed Swords has increased to 4.

Your skill in Two-Handed Swords has increased to 5.

You have died.
---
I specifically mentioned they were going out today, which is what a lot of the rumors of this subreddit being based off of came from. Made a post originally Friday about it as well.
---
How old are you? Never mind I didn't ask. I came here to rant for a bit.
---
You know how people always complain that I'm too smart? Yeah me too. It's starting to get annoying. Everyday when I go to school (I'm 16 but I go to Harvard medical school) people always scream my name in the corridor like **OHHH YOU'RE SO SMART, PLEASE MAKE ME ORGASM WITH YOUR BRAINWAVES** then I'm like bruh you like 25 and I'm 16. It's really starting to get on my nerves the teachers always give me A without me doing a single test, or doing anything in class.
---
Everytime I go to a party, girls and boys alike scream in choir. I'm so fucking smart like seriously I make girls orgasm with my brainwaves. I conduct my wires into a computer and it crashes because I'm so smart. My brother literally came all over the floor because I'm so smart. Everytime at family gatherings everyone cums because I'm that smart. Seriously there's not a thing I cannot do, and I'm hot. So it's perfect, perfect for my success.
---
One of the reasons why I'm going to main a tauren druid this time around, as stealth makes exploration fun!
---
For WoW Classic I would advise you not to focus too much on wasting time. The slow pace of the game compared to retail is what makes it so great. Rushing through it, wont make you server first ;-). Enjoy your time, read the quests, explore the surroundings, maybe focus on professions (remember those?). Have fun
---
Do you have any idea how insane these WW axes are at lvl 30?
---
r/Sleepparalysis
---
I mean, thats what they are though. Its why their the most popular Horde race
---
Reminds me of WotLK Toy Train Set. The forced "choo-choo" emotes were so hated in raid groups that Blizz had to introduce a counter-toy that destroys the train sets.
---
Mad skills
---
r/classiswow numbers are somewhat irrelevant. Yes, the number jumped, A LOT, in the last 6 months, I think it doubled or so?
---
When I try to predict the Classic WoW player base size, I look at how many WoW accounts were created (last official number was 100 million between 2005 and 2014) and how many players were on private servers between 2014-2016 (an estimate was 1.3 million players).
---
I also know, for a fact the the VAST majority (like 80-90%) of FORMER WoW players simply refuse to play on private servers, for various reasons, all justifiable (DnD, gold sellers, bugs, server short life span, etc).
---
If only 5% of the former WoW players come back for Classic, that is roughly 5 million. Granted 5% is a VERY conservative number, but I just can't go to 10%, which is more reliable, because...fuck me...10 million players in Classic sounds absolutely insane.
---
I can't go bellow 5%, because 5% is already the minimum possible.
---
Now, if most (80% or even more) people refuse to play private servers, and 1.3 million people played private servers in a span of 2 years, that means that there are 4 time more people that want to play Vanilla...just not on private servers. 
---
Which means roughly 6 million people. If most private server players do not wanna pay for Classic, that still leaves 5 million players for Classic.
---
No matter how I look, the LOWEST number of Classic WoW players that I come up with is 5 million, +/- couple hundred thousands.
---
A lot of people will say that even 5 million is a stretch, because hell, it's more than twice of what BfA have.But...100 million people played WoW, and they don't play it now, be it private servers or BfA. They don't play other MMOs...because other MMOs barely scrap half a million players. They also don't play Fornite, because...well, they aren't idiots.
---
To think that 5 million is crazy...keep in mind that that would be ONLY 5% of the former WoW players from 2005 to 2014.
---
I will not be surprised to see over 6 to 7 million players at Classic launch, 5 million former players and half of BfA, plus half a million from private servers, with over 3 million still playing one year later.
---
Made up tourney. Not a blizz event. GM shouldn't have intervened at all is what a lot of people think.   
---
Unless someone is breaking a rule or doing something bannable, then nothing should happen. I agree the dude was being a dick but GM intervention for things like this is not what we want. Can lead to some weird things down the line. The streamer who created an event is no more important than a level 1 person who has never played the game.
---
 Asmond didn't deserve to be griefed, but he also didn't deserve special treatment for this
---
What he means is that lower levels will receive more health from the fort buff (greater % hp gain). That would put them at a lower % going into the jump, and make it easier to die from said jump.
---
A Blizz employee can in theory request 10 people to on their Friends and Family list.
---
But Blizz is prioritizing Top 3, as it isn't very fair if someone's 9th F&amp;F gets in before their 9th.
---
So some trash item you get cause nobody wanted it counts the same as absolute BiS gear?
---
This seems like it will lead to ppl holding out for BiS items and not taking upgrades
---
Yea, he was just going for dramatic effect to bring his point about antiquity home. 
---
You are actively choosing to get upset over something that isn't an issue. Grow up.
---
wowhead says that on every item.
---
example: [Thunderfury](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker), [Savory Deviate Delight](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6657/savory-deviate-delight)
---
So do you know when more public invites will go out?
---
would people like a person running around with all the gear and if a timer runs out no one gets it? One internet problem and buy to all the loot?
---
Certainly would cause some anxiety.
---
(i like the system im just being devils advocate)
---
and only horde as well, if Alliance were included it would have been HUUUUGE
---
I did my first time on a mage too. Best fight ever.
---
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but its entirely possible to not get any raid gear in 4 weeks of raiding. This isn't a "not your full set", this is a "not one piece of gear" sort of thing.
---
Husband and Wife combo here, NA, located EST.
---
We have a two year old and both work full time for our own businesses, so we are looking to play after the toddler goes to sleep, probably 9pm - 12am EST, Sunday - Thursday, and likely even Fridays too.  If that means a West Coast guild might be better for us, that's okay.  
---
We both played Vanilla and raided back in the day, but never cleared everything before TBC and we'd really like to clear it all now!  We didn't know each other back then and we're excited to play together this time around.  
---
Likely going to do PVP, Alliance,  Prot Warrior &amp; Shadow Priest (Yes, I'll re-spec the priest if I have to after 40...).  
---
Looking for a guild of more mature folks, age 30+ who want to be efficient in playing, raid successfully and do end game content, but also understand the occasional absence due to the RL adulting we've got to do.
---
If it matters, we're also going on vacation for 2 weeks (no gaming) end of September/early October so we might fall a bit behind in leveling, so ideally there's no pressure to level really quickly early on.
---
We're looking forward to reliving the fun guild chat and warm and fuzzy memories of 2006.  
---
PM me if we sound like a fit.
---
The whole notion of 'gear your tanks first' is kind of silly, ESPECIALLY in vanilla/classic. The only people that you should be competing with on drops are going to be other warriors. Your BIS weapon is Quel Serrar (before TF obviously, but QS is a non-raid item, everything else other than daggers in MC are too slow for you). Shields - Drillborer disk, again, no one to compete against.
---
I think everyone has the idea that "funnel gear to the MT, he gets priority on his upgrades" but in practice, MT gear is not something that really needs that much attention. If you have priority over the other warriors, you're essentially doing that already anyway.
---
I'm not saying this to be controversial, but I think there can be some "Public relations" gains by not going out and telling everyone that "MT GETS GEAR FIRST". Obviously the other warriors need to know that, hey, onslaught girdle is maybe BIS for your MT, so he has priority on that piece, but there's going to be very little overlap, especially as you progress and get into better itemized gear.
---
Accept
---
Niceeeeeee
---
Good luck.  I haven't had ANY luck finding PVP guides for Vanilla hunters, only PVE. 
---
for what it's worth 0/21/30 seems like a great spec to survive in BGs at first, and then once you get some better gear you can move points around to gain more offensive potential.
---
I heard today that he did get dealt with, a Gm ported him and the other Tauren to winterspring but they intervened a couple hrs too late so this happened at the tail end of the tourney
---
doesnt everyone just make characters anyway till they have the best 4 abilities anyway?
---
lol nice one bro
---
Don’t make tanks bid DKP. Just loot council all tank gear based on raid attendance. You can gear yourself up but don’t give all the best gear to yourself. That is not what’s best for morale or progression at any stage. You need multiple strong tanks who feel valued as key members of the raid, not a single tank hero GM Raid Leader who gives himself all the gear. Don’t be that manchild.
---
Yeah - file a bug report. Sounds like somethings broke, yo.
---
No it can be in there for a lot longer if you don't touch it
---
Agreed, boosting it up to 100% would be a game changer.  I personally think the guaranteed procs are always worth it, no knockback after receiving a crit, etc.  Now, five points for 70% with limited spells that some classes have is pretty underwhelming. 
---
I know I'm nitpicking this specific example because I'm a Druid player, but Nature's Focus has the down side of not working for PvP abilities.  If it worked for Wrath, Entangle Roots, Hibernate, etc it would go from a poor situational pickup to a mandatory one.
---
A Shaman for example can choose.  Healing Focus, which is 5 points and works like mentioned above is meh.  Eye of the Storm on the other hand is mandatory.  I just wouldn't group them all together as a must for PvP.
---
Yea how good is Snutz really? I dont follow retail PvP players but I know Ven is supposedly an extremely good mage player. Did Snutz play wrong or poorly here? From what I know warlocks usually destroy mages. Missed sacs and wasn't using Felhunter for dispels.
---
&gt;For a game famous for it's tight knit community and people going out of their way to help each other out. 
---
...You sure you'r talking about World of Warcraft? I mean, this is almost the LoL of mmo-rpgs.
---
I read the whole thing.
---
A bug
---
Same reason anyone can learn anything, to possibly protect themselves from this
---
So you have tank covered, now you can spend the next 45 minutes sitting in orgrimar looking for a healer
---
So I'm super dee duper confused. I've had beta since May 27th?
---
I am not a family member, nor a friend, nor a streamer. 
---
Did I just win the jackpot?
---
No idea, as this isn't something the average employee would know. Those will be pretty random based off testing need I imagine.
---
There were a lot of F&amp;F that still hadn't gotten in yet, and there were so many requests they sent the company wide email on Friday letting people know about when they would get in if they're on your priority list.
---
You can also see that group beating horde streamers R1 Glad groups also multiple times.
---
&gt; So some trash item you get cause nobody wanted it counts the same as absolute BiS gear?   
---
If you do main spec/off spec you could charge 0.5 for unwanted main spec gear.    
---
&gt; This seems like it will lead to ppl holding out for BiS items and not taking upgrades   
---
If it was a zero sum game, sure. But in reality people are competitive on the meters and want to progress. Playing high risk games for specific items will likely hurt them more than the collective.   
---
Plus these issues exist in all DKP systems.
---
No one has claimed it isn't?
---
I mean how snowflakes are now
---
I would guess that's your base stats, and you probably got talent points for your skills, and you could distribute them to raise base stats, weapon skills, magic skills, or crafting skills. gear would still increase base stats.
---
Appreciate the insight, thank you!
---
Looks like if you're not on F&amp;F your chances of getting in are slim now.
---
Not as big of a difference as 1/3 and 1/4
---
&lt;Envy&gt; PvP Server, Alliance | PvE Raiding Guild | EU
---
Envy are a long-running guild from private servers and retail looking for additional players at launch and beyond.
---
But first, let me start by giving you some general information about us.
---
History:
---
Formerly known as Millenium, Inside Job and Cobra Kai across various vanilla servers; we as a guild have been able to achieve consistant progression through content from release, while earning a position among top guilds. We’ve also accumulated a massive amount of vanilla information over a span of several years, and it’s safe to say our resources are some of the best out there. We are a moderate raiding guild with an experienced core that has been together for over two years now, and we plan to continue our success come Classic.
---
Raid Times:
---
Wednesday, Sunday and Monday
---
18:30 GMT - 22:30 GMT
---
Our raids take place on Wednesday, Sunday and Monday night at 18:00 until 22:00, and we prefer our raiders be available for slighty longer on Monday nights for progression periods; currently looking to start MC progression within three-weeks of launch. We will also host optional ZG raids (once released) throughout the week at the same time. We are currently seeking exceptional players of all classes and roles at the moment, though healers are always highly sought after.
---
We have big plans when Classic comes, but we can’t do it without your help! If Envy interests you, you can find more detailed information on how to join by visiting [https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/](https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/)
---
Additionally you can contact myself (Ancilla#0140) or probability#1475 on Discord via DM for more information.
---
Rolling a male dwarf priest... A short hairy man in a dress. I don’t think you can make that one look cool lol
---
idk, this is a beta, and everyone can somewhat agree that thhis is mostly for blizz to get views and interest. When there is a huge cash prize for some event on there beta servers, that they had to invite people to i think they can do w.e they want to that players character.
---
Is it open beta?
---
Oh look another troll post.
---
There’s some detailed profession guides on classic wow head that tell you exactly what materials and how many of them you’ll need to max a profession. 
---
Here’s what I plan to do. Pick a crafting profession that you’ll want to use at level 60, check the materials you’ll need to max it, then grab 2 gathering professions to use while levelling for collecting said materials. Start collecting along your levelling journey. You’ll know exactly how much materials you’ll need, and anything surplus of that can be sold on the AH. 
---
Any unusable greens I find will get put up for auction at a lowish price. This’ll increase the chances of a sale so that they’re not filling up your bank/bags. 
---
It may be worth picking up enchanting to DE those greens and sell the mats. It’s impossible to predict how the market will be at this point though.
---
are you eu?
---
Seems like the opinions are very divided on that. Staysafe and Asmongold just had a 45 min argument about that and neither side could agree with each other
---
It has to be a copy pasta, I refuse to believe that on this day, 4 minutes ago, someone came up with that and wrote it for me to read.
---
I would be surprised if there isn't a random wave within the next month though.
---
Seems Top 10 didnt worked out yet :D
---
I will get Skinning, but drop it at lvl 18-20.
---
Doesn't worth it for longer. Just to have enough gold for skills.
---
I'm really looking forward to the TBC and WotLK Classic servers that are (pretty inevitably) going to be released in future. With every expansion server they release, more people whose favourite expansions each one is will be re-subbing. Blizzard wants to (rightly so) leverage every possible revenue stream they are able to.
---
It really wouldn't surprise me to see more and more expansion servers popping up as time goes on. There are a large number of people whose favourite expansion was Cataclysm and an even larger number (from my observations over the years) whose favourite expansion is Pandaria. Every one of those people would re-subscribe given the opportunity to play those expansions (for real) again.   
---
Brack (President of Blizzard) has mentioned that with a successful Classic, the transition to Classic TBC would be doable:
---
&gt;*We certainly now have the ability to do it in a way that we never did before. It’s something that now has become possible.*
---
[Interview source](https://wccftech.com/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-tbc-wotlk/)
---
On a personal level, TBC was really when I started to enjoy dungeons (Heroics offered up great challenge with fun gear), as well as Karazhan which was the first WoW raid I participated in. As for WotLK it always felt like the culmination of learning from the dev team. Classes were mostly fun to play (in any spec), dungeons were smooth, but challenging. I know there is a lot of hate on Naxx, but I really enjoyed raiding it, and all the WotLK raids. I \*like\* flying mounts, I \*like\* 10 man raids, so for me... It was the best expansion and the one I am really excited to see come down the pipeline in a few years.
---
by design, it's unidirectional sharding. Obviously it's adapted from retail's sharding and they are testing it during the beta so wonky behavior is expected while they work out the kinks.
---
They've already committed to having no layers by end of phase 1. Until that changes, I don't see the point in bitching about it.
---
Wand on hot key 1, is vanilla
---
Officers share accounts all the time. This really isn't a problem.
---
Yeah I just grabbed Divine Intellect and Spiritual Focus. 15% was negligible, it barely adds anything onto the damage, certainly not worth it compared to the massive number of times I 100% survived huge pulls purely due to being able to heal without interruption.
---
Where did you find this delicious copypasta?!?
---
Thx. Good to know (and also that I apparently know literally nothing about tank itemization)...
---
Please oh mighty blizzard, have mercy on me. 
---
Please
---
That makes absolutely no sense.
---
not if both players are good then druid sux, druid only a good noob killer.
---
This gives me hope! My gf scrolls insta while watching Outlander. So you’re telling me there’s a chance!
---
Not as much as 1/4 is to 1/3.
---
Ah, Dragon's Call. How I farmed for that sword - never did get it in the end.
---
UNTIL NOW (soon)
---
Exactly this! The only issue is that Dire Maul won't be out immediately, so we'll have to find another way in the meantime.
---
It's hard to get my girlfriend to get into the game again and she played to 60 and raiding during vanilla.
---
Someone who has never played and also someone who doesn't play many video games in general it's going to be a hard sell.
---
Does she know that you are really interested and will be devoting time to classic? Maybe sell it as something to do together if you will be investing a lot of time into wow that could be a group activity.
---
There are tons of actual references in the game
---
Venomhide Ravasaur and Winterspring Frostsaber are missing
---
Agreed. That’s why I’m laughing at ppl complaining about it...
---
I think you need to start out with some gateway drugs, rather than leaping straight to WoW. I got my girlfriend into videogames (beyond basics like Mario Kart) starting with Civ6, then moved to adventure/rpg games with Zelda: BotW and Diablo 3, and crafting/grinding with Stardew Valley, and then kinda combining all that in Skyrim. Some of those we played together, some of those I had to force myself to leave the room so I wouldn't backseat drive. She's really enjoyed all of them, loves exploring the world, is driven by that sweet, sweet loot, and crushing bigger and badder enemies. Now she's excited that WoW is an opportunity to do those things together. I doubt she would have wanted to give it a try if it wasn't for the couple years building up to it.
---
Nah you've got it totally backwards. Not everything has to be 'good' for it to be fun. You can tryhard all you want, but remember people have leveled 1-60 wearing only gray items. So don't get all preachy about what's 'good.' Every item in the game is usable if you're not being a baby about stats.
---
Especially if said Hunter is walking around with Brokentooth. As a Mage that means blink for your life.
---
I wish they kept the distinction of buckler/shield. Would be so fun having a buckler on my rogue.
---
I generally agree with most of the above, but you're wrong about tanking at least up to the 30-35 instances. It's GEAR that matters, not talents. I barely noticed not having Redoubt when I tanked different instances in Beta both as 11/10/0 or 21/0/0.
---
I imagine once you get to Maraudon level then you'll likely not want to tank without a bunch of prot talents, especially imp RF due to scaling damage from the DPS you'll be tanking for, but at least up to Scarlet monastery a Paladin can tank just fine with 21 points in Holy and zero prot talents provided you keep your gear up to date (mostly armor/stamina). Of course Strength is fairly minor for threat and mana is an issue so the ideal prot set would probably be a 1:1:2 ratio of Str:Int:Stam with some bonus spirit for regen.
---
Did you learn about wounded knee?
---
He' Snutz
---
In beta, macros work like they do in retail so its would be more like
---
/cast \[mouseover,exists,help\]\[\] Polymorph
---
I always liked how ST didn't look like any other troll area. Very green and murky.
---
There were Blood Elves in Azshara, as well as that one escort quest in Ratchet.
---
Man i'm a grown ass but i'm also in and I dunno is it ok to cry ? I mean HELL YEAH I LOVE LIFE AGAIN LETS GO TO MARS ELON OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Unless Blizzard re-introduces Guild Banks, every hardcore guild is going to be sharing accounts.
---
But what if I already decided on mage before the tourney?
---
I think the hivemind is pretty clear on disliking him.
---
It was more a source; everyone who has fucking played beta and vanilla know without a shadow of a doubt that shit is whack. You can watch literally any PVE video recorded in vanilla and go kite a mob in beta - the difference is obvious and extreme. 
---
In vanilla, every shitter mage could AOE grind. It wasn't terrible hard. In the classic beta, some of the best mages in the world are struggling to pull it off because of leeway added post vanilla.
---
had something similar in an old guild
---
we would get ten points per raid we attended, but only the last ten raids counted, was roughly 3 weeks time.  so if you missed two in that time span, you would have 80 points (exceptions could be made for an emergency or vacation).  you then used these points to bid on items.  you could maintain 100 points by showing to every raid, but if you bid it all to ensure getting an item, it would be a couple of weeks before you had enough points to realistically win another bid.
---
it rewarded people that showed up consistently, and whether they were new or a long time member after a short time they were on equal footing in terms of ability to bid on gear - no stockpiling dkp, no gear going to some part time raider ahead of someone that was a stalwart.
---
I've leveled 3 wars myself. It's horrible. It's really really bad.
---
Looks like a win win
---
I don't think you need to get exalted with darnassus to ride the winterspring frostsaber?
---
those unit frames are shadowed unit frames
---
You missed the Venomhide Ravasaur for Horde
---
Using /duel to duel an opposing faction player, if theyre unflagged, attacking you during the duel will cause them to flag regardless and any other of your faction members can jump in and gank them during the duel.
---
Was usually only used when doing raids on xroads and Org. Would work well for PvE servers i imagine.
---
yah honestly OP sounds selfish af and seems to only care about his own gear. terrible leader imo
---
Ehh. I dont think make is very good vs druid. They can't control the fight in any way and that's their whole stick.
---
It’s an OK solution but not ideal obviously.
---
Personally I think an “ok” solution isn’t good enough and should find something better:/ no matter how you slice it the community is going to be somewhat divided on certain spontaneous events that happen out in the world. Even if this is for a short amount of time I feel like it detracts too much.
---
Not a game breaker obviously though it is annoying and will be eager when it goes away
---
Yup as a lock you can either give your vw a chance to get aggro while you skin and regen some of your own mana or you can put some dots on the mob with the vw or a fear while you skin.  Either way you're still pushing the pace of what your hp/mana/vw mana/vw threat balance can handle even while throwing skinning in.
---
It was added in WotLK, I also have that mention on the Alliance Quest mount.
---
that's shadowed unit frames, or pitbull back in vanilla.
---
Why should a bunch of people have to move just because of 1 asshole?
---
Why does 1 person, acting like an anti-social tool, have the power to make a whole raid move?
---
Why should that person have immunity for acting that way?
---
Seriously? What a load of shit.
---
I thought he stopped streaming after his dog died?
---
I find at 30 in beta right now with 21 in Holy then I can make fairly large pulls (maybe 4 same level mobs, more lower level) with a good 1h and shield and through a combination of 2-3 Consecs, SoR, Ret Aura, and healing via Divine Focus Holy Light, good stuns etc, they will all die fairly safely. Ret would kill them individually at similar pace to the full group but if al four pulled at once the ret would have to bubble/run or die, so it's more the safety as there are SOME packs in the world you just can't easily pull without a multi pull.
---

Here is where the animation started playing, but the debuff has not yet been applied: https://imgur.com/j0rah5K
---
And here is where the debuff was applied: https://imgur.com/byEZrzh
---
Definitely something is off, especially with how the mage that's much closer doesn't get stunned
---
My wife has never played a computer game. Her family would literally disown her if they knew she played WoW or has watched a few animes with me. They're weird haha they're from a small town and are scared shitless someone in the town will make fun of them for something like playing video games or watching super hero movies.
---
But that didn't stop me. It's my mission to break all those weird misconceptions that were ingrained in her haha I've got all the kids now to play some form of video game or similar lol
---
Well back to WoW:
---
My wife loves all things hunting but has never played a computer game so I told her in the most layman terms possible that she could play with us and just sneak around invisible and backstab people and skin animals. The skinning animals won her over haha. Started her on a human rogue (private vanilla server) and we all played together. While I was at work the next couple days she somehow got to level 18 by doing no quests simply killing and skinning things. Maxed out her skinning and leather working for her level and just loved seeing how much gold she could make from her professions. 
---
That segwayed her into exploring the world and really enjoying other aspects of the game. She loved to play with me and my friends and just follow us around and skin high level mobs haha that private server shut down and now she's excited for classic to release
---
It requires Tiger Riding, as you can see in the tooltip of the item. In order to get Tiger Riding you need to be either a Night Elf or exalted with Darnassus.
---
You spelled it correctly, so obviously you should not be a Night Elf.
---
Yup the turtles drop a particular grey, if you're a skinner cook grinder you probably know what I mean.  They only stack to 5 so you want to grind turtles close to a town ala hinterlands turtles for horde.  You will make an insane amount of gold while grinding there.
---
there is like zero good private players on beta, cause theyre no streamers like ven or soda
---
there was a private server tournament weeks ago, look at this:
---
https://challonge.com/de/n2tkz6do
---
No Goth, Seuche, Traque or Perplexity and other really good players on tournament - what do u expect
---
If she's not bound in killing things in a game you might as well forget it. My SO thinks wow is violent, I won't even tell you what she thought when she saw me play GOW.
---
I did manage to make her try a few times, she likes pandas so the ability to play a pandareen helped and I just explained her what each class does and she chose shaman by her self. 
---
Thing is, if she's not a gamer she will find the gameplay really overwhelming.
---
Best advice is to let her choose her race and class and play along side her. Don't give her orders or tell her the best way unless she asks. Just play along and don't overwhelm her, this is very important as the game will be overwhelming enough.
---
One of my favorite items in retail is the Precious Bloodthorn Loop, a ring with an on use ghetto invisibility/extra vanish. If you’re in a shitty pug that’s wiping a lot (timewalking f ex) just sacrifice a ring slot and use that baby, wait until you’re the last man standing and use the ring to escape (and save a bit of repair cost)!
---
This would be such a sick tattoo
---
A toweliee block is more valuable than an Alex block
---
I guess the "problem" with finding a tank for your 5man is having tanks whisper you as soon as you come online. 
---
Easy fix.
---
mines gone too now ''/
---
I just corruption everything and get a few shadow bolts off that's about it tbh unless it's a boss then I use amplify curse and CoA also
---

 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=13086](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13086) ? in 1.12 I don't think you need it.
---
What class is this spooky guy?
---
It works but it's a lot less reliable. Sitting wont trigger crit reactive procs. However if you were to stand up right as the attack lands against you then the game will read it as a regular crit and you will get a stack.
---
Problem is I could only reliably do it about 7/10 times on the Stress Test (With redoubt), and if you end up eating crits without getting a stack then it hurts your killspeed and extends downtime.
---

---
agree with you
---
It *might* be close, if you're trying to say an average geared mage vs Naxx geared warrior?? I assume this is what you meant to intend. It's hard to say, but I think the warrior would likely win in that scenario. A geared warrior hits ridiculously high and has ridiculously high health. It would only take a very small number of hits, even less with lucky crits, to wipe out a mage. Now I know the argument for mages always devolves into "just don't get hit 4Head" but it isn't that simple - warriors have a decent number of gap closers. You're almost certainly going to take at least a few hits against a decent warrior.
---
Still though, that's taking it to the extreme with a Naxx geared (or just very well geared in general) warrior vs average mage gear. Obviously outside of that, it becomes heavily sided towards the mage.
---
Could you give me some advice? I played a warrior back in vanilla but don't remember it well. I recently played warrior from 1-10 on LH and it felt way worse than it should be. Rage generation was close to 0. I could keep rend up most of the time but then wouldn't have any rage to heroic strike, and keeping battle shout up was cutting into rend uptime. Fighting single enemies that were 0-2 levels above me was only like 80% success rate based on RNG, and after a while I had to eat after every kill unless fighting green enemies.
---
I think the only thing I can remember from vanilla was that I preferred doing green quests over yellow, but I'm not sure if it's actually just way worse than I remember. Seems like having a 2hander makes all the difference in the world.
---
Staysafe doesnt have a solution a level 1 char can still go anywhere in the world. They could be killed by opposite faction if moved to contested territory right.... however they can still disrupt the duel by releasing on top of someone during the duel and attacking them before they get killed again ASSUMING opposite faction would cooporate and ONLY killed the griefer... which wont happen. 
---
Staysafe's argument of it didnt happen so it wouldnt be a problem is retarded. It only didnt happen coz they were in HORDE territory so there was no PvP available unless Horde would attack first which happend and immediately you had an alliance warlock Drain souling was it Venruuki? so he couldnt drink coz he was put into a combat.
---
Now Imagine contested territory with 200 ppl from opposite faction. Yea in no way people would not attack. There is no ingame solution to this other than constantly changing location by Warlocks summoning 50 ppl to other side of the world every few duels which is clearly insane ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS BEHAVIOUR IS AGAINST TOS. 
---
It's against the rules. And EVERYONE KNOWS that his character sole purpose was to be a dick. Clearly breaking ToS. No argument there.
---
?
---
Thats part of classic...that is the point.
---
No, it was big. It was just really time consuming.
---
That version has "Requires Riding (150)" in the tooltip, which is from the new mount system. We don't have 75 and 150 riding in our version, instead each race has their own riding skill.
---
Be s good player who knows how to play your class and CC you shouldn't have a problem.
---
LF buddies to get ready for classic with, practicing starting zones and/or testing classes (I'm not in beta but there's another way *raises eyebrows*) 
---
I'm 23 , NA (mountain time -- PST +1)  played a bit in vanilla, plan to go with an Alli caster but not sure yet.
---
Gonna be no lifing it pretty hard, looking for others who will also be partaking in the "no life" life 
---
Shoot me a DM I'm down to try and class or race tbh , just trying to get solid routes down for classic.
---
You can also hover over the stats on your character window to see what they contribute.
---
laughs in druid
---
He is just that weak the mobs dont even see him
---
Just be careful!
---
If youre somewhere unreachable by guards you can easily catch a ban, and with right click reporting being a thing, people will be busy trying to bring the hammer down
---
My point ultimately is, WoW is massively popular and profitable. Even today in its “decline”. The reason for this decline is less that WoW got worse and more than other substitutes got better at doing individual aspects of WoW—better than wow. 
---
People left WoW for mobas, Facebook, YouTube....wow had millions of people who weren’t really gamers and certainly weren’t mmo rpgs players in the traditional sense. 
---
WoW is a fantastic success and due to its long run time, has time capsules of itself that appeal to totally different groups. Due to their massive fan base, they can run multiple versions of their game with each version having more people than their competitors. 
---
I think looking at it as a failure is missing so much contextual data, that the statement “WoW is a dead game” comes off as ignorant.
---
good for them, they can deal with being locked out. Everytime i had my brother try and log in for me real quick, or even play from his pc i had an issue
---
Can't say I ever altered my approach to a fight based on the gear rather than the class.  Have also found gear doesn't equate much to skill in both myself and others, hah.
---
Most of the PvP I've been through has just been getting ganked, though.
---
Leaving a comment so I don't lose this three months from now when I figure out where the hell my friends are going to be.
---
o0 for sure. I was planning on maining a shaman before my brother told me he wanted to main a healer. I got an immediate murder boner and, am now playing a warrior. He's playing a shaman now lol. I love shaman because they are the only support in the game who doesn't need to respec to become an object of fear.
---
You literally answered the question by yourself that you should roll a gnome lol
---
They should have mentioned that you will only be watching others streaming it during the summer, you can play it at the end of it.
---
kys
---
Delicious delicious bait..
---
Keep going right.
---
Hi, /u/kingydakilla
---
If you want to kill other rogues go Human. Perception is fantastic at rogue hunting. Happy to make that decision more complicated lol
---
They did.  And he followed.  There are little to no places in wow anymore that a person can't get to.  So simply saying "Just go somewhere else" is completely asinine.
---
Yes, certain/some 'griefing' has been bannable. But you are stretching it heavily. People have been parking pets invisible at crossroad junctions, or camping StV areas forever. Gotta be case by case, and only the most severe should be looked at if they aren't breaking rules.  
---
We've all experienced the hell that can be going though StV. And most of us aren't pro streamers with friends to help. Most of us have been griefed to a point that we logout. I dont go to the GM and cry when it happens.   
---
Asmongold is no more important than any other person. I agree with the GM porting the dude who was griefing . But it better not become a habit. Its a slippery slope to start banning somebody because they are standing in an area messing with people dueling. They have just as much right to stand around and grief duelers as those duelers have to duel.  
---
Nobody is talking about how Streamers have an entire support group ready to login and assist them with anything, be it guarding them while they level, to camping an area, to taking over a town/zone.
---
Dwarf or Gnome if the only thing you're interested in is PvP imo. Humans are the PvE min-max. 
---
Female Dwarf if you want to feel special. A female Dwarf Rogue is like a triple rainbow or some shit
---
What do you mean "our version"? Classic? if classic is released in the 1.12 state it then it will be like how it was in my link
---
I need some more F&amp;F
---
You make far more on private servers. I believe you get more junk boxes on Classic compared to privates, but the loot is far less. You do get more gems, but the problem is Rogues Diary which on private servers vendors for 45s and on the beta it only vendors for like 2s50c. That alone will make pickpocket farming not viable if it isn’t a bug.
---
This is very true. It definitely feels like Ret's power is weighted in the level 40 point of getting maxed vengeance. At this point it will be curious to do a side by side comparison of a SoComm 31 Ret paladin vs a SoR 31 Holy paladin in similar gear.
---
If they up the level cap to 40 in the Beta hopefully i can do a test with another paladin on this. 
---
The main advantage to avoiding Ret is to make teh instancing and outdoor grouping just more "fun" due to being more specced for things. I've healed as prot and whilst it went okay it just felt far more stressful than goign as Holy and being able to churn out bigger heals with guaranteed crits and more mana. 
---
Couple this with what I wholeheartedly beleive to be noticeably more survivability on dodgy pulls and it MAY be enough to make a Holy-with-2h levelling style appealing as an alternative. Or at least not slow enough that it feels bad. It doesnt have to be the FASTEST, it just has to be fun, and often people give the advice of avoiding prot/heal specs because the slow kill speed is unfun. Very much a subjective thing.
---
Hate on it all you want, it's gonna be there and not for the entire game anyways.
---
Yeah, report me for being toxic for implying that you're still in school.  Such a toxic thing to say.
---
So it's called network compensation because it compensates for shittier networks, right?
---
Well internet used to be significantly worse back in the day, and so were computers. This is why we have the 16 buff limit, the spell batch windows, etc. They weren't design decisions, they were necessary to make a playable game.
---
Network compensation is another one of those things that isn't necessary anymore but which was mandatory originally. Blizz may be bringing forward the original compensation for the sake of authenticity.
---
I'm sure they've tuned it better on bfa servers, but since they want to release classic as similar as possible to vanilla, it seems like they're going back to old compensation that was for really, really terrible internet.
---
Remind me! 83 days
---
No I don't think that many want vanilla to just be stagnant forever. Blizzard didn't spend all that money and effort to revamp it just to leave it alone.
---
And no I won't be surprised. There aren't that many that want Vanilla with no content updates ever.
---
I'm sure if it blows up there will be enough people that just want Vanilla to justify Blizz to have their own server. Everyone will be happy.
---
And if you can perform both roles at a high level it becomes one of the most complex as well.
---
&gt; here's literally nothing worth fighting over
---
*Of course!* Why was everyone being **so stupid.** All we had to do is realize that they're literally nothing worth fighting over!
---
Check VW skill bar to make sure they are toggled on.
---
&gt;What if the opposing faction came and stood on the totems? Do you have a right to remove them?
---
This is a PvP problem with a PvP solution, therefore Blizzards official stance is this is not griefing and they won't involve themselves in it.
---
Same-faction griefing has no PvP solution, and Blizzard considers these things griefing. They intervene in this circumstances, and its literally the reason the report button exists as a feature at all.
---
real men don't need to use macros for this, l2play skill son. In b4 decursive, lazy healers
---
"But in reality people are competitive on the meters and want to progress. Playing high risk games for specific items will likely hurt them more than the collective."
---
The way I see it, it is just as likely to hurt them to take an upgrade as it isn't. I guarantee warriors are going to pass on Claw of the Black Drake in favor of any other weapon from BWL. You don't want to have "gotten" an item noone else did because you are surely not going to get Maladath or another good weapon that way. Taking the Claw only puts you ahead on meters until any of the better weapons drops. Seems like a dumb decision all around to take the Claw.
---
It would seem that the assumption that players are competitive on the meters means this system IS going to hurt the collective. I just hate DKP systems it seems like they inherently hurt your group's progression because of individual greed.
---
Speaking of concentration aura, how does that come in? 
---
Additive with talents (70%-&gt;105%), or multiplicative (70%-&gt;80%)?
---
And improved concentration - does it go from (35-&gt;40-&gt;45-&gt;50) or (35-&gt;37-&gt;39-&gt;40)?
---
That sounds like a fantastic memory to have.
---
I've been kiting in the beta, you just have to not wait too long or they will beat you down as you run. 
---
I do remember this being the case to some degree in Vanilla, but I couldn't say to what extent. I've definitely been frustrated by it before though, seeing a mob hit me from a considerable distance. Not including the actual mob glitch that would happen rarely but pretty much have them hit you from across a zone.
---
They are called dragon *kill* points for a reason 
---
Why on earth would you get points for attempts? Its not like theres a team somewhere else getting points so that raid members would feel behind
---
Everyone who is new to the game always starts a human warrior. If you don’t do that then you’re not playing the game right.
---
In all seriousness; that’s what got me into it. I put the game down and thought it was the most boring game. 
---
Came back and made a human mage. I was extremely happy after that
---
Then like 2 weeks later burning crusade came out and I made me a blood elf mage. Never went back.
---
Never had issues when i raided as a dagger rogue. We raided through AQ, BWL, and early parts of Naxx easily and was usually on par with sword rogues in terms of dps. Some fights we were ahead, others we weren't but it also boiled down to the skill level of the player. Id say, play whatever you want and whatever you think you will be best at.
---
I had that breastplate til I got Vindicators. I practically lived in UBRS even after MC/BWL and saw it drop 5 times. I actually got a second carapace later from a greed roll when no one wanted it.
---
NA, PVP, Alliance. 1 to 2 raid nights per week.
---
I'm rolling with 5+ people on launch. the Majority of us will continue to raid in BfA, we are just looking for a super chill casual-ish guild to raid once or twice a week with. A few of us are avid PvPers.
---
Confirmed classes: Pally, Rogue, Priest, and Warrior. The rest are undecided.
---
Contact me on Discord if you are interested! :)   Smoothiez#4444
---
I haven’t seen it and I don’t see a spoiler in the post. What are you talking about?
---
I might do it on my alt, but on my main I'm just rushing to 60.
---
Which is why I agree with what they did, but hope they dont start favoring streamers once its live.
---
With a beta they can operate how they want to increase exposure/advertisement/interest for sure. But once were live, anything not already bannable is game. I mean this was a user created dueling event, once beta is over an event like this should get zero GM support unless absolutely needed. They can run these events in ways that prevent griefing, or deal with it.
---
But like you said its the beta, I def agree the dude needed porting out.
---
the alliance desperately needed an additional bonus when protecting that bridge which as we all know is so notoriously easy for the horde to get past.
---
Continue being scared baby
---
BeaStanellosGhost, no!  Not the younglings!
---
You beat me to posting the link. The sad fact is that tacking extrinsic rewards onto broken gameplay is easier and cheaper and has a more predicable outcome than making good gameplay to start with.
---
The way I got my then girlfriend (now wife) into wow was just by talking about it and playing it and she was curious and into it because how much I love it. 
---
When we got it fired up for her my main thing was to let her drive. I didn’t give her any advice about what race or class to play, I let her do the reading and make the choice. Of course answer questions, but try not to take away the experience of it being new and unknown. 
---
Let them take the lead when you’re out questing and doing stuff, go at their pace.
---
Lol if you think skipping a few weeks wont lose you your raid spot
---
You should venture out a bit more on Reddit. This sub is pretty tame.
---
To be fair, gaming was pretty toxic back then. Classic is just bringing out the best in us.
---
Oh shut up, you know you wont be invited into any group!
---
Read the patch notes I posted. Its actually is quite very much correct.
---
what an asshole.
---
Wow nice detective work :D
---
It looks even crazier looking at the mage's positioning.
---
The series began in 1991.
---
You can expect the marginal propensity to consume to adjust over the short-run as demand shifts between mounts, enchantments, and maxing professions.  So short run aggregate demand will be highly variable, but the monetary base will grow rapidly as players max level &amp; quest so the velocity of gold.... oh no I’m not making any sense. 
---
Would actually be cool if someone qualified could track economic metrics through the first couple months of classic though.  
---
What data points could be measured beyond indexing AH prices for mats &amp; gear?
---
It still need some work so people wont abuse it so easily for profit
---
Geez save some talent for the rest of us, guy/lady
---
Im not sure where I read this, but it said \~3k players per layer with whatever amount of layers until initial burst of people quit and servers start to settle and then they will remove layers.
---
I ran 21marks/30surv dps spec back in the day and used to always be top 3 on the dmg meter.
---
I never saw a marks hunter beat me... I did have cherry picked agility gear BiS pretty much vs their T2/T3 and it used to piss them off so bad.
---
Also just understand that clipping/interupting your autoshot is bad ;)
---
That’s awesome. 
---
Night elf hunter next? ;)
---
It would be nice if they would tell us what the plan is if they get to the end of phase 1 and the server pops havent declined to a single layer pop.  
---
I think that's why a lot of people are worrying about layering hanging around longer.
---
and now I cry again
---
Still loved my vanilla warrior! BloodyDmoney, first ever main. Cannot wait for August, I’ll die 1000 times reaching level 60 and I’ll love every second of it!
---
I'd say it depends on your goals.
---
Is your goal to get to 60 fast and start gearing/pvping, or is your goal to stop and smell the roses as you level, even if it takes significantly longer to get to 60?
---
If you want to get to max level ASAP, get an addon that tells you where to go while questing.
---
If youre fine with going slower, dont get an addon and you'll have to read the quests to know where to go.
---
If you're new to the game, its rough. It was my first class, and it was just brutal. I specced tank spec (before they revamped it), I sometimes laugh at how bad I was. It wasnt until i was level 50 before i discovered how powerful MS was.
---
If you're experienced and know the warriors strengths and weaknesses, they're really not bad for solo leveling, and pretty engaging depending on your playstyle.
---
Going to go AoE spec but just follow Joana's guide. Last time I leveled a mage on a pserver it was nice to have the option to AoE quest mobs or grind for an hour if the spot is uncontested.
---
If it turns out that I don't get a chance to AoE I'll just respec single target shatter.
---
They should just have different locks spread across the world, summon to a random location for the duel, the trolls cant keep up.
---
I used to have the statue order in my guild note as reference lmao. Can't wait.
---
The goal is a normal server population. About 3k. However, some realms are going to have more than this after layering is removed. Particularly streamer servers. I'm wondering what they'll do to solve the problem. I'm 100% sure Asmon or Soda's server will have like 10k people on the realm after layering is removed.
---
I think the only thing they can really do there is to offer free realm transfers to other realms. T
---
Yeah idk what world people are in where they can be late...  no need for bonus on time points if being late means you dont raid.
---
no it cant. the 30 days mailbox timer does not work on COD mail. check in beta
---
Funny that you took time to read a post history. I didnt even take time to read your name, so thats cool :)
---
After levelling a Warlock and having every Hunter past lvl 40 sic his pet with Bestial Wrath on me I can understand his motivation.
---
If they did teleport him away I'm simply misinformed. How do you know that they did it and it was not due to phasing or simply him logging off?
---
I'm not aruging for the right of players to grief so it's not like I'm losing a battle here.
---
There is no real protection in place for community events like a dueling tournament, is every tournament warranted a GM intervention or is it only for big streamers?
---
If they were to host a race to the Orgrimmar gates, are they going to teleport away everyone standing on the finish line so they can have a proper photo finish?
---
A lot of people, myself included, enjoyed the tournament and events like that can be hugely beneficial for the popularity of Classic, but there's always going to be people ready to grief and needing GM intervention every time someone decides to do something fun like this just does not sit right with me. 
---
GM intervention is not going to be rare in Classic when streamers bring several thousand viewers every time they do something.
---
They are not using the 1.12 mount system. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit
---
Yeah it is, im using Luna unit frames
---
I'm not saying you should encourage it or that you have to like it.  I think "ganking" is a ridiculous idea and doesn't prove anything except you like to step in and mess up other people's day.  People can complain about it, such, but using terms like "gatekeeping" is absolutely ludicrous.
---
Similarly, making it a comparison to being racist.  Seriously?  I don't like people ganking, but it's not comparable to racism.  If we're going to talk about comparisons to racism, then the whole "my faction is better than yours" and a lot of the associated vitriol that comes with it is a better comparison (because it pretty much is in-game "racism" and gets about as vicious at times).
---
I wouldn't go to bat for outright banning ganking in WoW, but I'd totally be on board with banning racist comments, and while someone repeatedly ganking should probably get a suspension, I'd be all for a suspension the first time someone drops the n-word or similar rhetoric (ditto for homophobic remarks and similar stuff), and a full ban if they continue... because they're not comparable behaviors.
---
Human mage!
---
This has to be the dumbest little kid opinion I have ever heard. I have no problem with trolling on a main. Because reputation matters. Hiding on a level one alt and ruining something literally 110k other people are trying to enjoy. For fuck sake the amount of pathetic narcissism in your post is off the charts. At the very least you should be able to inspect him and see his main.
---
MSc Financial Economics here and i believe the classic-WoW economy is quite predictable. 
---
TL;DR: Inflation in AH-prices as the cumulative wealth of the server increases. 
---
First few weeks/months, everyone will be dirt poor. Also, a lot of people will be selling leather/bars/herbs to scrap together enough gold for their precious mounts and abilities. The supply of crafting mats will be far greater than demand for said items, so AH prices will probably be vendor price + small mark-up. A few exeptions of course (rare crafting mats). If one manages to get ahead of the curve in terms of gold, this will be a great time to level professions at a cheap price. But then again: "cheap" is a relative term. 
---
As for blue/epic BoE's: they wont sell that easy the first months when people are low on gold. As players get more gold between their hands, prices will increase too. In particular when people are starting to level alts. 
---
Another important concept is the expected future value of items. For example: as new content is released, there will be new crafted items in demand, making some crafting materials more expensive. But: You know, I know and everyone else knows that crafted item xyz is comming and that you need material a, b and c to make it. So: do you sell those items today, or do you wait a month until the new content patch arrives? In anticipation of the new content release, people will start stacking up on the items, thus bringing the prices up.
---
Oh I did.
---
No one would have blamed them.  Everyone was expecting the alliance to raid the tourney.  But it was in good form that they didn't.
---
\&gt; not applying hamstring while levelling weapon skill
---
I think it was but it was fixed before even Onyxia was released.
---
Defias Pillagers specifically.
---
I tried to play Warrior on a Vanilla private server many years ago. I tried to do dual wield and wondered why  I got kicked out of the dungeon party.
---
as for bannable: depends on the game and how much the individual is doing it. 
---
as for "why not wow": i please refer to the last sentence of my previous post.
---
What's gonna happen is while on my mage it'll drop every single time while farming for briarwood reed and then the moment I try to gear up a warrior it'll never appear.
---
Show us, on this doll, where the MT touched you.
---
What happened with this guy?  Not super into the streamer / content creator stuff but what’s the deal with this guy?  He go off the deep end or something?
---
I got this gun on all of my 29 twinks
---
A lot of people who frequent reddit maybe, but the average player doesn't do any research whatsoever and just plays.
---
Expect many people to refuse to heal as pally and then get mad when they aren't taken into content e.g
---
You shouldn't use Heroic Strike much. You want to save all the rage you can for the tough pulls. Just keep rend/battle shout up and save rage. Then, if you happen to fight a high level mob or if you pull 2, you can dump all that rage into Heroic Strike, maybe a Thunder Clap if it does enough damage to kill one of the mobs. 
---
At level 8, you can start doing the Hamstring method, it works well on private servers atleast.
---
Lol Druid has been my fav since I started in tbc, but since I started deciding what I wanted to main for classic I kept switching around bc druids aren’t particularly great in any specific area (except speed maybe) but at the same time the fact that they’re so versatile is one of the main reasons I love the class so I can’t really choose a different main :)
---
Getting into groups doesnt necessarily mean you'll do as good a job of course - for those who enjoy healing and want to focus it as their role at 60 you can certainly run around in holy spec with a two hander, strength gear and SoR and kill "fast enough". Fun is subjective and as long as you're killing fast enough to not FEEL slow then it's fine.
---
Obviously levelling with 1h/shield/int gear would be horrendous but as long as you detach the concept of gear/weapon from your talent points Holy can still do damage.
---
Note that you CAN judge with max rank SoR at all times during levelling as Holy and have zero mana issues, so if you're not judging with SoComm you're missing out on potential dps with it. I'd argue actually having a constant frequent nuke is more "fun" than just auto attack waiting for a proc. 
---
Do note that it's also been proven that for SUSTAINED damage, SoR can generally outdps SoComm depending on various factors, so don't think it's completely worthless. If you get a really fast two hander with high DPS then SoR can still be really useful regardless.
---
&gt; I just dont support borderline harrassment and bullying.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Also I'm interested in discussing Classic, no matter if I'm going to play it or not.
---
Having the unarmored mounts be unavailable doesn't make sense to me, especially since we are using the original mount system, not the 1.12 version.
---
I am pretty sure the guy was a hunter too.  I'm not sure if he got griefed when he did the quest and just became bitter and wanted to continue the cycle of griefing, or what.
---
It possible. It would be the easiest way to do it and would probably make a lot of people happy.
---
The best argument I've heard against was from an original vanilla WoW dev. His argument for not doing TBC and making new content was this; If you go down the Expansion Classic server route you're eventually going to end up in the same retail wow situation we're in now.
---
I love TBC. But after watching his stream I'm firmly in the new Classic content. I'd love to see Outland again, but I think the best thing for the game is to move forward using Classic game design philosophies.
---
fuck the streamer realms, i fight for the seven kingdoms
---
This was posted like yesterday
---
Seeing an item while levelling, saying hey that's neat and I wish I could incorporate it into my playstyle, and then vendoring it an hour later because I got a drop that was significantly better is really, really disappointing.
---
And then you never see another item like it again because it was a one-off and you feel worse cause it shows that they wanted to explore a design space that they didn't have time to really explore in depth and now you'll only be able to imagine how cool of a game it'd be if they had come anywhere near finishing it.
---
Thank you all who have responded so far I will be responding thoroughly once I am back home I do truly appreciate it :)
---
I ran the 21marks/30 surv dps spec back during vanilla and with my cherry picked agility gear I used to smoke marks hunters in their T2/T3 gear.
---
It was powerful spec and scaled well that is for damn sure.
---
Oh interesting! I didn't see that - Thanks for the heads up about this and nice work on the website. The Frostsaber grind becomes that much longer..
---
Oh shit got in, thanks. Wasn't aware I was top 3 or that even existed lmao but someone did add me.

Chernobyl being a disaster
---
Blood elves ruined the horde, lost all the charm with half the playerbase looking like alliance
---
Priests can’t wear mail and a shield. Or drop WF totems. 
---
Also water is wet and the sky is blue.
---
I recommend you turn on instant quest text in the interface options I can read much faster than the text appears.
---
Yeah, I watched Sony duel for hours. The WW axe is insane, but only when you can actually attack with it (i.e. dueling melee classes).
---
Against any caster the warrior can get chain cc’d or kited until dead. Level 30 warriors can even lose to rogues due partially to rot kiting in dead zone.
---
It’s clear to anyone who has been watching duels and/or the tournament that warriors aren’t dueling champions @ level 30, but they’re the most popular class so people get upset by the truth.
---
lol you must be very smart and also skilled at the game!
---
Well no reason to check, im surelt not on any friends and family list :p
---
yes indeed, I heard UK has a lot of stoning enthusiasts as of late
---
This.  I'm going to go HotW tank and heal spec at 60.  I'll tank the dungeons and heal raids.  I'll just suck pretty bad at PvP.
---
His point is still valid.  Your backstory is about as weak as they come.  Also, you mean to say 'horde' not 'hoard'.  Dictionaries are our friends.
---
They're using the mount system that was there before 1.12. Like I've already explained, there was:
---
Horse Riding
---
Ram Riding
---
Tiger Riding
---
Mechanostrider Piloting
---
Wolf Riding
---
Undead Horsemanship
---
Kodo Riding
---
Raptor Riding
---
Some mounts didn't even need anything at all to use them, other than the level requirement. Just look at my guide and when you hover over a mount it usually says if it for example requires "Wolf Riding" or only a level.
---
The unstoppable force meets the immovable object and thus appears GM (forgot his name)

Man GMS were.lit bacj then

Blizzard intervening to teleport someone, who is playing the game that they paid for, how they want to play it. Ridiculous. I was watching Soda (I think?) during this and he was bitching non stop about the Taurens that were trolling, saying Blizzard should perma ban their entire accounts for interfering with a duel tourney in open world on an MMO with a large PvP focus. I'm usually whatever about the streamers, but if Blizzard is going to interfere with the game, and individual players, based on streamer whining then Classic is already fucked. 
---
The other night I was doing WSG's, noticed we were against Swifty and his premades. Turns out there was a druid on our team, Life, who was wall jumping the flag. He starts saying we were a premade who were going into the game with the intent of cheating to win because it's the only way we could win. Called us all cheaters and was tweeting Blizzard to ban us. There was no premade on Horde, just one cheater. Alliance were doing the same thing on his side and the next night in WSG as well - not one of his premades where he whined about losing to his stream until he got 3-4 healers to join and heal only him. He was literally saying "Just heal me and do nothing else and we'll win" because he was convinced that we (the Horde team) was working together to kill only him. 
---
Paranoid, narcissistic man-babies, the both of them.
---
The next game when Life joined 3-4 people called him out as a cheater and he didn't run the flag that game. The average player doesn't want to cheat to win, especially in a Beta where everything is going to be wiped soon. But to call out an entire group of 9 people as cheaters when it's only 1 cheater and saying Blizzard should ban us all is asinine.
---
I was planning something similar, but i'd definitely urge you to consider taking Spiritual Focus over imp SOR.
---
The 15% damage on top of something which is already only about 20% of your damage isnt a big boost compared to the ability to heal when surrounded by a huge pack of mobs. I tried imp SOR and levelled with it for a while but SF just was SO much better overall.
---
Your comment is actually the best comment here
---
Barrens chat was hella fun to interact in. All the chuck norris.jokes. and I even had a macro of an epic tale of Twink, the level 1 orc rogue.
---
I know of at least 3 friends who are getting back into, a 4th is thinking about subbing for the first time. I haven't played since 2007 and I will be in day 1.
---
Yikes.
---
that's fair, I just mean like it feels horrendous that a legendary off a final boss of an expansion isn't made to be better than everything
---
Yeah maybe diablo 4 to make up for last years blizzcon. But they are gonna need something to sell and diablo 4 will probably be a ways away. I could see an announcement but maybe not too much info about it.
---
The bar is pretty low for blizzcon this year so as long as they do something it should be a good time. Just no more mobile shit pls.
---
Spell batching, basically artificial lag Blizzard added to simulate the vanilla experience. You press an ability and it will only take effect a few frames later, unlike on Pservers where it happens instantly.
---
The guide assumes we are using thr old version of mount training and not 1.12. Has this been confirmed ?
---
The T2 Paladin set has to be one of the most universally appraised World of Warcraft sets. But also yes, it is way more likely I get a T2 set than a T3 set.
---
If you check on wowhead, comments from 2006-07 states that they sold for 45s, so it might be a bug idk.
---
Loved it, no drama involved. Guess every loot-system was only as good as the raidmembers.
---
I'm completely fine with that.
---
It's just funny to see how the romanticization of the "organic community" that has been parroted since classic was announced proceeds to crumble instantly as soon as the first instance of griefing comes to light.
---
I think there's a large group of people who have no idea what they're in for.
---
TIL, that's really cool.
---
~~of reddit~~ of the internet
---
To me rolling another character just to support your warrior is pretty wasteful imo.  I guess you get two level 60s at that point, but any slowdown in a Warrior's leveling is easily overcome in a lot less than another 8-10 days /played.
---
Like this is any compelling reason to speak with you.  Call me yellow next Biff.  Talking with you would be a bigger mistake than this conversation has been.  It's clearly going nowhere from here and has for some time.
---
&lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
What to expect
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week, and additional nights may come into play after launch. Unorthodox specs such are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
We often hang out and socialise while we wait for classic launch. Additionally, we host our own vanilla server for us to jump on, test some things and have some fun every now and then.
---
We are currently accepting raid leader applications!
---
Raid dates: Thursday &amp; Tuesday
---
Raid times: 7:50 PM GMT

---
&gt; **From the classic demo, we learned that the riding system is the older race riding one, instead of the profession-esque system we have today in modern wow introduced in Patch 1.12.1. What was the train of thought behind this decision?**
---
&gt; The modern riding system was introduced in one of the later 1.12 patches, and as we were discussing it, we felt this system was added to prepare the game for Burning Crusade, which had the ability to ride flying mounts.
---
&gt; For most of the history of WoW Classic, throughout 2004 and 2005, we had the older mount system. It just felt more authentic to that game, to use the older one instead of one that just laid the groundwork for another expansion.
---
&gt; Blizzard intervening to teleport someone, who is playing the game that they paid for
---
gonna stop you right there, this is a closed beta. They are paying for retail subscription currently.  Blizzard can do w.e they want in a beta
---
I had  60 warrior on nost, worst experience of my life leveling, and very little reward as a fresh 60 because noone needed a non geared tank, so I couldn't get gear, ended up just going arms and pvp'd that was fun though.
---
Can’t blame you :D I’ve always loved versatile classes as well as support so I just can’t see myself maining anything else, plus if I try to I’m gonna regret it every time I see a tauren cat running around out there (Tauren kitties were the main reason I switched from alliance to horde lol)
---
From a noobie perspective, Im missing one layer. What if you are the only one, who needs it? But you dont want to lose all your points, because a better item might drop later on. But you would still benefit from that item more than any other /greed guy. Which means, it would be good, if you add one more layer. After nobody needs it, there will be free roll for anyone, who would get an upgrade from it. Points would not be lost here. After that, there would be /greed roll.
---
I'd prefer a diablo II LoD remastered. I'm still sad about diablo 3.
---
The Gurubashi Arena is way too small for this. Almost every duel had a form of cc into run away until you left combat and then eat/drink. It would be impossible to do this in the arena.
---
Arguably that is a good thing, but it would change the balance a lot.
---
They did teleport him away, there's a SS where he told Sodapoppin they moved him to Winterspring.
---
There will be no more intervention than there was in retail. I come from RP servers and griefing is an everyday occurrence even on those. I only ever saw someone act as flagrantly as that guy maybe twice during all of wow, and both times they were actioned in some way. 
---
It's not like you can get removed just because you disobey a streamer or something. It has to be a clear, long-term, dedicated effort to stop people from being able to play the game, unresolvable with pvp or other means.
---
These rules protect everyone, not just streamers.
---
Nooooooooo its tooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooong time!!!!!

**\*\*&lt;Maelstrom&gt;\*\* NA-PvP Alliance community is recruiting more players for the launch of WoW-Classic. We’re a serious progression guild with a 3 night per week raid schedule. T/W/TH @ 8-11pm Central Time.** 
---
**Our core team consists of many members who successfully lead and cleared Naxxramas on private servers as well as has been a part of other top 100 retail guilds in the past.**
---
**Currently we have been raiding together on a private test server in preparation for the release of Classic. We expect all recruits to participate in our Tuesday practice raids.** 
---
**We strongly believe that by playing together prior to launch of Classic will give us an advantage in terms of progression as well as allow us to get know each other better.**
---
**\*\*Current Class Needs\*\***
---
**Holy Paladin**
---
**Holy Priest**
---
**Rogue**
---
**Fury Warrior**
---
**Warlock**
---
**\*\*Member Expectations\*\***
---
**We expect all trials as well as members to be able to maintain a nearly perfect raid attendance. All players are expected to be online at least 15 minutes prior to raid start with consumables, repair money, proper gear enchants, and a good attitude.** 
---
**Members will be required to level a 20 warlock and summoning alts for world bosses.**
---
**\*\*Loot System\*\***
---
**Maelstrom uses a loot council system where officers award loot to members based on attendance, size of upgrade, performance inside and outside of a raid, and an overall benefit to the progression of the guild.** 
---
**To ensure fairness, officers do not vote on their own loot bids. Trials are not eligible to bid on loot unless all members have passed.**
---
**\*\*Contact\***

**If you meet the requirements and want to chat, send me a msg on discord. Frost#6270**
---
For sure a bug.

Mind Control: Hillarity at the 1k Needles Elevator
---
Can you kill the priest BEFORE you believe you can fly?
---
You are missing what he’s saying. By making snapshotting way too powerful they had to remove it. 
---
I don’t think he was advocating against its usage.
---
&gt; Back in vanilla a lot of people just never bothered to enchant their gear. 
---
?????????
---
I’ve already reported it a few days ago ingame so we’ll see if anything changes.
---
Your buddy never had an account before? But got beta invite?
---
That action bar is all wrong for classic
---
Lost all charm seems like a massive overstatement but, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I still want Blood elves. Or at the very least Female undead models that aren't rotting. So girls can look "cute".
---
Get a ranged weapon ASAP and use it to pull a single mob from tight groups. Just shoot and run, since you damaged it, it will stay on you longer since there's infinite leashing in vanilla.
---
Private server lol
---
And they did have an economist on the payroll. I don't know if they did from the start and Eve doesn't have market resets so that ship has sailed.
---
I was curious how that worked on classic. What makes it more difficult?
---
Why? Feral's great for dungeons, good off-tank for raids with a valuable buff, and resto is great in general. Not having a ressurect spell is a concern for people who plan on dying.
---
i guess its loot lists
---
but divvy out the loot after the boss is downed
---
Try questing in that hidden alcove southwest of arathi highlands without it. It's a pain.
---
Yeah 13 ret is just a no brainer, Seal of command and 8% movement speed bonus.  
---
I went holy first and then watched my brother out level me by 10 in a week as ret. I went back and respecced to get seal of command. i dont think the speed bonus was implimented yet so i just had 11 points in ret, but after the talent adjust i put 13 into ret to get the 8% movement bonus  
---
after 1.12 my spec was something close to  [Legacy-WoW.com/vanilla-talents/paladin-talents/?tal=15503100521251000000000000000322030512200000](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/paladin-talents/?tal=15503100521251000000000000000322030512200000)   
---
this spec is a little more heal focused, you can move around some points especially the first talents in each spec to suit your needs  
---
lasting judgement i probably didnt put points in in vanilla, but i would now  
---
i call it a shockadin build. i had unstoppable force  
---
spent 80% of the time healing, 10% kicking ass, 10% stun or fear locked
---
I know the feeling! For the longest tim I gravitated towards priest, but I said goddamn no, not playing the same class. At the same time in my time in ps's I realized I was fed up with its weaknesses...but if you haven't tasted the provedbial greener grass elsewhere, why not:)
---
&gt;gonna stop you right there, this is a closed beta.
---
gonna stop you right there. It doesn't matter. Blizzard intervening on behalf of whining children is bad for the game, no matter the stage. Also, you *have* to be paying for retail to get into beta, so they are paying for both. Just like when Classic launches, it will be one sub still.
---
Sweet molasses, that is waaaaay less than the pserver I am on
---
I'm just fuckin' with ya.
---
Same argument (at its core) that people have with SoulsBourne games. Some people want features and QoL changes (and straight up difficulty changes) to make the game more accessible. But making the game more accessible in some ways just cripples what makes the game great.   
---
people forget that challenging / tedious tasks can often time lead to long term satisfaction. Bliz just gave into the "I want it now / instant gratification" crowed which I think the gaming industry has done in general.
---
Beat me to it lol
---
Then you are in the wrong subreddit
---
Just get him to restart game and log in again.
---
Just curious, why do people noggen/savory all the time?
---
You can say that all you want, but it doesn't mean anything.
---
if you act like an asshole and same-faction grief, you should accept the risk of what can happen.
---
Buncha fuckin babies  thinking they're EPIC TRULLZ, can do whatever they want then cry when they get sanctioned. it's pathetic.
---
Don't bother criticizing classic or people will hit you with the, "just go play retail hurrr" shit and avoid the conversation entirely
---
They have the same models in vanilla.
---

Mine would be similar but with more humane hair and that leather X wrapped around his face.

Forsaken warlocks ftw
---
It's better than 4rd or 5nd
---
Soda was robbed
---
Why would they add this?
---
Yup, annoying AF if someone screwed up and you had to all the waves over again.
---
However SSC,TK, BT and Sunwell were all awesome raids. ZA was super nice to run with friends, and Karazhan ofc. 
---
I think they hit the perfect spot regarding catch up gear via reputations/badges/crafting in TBC while there were great trinkets still dropping in t4/t5 so good people always had an incentive to run them again.
---
All guilds will have to use Loot Council for some items no matter what so why not just use LC? On private server its super rare with DKP guilds. If it was good guilds would use it more.
---
Its a beta. Arn’t you doing the same man baby thing now by arguing that blizz devs are being unfair to troll man. Nobody is paying for beta its a blizz dev playground. The god mode buff on Omar is not for show. They run that town and w.e they want goes. This equality for all garbage is what lead us to retail. Let blizzard have fun ....
---
"Behaved"... How arrogant. The trolls are playing the game how they want to play. Just because someone decided to organize an event in an MMO doesn't mean everyone must adhere to or respect what they are doing. It's the point of an MMO and the point of a PVP server.
---
Isn't hamstring only beneficial if your swing timer is really low compared to the monsters? And yea that's all pretty much what I've been doing, it's just amazing that I am sitting at no rage all the time. I can go from full hp to dead without hitting 30 rage.
---
I know there were no *playable* Blood Elves in Vanilla (duh!), but I'm sure there were NPC ones, which is why I'm asking.
---
dkp is shit if you intend to trust your guild to raid with you for more than 2 months
---
loot council is the only viable option, if people don't trust the guild leadership to distribute loot then the guild has bigger issues to face.
---
The Defias were made by the Devs as some kind of sick joke to humble players early on in the game 
---
There’s no other reason they’re so OP
---
Yikes
---
Hey there, &lt;Envy&gt; are currently looking for a few more Rogues; we've been potting around on pservers together for the past couple of years. If your after a well-knit, open and competitive raiding experience you'll get it.
---
Feel free to hit myself or our Raid Leader up on Discord (ancilla#0140 or  probability#1475) or visit our website [https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/](https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/) for some more info.
---
That he's one of the best warriors
---
Yea in pvp I would say the highest skill floor is hunter. You fuck up one time and your like... guess I'll just die then.
---
TrollGodX is a fucking Martyr, such a legend
---
Hey mods, could we please have a "Rule 7: Avoid Trolling" in the report options? These damned throwaway accounts are rising day after day ...
---
theres winter squid? for agi food, idk if that fish name is right
---
It's a beta test, the primary function is to find problems and improve the game. Why would you anyone assume it would be released in it's current state?
---
Gonna listen to these later, thanks for the heads up! Sounds super interesting
---
Battle Shout (Rank 3) gives 55 AP at level 22 and 59 AP at level 30.
---
I assume these screenshots were taken at different levels, but if they weren't then you should definitely report a bug!
---
I don't understand the purpose of bonus dkp for guild first kills. Don't most raiders already get very hyped to be part of the guild's first kill and to be the first who get a chance to bid on the best loot? It seems like they'll already want to be there for the first Rag kill and you'd be better off using the DKP system to incentivize people to be reliable and consistent raiders who will show up for the 2nd, 3rd, and 10th kill to help gear up the rest of the guild.
---
I leveled 4 60’s in Vanilla along with various horde PVP twink characters. I plan on doing that again this time around. IMO it’s not wasteful, it’s how I roll 😜
---
Meh , i have not got into any beta for wow since wotlk #feelsbadman
---
I know right? I hate it when I have to report a player named "DeathNinjaBlazeit" and the GM totally kills my immersion by not even trying to RP and just says "Hi Watercoolermage I'm here to help with your report".
---
I drive a 4rd
---
Also interested in this resource.
---
&gt; Blizzard intervening on behalf of whining children is bad for the game, no matter the stage.
---
gonna stop you right there, the tournament generates a lot of attention which as a business is good for them. Beta is first and for most for Blizz, whom is using it to test, and advertise. Everyone in the server is subject to w.e blizzards wants to do
---
I remember seeing Franklin the Friendly in SG while I was farming Thorium. Occasionally I would see a horde hunter trying to take him down and I just wasn't mean enough to interfere. I had a friend that played a hunter and I knew what a bitch it was.
---
That probably explains why on p-servers on my Rogue it keeps saying I'm out of range when I'm practically on top of a Hunter. Its damn near impossible to defeat a half decent Hunter as melee on a p-server (the at best 250 latency doesn't help).
---
If DKP was any good you would see guilds actually use it on private servers but its super rare.
---
I generally don't like streamers much either, but streamers=/=Classic community. Especially considering it'll be pretty easy to avoid, just pick a different server than those jags.
---
This is why you kill anyone with a chinese player name.
---
Good idea, create a guild for people who base their entire personality on weed on every server so you know who to avoid.
---
To simulate the Blizzard experience. Back then the average latency even if you had a really good internet connection was around 100-200ls, and again, that's a really good latency, **most** people were playing at around 300 on average, and if you had really shitty internet, and I'm talking dial up here (yes even in 2005 some people still used dial up!) you would be playing at 500ls or more!
---
Naturally with such a high latency there is bound to be lag, and even with the beastliest of beast computers and the absolutely fastest internet connection available you'd still get a delay on your abilities. 
---
Blizzard decided to add spell batching to regain that old flavour.
---
it's cause that's how it was in vanilla, but it can happen right after depending on when your ability occurs compared to the batch finishing/starting
---
don't forget to clap
---
OMFG, everyone is playing an overpowered warrior.
---
Feelsbad
---
The participants should have set their hearth to an obscure location *secretly.* So at least the semifinals/finals could have gone on without two Taurens /following and/sitting on the duel contestants.
---
Was a shitshow.
---
I just watched BRD run, pickpocketing NPCs, and the loot seemed to be around 4s per one
---
????? Streamers and the crew around streamers have done more beta testing than your average joe has 10 fold.   
---
They max out professions as far as they could, have farmed quests they shouldn't be able to do at this level, they have ran through a ton of respecs, they use the AH. They explore areas. They are running some instances dozens and dozens and dozens of times. They've maxed out their level 30 character.  
---
And they are doing this 12+ hours a day.  Nothing wrong with hosting an event. A level 1 standing on top of competitors for 5 hours shows someone that they aren't even try to test anything and should just be removed from the beta. That's it.
---
What was your level in these screenshots?
---
Your post history is pathetic. Seek help, you’re mentally deranged.
---
Much of WoW is inspired by GoT since first book is almost 30 years old. Did you think the Lich King was a original idea? :)
---
I tried watching his stream and after a few minutes I wanted to punch myself in the dick.
---
You just have to opt in.
---
One thing is people who bind EVERYTHING to the mouse are missing the point and it is not an efficient way to do things.
---
I rebound the first 3 rows on my Naga to keys on the keyboard you can't reach so I'm not just disregarding all the easy to reach number keys above the QWERTY row.
---
I got a Naga because even with using the numbers and modifiers around WASD I was running out of keys. It should really compliment your keyboard rather than replace it.
---
Regardless, one thing I don't see mentioned enough is unmapping Z, X and C so they can be used. I actually like using the default functions of those keys so I just remapped them to a shift modifier on the same letters.
---
**Guild: &lt;Nevermore&gt; \[Horde\] \[US\] \[PvP\] \[Server: TBD\]**
---
**\*\*Raid Times:\*\*** Weekday 9pm ET - 12am ET (will choose days based on needs as recruitment fills out)
---
**\*\*Goals:\*\*** Clear all end game content in and rock in World PvP. We understand that we don't have the same time availability that we did 14 years ago when Vanilla launched, so progression may be slower than other Guilds with more free time. That doesn't mean we cannot strive to be one of the top guilds on our server, clearing all raid content in a respectable time frame. As for World PvP, if it's red, it's dead!
---
**\*\*About us:\*\*** We are a large org with \~ 2,000 members in our Discord. We play various games, some more competitively than others. We've been around for roughly a year as an org. We also operate as a gaming league, hosting competitive seasonal game play and tournament play with cash prizes and sponsors for CSGO, Apex, and Overwatch.
---
For WoW Classic, we will be building a division that is as successful as our other successful divisions. Our WoW Classic division will form a large family, just like Vanilla, where everyone works together for the common good, and everyone knows everyone. No more dungeon and raid finder crap! We're building a community.
---
We have a large infrastructure that already exists from bots, to servers, to websites, a large streaming and social media presence, a podcast, to active and helpful staff.
---
**\*\*Needs:\*\*** We're still very early on in our recruitment. We need raiders that have experience in Vanilla raiding either via many years ago or via current private servers. That said, if you aren't familiar, but you're willing to read, listen, and learn, we still want you. Besides building a successful Raid team, we need everything from Officers, to Raid Leaders, to Class Leaders. We are building our WoW Classic division from the ground up.
---
**\*\*Loot System\*\*:**
---
 Nevermore will be using a loot council system where officers award loot to members based on attendance, size of upgrade, performance inside and outside of a raid, and an overall benefit to the progression of the guild.  
---
Hit me up if you have questions.

---
They did, but to me it look's like there's something weird happening with the spell batching system alongside their hitboxes. 
---
Spell batching may not be the culprit here, just wondering what would cause this huge warstomp. I don't remember anything like this happening in vanilla WoW.
---
PUG raids in classic were not a thing
---
idk where i read it but blizz stands by griefing is as an event where the player being griefed has no pvp option to deal with the the griefer.
---
If this was alliance it wouldnt be greifing because the horde can fight back. This is a beta i think everything blizzard does should be taken with a grain of salt
---
I dreamt that there was a polar bear in my house last night I wouldn’t worry to much about the whole dwarf thing.
---
You’re lucky! 
---
May not be a bad idea. I can’t imagine her having a good time playing at crowded launch anyhow. Maybe only after seeing me play it would trigger curiosity.
---
It allows for people to hit spells on the same tick as their opponent with quick reaction time in PVP.
---
Undead warlock, I think!
---
I didn't buy it from the trainer because I was out of silvers.  10 silver is a lot at low levels!
---
we got the last major patch for warcraft 3  a couple of days ago.

so all they do is working on reforged now
---
&gt;Its a beta.
---
So?
---
&gt; Arn’t you doing the same man baby thing now by arguing that blizz devs are being unfair to troll man. 
---
No. Streamers are players just like everyone else, but they are actually getting special consideration at this point. Until now, it's whatever, they got beta invites to show the game off and build hype. Good. I'm glad there are 100,000+ people at once watching it. But when the game devs step in on their behalf, it's a bad thing for the entire game. 
---
&gt; Nobody is paying for beta its a blizz dev playground. The god mode buff on Omar is not for show. They run that town and w.e they want goes. 
---
This means nothing. It's the same in Live. They used to do similar stuff in live all the time. 
---
&gt; This equality for all garbage is what lead us to retail. 
---
This isn't equality for all, this is the game devs intervening on behalf of streamers. Your straw man has absolutely nothing to do with progression/loot/etc. 
---
&gt; Let blizzard have fun .... 
---
How is teleporting one person fun? Why not let the players have fun? You know, the ones that will actually be playing the game? Why is the Tauren troll's fun not valid?
---
My favorite was the stealthed horde rogue/engineer hiding in the dwarf newbie area with an explosive sheep out waiting for one of the level 1's to run up and take a swing at it.
---
&gt; Asmongold is no more important than any other person.
---
Sadly he is to blizz , try to grief some random person and try to grief him, see the results for yourself.
---
Not so much in dungeons. In open world and pvp, you will be glad having it
---
Love or hate the guy, he clearly gives a damn about the well being of Classic and puts as much effort into all his content than nearly anyone. Gotta respect that
---
Better than being a nazi
---
That part when monkey news killed Sony was the funniest shit
---
At least I'm not a scrub :)
---
we cocaine now
---
I don't have a video or clip however, I experienced a bug this morning in WSG that bugged my character in permanently spirit of redemption, which made me immune to death however horde could still damage me. I could heal myself the damage but would never die.
---
it may have been done through a paladin bubble but I am not sure. I bugged it and apparently got reported by the horde as well.  Did not know of this bug before I went that spec.
---
Why would i invite a class that does 1/5 of what warrior does? The "fotm" classes will be by far the most played ones, they will be everywhere.
---
I thought when someone ran him off the cliff MCed the best
---
They also consider going into wall jump areas a violation of ToS, why didn't they port everyone there out?
---
&gt; But eventually it all leads to the latter once you hit max rank.
---
Not necessarily. A huge number of rankers take several month long breaks when they finish the grind, or stop PvPing entirely and go back to raiding. Many start the grind over again on another toon. Very few stick around PvPing at a high level on that toon once they finish the farm.
---
&gt; Druid flag carriers? All you're doing is running back and forth for the cap with support along the way. You may not even get touched because the pug is getting GY farmed. 
---
Agree 100%. Druid is not particularly impactful in most premade groups, outside of a few rare circumstances. The reason I listed it as high impact is because of how hard it can carry PUGs.
---
&gt; Anything can be seen as "high impact" in that scenario.
---
The warriors and healers farming the GY would be high impact in that scenario. Not the rogue or druid who never so much as even see an enemy.
---
&gt; Only on an even playing field can you be told where you're valued, had the most impact and it actually matter.
---
This is a ridiculous notion. We are specifically talking about organized pvp, which is premades. And premades are 99.999% dodges and stomps. That's just the nature of the game. You can't have a conversation about what classes are needed in competitive pvp and rule out the meta for rank farming.

how i feel in general about potheads, everything revolves around weed. so if you dont like weed or merely dont partake, your gonna have a bad time
---
This isn't classic WoW yet. It's a beta test. I would welcome stuff like this from people actually playing the game. I enjoy posts like this. But this is a test, please TEST the game so it can be the best it can be when it launches.
---
Imagine being salt about others people jobs.
---
Yes, those are the binary choices- life revolves around weed or genocide. Definitely no other options.
---
No every spec you want to play is beyond unplayable. Oomkins run out of mana. Enhance shamans do fuck all nothing for damage and, Aff locks use too many valuable debuff slots. You can only put 16 debuffs on the boss. Lock dots are no where near good enough to be considered.
---
But this is not how it worked in vanilla, this is how it works in MOP+. Your argument makes no sense - if everyone had shittier internet, why wouldn't we have noticed the *horrendous* 15+ yard leeway?  I don't understand how anyone could possible believe that this leeway was in vanilla if they have played either.
---
I love it!
---
Spoiler:  There aren't many.
---
Yeah combine that with the fact that some of us are basically living on this sub waiting for classic and the issue gets exasperated
---
Well, I am not the one who's been trying to explain his point for three comments so that he doesn't get downvoted to hell. And considering my comment has *one* downvote, which is literally yours for calling you out, I am going to take it.
---
The fact that you *admit* I am right in your last paragraph answers it all.
---
Have a nice day.
---
You can be a fair bit more toxic in reddit as its hard to gain negative reputation.
---
This wont be the case in classic
---
That's cool. Anti-druid sentiment seems to be pretty common, and I'd say that while criticizing the role the class plays in the game is fine, they provide so much utility between battle res and innervate that you can't honestly say they're bad, yet people do.
---
This is the most annoying copy pasta I’ve seen in a while, congratulations sir you have ascended to a tier 14 internet troll.
---
toxic is still toxic
---
Very true
---
Yeah I was Feral leveling and Moonkin at 60, but I also was 13 and refused to heal, so I hated my Druid but I could never bring myself to reroll.
---
I actually have thought about being a Priest this time but I might go Warlock.
---
True! I don't have Beta access, but I'm enjoying keeping up with everything. Unlike Middle school me, I doubt I'll have time to spend climbing on buildings to grief someone!
---
&gt;gonna stop you right there, the tournament generates a lot of attention which as a business is good for them.
---
gonna stop you right there. So is showing that you can play the game however you want, even trolling people. He wasn't harassing anyone in particular, or even talking, much less targeted harassment or anything of that nature. 
---
&gt; Beta is first and for most for Blizz, whom is using it to test, and advertise. Everyone in the server is subject to w.e blizzards wants to do 
---
This doesn't make them doing it right or acceptable. Just because you *can* do something doesn't mean you *should*.
---
Strategic intentional delay though, making it within the rules?
---
i think bfa should be next
---
Mana and casting time are reduced at lower ranks, whereas spell damage/healing still gets bonuses.
---
Yep super constructive. Thanks bud.
---
Good points and I think he nailed it.
---
Yes, lower ranks cost less mana, &amp; in some cases have reduced cast time. 
---
So say you're a mage &amp; you'd like to apply a frostbolt slow, but don't need the damage. You can downrank your spell intentionally to apply the slow without using anywhere near as much mana.
---
I always loved swimming around from the lighthouse to that little islands for the ZG turn in, seeing the big double doors, and knowing that Van Cleef's ship was in there.
---
Except it wasn't, really, because it was instanced, but oh well.
---
Wait so is the hamstring with just out of the game? If so might role  hunterd
---
There's a list?
---
Ascendance - Alonsus, right? While I missed vanilla by dinging 60 3days after tbc launch.
---
I watched you guys in awe throughout TBC and cheered you on as you progressed! :) One player from our guild Cry Havoc even joined you guys if I remember correctly. :D
---
Would have been very interested In applying but will be playing a priest sadly. Will certainly have the time of my life reliving looking up to you guys though!
---
That is not what spell batching is. Spell batching was there to save on processing power, not as a result of latency.
---
I think VC took hold more because, as you said, he was the main target for the quest chain. Plus he is a super iconic dude for nostalgia alliance lowbies
---
Yay for troll accounts.
---
No one can say what Pugs will be like. It's quite common in WoW for pug raids to be even more strict about requirements than guilds. Like the only way to get into an MC pug will be to be exact meta spec and have at least 4 epics from MC - that kinda thing. They have even less tolerance for people not pulling their weight and wasting time. In a laid back guild doing farm content no one cares that much what you spec.  
---
In 5 mans while levelling no one cares what spec you are, a dps is a dps. How effective you are usually depends jut on your level. An enhance shaman lvl 42 is going to be much more useful to a Cath group than a lvl 37 combat rogue. At lvl 60 you're probably ok for the easy dungeons like LBRS/BRD, but for Dire Maul people are going to want decent specs.
---
Captain and Beta both have some pretty questionable comments. Sad to see.
---
You can tell by the way that it is.
---
Close, but no.  Vanilla had spell batching regardless of latency.  Actually retail has spell batching still but the tick rate is much much faster (factor of 10).  So it's not just something they put in to regain that flavor it's something that existed in vanilla and they decided it was important enough to the experience of vanilla that they put it into classic.
---
lmao  
---
we're gamers, we're all mentally ill now
---
lol imagine making this comment and, thinking. I'm superior, calm it down bro. Your the opposite far more annoying extreme.
---
What do you mean, if the trolls were alliance then the horde could kill them.
---
And ganked! In a raven hill graveyard of people fighting for spawns, no one protects the aoe mage getting Cheap Shot by twinked UD rogue on his drink break. (Especially since those aoe mobs are the one people desperately need for quests).
---
this comment is in respects to when come live, what actually is greifing..
---
Blizz allowed the tourney to continue (and also intervened with trolls) because *they were generating a shit ton of views and $$$*
---
Was this a vid from 2004-07? Or private server?
---
What if you wanted to use the rank 1 spell?
---
They still have uses. Healers stack +healing, and downrank heals to conserve mana. R1 frost nova freezes just as good as max. Rank 1 Seal of Command does 70% weapon damage, Rank 5 also does 70% weapon damage, but at 3x the mana cost. Rank 1 Frostbolt slows a mob just as well as a higher.
---
Griefing and harassing people is not just "playing the game that they paid for, how they want to play it". Streamers weren't the only ones calling for bans. When someone is ruining an experience for 10's of thousands of people, you really think that is acceptable? Whether it's oN a PvP sErVeR or not?
---
Is this what he is saying?
---
Wait, why didn't one of the high level alliance kill the trolls?
---
I really don't see it I guess
---
Finale? Is it only 4 or 5 episodes?
---
Bro his post history is bad but, you might wanna calm it down. Glass houses and all.
---
It was in Vanilla, it was just designed for the internet of that time, and as such it was not noticeable because your internet was so shit they had to do some wild shit to make the game look and feel alright. Like due to your shite internet you wouldn't even know the leeway existed, only the server would. That's how bad the internet was.
---
Like, the reason you see it now is because internet is better and the game is compensating for much, much slower connections.
---
Also, there is usually a chest under the waterfall with a couple grays in it which will net you enough silver to take the flight path and then some.
---
we fentanyl now bruh
---
Unfortunately I never got to actually run this whole place, I was a little late getting to 40+ in vanilla and could never find anyone who wanted to do it. Only group I ever got was a warrior, I was a mage. We tried to down a quest specific boss but it went nowhere because we had no sustain. A better player probably would have been able to kite them, but oh well. 
---
For all the praise it gets this dungeon sure seemed forgotten and unpopular even in vanilla
---
I mean you could still do it, it would just require you to learn the very specific timing to make it work, you'll have to judge when the ability will actually go off after you press the button, tricky but doable.
---
Generally you use low rank damage spells in PvP when you're oom or want to conserve mana but still need to use the spell - like you're completely oom but need to stop someone capturing a flag in AB or drinking, then you'd use rank 1 MF.  
---
Lower rank healing spells are often used in PvE because they can have better efficiency than higher rank spells, especially when you start getting a lot of +healing gear.
---
i will not wait
---
It should be nearly everything except the swoops/carrion birds.
---
Enjoying leveling doesnt mean it taking 2 fucking months to hit 60. 
---
I enjoy leveling and i plan to run every single dungeon and farm any item i want while leveling, but i dont see it taking more than a month to hit 60.
---
2 months to 60 is like 1 hour a day gameplay.
---
I'm a fan of combining both loot council and EPGP.
---
You create a small list of guild progression items that are on loot council. Typically legendaries and tank loot that you have made everyone aware of.
---
For the rest of the loot you just use EPGP.
---
This gives the benefit of letting the loot council reference the EPGP values to determine who should get the reserved items. This also allows more thought to go into fewer items rather than debating every item that drops. Lastly, it helps prevent people from hoarding points, delaying gearing up, in hopes of the big rare drop.
---
it's the convencience parts mostly that has taken away from the WoW experience i liked so much. i think WoW Live also could have been far better than it is if it was more like classic. TBC also didnt feel like it did to much to ruin the classic experience. neither WotLK, except no 40man raids.
---
Orcs are the only horde race that boots fit on
---
Wouldn't rank 1 frost nova be ineffective against higher level mobs and players? In that case rank 1 would be pretty useless.
---
mage isnt just control and it doesnt matter, druid cant stick on the mage cuz mage has frost armour and druid is constantly slowed so has to constantly switch forms and waste all the mana. All the while mage is using instants to get the druid low, and if try to heal then mage wins, etc. I tested it a lot on a dueling server. Mage beats druid ez.
---
Spells that are learned at level 20 or lower benefit less from +healing/+damage effects though.
---
Bro at this point I might apply for a job at blizz.
---
Thanks man, always good to get stuff like this cleared up. :)
---
Yes, it's acceptable. It's not an official event, they weren't harassing anyone, just jumping their character around. Everyone that was at the tourney was breaking ToS, but the only one the streamers and their followers want banned is the one guy there actually having fun? Wtf? If it mattered so much to them they could have gone to alliance territory and killed him. Or gone somewhere a level 1 could not, or would have lots of trouble, getting to.
---
Nice Tauren hooves m8
---
Hi OP, for duo leveling could double skinning be worth it just help us get the 40 mounts?  Then at 40 one of us could drop it. Thoughts?
---
No triggered in the least. Don’t have to be upset to spot a shitbox.
---
That's bad right? It must mean I'm a liberal
---
If it's anything like it is on private servers, as long as you make it up to 125 for iron ore you're going to have a lot less competition.  Most people either don't pick it up, or drop it because there's too much competition.
---
idk why you cant grasp this. ITS A CLOSED BETA, the rules are a bit more up to blizzard to decide, they have ultimate control. The person was annoying literally any one watching and playing
---
Loner*
---
Do you think you’re smart?
---
The best way to get your partner to play. Is to ask them for help. Don't pipe up the game. Don't tell them how amazing it is. Just tell them you need help and you'll pay for the account. I find your partner tends to be far more willing to help you then they are to try something new. 
---
After you get them into the game. Just play it cool and let classic do what classic does. Seduce the non-believers.
---
After 12 years of demand. Sure.
---
STREAMERS BAD
---
ME DOWNVOTE
---
I think the caluculation used here is 'per hour that skinning added to your leveling time' not strictly gold per hour. 
---
So if skinning adds \~3.3 hours to your leveling time, and you get 144g by leveling skinning, then skinning gives \~43g per hour of 'skinning time'.
---
The rank 11 grind doesnt seem so bad after all.
---
What does LARP have to do with answering tickets?
---
If you craft Nightfall or Annihilator you can maybe come on your enhancement shaman to apply those weapon debuffs. But you probably have to be sociable and charming too.
---
Alliance Hunter LF guild on a West coast PvP server. I didn't raid much but know how to min/max a classic hunter and am a God at not standing in red.
---
Ooooohhhh! Ok, thanks!
---
Guess I must have misunderstood it when the topic of spell batching first came up, granted it's not a very common topic and quite confusing for most people to really understand. Good thing I wasn't totally wrong though!
---
Tanks and healers are the hardest to find for 5-mans, so I’d most likely wouldn’t take any memespecs, unless those roles are already filled and there are no proper DPS available. Affliction is okay for dungeon, unplayable in raids due to the debuff limit, though one of the Warlocks in the raid is usually allowed to be SM/ruin.
---
Same experience with PUG raids, usually competent healers are the hardest to find, while there is an abundance of DPS so again, your memespec won’t make it.
---
This was the best thing I ever did in Vanilla. Guild said it was worthless but I put in a ton of work to get it and was proud of it.
---
I know. Profits over people is perfectly acceptable. Fuck this one guy having fun. They want their money. Even though what he was doing wasn't actually affecting the tourney, and there was an alliance rogue that actually caused an issues in one of the earlier matches.
---
That's definitely not the case.
---
this is correct
---
I have no issue with people getting banned or suspended for griefing.  However don't complain about it.  Asmongold or other streamers shouldn't complain about it at all.  Send in a ticket and hope a GM answers it (which it will bc you're streaming and bringing popularity to their game).
---
A normal player being griefed would send in a ticket and it wouldn't be answered for an hour or two essentially doing the same thing as logging off for a bit.  I have seen streamers deal with stream snipers on private servers example Monkeynews and WarriorTSW.  They are quite a bit more professional about it than some of the new retail streamers like Asmongold or Esfand (I understand they aren't new but new to WoW Classic which opens up the possibility for griefing)
---
I do see some level of trying to change the way the game is normally played for just themselves by some of these retail streamers and this is probably overall bad for the game.  Personally I think if some 10 year old gets suspended because they see Asmongold and keeps killing him, this experience would overall be bad for the game.  A lot of people don't read the terms of service and they play the game based on what is available to them.  Asmongold openly  bragging on AllChat someone got banned on twitch for stream sniping is again kind of the type of experience thats overall bad for the game.  Personally the main culprits here are the streamers who need to grow up a little bit.  This again is the minority of streamers not the majority.  I think ignoring the griefers or choosing to just do something new because your path forward is unavailable due to another player is actually part of the game and something that every player has to deal with at one point or another.  Removing that aspect from the game changes the game to something new.  I understand the streamers bring in revenue for blizzard but the GMs shouldn't answer their tickets faster or allow them to play a game differently and without disturbance as this is unfair to the normal player who has to deal with this every time they log in.
---
If some of these streamers intend to push world bosses and such while streaming good luck to them.  The enemy faction or allied faction knowing where you are they will get the jump on you and they will grief you for hours where ever you are if they think you will be part of a raid group 1 or 2 hours later going for a world boss.
---
TL DR You're a streamer and this is the game your excited for; You have to deal with the stream sniping.
---
No, it would just do less damage which is not the main purpose people use it for.
---
are you trollgodx? You seem to be taking this very personally....
---
That "Accept now" looks too good. It should be Release spirit for maximum anxiousness
---
WoW politics in action
---
well of course people can have differing opinions! Just mentioning it because looking at reddit on expansion launches and now (same crowd-ish) it seems generally that people now favour the experience in walking.
---
so that it's noted; i like that people have stepped back and view it this way now.
---
maybe i'm just mentioning it so that the next time people grab their pitchforks about something, they think for a moment first.
---
TIL finding people who who make everything about weed obnoxious is considered extreme.  
---
Guess I'll just try to fit in then. Dude weed, lmao, 420 amirite?
---
If you level at a normal pace, you're not going to be level 40 for like 2 or 3 weeks.  At that point AH prices will have gone up and you can just wait to sell your items.
---
Crusader is fucking expensive at lvl 60 though. Even in later expansions I made decent gold selling crusader enchants for everyone's heirloom weapons.
---
Dude it’s real. I had a roommate who would not go more than an hour without smoking.   Literally would not leave the house without smoking first. Smoked first thing in the morning, before breakfast lunch and dinner.  
---
And I’m talking bong hits. Not that pussy bubbler shit. This dude was always high. Loved Chic-fil-A
---
IDk why you can't grasp this. THEY ALWAYS HAVE CONTROL, BETA OR LIVE. The rules are always fully up to blizzard to decide. They always have ultimate control. It wasn't annoying me, or the numerous people in guild chat that night watching it. There were a few, like you, who were super butthurt that someone was going against their streamer overlords, but mostly people thought it was funny.
---
If portals exist as a means of transportation, especially as a means of moving men and logistics to the front—or rather having the bandwidth to teleport than much men and materiel. Then why would anyone not use portals for everything?
---
Boats and zeppelins? Lol go get a contract with the Kirin tor. I can almost guarantee that being able to move raw product from a mine in stv to a refinery up river and then to the larger azerothian market for sale instantaneously would save so much money on overhead, labor, and supply chain management issues that your margins would be so large you could easily afford the price of a permanent portal.
---
Let’s not even consider that if this was al real, a non zero number of ships and zeppelins would be subject to loss. Be it by pirates of the sea herself. All that risk is just gone. No need to mitigate and disperse it with insurance policies if it doesn’t exist in the first place. 
---
Portal technology (magic) would be ubiquitous if Azeroth responded to market forces like the real world does.
---
just to add, cant use certain levels of buffs on all levels of players
---
Orcs
---
Orcs, natural warriors and hunters. Living in close connection with the elements, while bravely seeking glory on the battlefield. That is, what is natural. And then there were those who was the shame of their clans, the weak, the cowardly, the... unnatural. 
---
Gul'dan was only one, only the first, there was many who followed in his footsteps. The cowards, the weaklings, the ones who craved POWER above all else, and would give anything to obtain it. And so they did, destroying their world in their quest. 
---
Honorful combat, lok'tar'ogar, meaningless words. I will watch my enemies flee before me, while they burn form the inside out, The rejects and cowards now wield true power, and will use it, for the Horde of course.
---
Undead
---
Farmers, city dwellers, leaders of their households. Devoted followers in the light, the light which couldn't protect them against simple grain. Couldn't protect their children, their future convulsing on the floor, gasphing and gnawing. Until they all turned, slaughtering their friends and their families. 
---
Abominations created of a true power, the Fel. The forsaken was born in it, molded by it, and therefore must WIELD IT. 
---
BECAUSE TRUE POWER LIES IN THE PUPPETEER, WE WILL USE THIS WEAPON WHICH DEVASTATED OUR HOMES, OUR FAMILIES AND OUR NATION AND FORGE A NEW PATH. AN ETERNAL EMPIRE WHICH WILL COVER AZEROTH AND SPREAD AS A FIRE, UNREMORSEFUL, MERCILESS AND GLORIOUS.

How to level holy paladin
---
1. Step one get full rested xo
---
2. Step two do dungeons
---
3. Step three repeat
---
Will still take you far far longer than actually grinding for the 800. You'll take months to get Rank 11.
---
Maybe he wanted to decrease the number of competitors for raid spots.
---
Haha I've kind of been doing the same but just queueing for battlegrounds and roaming around questing with warmode on ganking people.
---
I'm focusing less on gaining levels and more on just the PvP and honestly it's a blast. I still have my boost to 110 but I didn't even use it because I know it'll just take away the enjoyment.
---
PvP fighting over resources on a PvP server is fine. But if your sole reason is “I want to inconvenience someone just cuz” then you’re a bit of a shitbox. His comment didn’t remark about PvP, just inconveniencing someone, period. This could include just being a doucher on a PvE  server by various means.
---
I mean, 85 doesn't sound that bad though, right? :D
---
\_\*\*Title\*\*\_
---
We're \*\*&lt;Rising&gt;\*\*! A new semi-hardcore raiding guild playing Horde on an EU-PVP server.
---
\_\*\*Introduction\*\*\_
---
We have all been waiting a long time for Classic WoW and we are looking to build our roster of players now so that we can really hit the ground running.
---
The main focus of our guild will be to build a community of friendly players that are keen to help each other and get the most enjoyment out of Classic. We believe that having a group of supportive players will be a huge benefit in Classic as there is such a focus on cooperative play.
---
When you are levelling, we want a community to be there to help you with that quest or to kill that Alliance dog who has been corpse camping you. At endgame, we want to gear up together and have fun doing so.
---
\_\*\*Raiding\*\*\_
---
We plan to start endgame content as soon as we can. We intend to host raids on Monday, Thursday and Sunday 20:30 - 11:30 CET for progression raids, although I do not expect we will need all 3 days to clear the current content (at the start).
---
If you do sign up we expect you to be on time and prepared. That said, by no stretch of the imagination are we a hardcore raiding guild that’s pushing for world firsts or expecting players to sink every minute of their time into Classic. We're all a bit older now with life stuff going on. Our goal is to clear the content before the next patch roles out but also enjoy it, so know your class and bring your best.
---
Although the guild is young we're starting to get a core raiding team together, at the moment our preference on roles for new raiders are:
---
\- Strong - Restoration Shaman
---
\- Strong - Mage
---
\- Strong - Fury Warrior
---
\- Medium - Warlock
---
\- Medium - Restoration Druid
---
\- Weak - Hunter
---
\- Weak - Holy Priest
---
\- Weak - Rogue
---
However if you see your class listed as weak priority or even closed, we are always open for exceptional candidates and will will be taken into consideration.
---
We're running a Loot Council system for raiding with the goal to be as transparant as possible. While we know this can be a turn off for new members we want to make sure that the loot that is distributed is fair and also rewarding for those who are loyal, attendant and good members of our community.
---
We also have future plans for alt raids, however this is much further down the line.
---
\_\*\*Other guild activies\*\*\_
---
Whilst our main focus will be on raiding we also plan to host some PvP events. A lot of our current guild members and I love Classic's PvP content! We are hoping to do some World PvP, Battlegrounds and to raid a capital cities.
---
There has also been an expressed interest for twinks by current members. So I imagine we will have a community on this as well.
---
\_\*\*Member expectations\*\*\_
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, are willing to help their fellow guildies and can have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we have seperate expectations such as turning up and so on.
---

Both apply I believe I’m a conservative but fuck trump finally realized he is just a racist XD
---
But on beta they made shamans pink again &gt;:[
---
I’ve never gotten lost in Gnomeregon. It’s got some circular staircases, but for the most part, it’s a straight line with some side spurs. A very LONG straight line, but a line.
---
Sunken Temple is nothing BUT circular staircases, and most of the floors look the same. Plus the staircases don’t really tollow any particular logic; a stairway on level 3 might take you to level 5; if you’re trying to get to level 4, you need to backtrack to level 2.
---
If being better than a nazi is the only standard you base your decisions on I have some bad news for you
---
But you get upset every time you look in the mirror 😂
---
Stick on a mage? Nobody pvps seriously as a feral Druid. Feral is just a meme spec for fun at 60. They will go resto or balance/hybrid and just range you. Dip in to re apply dots and just run away.
---
This is one of the dungeons I NEVER felt a p-server really got right. I cannot wait to do it on a proper server!
---
When you're about to go to sleep click the log on button.  Then you don't have anything to worry about.
---
Rank 1 arcane explosion to reveal rogues
---
Stood on totems? No idea what that means
---
How could you forget your favorite dungeon from Cata. Stonecore, the greatest pug friend pug dungeon.
---
the lack of vellums is going to make earning money off enchanting difficult or at the very least, time consuming.
---
I was that guy sitting out of raid waiting for a paladin raid spot when I started raiding. I sat out of raid for MC for 3 weeks before I got my chance to go to my first raid. Sounds crazy but it was epic at the time.
---
That other guy came off so autistic then you had to come in and one up him like that.
---
That doesn't stop idiots from reporting it
---
Your options are  
---
* HotW spec - worse raid healing but will still be able to tank random dungeons and do some stuff in pvp apart from just healing
---
* Devote 2-3 hours a week to farming to cover respec costs
---
* Play an alt
---
* Suppress errant thoughts about doing other things except healing at lvl 60 as a vanilla healer
---
They have the same models in TBC and later, the only difference is eye color.
---
Lol, no, I was running WSG's at the time. Should have joined him though, seeing how personally you are taking my opinion that people should be allowed to play the game the way they want to as long as they aren't exploiting/hacking/cheating/harassing people. It's a level 30 beta tournament. Who cares if someone was fucking with it? Seriously. People who hear about this are going to think that they can just complain to Blizzard when someone does something that they don't like and expect results.
---
&gt; This iteration of spell batching isn't vanilla. That plus taurens hitbox is what's in question.
---
Didn't they confirm both of these in a bluepost?
---
&gt; I don't remember anything like this warstomp happening in vanilla.
---
I don't trust your fifteen year memory.
---
thank mr bot
---
there were no vellums, so you had to find an enchanter.
---
Remember to get the Nek'rosh quest this time around :)
---
Do leathers sell on auction house?
---
The gold per hour is a bit missleading.
---
If you only count 1 leather per mob killed. From each mob you skin you will accumilate \~1.8 silver*(144,9534g/(16339/2)* more than if you hadn't skinned them.
---
I mean its more like trying to move a rook straight and not diagonally. Simply the wrong tool for the job
---
&gt;Pugs will clear MC, Ony and AQ20/**40**. ***Possibly*** BWL late on
---
Uhm
---
&gt;they weren't harassing anyone
---
(X) Doubt
---
Get a level 1 rogue to the opposite faction capital. Wait for a duel to finish, then suprise kill the loser.  You'll get murdered instantly but it's worth the lols.
---
It was only really popular in WotLK, but we're trying gDKP again.
---
We won't necessarily have a full 40 man core, so this prevents the rotating members from getting little or nothing.
---
In addition it's natural gold welfare, let's the raid-day onlys fund their play if their fine with slower gearing.
---
For those of you not familiar, gDKP works like normal blind one-bid DKP except you bid in gold instead. At the end of the raid the master looter divides the total bids 40 ways and evenly distributes it.
---
Back in the day we'd do open bidding on hotly contested drops, but that got out of hand so we're soft-banning that. (Our ML had a great auctioneer voice though, still not worth it)
---
Yeah I'm expecting a trailer info at the end of the main show without any specific  info and release like 2 years later.
---
Just making sure you dont catch grief for keeping things nostalgic :P
---
I hated getting griefed, but I know I rolled on a PvP server, and Id get the horde back eventually.
---
lets not forget you started talking to me, over a fact i stated, blizz ported the character to winterspring. You were immediately butthurt.  I was simply stating a fact
---
Cloth goes for extremely cheap on private servers.  It's not even worth selling usually.  Just level First Aid.
---
I love him unconditionally.
---
Experienced raider looking for guild
---
NA Horde PvP
---
I raided some in vanilla cleared MC and ZG never did attunement for Ony and wasn’t geared enough for BWL AQ. Had 3piece of T1 some ZG epics and a few blues as fury warrior. 
---
TBC raided progression and cleared Kara, SSC, Gruuls/Mags,TKEye, 3/4 hyjal,BT all bosses also started sunwell. 
---
Switched to Paladin main in WotLK and raided as Ret dps and OT as prot. Cleared Naxx, OS, Vault, Maly, Ulduar 10/10H/25, ToC 10/10H/25, ONY, ICC (quit week before guild cleared Arthas). 
---
I’m older now (31) and have a 16mth old and a wife and full time job.  My free time is limited but I would like to revisit classic and enjoy the game all over again. I’d like to raid some, maybe 1-2 per week and PvP. 
---
Although I may not have the same availability as some, I’m a very competent raider and chill person. I’m looking for a guild, preferably one with other parents that understand life outside of game but still want to use time efficiently and get content cleared. 
---
Planning on playing resto shaman for raid and elemental for PvP. I’ve already done the tank and dps roles in vanilla and expansions, so I’m interested in giving healing a shot. I’m they type of person who loves to do research on my class/spec to get the most out of character as possible. I’m a min/maxer at heart but I just don’t have the availability to be in a hardcore guild anymore.  Please let me know if this sounds like it would be a good fit for your guild. Thanks for reading and Lok’tar Ogar. Good luck everyone with Classic.
---
Trisifal..
---
rank 1 moonfiring a totem is the same as using max rank
---
Can you ELI5 that very last part to me? Didn’t quite understand what you meant.
---
I try to but honestly I get bored eventually with it. Warcraft lore is awesome but not all the quest texts really add to the lore. 
---
If you have access to Warcraft 3, play through the campaign and it'll give you a solid foundation of what's going on, which can probably help you decide which quests you want to pay attention to.
---
Are you on the F&amp;F list?
---
The chat logs are great. "How'd it feel to be her bitch, nub?"
---
I like how I’m hoping to get in yet not even people who know blizz employees has a sure invite.
---
You can feral DPS but its not that good, and optimally only really works on Alliance due to Blessings being good and Windfury not helping Kittys at all.
---
There farming isn't very good, but you don't need to go full resto so its not that bad either.
---
In general, if you really want to DPS I'd play a different class. Kitty DPS is something you have to give 100% to make work at all in a progression guild, and even then its great.
---
Ah yeah, not PVP flagged, unfortunate.
---
Literally no has seriously thought this. Rotations were far less intensive in classic, though. That’s fine to admit to ourselves.
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Enhancement\_Equivalency\_Points\_(EEP)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Enhancement_Equivalency_Points_(EEP))  
---
Seems they deleted it back in 2008 because it was "very old"...I guess 11 years late the joke's on them! ;)
---
It has nothing to do with simulating a laggy connection though. Spell batching means that groups of actions happen together, so you can have a warrior charge+stun a mage as the mage sheeps him, and similar interactions. 
---
Also, batching introduces a variable amount of lag as low as 0ms, since your comma d may arrive just as a batch is processed.
---
20 servers? I had heard theres probably only going to be less than 5, each with multiple layers
---
My guess is it conceals the gear you have
---
But at least it will be killing Horde.
---
Didn’t get my first epic until BC but I still remember grinding the AV rep to be able to buy the Stormpike Charger on my dwarf warrior. That was an awesome feeling when I finally got it.
---
They weren't... They said nothing the entire time. Jumping around isn't harrassing anyone.
---
Mate I used to think exactly like you. Part of me still agrees with you and that any action done ingame should be allowed. But it's not always black and white. This is pure griefing/harassment just for the sake of it. It's like going to a restaurant and paying money for your own dinner and then going and asking everyone at the restaurant for a bite of theirs. You will get kicked out despite being a paying customer. Blizzard can and should hold the right to intervene at any point for any reason.
---
This feels pretty unfair as someone who has 0 Blizzard employees on their friends list. Well Gz anyways to those who got in!..
---
Spell Batching is when the server batches together all spells cast within a certain timeframe and considers them to have happened simultaneously.  
---
For example: two mages cast polymorph on each other. If the time difference between their casts is small enough (0.2 seconds for Vanilla) then both polymorphs are batched together and both mages get polymorphed.  
---
In retail WoW, the spell Batching window was reduced from 0.2 seconds to around 0.02 seconds. Making the chance of a double polymorph like above extremely unlikely, and changing the Meta of combat.
---
Spell Batching has nothing to do with simulating lag like -og- says. This is simply wrong. Spell Batching of around 0.2 seconds was part of Vanilla WoW and they have recreated it to keep the combat accurate to what it once was.
---
No matter your faction, UD rogues are consistently the worst
---
Buncha reskins.  Vanilla WoW was not known for it's rare mounts.
---
**Looking for Guild**
---
*NA / Adult guild preferred / Horde preferred / PvP Preferred**
---
** Looking for guild that will be emphasizing both PvE &amp; PvE elements. I will be pushing for max level as quickly as possible, and would be looking to participate in both raiding and premades as quickly as is feasible. Between the two, I place a slight heavier emphasis on PvE and would want to be with a guild intending to clear all raid content. I would however like to run with folks who are serious about attaining at least rank 10/11 in PvP, as well.
---
I've been playing off and on since 12/31/2004. I've raided as Dps, Tank and Heals through the majority of raid tiers since release. DPS from MC-&gt;Naxx in Vanilla, and throughout TBC. Tanked from WotLK through mid-Legion. Healed 2nd half of Legion. And in BFA I played Dps till I stopped playing.
---
I have acted as a Guild Leader, Raid Leader, Class Lead, General officer and lastly rank and file, and am comfortable in any role. If I'm an officer, I take that seriously. If I'm rank and file raider, I show up and shut up. Whatever is needed/required.
---
**Classes I am currently considering are:**
---
Mage - Most likely
---
Warlock - Possibly
---
Hunter - least likely for Dps
---
Ele/Resto Shaman - If guild is more pvp focused. Unlikely.
---
After my main is leveled, I intend to level 1-2 other characters. One such alt will be a prot warrior.
---
Please DM here on reddit if you think your guild and I are a good fit for each other. We can then exchange discord names afterwards.
---
Noob warrior. You have shield bash by then.
---
Name checks out
---
Far west of trisifal in that section that has nothing in it, had to wall jump around the north west coast to get there.
---
Let's not forget that you started off butthurt about the guy in the first place. How far back do you want to go?
---
You can say about pserver players what you want, but their passion for the game is uncontested!
---
Whoops meant ZG
---
Lol so glad I'll be leveling with my shaman wife this time around. Almost certain I'll be tauren and almost certain I'll be a PvP beast without that orc stun resist (warriors can be cocky I know).
---
what are you on about?  griefers are in the minority in games, just like in real life.  Organic community effort is an intrinsic part of classic for the vast majority of players, and griefers are a minor inconvenience that can spark some fun pvp if you're that way inclined
---
Only MC is available at launch.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Night_Watch 
---
how did you miss the most obvious one?
---
Hey it’s me, ur brother who u share an account with
---
Every Monday is "LFG Mondays". You can look at previous weeks post as well
---
Depends on the spec. Against bm? No against mm yes
---
Lol! I would’ve never guessed it was the skinning that did it in. Are you into hunting per chance?
---
spending skillpoints into improving spells,
---
not knowing if it actually improved it or not
---
Even just getting to the entrance portal is a test. If you don't know exactly where you're going you could spend an extra 30 minutes fighting elites for no reason.
---
Mana efficiency. How much mana is converted into healing or damage? For instance Rank 4 Healing Touch for Druids has the best mana efficiency. 
---
You'd want to use rank 1 Moonfire to force someone to stay in combat or to tag a mob for basically 0 mana.  As a Druid vs Shaman, I also put Rank 1 Rejuv on myself to force him to waste a purge.
---
If you go balls to the wall with every consume and buff in the game you can potentially sit in top 10 or top 15 in an everage guild simply because youre trying twice as hard as them. If you wamt to play a meme spec, prepare to farm for the rest of your raiding days to do middle of the road dps, or sit in last place on the dps meter even against garbage warriors with no consumes
---
Maybe one day it will be.
---
Can't wait for classic...bfa is so damn boring 😪
---
This is literally one of the least toxic reddits I've seen.  There are a few elitist original players out there sure.  But their ego will go away.  The only real toxic you should expect is the people who are coming in on this blind from retail thinking this will be the same game, and the kids who don't understand what real games were about and expect the empty she'll easy play of today's games.
---
Horde are xhads allys are betas
---
I have already decided the face customization options in Wowhead's dressing room as well as BiS gear for Phase 1. So yes.
---
It was the same on pservers too. It’s because the horde is just full of kids to be honest.
---
Where’s the spooky flame horse then?
---
Hahahaha
---
Yeah I have no delusions about being anything other than a healer in raids. More curious about how the rest of the game plays at 60 for druids.
---
Yeah i see druids have a place. But minmaxers seems to always say they wont get a group. So it felt fitting to point it out for a "laughing" druid ;)
---
onyxia is available. I was listing the 3 raids which are on a different lock out.
---
This also doesnt answer my question
---
Because I’ve paid for that spell so I damn well get to keep it.
---
That was impressively sad.
---
tbh. I griefed a lot back in 2004/5 and I was alliance. I guess it all depends on which is the dominant faction.
---
I'm playing warcraft 3 through right now.  I'm at the Orc campaign after summoning Archimonde.  I might play through TFT as well, but that's more like the precursor for TBC, not Vanilla.  Only the founding of Orgrimmar and Durotar is important from TFT for Vanilla.
---
&gt;Items that have random stuff like speed boosts, professions boosts, breathing, or something unique are interesting. Cloth that has agility and strength on it just feels bad.
---
Does this not describe Retail, which has the things he likes, and does not have the things he does not like? Intelligence
---
The two trolls were obnoxious as fuck annoying griefing everyone that wanted to enjoy the tournament, you're insane dude.
---
If you're a priest trying to get 5 stacks of Shadow Weaving for the raid there's no reason to use your max rank Shadow Word Pain 5 times.  Just hit it with the lower guys!
---
Alliance is basically scared to kill horde. Even low level. Because it’s scary being in enemy territory. If you die it hurts feelings. I don’t do bad things. That’s why I play hood guy alliance.
---
04 account here, I'll check when I get home but my old friend at Blizzard has long since moved on. So very doubtful. Congrats to everyone that got in! I'm very happy for you!
---
I play a lot of druid and plan on maining it again in Classic. I'd love to help but a lot of your questions are vague and lacking in detail to the point its hard to really answer.
---
&gt; Is grinding a chore on feral/resto specs at 60? 
---
Grinding what? And what spec are you talking about? HotW is probably the default feral/resto hybrid spec.
---
&gt; Will I be stuck constantly respeccing for raid night? 
---
That depends on a lot of stuff, including what you want to raid as, what you do between raids, and what your guild needs from you.
---
&gt; How gear dependent is the feral aspect, will I need to roll against rogues or something?
---
Feral fights for gear with rogues and warriors, both of which tend to have higher priority on loot than you. Good news is that at a raid tier, a lot of your gear is so niche that nobody uses it but you. BiS items dropping on trash, etc. Overall getting gear as a feral isn't too bad, aside from the sheer volume you need to obtain.
---
&gt;  I really want to avoid hitting 60 and then never doing anything but healing again.
---
Feral is a viable raid tank. Not just casually, but optimally. Keyboard warriors on reddit will say otherwise, but people who actually farm endgame vanilla run a druid tank as part of an optimal build. I've even had guilds try to poach me because the supply for a bear is so low.
---
I'd be happy to talk more about it if you can narrow down to some specfics of what you want to know. It's not clear to me if you actually want to run feral, or if you want to mostly heal but be able to do other stuff on the side. Generally speaking there is a spec for you out there. There's something like 2 dozen endgame druid specs depending on what you're doing with it (granted the different between a lot of them is 1-2 points)
---
I'm not too concerned about damage meters I really only plan to PVP this guy for awhile.  I picked the 0/21/30 spec as it has SO much defense at first, and now that I've got a lot better gear I find I don't need nearly as much of the HP and it's time to improve my offensive abilities a bit more. 
---
Did you ever PVP much?  I have figured out how to avoid clipping my autos which is especially easy with the 3.4 crossbow from AQ =P
---
You can raid add as a casual as long as you have a reliable schedule.
---
I, on the other hand, play a lot but have a very unreliable schedule so I cannot raid.
---
No one trolled him.
---
&gt; This is pure griefing/harassment just for the sake of it 
---
How? Him doing what he was doing had no affect on the matches. It might have made it slightly harder to see someone, but you only have 1 target the entire time, and you can tab target as they will be the only valid target during the duel. Why aren't arena's flat planes with no obstacles/terrain? That's all this guy was.
---
&gt; It's like going to a restaurant and paying money for your own dinner and then going around and asking everyone at the restaurant for a bite of theirs. You will get kicked out despite being a paying customer. 
---
It's more like signing up for a team vs team paintball match, then deciding that you don't want to follow the rules of the match, talking to the other team (against ToS) to organize 1v1 matches, then getting upset that one guy that paid for, and was expecting, team vs team is still trying to keep the match team vs team while all the 1v1ers are breaking the ToS, twice (wall jumping and communicating with other faction).
---
The real reason is because the Horde actually bother to send level 60's to kick out any Alliance player trying to do this.
---
Alliance players just ride right past a 60 ganking in Redridge or killing the Defias Traitor right before the escort quest completes.
---
Holy Nova R1 for priests too
---
\&gt;say literally anything negative about classic in the absolute slightest
---
HURRRRRR RETAIL'S THERE FOR YOU HURRRRRRRRR
---
Not at all, I just think it's pathetic. Why do people do it? Because they can't win against other 60s?
---
&gt;being conservative in 2019 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
What would **you** like to see in place of the subscription model?
---
It's important that you see this as not just a AAA game, but a AAA MMORPG. 
---
Buy to play? It, for the large part, hasn't worked out for any studios. GW and GW2 saw some relative success, but the quickly dwindling populations quickly gave rise to pay-to-win features. 
---
Free to play? F2P models *always* involve some sort of pay-to-win model, or a model where *not* paying puts you at a significant disadvantage in both convenience or quality of life in-game. 
---
There are continued costs with maintaining the quality and longevity of a MMORPG. 
---
It sounds like you would much prefer to have a buy-to-play model. What incentive, then, does Blizzard have to develop, maintain, and even launch Classic? They already got your $60. They have no reason whatsoever to ever produce anything again for WoW if there isn't any profit to be derived from that development.
---
Implying that 40 man raids were not tuned for 40 players?
---
That just means that your specific experience in a raid group was different than somebody else's experience in a raid group.
---
I'm thinking about giving rogue a go. I've been liking cat form more than bear form (played a warrior through BC and into Wrath) but I will miss the healing ability.
---
He was the first person in history to OD on weed
---
I’ve played both sides. It happens on both sides and always has. Get griefers in redridge so I’d switch servers and end up getting griefers in the Barrens.
---
The saddest I have ever been on retail WoW is when I did sunken temple and saw how bad they gutted the damn thing.
---
You should edit your post, because spell batching has nothing to do with simulating the lag of worse internet connections. Here's an accurate description of [spell batching](https://www.wowhead.com/news=290910/spell-batching-in-classic-wow).
---
It always saddens me that there are people that are not even aware that ASoIaF is a book series (which to me also is superior to the TV series simply because the narrative works better for books as a medium).
---
Stop acting like a cowardly beta, accept the fact that most women are not interested in video games and stop thinking that coercing her to play the game with you would replace quality time spent together. Also this way you can still have your “male hobby” when you need some time for yourself and it’s way better than going to the pub with the guys.
---
I remember watching this show and loving every moment of it back in highschool. 
---
It has not aged well.
---
&gt; Most dungeon groups stuck together no matter what in vanilla, even if they were bad or just had to go AFK.
---
Did you want to go back to Stormwind and look for people for a half completed Maraudon dungeon?
---
the level cap is double in BFA
---
I got use to stepping forward to cancel a spell and interrupt. Threw me off when some spells were castable while moving.
---
Don't forgot though that ZG / AQ20 are on 3 day lockouts so can be run twice a week.  But these are in phase 4/5 so may not really be needed.  It's not like Hakkar will be out day 1.
---
replied to wrong thread lol   
---
I  went holy first and then watched my brother out level me by 10 in a  week as ret. I went back and respecced to get seal of command. i dont  think the speed bonus was implimented yet so i just had 11 points in  ret, but after the talent adjust i put 13 into ret to get the 8%  movement bonus
---
after 1.12 my spec was something close to  [Legacy-WoW.com/vanilla-talents/paladin-talents/?tal=15503100521251000000000000000322030512200000](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/paladin-talents/?tal=15503100521251000000000000000322030512200000)
---
this  spec is a little more heal focused, you can move around some points  especially the first talents in each spec to suit your needs
---
lasting judgement i probably didnt put points in in vanilla, but i would now
---
i call it a shockadin build. i had unstoppable force
---
I hope that blizzard quickly destroys all gold selling and boosting operations and bans thier customers. So far blizzard gas been doing a good job of doing so in current wow
---
I can dig this, it would be nice to be able to avoid guild members who really think everyone ONLY wants to hear about how high they are or how much they smoke in there semi catatonic brain dead state that is ready and willing to argue about there not being side effects from drug usage....
---
 Yeeeeeaaaahhhh maaaaan I sweeeaarrr duuudee therrreee reeaaallly isssnt aaaann issue maaaan.  Liiiikee nooo isssuuuee maaaan
---
I don't know what your motor skill disability is but, if it's bad I would highly recommend a new class. The reason you aren't seeing a lot of pvp info is because as a class hunters are just okay in pvp. Not great and they fade as classic goes on. 
---
Beyond that they have the highest skill floor. You fuck up once and you die. As opposed to a mage where you can fuck up and iceblock. Or fuck up and frost nova, or fuck up and sheep. Point being play hunter with caution. It's hard as fuck.
---
Warcraft 3 is definitely important in WoW's lore, but to be honest, there's a lot it misses out on.  The Frozen Throne is more of the lore behind TBC than anything.  It goes into the Naga, Blood Elves, and Illidan.
---
I’m doing DW now as a first time War player, at lvl 21 currently. What’s wrong with DW? DPS btw.
---
And how do you attract new members when progression content calls for a more robust raid team?
---
You’re too easily impressed
---
no, he's saying "poggers in the chat."
---
Wow Classic gameplay is slower and more meaningful
---
Because its fun
---
Holy crap I'm in. Right at the beginning of a 12 day vacation from work too! That is hecking celestial timing...
---
Classic is actually fun and rewarding.
---
He made sweeping assumptions base on a guy wanting to smoke weed and play video games, I did the same based on the fact he is German
---
This was bugged on the stress test. It auto upgraded on my bar, and replaced previous ranks of spells. I put in a big report, but this is a majpr thing in classic, so I hope others reported too. How am I supposed to druid?!

He said same faction griefing. Parking pets is not same faction, camping is not same faction, etc.
---
Personally, I think there is a easy way to know if the griefing should be banneable or not. Can the other part do something? You get ganked, you can ask for help. You attacked a pet because you didn't payed attentiont? your fault, as I said in another post, I don't even consider in game scamming as something that should be banneable, because it can be avoided by being smart or asking people if you should do something like that.
---
Having a lvl 1 character griefing for hours in a event like that has no counterplay.
---
Each guild has a different balance of 'how much what classes/roles we bring for a raid is determined by their statistical viability', versus 'these people are my friends and having them play the classes/roles they find most fun is more important to me than making sure they fit the raid meta'.

You \*can\* ask the reddit if you \*can\* raid as ret...but you know, you probably \*should\* also ask the guildies you  eventually end up playing with. Who knows, if they like you, if you become friends, maybe they'll welcome you raiding as ret...because the amount they like you as a human outweighs their desire to have a specific raid role filled.
---
That kind of basic socializing stuff.
---
Hey "insert random name" it's me your long lost brother. please send invite. Lets hang out sometime.
---
I’m going to actually play Classic.
---
Sounds like you probably should play on RP realm and stay clear of any other server mode.
---
We weren't talking about retail in this conversation, but you were. We can complain about negative aspects of games while also enjoying the game. Stop gatekeeping.
---
I am on top 3 but not in yet. So maybe Manual Flags or staggered invites.
---
1996*
---
And you still won't get all of them! :D
---
Got my first elk two years ago. A solid 6x6 but I didn't get into hunting until I married my wife. Theyre from a small town so that's all they do haha my wife's got a bull tag for this fall can't wait to stalk up our freezer with meat again!
---
My experience is getting slaughtered by lvl 60 allies when playing horde in private servers. People just want to be asses not matter where they are
---
It's literally nothing like that.
---
&gt; literally no one
---
And yet just a couple days ago someone bitched about how switching between rank 4 and rank 2 of some frost mage spell was what the vanilla rotation was.
---
Source? I took the 26th info directly from their site.
---
Hopefully the industry will learn from Classic what it is players need to stay engaged in a game like this.
---
I think blizz will actually set layer size way lower than people think. At launch I expect a 250 layer size.
---
Hope so! Make sure you report back if you got in!
---
***Title***
---
We're **&lt;Rising&gt;**! A new semi-hardcore raiding guild playing Horde on an EU-PVP server.
---
***Introduction***
---
***Raiding***
---
We're running a Loot Council system for raiding with the goal to be as transparent as possible. While we know this can be a turn off for new members we want to make sure that the loot that is distributed is fair and also rewarding for those who are loyal, attendant and good members of our community.
---
***Other guild activities***
---
***Member expectations***
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, are willing to help their fellow guildies and can have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we have separate expectations such as turning up and so on.
---
If you feel like this could be the guild for you then please visit our website [**https://rising.shivtr.red/**](https://rising.shivtr.red/).
---
Additionally, if you have any questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact us directly on discord ***@\[Rising\] Boo#0059***, ***@GlenCoco#3702***, ***@mizi#3868*** or ***@QFierced#7447***.
---
**Lok'tar Ogar!**
---
That said, I think you’re over blowing it. A bit.
---
I came back to wow like 3 days before beta started. I was 36X ilvl. I’d played the opening weeks, did some m+ with rl friends then we all got bored a quit. 
---
It literally took me 2 weeks to get to 400 ilvl and be useful in mythic raids.
---
I did maybe 6 emissary quest things. Killed the weekly world boss twice. Did 8 m+ runs total. And attended LFR bod/cos as well as a couple pig heroic/normal kills.
---
Sure could I keep doing m+10 day in day out to get better gear, I mean sure. Could I farm azerite tocget from 44 to 50? Yeah could do that too. 
---
Or I could just raid log at 401ilvl when the guild average is 414 and still be top 5 dps. 
---
That super duper min max philosophy isn’t needed. Getting better at button pressing will improve your numbers way more. Most people are however fooled into thinking ilvl is all that matters.
---
I’ve raided at top 20 us levels. It matters there. But as someone who hops in and hops out of the game, and casually raids mythic to see the content before the next tier. You can really put in much less effort and be a success. 
---
Same shit exists on classic. Mopes saying you need a buff buff tray and an ideal class/race combo to be effective. Just isn’t the case. Naxx was cleared with 15 room temperature bodies. If you press your buttons and show up, and have the capacity to learn and listen, classic wow content will die. That doesn’t mean you can have 12 ele sham. But it does mean you can be successful with more than two hunters and 0 dwarf priests.
---
Source? I haven't seen anything about server life or how long they plan on keeping classic.
---
except the part when your computer is on all night
---
This is very important, because 90% of the posts here when it was a hot topic were grieving over hundreds of hypothetical scenarios within 5-mans.
---
classic is an mmo
---
You are actually the best you here
---
The best guild I was ever in (this was back in wod) used a mix of loot council and sims to determine who gained the biggest upgrade from tier sets and items, it was universally accepted and agreed that loot was a tool for progression and not the point of raiding so there was never any loot drama, if there was a equal damage upgrade between two players then the officers and one random player for that week was chosen to decide who would get it based off performance, attendance and attitude, which meant people always showed up, always tried and always kept a positive attitude.
---
Lol? Obviously you've never done progression raiding before.
---
"Mail received stays in your mailbox for 30 days. 
---
Prior to patch 2.1.3, any piece of mail you read would only last for 3 days from being read." 
---
So reading it overrides the 30 day timer with the 3 day timer, so don't read it and this can be done, now we're talking classic not classic 2.0 so there's no telling if we can do it in this new game or not, but it definitely was a thing.
---
Lol I read this as alcoholic, and I was gonna day that classic wow is not going to help his condition any.
---
On that note I would say a druid gives you a lot of  ways to play
---
We're not getting rp PvP servers though.. not looking to play with casuals who hang out in goldshire and cyber all day. Looking for some faction pride and immersion
---
My thoughts based on this post:
---
1. 11 or 13 points in Ret (get SOC and maybe Pursuit of Justice) and then go Holy.  You'll be a little bit behind the curve on Holy talents, but you'll still get them and still be able to heal.  SOC is the biggest single DPS boost in ret, get that and everything else is gravy.
---
2. People generally go Ret because it's already a balance of tankiness and damage.  Going Holy is more tankiness, but further away on the damage scale.
---
3. Don't mix melee and healy gear (for the most part).  Get two sets to use depending on circumstance.
---
I don't think anyone should be greifed. If you need to greif people to have fun/feel good about yourself, then you need to seriously re-evaluate how you're spending your time. Also seek therapy.
---
It's literally exactly that. It's nothing like your restraint thing. Each person is paying for their own individual meal, a single player game. In my scenario it's a joint setting, just like WoW is.
---
Getting angry at this is like being pissed someone ran by a pool. Vanilla is nothing but trolling. And if it gets you this butt hurt, you're gonna have a bad time when people block your mailbox
---
Still I'm going to do it all over again..
---
It means an opponent could not target them in a duel.
---
Yeah I remember lol. He was definitely on one of my servers. Jubei thos I think.
---
No flying
---
The mini bosses drop shoulders and something else. Problem is it’s not guaranteed that they will drop anything, and if the do drop something it’s a random affix.
---
As a priest there are generally 2 dps spells i use at rank 1. That is holy nova, to interrupt or to unstealth rogues. Rank 1 swp, to keep rogues unstealthed, add shadow weaving, to trick dispellers (priests, paladin, shamans) to waste mana dispelling or mages to ice block it and to procc blackout.
---
Rank 1 Mind flay can be used in group pvp as a slow.
---
Who cares?  My computer is on 24/7 already.
---
You will have some ability to deal damage soloing open world as resto/balance share core stats. The most efficient leveling you will probably see as a resto spec will probably be the same way I leveled a holy priest back in vanilla. 
---
Grind the hell out of instances. Run them back to back to back. You will get a nice amount of xp per run and it will keep you geared all the way up. It is also a great way to get rep at later levels as well such as Argent Dawn.
---
The dedicated healer is usually the last slot picked up for most groups so it's basically just a matter of hitting the hub city, restocking water, hitting the bank, and announcing your presence in LFG. If you have to pee, do it before announcing in LFG because you probably won't have time after the masses of rogues and hunters smell blood in the water.
---
It comes down to how much you love or hate repetitive content because Strat, Scholo, and UBRS are going to be your life for a while but I enjoyed it and found healing to be really fun.
---
Blizzard seemed to think that priests didn't enjoy their jobs so they screwed them up in TBC but playing a flash heal priest was one of the most rewarding things I ever did in wow.
---
Oh. My b. It wasnt very clear since dead serious accusations of being a nazi are thrown around like candy these days.
---
I have done progression. It was loosely loot council based. Care to have any meaingful input to the conversation?
---
Bold of you to assume I go outside
---
Heals will likely be very easy to find compared to tanks. Even in expansions with better tank/hybrid dps balancing the limiting factor is almost always finding a tank.
---
This seems like sarcasm, which is weird. I gave you specific advice on a specific component of your plan. You may not like it and you may not accept it, but that doesn’t make it any less constructive.  I would never join a guild whose GM lords over loot like this for himself while making his co-tanks bid DKP. Just do loot council for all tank gear and be fair based on the best interests of the guild.
---
\*Assuming the Classic servers are here to stay and that we will all one day die.
---
why do people watch soccer or football instead of just playing themselves?
---
So crazy how if you put every streamer into a room there’s a lot of viewers. Completely illogical.
---
This is no where near as feasible on beta as it is on most private servers.
---
People say to go SOTC because it's not working right on Private Servers and gives you too much damage.  A lot of the meta from Private Servers won't work on Live, or won't work as well on Live.  Things like sitting down to charge reck bombs, or fronstabbing, for example.
---
I think a lot of it is geography. Redridge presents a low level ganking opportunity that doesn't really have an equivalent horde side, because most of them are still in barrens at that level. There is stonetalon i guess, but it doesn't have the population density that redridge does. 
---
I don't think duskwood and westfall are particularly active for gankers compared to other zones. 
---
There is also more horde ganking in the 50-59 areas. This is largely because alliance premades get instant queues, and horde have to wait, sometimes quite a while. Its therefore more efficient to run and gank greens for the extra honor while you wait for queue to pop.
---
**&lt;The Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**

A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**

pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)

Remember that nelf hunter competes with druids moonfire which is a beast at tagging, no traveltime nor cd
---
This!
---
Tame the polar bear. Feed it to increase it's happiness.
---
Yeah I found a guild ty
---
This isn't a troll account. You're just a terrible leader.
---
This may be a silly meme, but the pedals is actually 5Head level genius.
---
Ohhh ok. Cause they would target the lvl 1 instead
---
Yea it can be done.... I would argue it just isn't worth it due to not being consistent enough.  I think it evens out in the long run to just being the same as standing there.
---
If you're killing the mobs together, there's really no reason to both take skinning. Only the melee class should. Just keep the loot on Free For All and keep trucking, though the ranged/support class will still have to pickup any quest items themselves.
---
But if you're duo leveling, you're not really concerned about speed, so you might as well pick up Herb and Mining and either Tailoring or Enchanting for whoever has the appropriate class (mostly for bags or wands).
---
I want you to design my next tattoo your skills are insane......
---
Horde has more appeal for the edgelords who think ganking is fun.
---
We are also eternally jealous because the edgiest, most masterful trolling during the history of WoW was done by an Alliance guild. 
---
Thank you Serenity Now, you were an inspiration for all of us.
---
There's a good chance streamers wont play on any PVP server as they tend to get griefed by trolls constantly. It's not easy streaming when you have several people out hunting you at all times.
---
because blizzard was terrible at balancing and designing and made some lower spell ranks more efficient to use
---
Well they gonna have an excellent way to monotor the demand. The pregenerated characters will show how many servers they gonna need.
---
The hope is this ruins the game for enough people they roll something else. Id rather not have a server filled with bad warriors that take every scrap of gear because they've been told anyone who can tank is handed gear first (even when they arent tanking.) I see the word entitled thrown around alot lately but holy shit try talking to a delusional warrior about gear priorities.
---
Have you been to the Crossroads recently?
---
Why do you not want to use judgement with seal of command?
---
But did you cum?
---
your hardware must love you
---
No LFG tool, to finde random Dungeons/raids. will love it so much
---
It seems like the interviews say exactly that they revamped it and plan to leave it alone soooo.... Where does that leave us?
---
But they can't keep layering... they already said its gone by P2.
---
Chat XD
---
Did you know Chuck Norris tried 23&amp;me once. The sample came back 100% testosterone.
---
I know there's nothing that can be done, but seeing people get feared outside of the dueling area always triggered me so much, because the fact that they then have to walk back for 5s and can't drink or bandage makes Fear just so overpowered in these duels.
---
Done.
---
More importantly, it counts as a magic effect that can eat up a dispel.
---
You use max rank for that.
---
you don't get showered with items constantly
---
Yeah, that's really not what actually goes down on RP servers aside from a small section of a RP server's population (Which the RP majority tend to mock)
---
WHAT?!  HOW DARE YOU SPEAK SUCH BLASPHEMY HERE!!!1  Get thee to a nunnery
---
Get em to throw down in one of the arena’s. Of course they probably won’t.
---
The real thing to do is be a duck (at least in online games). Let it slide off you.
---
You can go whatever specc in dungeons, the problems in raids, and why you never see certain speccs is the issue of gear. A person doing 2x your dps wont think it's fair your getting his gear, which means you wont get gear, and wont improve your dps. 
---
Aff lock, is the only thing completely impossible though, raiding wise.
---
There will be a sense of community in classic. Almost everything in the game requires teamwork, you will actually see the same person over again. Gear isn’t handed to you for logging in
---
Bonereavers Edge
---
You aight
---
The barrens used to get wrecked by alliance daily when I was leveling back when it was relevant.
---
I should be I got asked directly If I want Join. So dunno. Very upset right now. But I wait Til 6 PM US Time.
---
How is the gold per hour misleading? Skinning gives you X amount of gold and takes Y amount of time.
---
This comment is a personal oppinion.
---
This tournament event was a big hit and very enjoyable to watch. Stream viewers round 100 k more or less. Sure the tournament was something privately created by streamers but the commersial blizz gets out of it is phenomenal. Id personally would teleport those griefing players very far away. Not only just to ease the minds of every viewer of that tournament both present and on twitch
---
This is some collusion right here. Red=Dead
---
Also rebind S to something other than backpedal.  Don't be the newb hunter who backpedals and gets roasted..
---
Hm what ? It sets what the world looks like and what the factions are.
---
All of loarderon plagued by the scourge, dalaran destroyed, stratholme and Naxxramas, the horde sailling to Kalimdor, how the taurens joined them, the night elves joining the alliance...
---
He got killed by a 17 hunter and never managed to res.
---
downsample from 8k, ez heater
---
Man... those old damage numbers look so much better than they currently are on beta. 
---
Really hope they consider looking into that.
---
Many of those players got banned. Secondly your point makes no sense. If it was an alliance griephing.then pvp solutions could work. There is no solution for same faction griephing even on a pvp server.

COD 3-day Return limitation
---
2004 I rolled a warrior and only did so because I had no idea anyone else would have an easier leveling route.  I couldn’t play a warrior past vanilla because I hated leveling so much.
---
But I was so happy to have a warrior at 60 for raiding and pvping
---
People got banned for attacking the funeral. How do people not remember this.
---
If you use a &gt; instead of \, it'll quote text, like this:
---
&gt;That's not true btw, you do appear in the map after a while. That was the WSG timer in vanilla.
---
With no tank? Goodluck lol
---
Oh so you just want to argue :)
---
Only a small number of specs are competitive
---
That's pretty neat.
---
ohh shit, new pvp meta
---
The fact that everything terrible they did after classic will not be there.  TBC began pushing me away, WotK said you aren't moving fast enough so I'm going to offer you a ride off that cliff.
---
You don't know that. None of us know how the servers are going to be allocated. As for that immersion dream your going to have to wear sun glasses, all chat functions off, stock ui, not single addon and play solo unless you have 4 other friends that share your immersion pipe dream.
---
Dude, way too edgy. I'm sure there are a lot of other wastrels out there who've formed a guild.
---
No loot system is perfect. My preferred one is Loot Council that tells that assigns loot before its ever even dropped. At least then you know what you're getting or what your not getting. 
---
Its not a perfect loot system, but its probably the best one.
---
Nah, only weirdos did this
---
The Barrens you have to choose to flag for pvp though, so that seems weird.

Do you have any basic guides? I’m a dwarf lvl 21 warrior looking to DW and DPS (on a priv server).
---
I got decent gear and about BiS sword for my level, yet I keep getting rekt by other melee classes in duels.
---
I’m a fresh player, very limited experience and just now getting out of the clicker/keyboard-turning and into the real way.
---
&gt; Keep in mind that Pickpocket costs energy
---
No it doesn't...
---
They're paying for their meal and the venue to eat it at which is a joint setting, but fine here's a better analogy:
---
What if you paid to visit a beach and you saw people had set up a touch football game in the sand way out of everybody's way. You then decided to instead of doing literally anything else, you went and ran in front of and around the players for the entire game waving your hands.
---
Ignoring the fact that in this scenario you run the risk of getting your face beat in (which WoW doesn't have in uncontested areas), let's assume everybody in the scenario is civil. The beach staff would come ask you to leave and then if you don't comply they'd get security to escort you out.
---
Oh, these guilds already existed back then. Some really good guilds were full of dickheads and griefers. 
---
Also, population size will play a huge role in this. Higher population = higher percentage of dickheads. Generally speaking, people are much nicer on small servers.

Well, they hired him and he works for Blizzard now.
---
The API that Decurive used was changed well before 1.12.1 which is the "build" we are playing.  I believe it was 1.4 that it was changed.  The mod itself exists, but the "one click do my job for me" version no longer worked as of 1.12.
---
This is equal to both factions, your not partaking in it is the only reason it seems one sided.
---
That’s what I was gonna say. I made my way to valley of trials and senjin village to wreck quest givers often.
---
Also Xroads raid anyone? I recall in my early vanilla experience Xroads was raided far more often than red ridge.
---
Then you weren't doing it correctly.
---
Tab target then.
---
If you have progressed, ESPECIALLY with a loot council, you know that the loot goes to the raiders that show up for the progression, the wipes. Does the healing trinket go to the guy the shaman that was with us last Thursday night wiping on H Archimonde for 4 hours straight, or the priest that came in to kill everything up to that point?
---
Not sure if trolling or actually this retarded
---
Honesly i feel like allys are more passive when it comes to wpvp all together. Most 60 hordes will jump on ally upon seeing them. Allys on the other hand would gladly just run by. Obviously it is not like that for each player, but i think for the majority it is.
---
You best here.
---
oh yea true i forgot about balance hybrid ya i guess that would own mage but i havent tested it maybe mage can win anyway. mage is pretty op..
---
That's for current patches, use big brain.
---
So many runaway at low health mobs, hamstring is a life saver.
---
The gameplay mechanics feel more fun to me
---
LARP stands for "Live Action Role Play" and it's done in the real world and not on computers or around the table. Just wanted to point that out.
---
I Don’t care give me release day.  Feel like cartman right meow.
---
any proof that it was changed?
---
No problem! I actually really loved that machinima back in the day XD
---
Whatre the odds they respect the outcome though? A griefer doesnt have shame, likely doesnt have honor either. 
---
In reality when people are massive enough cunts bad shit starts happening...France Decapitated an entire class of people over it. 
---
In an mmo you can just make a new character.
---
No they didn't. Provide source.

 **&lt;Ancient Dragons&gt;** (beta server name) US Alliance PVE Weekend Raid times
---
**AD** is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from never raiding to boss kills in Nax. We have all met in the beta and so you know we're Vanilla players! We are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.  
---
Important note, we are a wine mom/beer dad guild if you enjoy a stiff whiskey or a dark ale while you PVE, I got a beer to share!  
---
**Who do we want?** Just as we are a group of adults with full time jobs/kids, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate drinking buddies to do the same with. 
---
As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.  
---
**What roles are in current demand?** At this current time all roles will be considered including off meta picks like pally tanks, and DPS druids as long as you peruse proper gearing.  
---
**Misc:** Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT) 
---
•    Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming pre bis (even those with little interest in raiding). 
---
•    Organized PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest in doing so, especially in the later phases. 
---
•    Loot rules are still to be determined by group consensus  
---
•    The name is a place holder and will be determined closer to launch with a Discordd vote.  How to join? You can search out Ancient Dragons on the Alliance PVE beta server
---

---
It counts as a magic buff and therefore eats a dispel. If you don't think hardcore PVPers are going to be using every trash buff they can get their hands on, you're delusional.
---
Yeah... That's why I edited my post and credited the person who actually gave a good description. Thanks for pointing that out after the fact though, very helpful!
---
Ahh feels good to know people at Blizzard, but it feels way better to brag about on Reddit.
---
Sorry to break it to you but I don’t think people are going to be very happy to know that playing this game for 14 years means less to blizzard then knowing some one at Blizzard.

https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
&gt; If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account.
---
When your idea of "fun" is to simply irritate other players and ruin other players game experience, you don't deserve to be part of the event/game/community.  Stupidity like that shouldn't be tolerated, and I'm glad Blizzard did something.
---
Stop defending that idiot just because you have some vendetta against streamers.  He was ruining the event for everybody involved for no other reason than to get attention.
---
So odd. I got asked directly by the devse and not in yet xD
---
I am not the villain. The horde are.
---
I definitely pick up Skinning because its the only Profession you can level while powerleveling without going out of your way to farm stuff. I never can get mining above 75 unless I get out of my way to farm Tin Ore until 125. Same for Herbalism.
---
Wall climb into old Hyjal. Would be great seeing level 1's try
---
First struggle is getting enough warm bodies 60s on every night.
---
Hey, I live for that.  I'm not EU, but someone will be willing to help, guilds and servers will be full of helpful people.  People gain reputations on a server, people really can't afford to be assholes because blacklists are a real thing and to be honest most people coming back were there in vanilla as new players and understand what you're going through. I don't think you'll have any trouble finding a core group of friends and a bunch of acquaintances.
---
Additionally, you can use distract on a warlock or hunter pet (but not the player himself) and unless the player is paying attention, will keep running and despawn the pet.
---
Oops, my bad! I didn’t realize that.
---
Sure bro. Dont forget to swallow after youre done servising him too.
---
No idea what most guilds will end up doing this time, but it was common on my server for most to use some form of tiered DKP system.
---
Attendance awarded points, and if people were in the same 'tier' (lets say between 15 and 20 points) then they would roll against each other.  Never heard a single complain over this system, as it flat out awarded just being there.
---
If you are talking about serenity now. I don't have a source but, he's 100% right multiple members got perma banned for doing it. Turns out not everyone is a 16 year old virgin edge lord and the adults didn't take to that kindly.
---
x4
---
I only meant is as a weapon for like warriors and rouges, cause it would give them extra stats from, I know other bows are better for dps as a hunter. Guess I should have made that more clear mb haha
---
&gt;unfunny meme
---
&gt;using y’all
---
I wish I could bother making another account to downvote more than once.
---
Based on facts, not feelings, yes.
---
No, they changed that way before 1.12. 
---
In fact, they changed this when they nerfed 5 man content in general.
---
This! I'm usually the friend that does too much research, watches too many videos and guides and goes in way over prepared. And I love tanking for that reason. I'm also too much of a "I need to be the center of attention and stroke my own dick in a competitive environment" so I still play dps primarily but. It really makes tanking a lot of fun and feel very worthwhile. It's a very "Silent stoic leader" kinda vibe. If you know what you're doing then nobody will ever know how hard you work for it.
---
&gt;I feel loot council is going to be shady with some people in a 40man raid.
---
Only if you're shitbag raid leaders. Be transparent and fair, and it's fine.
---
I was JUST about to fucking link that video, seriously gives me goose bumps its so good. 11/10
---
I'm jewish, but thanks.
---
Haha made me laugh
---
i came here too ask this too
---
Lmao same. What's going on
---
One word,  China
---
Best bet is to let them make a character and just leave them alone their first day. If they ask questions answer them but that’s it. If you info dump it won’t end well. 
---
Be prepared for them to just not like it. My wife players with us but she is super casual.  It’s totally okay to have different hobbies.

---
Maybe don’t spread misinformation when you have literally no idea what you’re talking about
---
Bollocks, yea its http://truefaith.eu will get it fixed thx
---
it was based on who needed it more and who was more deserving.
---
at any rate, awarding dkp for wipes (if not more? like you said) would allow people to have way to much DKP. Progression is hard, which makes me think awarding extra DKP for the first kill is a good idea.
---
But ive never heard of a guild or system awarding points for not doing something. Sounds like participation trophies to me
---
 This is a result of what happens when you got 3 months to kill and no beta.
---
SoC requires a super-slow 2H, which means any swing-interruptions (to cast JoC) are *huge* DPS losses.
---
Just open with JoR and then switch to SoC.
---
I have no idea either. But shit went from 0-100 real quick
---
lmao yeah man WoW is definitely way too complicated to play while stoned. STAY BACK GANJO'S
---
It was intentional. Your most powerful spell was not meant to also be your most efficient.
---
Me neither. But I checked anyways.
---
Because wipes are worth more than kills. They cost more gold and cause more exhaustion, they are also what inevitably leads to kills. A raid that spend all night wiping should be more rewarded than those that just cleared farm content.
---
Swift Boots, Whelp chest, Nifty Stopwatch, spider belt...
---
rank 1 frostbolt is a 1.5s cast time and slows for 40% for 5s. rank 11 frostbolt is a 3s cast time and slows for 40% for 9 seconds. it's not always about damage
---
&lt;Really High Warlords&gt;
---
you´re playing with ppl and not solo
---
I think no flying contributes to the main difference: the pace. Everything in WoW Classic is slower, less pressured. Which is mainly a good thing.
---
No LFG in Classic. Plenty of other differences but the LFG tool is the big one.
---
if ip's are different then they are different....
---
I dont know much in depth, but someone said Tipsout and his dad scammed $800k+ by having a construction company and not doing any work or something? I saw someone say something about it in stream but I dont know anything is it true. Just rumor I guess
---
goodluck man i hope you get a thunderfury bi-weekly. i'd join you but i'm US
---
I garuntee there's more players who care about maxing out and skill on rp PvP servers vs normal rp servers. I want competitive players AND immersion. I would play on a normal PvP server over any type of pve server.
---
Duel someone and beat/finish them on top of a campfire.
---
Just look at the 0/30/21 HOTW spec for druids. You can get most of the kitty killing OR tanking abilities (pick 1) and enough healing talents to not be bad.
---
What about the old troll of releasing an infernal as a warlock in goldshire, or another low level zone?  The infernal can kill same faction players. Would that be constituted as griefing aswell?
---
I can't everything except reddit is blocked at my job but, 100% multiple of their members got banned.
---
The way Asmongold keeps talking about it makes me feel like he secretly does want to talk about it
---
But it takes a quarter of the time to get there. Go figure.
---
I have a feeling a lot of the new casual guilds will be Casual as far as raid schedules go but with experienced/progression minded folks who still want to advance with the limited time they have. This is what I'm hoping to find myself.
---
Uh oh.
---
Conflicted between Orc and TAUREN**

---
The first hunter on my server back then who got Warlord used the spec and taught me it.
---
Back then there was also the rare wolf Lupus who's bite did shadow damage and ignored armor... it was pretty sweet to melt warriors and pally's.
---
You'll lose more members to Loot Countil than you ever did to poachers
---
Tauren* homie.
---
Also true! Do you think that is a good or bad thing?
---
So you're LFD macros, eh?  (sorry, couldn't resist)

This is what I've been saying the whole time.

the reward is downing the content, the whole reason we objected to retail wow and asked for classic in the first place.
---
I already agree giving extra points for guild first kills would be a good idea
---
What would an example of cross faction griefing on a pvp realm be? Just curious, cant really think of any of the top of my head
---
How can you use abilities on someone on your own faction? Or am I missing something obvious?
---
you are going to have to make up for the lost XP, but you beeing 4, running instances will be fun
---
Toxic toxic le toxic DAE mctoxic nuggets
---
We’re doing Warrior and Shaman:
---
* Skinning/Mining on the Warrior
---
* Herbalism/Alchemy on the Shaman
---
We figured Tailoring for bags would be bad since we aren’t clothies, and we figured Enchanting works fine for a lvl 5 bank alt. 
---
That sound right to you? Leatherworking also seems wrong too since Shamans end up with mail.
---
You are not a casual player. Most casual players dont even hit cap, nor ever step into a raid (not even LFR). You are a hardcore fan, so is everyone else raiding.   
---
Raids are 100% irrelevant to the game, hence why the more inaccessible raids were, the more players played the game.   
---
You wrote several paragraphs only about raiding. Please stop. 99% of players that try classic will never even attempt to raid.   
---
I'll repeat myself, most players didnt even get to level 50 back in Vanilla. Thats the audience blizz lost years ago.

This guy is fun
---
Why are you playing WoW?  To enjoy a game with your friends? Then 4 man it.  Who cares if its slow or inefficient, or whatever.  You are playing a game to have fun with your mates.
---
You can also get the nozdormu rep ring for damage later as well.. pretty good ring
---
More realistic. Spells don't travel at the speed of light, buddy
---
 can see that their guild continued to play for awhile after that. They would have banned everyone involved if it was really a problem.
---
No one got banned for engaging in PvP on a PvP server in a contested zones. I await your source. Feel free to post it after work.
---
1.10 changed this, it is documented. 
---
Before then, they even changed UBRS and dire maul back in 1.3.  
---
This will not be possible in classic, nor should they bring it back for the reasons mentioned in their own patch notes.
---
Oof, the stickied posts have 0 upvotes...
---
Diablo 2-style random attributes would be kind of interesting.
---
Would be nice to know what actually happened yeah.
---
Ok, but that doesn't mean I like names unrelated to the race people are playing. I'm not looking to play an rpg where people have names that you would see on cs go. I'll deal with it but I always thought it was corny meanwhile people would look at me like I'm weird when I had a traditional tauren name instead of beefydps lol
---
Hillsbrad fields falls victim to Alliance messing with horde.
---
Source: I'm an Alliance who messes with horde in Hillsbrad fields.
---
You seem smart
---
Classic feels like a real RPG with a lot of love put into every tiny detail, while BFA feels like a slot machine on-rails.
---
Also in Classic you feel like truly progressing whatever you do, every bit matters, while in BFA, because of how the scaling works, you feel like going backwards, you are actually weaker while leveling up until you reach a certain item level threshold.
---
Differing IPs doesn’t lock you out if you’re using an authenticator.
---
I'd say: just go with feral if he's going ele.
---
Sure I'll look it up then but, normally no everyone doesn't get banned. The ring leaders got banned.
---
1.3  and then 1.10 changed it so all 5 mans had a player cap.  
---
This will not, and absolutely should not be in classic for reasons of trivializing dungeon content.  It was an absolute disaster in vanilla when people for over a year were 10 manning strat/scholo to level form 56-60 and gear up with little to no challenge. 
---
This was done for a reason.
---
Classic is pretty simple actually
---
My favorite rebut to the tax is if they save up for too long and don't upgrade their gear then they'll fall behind in their role and risk losing their spot in progression period. I'm not really a true fan of the tax, but if it needs to be there, it needs to be small... People should be able to pool a little bit if they're helping out on a lot of the farms or 20 mans. It encourages people to keep going to help other get geared after they're geared.
---
Agreed! That's why I kinda wanted to see what people think of it, we're doing it either way most likely, but it would be good to have an idea of what progress will look like
---
If they could apply Classic principles to TBC &amp; Wrath, that would be great. It would be difficult, but doable.
---
I don't have "some vendetta against streamers". Just anyone who whines about others playing the game in a way that they think shouldn't be allowed. Especially when they are breaking ToS (twice) themselves. It just so happens that Blizzard is actually listening to the streamers, when they won't, and haven't ever, listened to anyone else about something like this.
---
Pick what you think will be fun.
---
Try me. The only real challenge might be Rank 11 and the Scarab Lord mount, but other than that other stuff should be easily doable by grinding.
---
Don't worry about racials.    The answer is always Tauren
---
Ya I had to play on some ps’s to help me decide finally lol but for me leveling a Druid is actually gonna be a first on classic. I didn’t spend much time with it in tbc bc my friend who introduced me was already one so I kinda had to choose a hunter &amp; I also leveled a rogue a bit, then on ps I mainly leveled a shaman bc I thought I would main Druid when classic officially came out which is basically what I was saying, it literally took me months to decide I was going with my 1st choice anyway lmao. Also I think priest is gonna be my 1st alt :D
---
ive never trusted authenticator after it was revealed that hackers were successfully targetting people who had authenticators and successfully getting in

You can do that with earthbind totem too, real nice early on

I started playing BC when I was 9 or 10. My first character (a tauren warrior) I walked up to one of the guards who had a polearm and told him I liked his weapon. I thought it was a player. I sat there and waited for him to respond for way longer than I'd like to admit

I dont know if its true, think for yourself
---
Not really but it is what it is
---
If you were taking a random guy's opinion for decision making; my recommendation would be druid. It's a really fun class to play and allows you to do everything (albeit as a master of none). If you want to heal, tank, be a rogue, and be a spell caster you can do it all. You also have a basic movement ability outside of mounts.
---
I agree. There’s more complaining about toxicity than actual toxicity. And Too much complaining is toxic.
---
The only real question is did he buy that mountain bike.

be careful spreading rumors man

Because it takes a while to earn it.
---
It will be much slower
---
OKAY that makes more sense. I wish he would explain vaguely to quell the massive confusion he's not handling it very well. Mass bans and timeouts isn't smart.
---
Just play rogue /s(pit)
---
If you will enjoy it, do it.
---
You will be drinking.  A lot. Like. A lot A LOT.
---
Seems like the guy was just trying to cause drama by spreading false rumors. Asmon's reaction makes me think there is something more going on though.
---
It's funny because it's true :D
---
jack of all trades..
---
MASTER OF NONE
---
&gt; imagine how cool of a game it'd be if they had come anywhere near finishing it.
---
Why are you even here?
---
Not really any proof besides memories, pservers and vanilla wiki
---
nope. Don't farm that, useless. Post 'em all on the AH if you've got em for like 1 silver each, I'll trash them for ya.
---
BWL will likely be out in spring / after squid is no longer obtainable. Squid will skyrocket during the summer.
---
Nah I'm talking about then weirdos that did it everywhere, not just in PvP
---
 I assume they chose their race based on min max but hated looking at it or something.
---
It's insane to me how picky people are regarding any post about a streamer on this subreddit. Could the event have been better? Probably. Was the event a really fun time for plenty of people and promote community? Definitely. Don't really see the need for people crapping on Tips for this.
---
Did you get an email as well? Or did it just show up on your launcher?
---
can you give me a list of things that are funny your Highness ?
---
Shouting bc rare? I know gnome has far better racials...but i like the esthetics of human more...am i going to get ridiculed for rolling a human mage?
---
Read the text if you enjoy it!
---
And if you enjoy it there is a great addon I use called Storyline (I’m not sure if it will be available on classic) that basically makes reading quest text a bit more immersive.
---
Alliance griefs Crossroads and Tarren Mill. At least they did when I played TBC.
---
Many guild first kills will come after three nights of wiping, extra DKP is really gonna raise morale for that
---
Oh I enjoy playing mage. It's ridiculously good against a lot of classes.
---
Druid is just deplorable against some. Priests can just purge all your hots off and cleanse all your dots, and very easily. You end up bating purges with noggen to try and get a nature swiftness off. Then you end up losing spectacularly anyway as the priest eats a burrito irl and owns you with 3 buttons on his mouse. D':
---
Why are you asking?
---
Wow, looks straight out of a Warcraft I &amp; II manual! Awesome!
---
Are we sure this is only F&amp;F?
---
I dont believe in these rumors myself, but people wanted to know what he’s talking about
---
Well have to console ourselves with knowledge people like this will never have their pp touched. Eventually well see his posts on r/mgtow, or r/incel.
---
It's works both ways correct? They can hit you from further away too, but you can only swing at 1 person. 
---
I like the different size hitboxes. It's one of the very vanilla things that make classic cool :P
---
top tier shitpost m8
---
I r8 8 of 8 m8
---
Not true. When people abused a bug in ICC to make the fight easier all got temp banned. They've also temp banned entire guilds before, even the players that weren't involved at all.
---
I think they will all be fun. :(
---
I'm fully aware of that. Mages use R1 frostbolt in PVP for a quick slow. It's even 1.0s cast time once you're talented in Improved Frostbolt.
---
The aforementioned scaling issue is the reason why healers won't always downrank to the lowest spell level, especially a druid's healing touch. Paladins and Shamans don't have that issue, as Flash of Light and Chain Heal are both learned at or after level 20.
---
Asmon mentioned it has to do with doxxing. And tipsout deleted the vod from the tourney which means he probably accidentally leaked his info or leaked someone else’s. Just my logical guess tho.
---
Twitch drama, how rare.
---
I agree with you. Even though I love Classic over BfA - we should not be blind towards the bad things of Classic.
---
for leveling its fine, it will be slower, but fine, the bonus is that you have more focus on int gear at 60 so the swap to resto is much easier, downside is if your going hotw/resto you are behind on the feral gear
---
I've played Vanilla, Wrath - BFA. Flying did in fact ruin world PvP. Not to say there wasn't any, but it was boring &amp; campy. Someone would fly high above waiting for you to grab a node or kill a mob, then they'd just appear and kill you. It was really stupid. You also had hunters who would jump off their mount, hit you with abilities, then parachute to the ground. It's just retarded to say that PvP with flying mounts is even on par without flying mounts.
---
An ASAPscience fan, I see.
---
Because legendary items were also mentioned for loot council.  Of course this is going to affect other people. 
---
We are talking mindsets here, and if resentment builds, then guild drama erupts over time.
---
well linus tech tips did 16k gameing almost 2  years a go. 
---

---
Alliance has a rule, if it's undead, better make it dead. Undead have been KoS on every private server I've played on, especially if you're a rouge/lock/mage. We know why you rolled undead, we hate you for rolling undead, we will kill you if you roll undead. So there's a reason to not roll undead .
---
Yeah, xroads and Splintertree post was my second home as ally, and that says a lot.
---
I hope the bugged catapult still exists in XR.. Griefing the FP by constantyl keeping it in combat was good times.
---
Which is an especially silly attitude when you look at how Esports pros are often *really* quick to adapt from one game to another within their genre (or even cross-genre sometimes)
---
A Street Fighter pro can become a MK or DBFZ or MvC pro in a matter of months. Half the Overwatch pros came from TF2, and Halo + CoD trade off pros between each other all the time.
---
But here you have people saying "Just cause they're Esports pros on WoW Retail, they won't be on WoW Classic!!!" Absolutely delusional lmao.
---
Exactly this is what bothers me too!
---
Both are good for PvP, so just choose the race which looks better and is civilized enough to wear footwear.
---
runescape has a similar concept with game ticks that happen every 0.6 seconds I think. of course, once people got actually good at the game people started doing tick manipulation to speed up training, PK better etc. think something similar will happen?
---
No ubwont  be able to get r12-14 gear with that little playtime because there will be people on all servers who eill play 12hrs a day if not more, if u dont have that much time go for raiding gear instead it will do good in pvp
---
&gt; On a PvP server, any presence of the other faction whatsover.
---
as a druid, I literally cannot help myself if I see a gnome aoe farming something. I have to pounce it.
---
First e-begging now this? Lmao
---
Other spoilers: SF earthquakes= disaster. Tsunamis = disaster
---
His reaction is pretty odd, but just spreading false rumors seem much more likely
---
I don’t see how you can be constructive AND call me a man child at the same time.
---
If I was master looting DPS gear and mounts rightfully so call me out on it.  But having a geared MT is good for progression. Having a loot list for your MT is good planning. My guild in Vanilla had major problems with Tanks getting gear then leaving the rest of us to swing in the breeze. Makes sense the Guild Master would stick with his guild right?
---
You can disagree with me without being a rude about it and resulting to childish name calling.
---
same here.
---
Remember kids, if you end up getting reported for these things, and that leads to a suspension or ban, that's part of the banter too
---
doesn't mean its not bad design because its intentional
---
1. Learn Engineering 
---
2. You can Feign death + swap trinkets / gear (for example Shadow reflector) so during the fight you can use 4 or 6 trinkets 
---
3. Remember to drink when you can during Freezing trap (you are out of combat due to Feign death) ... even 3 sec of drinking is important
---
4. Use potions ... there is a potion for every occasion 
---
5. Master kiting and CC ... train with 4 mobs at once and try to control your fight 
---
6. Learn to use Aspect of Cheetah efficiently ... train while fighting shooting mobs ... you need to know when to use it to gain distance when kiting 
---
7. Learn to throw stun grenades at running enemies 
---
8. Learn skills and openers of every class ... knowledge is a winner here !!! 
---
9. Hunter with right potions, Engineering tools, equipment to swap has best tools from all classes to do OP things ... Feign Death is a name of a game ... there is always a perfect potion + trinket to counter someone ... 
---
10. Potentiality have resistance gear to swap ... I need to test it as I don't remember from vanilla and info I found in internet is no good ... 
---
11. Focus on getting good bow as a priority 
---
12. Cat pet (Broken Tooth) if you are NE to combo Shadowmeld and do stealthy shenanigans:)
---
Except when they do? (When cast just as server tick goes through)
---
yeah could have possibly handled that worse? if he had answered the original question with "I dunno" and moved on I wouldn't be here or searching on youtube LMAO
---
K bud. Have a nice day.
---
Nah. Mounts are 60
---
Have a mage friend who can give you stacks and stacks of water and you'll be fine.
---
Wow.  Tips started doing vids because he was unemployed.  Dude started on this subreddit basically and ppl started to donate to him.  Wonder if that was true or not.
---
Understandable. Have a nice day.
---
Because a small outspoken group of crybabies lobbied for it .
---
Those guys arent coming back. Classic nor any mmo is bringing back someone who didnt ever hit cap on live.
---
Classic has about a 170-250 hours leveling experience (best part of classic), 5 mans/raiding, pvp and farming/making gold. Thats the game. 
---
Its 2019, guides exist in plethora for leveling, anyone who wants to hit cap will do so. That leaves them with about 3 weeks of dungeons at 15-20 hours of gameplay a week. So maybe double that if players are doing pvp and farming along with dungeon clearing. The game runs stale in about 400 hours played without new content. 
---
That leaves raiding and pvp. Yes, raiding had a high barrier to entry until LFR, but it doesnt now and as a result  the majority of your live wow playerbase who have any inclination to play classic are endgame focused. 
---
Very few people are coming to classic with the intent to just lackadaisically play though the game--thats why theres 20 posts a day about optimizing your leveling route, professions, and race/class choice. 
---
Whether they ultimately reach cap or not, the majority of people newbies and veterens are endgame focused this time around. The past 15 years of video games have conditioned us to that. The only people who arent are going to be gaming newbies--kids, young teens.  
---
I dunno mate, seems like we have diametrically opposed suppositions as to how classic will play out. Only time will tell, we will definitively know about 4 months after 8/27/19 which is when your "average" player who "mains" wow will hit cap and have blue gear to raid with. Guess we will have to see what they all choose to do then.
---
i honestly cannot remember where i got it from
---
You should actually read what he posted before responding :o
---
No, it'll be fine unless you plan on playing really hardcore, and even then, it won't really matter.
---
This is what they are referring to  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClB5278A2xo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClB5278A2xo)
---
If you guys are a solid group then instance farming will be a good option. You can fish out a lot of really good twink items while leveling and save them for phases 3-4 when less people are running the lower level dungeons. The BoE blues definitely appreciate in value as the server ages, so stock pile them in your bank. Also once you hit Zul'Farrak, you'll have a chance for BoE epics to drop. Somebody should definitely take enchanting and if you split the shards as you level, you should make enough money to get everyone a mount at 40. Good luck.
---
Asmon was just raging about this in chat. what the hell happened???
---
A comment linking a YouTube video was deleted here but it explained the situation pretty clearly. I'm guessing Mods deleted it.
---
Lol everyone knows dragons are allergic to elf bread, pal
---
Imagine caring about streamers
---
It is divine retribution for reporting Trollgodx, the unsung martyr of our crusade against streamer scum.
---
Gotta find some critters with a high respawn rate to train on! For the Alliance there is a spawn point in the Tram that pumps out rats every few seconds.
---
Yeah, you can bind them to ralt, rctrl and rshift to have 3 extra modifier keys you can use with your foot. Basically doubles the keys you use for abilities if you're already using the usual ctrl + shift modifiers.
---
Yes, but he himself stated that they are only raiding 2 days a week... this isn't a serious raiding guild.  
---
He is trying to use a fast progression system in a casual setting.  It is absolutely going to implode.
---
Eh, not really. But I enjoy drama, it's not for everyone though.
---
&gt;journey was the destination 
---
Bridge four!

All of what you said was in Warcraft 3 Reign of Chaos.  None of it was in the Frozen Throne which was exactly what I said.

No one is keyboard turning. You keep your right mouse button held down for turning otherwise your mouse over macros will be going off on all kinda of shit by accident. You won't be moving while casting a fear, root, poly.
---
anyone know anything about the "tipsout situation"? someone donated to asmongold asking just now, and he literally sperged out and perma banned people for asking what it was, then going to timing out THOUSANDS of people who asked about it lmfao.
---
I remember it by getting lost and diyng because we didnt kill all the dragon humanoids :)
---
I would just do a warrior exactly as you said at the end of your first post. Green quests and green enemies all the way. Faster quests, less deaths, less rest. Off with the haters.

Yup. Currently leveling a warrior and I'd be willing to bet that, at best, I have a 60-65% chance to hit. Mobs your own level will fucking murder you. It's the worst experience I've ever had, I'd rather level a paladin again.
---
If it didn't happen in Vanilla, I don't think it will happen in Classic.
---
Yes it does work both ways. That being said. As a warrior you welcome the attentions of others. better them hit your giant ass then turn tail to hit the healers.
---
It's like "HEY GUYS I HAVE A SECRET DONT TALK ABOUT IT" why'd you even fuckin say anything?
---
Why’s it always rogues man. When I was in a guild that used epgp the rogues agreed to always let the daggers go to offspec (free) and wouldn’t ya know it, only the rogues needed offspec daggers.
---
What about priest/paladin spells?

Orc shaman is the only way to go. Anyone saying otherwise is alliance scum trying to undermine the greatness of the horde.

&gt;They're paying for their meal and the venue to eat it at which is a joint setting, but fine here's a better analogy:
---
&gt;What if you paid to visit a beach and you saw people had set up a touch football game in the sand way out of everybody's way. You then decided to instead of doing literally anything else, you went and ran in front of and around the players for the entire game waving your hands.
---
&gt;Ignoring the fact that in this scenario you run the risk of getting your face beat in (which WoW doesn't have in uncontested areas), let's assume everybody in the scenario is civil. The beach staff would come ask you to leave and then if you don't comply they'd get security to escort you out.
---
And if the football game was set up in an "out of bounds" area on the beach that should, technically, be against the rules for everyone in that area? Of if it was 'members only' but they brought in 'non-members' of the beach/resort/whatever doesn't matter.
---
&gt; Blizzard holds the complete right to decide at their discretion what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior. And they hold the right to act on it as they see fit.
---
They do. And everyone at that tournament was breaking ToS in 2 different ways. Wall Jumping into an "out of the map" area, and communicating with opposing faction. But one guy, who was maybe 'harassing' someone with a loose definition of the term in context of WoW, got singled out.
---
wtf are you even talking about? The USSR is always the bad guy or displayed in a negative light lol; red sparrow just recently as an example. The rest of the words you made up and no they don’t make you sound smart.
---
If I had a tauren shaman It'd be female and name Elizabeth tauren.
---
If you can play 3 hours a day for 3 days a week you can join a decent raiding guild and will have far better gear than rank 14.
---
These are people that hate on tips and are spreading fake news
---
&gt;when they won't, and haven't ever, listened to anyone else about something like this.
---
Care to expand on this, do you actually have any definitive proof of this at all?  
---
As for not having anything against streamers, just stop...you bitch about them in every post you make.  As hilarious as that is, it's also a bit pathetic.
---
Streamers are showcasing their game to the world, why in the world would they NOT want to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible and get rid of the complete morons (Like that troll) who try to ruin it?  It's common sense.
---
YTA

Ughhh...that’s a lot of reading for a video.

yeah I'm sure you're the coolest kid on the block

Computers don't last longer or anything from being turned off.

They actually say that powering them up is worse for them than just keeping them running all the time.
---

---
Just look into the company that they ran.
---
Leveling is fucking aids are you kidding me? No need to try and flex dick about how "not bad" the leveling experience is. It's the worst of any class, by a large margin.
---
This is definitely a problem and might ruin a servers economy. Instead of there being 4 black lotuses you have 4 per shard. Could spiral out of control real fast.
---
Druids can tank and heal. If you change your mind you only have to respec and not reroll.
---
yeah i was making joke
---
This is related to the fact that Battle Shout rank 3 gains an extra 0.5 attack power bonus every time you level up. Not sure why the three screenshots are showing different values though. The basic amount is 55 attack power.
---
Woah now bud. There's always been a lot of confusion around what Spell Batching is, and some people still spread misinformation. Guy you responded to is at least correcting his comment after getting the correct info. No need to be a dick about it.
---
Doesn't really seem applicable at all to levelling...
---
Moonkin is absolutely trash in raids thanks to the piss poor mana regen.  
---
They are decent in 5 mans.  I actually kind of enjoyed having them in dungeon runs.
---
Great, now I can never see the world map without seeing two faces
---
I will never make an orc again. Everytime I get stunned I get triggered and offended 😅

---
A casual guild isn't going to care that much; with that said, they aren't going to have too many of them, that is for sure.  
---
Keep in mind... warriors aren't going to be top DPS until they start dipping into AQ40.   How many people are actually going to be raiding AQ40+ to begin with?
---
Check for Cadet, he has some usefull stuff.
---
Um, I’d put my friends and family above some rando any day. No hesitation.
---
It’s going to keep getting reposted more than likely. I have seen several links so far. Bomline Tips and his father were in charge of a company that may have defrauded the us government. The video is against the TOS because it clearly is doxxing.
---
that is disappointing to say the least.
---
No joke I was attacking something and I had at least half a bar more hp then the money, kept hitting until it was 2 hit away and I was 3 and out of every time I could miss in a row it had to be then and I died ;-; talk about luck haha
---
You're welcome mate! ;)
---
I can confirm that SM Library is capped at 5 on the Beta. We attempted to bring more than 5 in to complete the IF quest that rewards a neck piece. More than 5 people got a "too many players in instance" error and they were kicked back out. 
---
I don't see why other leveling dungeons would be different.
---
Honestly, I think you misunderstood your chat with whoever you spoke to at Blizzard. 99% chance you didn't speak with a dev, also sounds like they just meant by "joining the beta" that they'll tick the box on your beta profile invites on Blizzards site.
---
I don't know. I've been so stuck between mage and rogue. And I've always played rogue and I want to stick with it but fuck. Classic mage looks so fun. I'm also worried about playing rogue and constantly wanting to swap talents for PvP and pve
---
pservers have 3day return. wow vanilla wiki says 3day return. any patchnotes about COD return time being changed?
---
Why not just rematch the duel 4Head
---
For a second I thought you was jocking.
---
&gt;Keep adding 10 more levels and making old content a pointless chore was an obvious oversight when making the system.
---
I think that Heirlooms &amp; Dungeon finder killed the leveling experience, not adding more levels. I do agree that we didn't necessarily need to up the level cap by 10 each time. Also, adding abilities &amp; changing the talents altered the leveling experience, because you got X ability or Y talent while leveling this time around. Perhaps that's not much of an issue, but it is a "change."
---
&gt; I think adding more to the old world, as opposed to making it irrelevant, is a much better tool to combat stagnation, SPECIFICALLY (This is vital.) with a progression through previous content. Keep \*as much as possible\* relevant. 
---
They really did need to do this. They kind of attempted it with Caverns of Time &amp; Karazhan, but it wasn't enough. Caverns of Time kind of pissed me off. Adding time travel is always a no-no. It would be interesting to do what you said, but backwards. Sure, bring about Northrend, but don't let the players access the entirety of it, kind of like how Hyjal, Uldum, Etc. are in the Vanilla world. The world would feel more progressive in this sense. The mystery isn't resolved all at once during an expansion &amp; a few patches, but it's resolved in later expansions. You could bring about an expansion that gauges interest in part of a new continent as well as old areas. Maybe it's a big deal to build a stronghold in Hellfire Peninsula, but it's not dire that we  explore all of Outland at once? IDK if that makes sense.
---
Private server values have been known to have incorrect/made-up values for multiple things. If this was a vid from a private server, the money values could be made up/guessed by the private server devs and won’t reflect what Classic could have.
---
lmfao this is so accurate

go nuts.
---
If you make it your alt it would be better with a +30 spell power skinning knife.
---
are hybrids truly hybrids or are they kind of a waste in raiding? like a boom/restoration hybrid or ele/resto shaman?
---
Are you a cop?
---
you really should. just spam the fuck out of hamstring to level those weapon skills
---
Well, Horde are 'safer' longer in Barrens which lasts up to level 25 in a lot of cases whereas Alliance have to venture into Redridge at level 15 or so and it is risky there.
---
However, Stonetalon is a popular Alliance target, as is Hillsbrad.
---
Disagree, troll and tauren are OG Horde
---
Hamstring is one of the most important skills to get btw. Most mobs attack much faster than you so if you hamstring them and then kite so they only hot you when you can swing at them you gain a ton of survivability.
---
Thank you Asmongold! Wouldn't have known about this without you!
---
Because the half finished one they put out still seems really good.
---
Just cause it could be better doesn't mean it's bad
---
&gt; rot kiting
---
Wut
---
No DKP, just free rolls unless you've already won something. Just need a guild not filled with dicks.
---
post deleted?
---
I'm going tauren shaman. They are very similar but I really like how great warstomp is for group content.
---
yea I have this problem playing in NA too. a \~120ms delay is enough to make it hard to kite with hamstring and time your auto attacks. honestly Im just too lazy to deal with it now and I just face tank everything.
---
Yeah I love this. Every race should have had a unique ability for every class! Would have been an even greater nightmare to balance though
---
Keep em coming, I forgot all about these.
---
Bummer about lock I guess. Do you foresee any time that these classes will get raid invites? maybe a year after launch or something? Curious how the Nostralious server represented after the first year or so of the same raids?

yeah that's the reason I ask. I get R12-14, it's an extreme grinding that require insane playtime. That's why I ask if there is any alternatives.
---
Still have my first character, it’s been race changed like 5 times and faction changed once and server transferred once. He doesn’t know what’s real anymore.
---
He got doxxed. Apparently he and his father owned a construction contracting vompany and were shut down for fraud. Big money was involved.
---
$800,000 or so. 
---
I shouldn't be surprised, but holy hell I didnt see that coming. At the worse, I assumed it was a leaked conversation of tips saying how he is milking this community but here we are.
---
sounds like most class/spec can be used in 5 mana but our of the question for raiding? do you know how hybrids will be viewed? like a resto/boom hybrid? or is that too little of the good and too much the bad?
---
Pvp gear is really good when it comes out, but the later the game goes the worse it gets.  Weapons are the most important and theres really good weapons that you can get in MC, BWL, and ZG (once those raids are out) that compare or are better than pvp weapons
---
'Sub optimal' isn't how I'd describe doing less than half the damage of another player, but yeah. You could show up without any talent points trained at all, if you really wanted. Knock yourself out.
---
Sounds like you just want to argue and ignore the points being presented. You’re head is up your ass and you literally just want to be right. You’re not
---
You are the one that fails to see the truth.   This is a remake.   When WoW first released we paid a monthly fee so that Blizzard had the funds to create new content.   There's no new content being developed for the game.  No new content updates = No sub fee
---
TL:DR Normal construction contract crap that someone is trying to play off as fraud is what it looks like.  
---
Contract disputes and nonsense like that.
---
No lol haha. They grabbed my E-Mail Address on Friday, to make sure I am in current wave :)
---
sociable I can do :) charming, that's what lock pets are for anyway ;)
---
What's poggers?
---
yeah i checked those, don't work
---
If you want to be gimped in pvp then go Tauren. It’s personal preference. But if you want to be a literal god then Orc is the only option.
---
only in AQ+
---
They are shit, they’re just tanky lol
---
I don’t remember ever having trouble with them, actually always felt bad for people playing them
---
What do you mean by multiple layers ?
---
Everyone who has told me they are going to read all the quest text stopped reading before level 20. Aside from a few quests most text is generic and boring.
---
I think it depends, we know Classic is part of the $15 subscription but if they keep it locked off from the free trial theres a damn good chance they could severely curb the Gold Farmers
---
Pretty sure just F&amp;F, they told us, they invite the Top 3 of F&amp;F which are \~1500 People. So doubt any public Wave.
---
"whats the command to leave your guild?"
---
Full fat greek honey yoghurt mmmmh
---
Warstomp just complements the elemental shaman so well, especially considering the lack of hard CC on shamans.
---
He was a shithead and noone gives a shit about him. Not even  jokingly.
---
I see what you are saying about raiding. it's always been the same thing in wow, regardless of expansion and player base, meta meta meta. Kind of a bummer, was hoping for classic to finally get away from the meta more. Any idea the outlook say 12-18-24 months down the road? anyone expecting more lax requirements?
---
If there is someone who actually does Elemental I will do that.
---
And what kind of raiding will that time get? I think Naxx is out of the question but is that possible to do BWL or AQ40. Also, I always want to use Ashkandi (it looks badass) but it was impossible for my guide to grind BWL at the time due to 400-500ms ping and not enough people.
---
Does skinning mobs make them respawn faster
---
Why do you think gimped? Anything to say about the 2 combos (arguably 1 gimmick) possible only for Tauren?
---
Tell that to all the dead horde flight masters and all the horde lowbies getting safespotted in booty bay and gadgetzan
---
after tipsout getting doxxed peopel found out that he and his father ran a scam  construction company and scammed some guy 1 million dollars. he had to testify in court.
---
Leatherworking eventually makes Mail armor, but none of it is especially great.
---
I’d probably skip the Alchemy. It won’t really provide you any benefit while leveling. The best option would be having the Shaman DE quest rewards they don’t need and aren’t worth vendoring,
---
World chat is auto enabled in classic, won't have to stand around doing fuck all.
---
In my experience, large population isn't unplayable because of lag. It's unplayable because of the number of resource nodes is finite. You can double or triple the spawn rates and you'll still end up with absurd prices on the AH.
---
Druid in its 30/21 build can do pretty okay damage but realistically you are gonna have to respec on both to farm stuff good. At least until dire maul comes out and you can holy nova farm lashers.
---
It's not that obvious. Night watch concept is more common than you may think.
---
I'm 50/50 on going rogue or tanking as a warrior. If I do tank, I tanked in TBC and WOTLK so I won't be entirely new, but there will be a lot of learning involved still.
---
https://youtu.be/ClB5278A2xo
---
imagine having a life so boring you comment on a post about streamers
---
Depends on the raid and spec. Ret paladin mc and bwl is pretty awful, but once you get to AQ40 you can do average damage in a semi hardcore guild. I could pull an average of 400dps on all bosses, be top 15 on the meter and heal for huhuran. Ret paladins can have utility on battleguard satura as well for the stun. You also make the aoe trash alot easier to deal with due to consecration and oil of immolation with dragonbreath chilli. Obviously warriors are still better dps from a math standpoint but the person playing the class matters as well
---
I'll try and address the points as you listed them :)
---
1. Most likely HoTW spec yeah, and by grinding I mean I planned on running Leatherworking so I see a lot of monster killing in my future. I know for some classes (like paladin) their healing spec sort of gimps their kill time on monsters out in the world. I also have fears about getting ganked but that more stems from me being complete ass at pvp. 
---
2. I don't necessarily want to raid as any one thing, I just want to be an asset. I've been in some rotating raid rosters and honestly hated the whole "well you'd have a spot if you were x" situation. I like the druids playstyle but I'm worried I'll get shoehorned into healing and passed up for Priests and shamans on raid night, since good druid players have usually played them for many expansions.
---
3. I think at 60 I'd like to heal or tank, as I doubt I have the ability currently to pull top DPS in cat form. However I'd like to keep some of the variability the class has at 60 so I can go out and pvp, grind mobs for money, etc. 
---
I guess a huge part of my reservations about the class is that with all the Classic hype, the number crunchers have been very vocal about certain things not being viable. While I know that most of the stuff they're saying is total shit, it's out there and people subscribe to it. I would hate to run bear tank at 60 just for people to say "warrior only raid viable tank soz bud" until lots of content has already been cleared or is on farm. 
---
Really I think my problems are stemming from over-analyzing. There's a lot of hype going around, and discussions are all over about what class is good in what role. I've done a little bit of everything but never really sunk time into any one class (I played death-knight for 3 expansions I'm up the creek without a paddle for this version of the game) enough to say "thats my favorite". Druid has piqued my interest and I really appreciate your post it's obvious you know your stuff.

---
They did chat though, but that doesn't matter because harassment is not exclusive to chatting.
---
It's like when pubg was big and everyone was sniping streamers. Lots of people would say that people going out of their way (constantly requeueing) to target certain players could be considered harassment.
---
Fact of the matter is, it's up to interpretation, and intentionally so. It's the same for US law, and the reason we have courts in place. things are intentionally left vague so that more factors can be considered case-by-case.
---
Personally, I thought the GM / blizzards actions were appropriate. They didn't ban him; they moved his character because thousands of people felt that this person was intentionally ruining the game for them, and his intentions were obvious. That doesn't mean I'd like to see more GM intervention. I'd really hate for streamers to start saying everyone who follows them around is harassing them. I'd much rather see more mechanics in place that give people the freedom to avoid these situations, though, but I don't think you should get special treatment for broadcasting the game.
---
I just need SOMETHING Warcraft related (not BfA) to play in order to survive until Classic is released. I'm seriously going insane. I can't waiiiiittttttt.
---
I never played the original Warcraft 3 so it would be super cool to play through in preparation for Classic as well!!! Heres to hoping!!
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure he was just a toxic asshole, lol.
---
You can do it with a nade far more effectively and you can do it against caster/hunters because of the long range.
---
I feel the opposite! I make sure to revisit series in it's entirely every year or so. I'm not sure I'd be able to if I wasn't already so into it when it came out though, so you're probably right.
---
I personally will be slowing my leveling playstyle drastically (not just by maining a paladin). I plan to read quests and actually get to know the lore etc. I was just reading the lore of Sunken Temple and didn't realise [VANILLA SPOILER] it was us adventurers that were tricked into helping summon Hakkar in Zul'Gurub!
---
The quest where you give the Avatar of Hakkars egg thing to the quest giver in the Hinterlands and he flies away as a green serpent... My 10 year old brain didn't understand what was going on, we helped the Soulflayer become reborn.
---
Also I recommend reminding a and d as strafe rather than turn and using rmb to turn
---
That I don’t know. My gut says no, but if it does, even better for Skinning!
---
Think my first and second character have seen like 6 or 7 server transfers as I switched guilds over the years.
---
Farmed the Truefaith vestments pattern for weeks, never dropped. Finally dropped and everyone rolled need, of course they did, I lost it to a what appeared to be a guild run.  
---
I asked if I can have it, they all agreed I could and that was that.  The pattern sold for a hefty amount of gold and no way was I able to afford it.  Lucky I got it and made the BIS chest for that content patch.  I ended up joining that shit tier guild too, good times.
---
Nothing is wrong with that, except that weapons you get at that level are simply outshined by 2handers, especially since you're so near RFK/GR/WW weapon/SM.
---
You're gonna roll fury 2h until Maraudon, when you get Thrash Blade, a weapon you will stick with until something from MC or Ony drops.
---
Well he did organize this tournament and it went pretty good. Organizing such things is a lot of work behind the scenes and people don't even see it, so I'd say this definitely was something he did right. This isn't intented to bash on him, just some criticism for the hopeful next time he does it. I haven't personally watched his stream besides during the tournament, so I don't really have an opinion of him. ;)
---
Yes, they were. Different realms used different builds. Some were better  (more accurate) than Classic will be because they re-created older patches. Sorry you hate on pvt realms bud? lol
---
30/0/21 is not a meme spec
---
You think the likes of Questie will be available and accurate on day one?
---
Yeah it’s much more satisfying when you figure something out on your own, as opposed to reading a guide.
---
hell yeah bruther. I never tanked in vanilla bout to embark on the same journey. Confidence is key :)
---
i meannn considering its a 3% droprate ahaha
---
Naxx is not out of the question on 9 hours of raiding a week. Guilds that raid 2 days a week have full cleared all vanilla content.
---
TlDr; Tips and his father ran a construction contracting company that was shut down for fraud.
---
Worked on a 834,000  dollar job that was never finished.
---
No, that's wildcard type servers. On ascension you choose your abilities. Hence you get some crazy but awesome build combos.... honestly going back to being restricted to classic wow rules would be dull after that.
---
That reminds me, how did "bio breaks" become a thing anyway? Isn't biological break a lot more awkward to say than bathroom break? Or if bathroom is too long to type I'd default to poop break way before "bio break"
---
btw this should not be something that would be different between vanilla and classic. Can easily be tested and reported during stresstest.
---
WC3 is still one of the best games ever made. With frozen throne it will set up WoW perfectly.
---
I'd argue it makes it less skillful, being that batching is a handicap for people with slower reaction times or higher latency, and the person with faster reactions is not rewarded within a 200 millisecond window.
---
Because rogues are naturally bred to take every advantage of every situation.
---
That was in response to Horde asking for an equal to the Winterspring Frostsaber.  Took a long time and tbh wasn't as awesome as the Frostsaber imo.
---
they removed Stance Stuff from what I know.
---
If you've got 40 people who don't need rewards, you're still in a coma.
---
Forsaken have always been pretty dubious in their allegiance. Been trying to make (and later refine) their own Plague since the beginning.
---
From my TBC experience, warrior seems to have a certain threshold when you feel the jump in power. Not getting 1-shot easily and able to do proper damage makes it easier to contribute group PvP. In TBC, that point is when I get all arena pieces and Stormherald but I think that level of gear is not acquirable in vanilla without extreme grinding.
---
Originality in leveling? :LUL:
---
For raids it absolutely is.
---
Warrior tanks the best. Next best tank is Druid. Paladin last tank.
---
Paladins heal better than Druids. Priests are tied to Paladins or a little behind at times, but have more varied heals.
---
Warrior DPS is great. Feral a far second. Paladin is bottom rung. Shadow priests are really just buff bots for Warlock heavy groups.
---
None of what I said about is indicative of how fun a class is to play. That part is up to you to decide.
---
Happy to see the sentiment change, around the reveal I was eviscerated for saying this
---
Original idea or not, the WotLK cinematic inspired one of the episodes in GoT. One scene is literally a legit live action remake of Sindragosa's flying over the undead. Like same camera angle and everything.
---
That'd be my guess. Like for the EU you'd just pick the country that costs the least for your subscription rather than the country you live in.   
---
Not sure what a good answer for this would be

any sort of source?
---
A lot are in dude. Many of my guild I'm in for Classic got in exactly at 12pm PST, and look at Twitter feeds; a lot got in. Not seen ANYONE type they got in at 1pm PST or 2pm PST. The only hope you and I have is that the usual 6pm PST wave happens, but I don't think it will.
---
Haha so you just proved my point :D You wanted to run past him while he wanted to fight you. Maybe with no honor but nonetheless.
---
in the court writing it says they tesitified that the contract was INDEED false. stop this damage control
---
but beside that 9 hour, do you have to spend extra time to grind consumables? 9-hr / week is definitely doable indeed.
---
You can only open AQ with both factions? (And why alliance require more?)
---
That's what I used the stress test for. 
---
I had a few ideas before the stress test but I experimented with some name/class/race combos until I found 3 I really loved. Those 3 will be my main + Main Alt + backburner alt.
---
Even if I have no clue what this is it seems cool
---
Don't because you can't. That's the point. 
---
What is "viable"? As far as I can tell, the druid in that video could've been raiding as 0-0-0, the boss still would've died. 
---
Is that "viable?" Sure, I guess. Knock yourself out, try the 0-0-0 spec if you want.
---
That's why you put it on white weapons. You can reuse it for every alt.    
---
On my realm (YMMV) in classic it was 60g/Righteous Orb + about 15g/Large Brilliant Shard. Or about 180g/per + tip for Crusader. That's about four ~ six live strat runs per weapon (depending on Orb roll luck). If you're running it a ton for your 0.5 set pieces or Dawn rep (which I assume you are), it isn't a big extra investment, just stop selling your Righteous Orbs.   
---
+15 agility is quite expensive though. 250g or more. I didn't have two +15 Agility weapons for quite some time for that reason. But once you run out of things to spend gold on... Well...
---
Yeah, just give up. It's too hard.
---
What about sword main hand, and dagger off hand?
---
Honestly you might find raid spots as enh and boomkin, it's just harder. But y, aff lock will be nigh on impossible i think :/
---
Well me and He have the Same Guy :-)
---
The only Difference, He is on #1 while I am on #2
---
Man that was my first ever epic, and the feeling of reward is still something I remember 14 years later
---
Okay smartass lets hear your boomkin leveling philosophy?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/BoredNaivePieMingLee
---
And do you have the money to train it + the knife?
---
The best option is to not talk about it, thats exactly what their lawyers would have said. The time outs and bans are dumb however
---
I’ll need proof of this. The nature of 2FA makes it inherently more secure than not using 2FA. That’s like saying “I only trust doorknob locks and not deadbolts even though I can use both at the same time”.
---
This. Plus if the target has a high shadow resist, it can fully resist your spell (yellow resist), but resistance usually produces partial resists, as in lower dmg numbers.
---
And maybe Asperger Syndrome
---
Theres a youtubevideo from NotStaySafeTV with 2 parts. 
---
Im not gonna post Tips IRL name here, but it's in the video. Google it and you will see articles linking to his company.
---
Did this prevent classes from hoarding DKP by agreeing to bid minimally on items only they could use?
---
You have to wait more than a tank or a healer, but there is no Dungeon Finder so most likely you will spam the chats while doing quests. 
---
Searching for tanks/healers at your level and whispering them could also work I got random dungeon invites quite often when I was leveling as a Priest on a private server.
---
Oh, how I remember the pain of those days...I remember all too well...Getting camped for 1.5 hours in by the top Alliance warrior was my worst experience, before anyone had even hit 60 yet. Bullshit times...
---
If you can find a couple of hours in the other 4 days to make gold you'll be fine.   
---
This idea that rank 13/14 people are master race of vanilla wow is silly. People that join a half decent guild and clear the content once a week are the master race. You'll get way better gear that way from 6-9 hours/wk playing than the people that spend 60 hours a week in bgs.
---
Oh yeah? Is PPM working like that in Classic? (I've had my experience marred by lots of pvt realms with lots of different mechanics.)
---
Blizzard stopped trolling back in the day to... I remember cause I camped low lvl horde at cross roads for like 4 hours until a gm told me to stop or they would temp ban me.
---
Wait.  The whole community couldn't tell this guy was a scamming charlatan from the beginning?
---
&gt;1. Yes it will be available the first Sunday after launch. The time will depend on what region your server is in.
---
What makes you so sure it'll be in week 1?
---
Hamstring mobs and kite while waiting for swingtimer.
---
Well to be honest tanking low lvl is super easy anyway... because you've got limited abilities and even more limited resources to use them.
---
The hardest skill to get down is ensuring you "save rage" up for the next mob group.
---
a reference to a twitch emote.
---
Love that name
---
Yes, the AQ War Efforts require massive amounts of materials from all professions from both factions before the gong can be hit. And in the case of Leather, the Alliance require more in numbers because the Leather they’re supplying is of lower quality and value.
---
Vendor, no ones going to buy greys on the AH.
---
Skarm Tank has some great videos on druids.  Goes with the 0/30/21 build, which lets him tank and heal depending on current needs for the fight.  There's also Shedothedruid with good vids on youtube if you're more interesting in a feral DPS/tank flex build (14/32/5 and some slight variations on it).
---
Some of the info may not translate from private to classic though, but the versatility of druids seems undervalued back in the day.  While things like farming Manual Crowd Pummelers might not be as common on classic (on private, rares spawn in dungeons all the time, rather than much more rarely in real vanilla IIRC), other things, like using Wolfshead Helm to powershift for instant 80 energy (paired with furor, and you powershift right before an energy tick procs), seems more like something that could stick around (so you swipe swipe, powershift, swipe swipe).
---
0/30/21 seems most meta atm.  You don't have to be a healbot if you dont want to, even in raids.  Just remember to use Innervate, combat rezz, dispel whatever, etc.  You're a very good 5 man tank (especially vs 3 targets) and viable as offtank in raids most of the time.
---
No transmog. 
---
I will actually be able to tell who is badass in the world and in bgs.
---
Additive in both cases. Pushback protection is good for Paladins, but I never took the talents on my Druid or Shaman.
---
STREAMER BAD 😠
---
I hope they move in a new direction. Look back, flying and the complete separation of pvp and pve gear ruined so much of my enjoyment.
---
spell batching existed in Vanilla (at least in part) because internet connections had much higher pings than nowadays and to not further advantage players with a good ping (around 80 ms back in the day). You could have a higher ping and still have a chance against someone with a lower ping.
---
So yes, its kind of an artificial lag with todays internet connections and 20ms pings.
---
That's a great point I didn't think about nades on a shaman. Though my primary plan was to go herb/alch on shaman
---
I see it more like this, I run past them unless they engage me first, then I fight back. But 90% of the time they never engage up front, sneak tactics is ez kill. I don't know why I'm still surprised sometimes when it happens. It's just so gutless and low, I usually don't wanna be like that.
---
Thanks for the answer homie.
---
prob means dot &amp; kite
---
3-4 times a week casual? Are you trolling or retarded?
---
I really hope blizz considers adding guild banks. It would be a welcome addition IMO.
---
 the MC and ZG weapons do not compare well to the R14 weapons.  
---
The R14 weapons are pretty much better than anything until Dark Edge of Insanity and then Naxx weapons.
---
The R14 weapons are even slightly better than Ashkandi which drops off of nef.
---
Things like Zin'rohk and OEB don't really hold a candle to HWL weapons.  You may as well go with TUF at that point.
---
How do you know you're on the same list as OP? OP has claimed multiple times he's the only person on that list.
---
I'm not the one giving wrong dueling tips. You tried.
---
If you are proactive you can get groups very fast and easily. If your just waiting ya it will take time.
---
**Balance Druid Levelling Guide**  
---
You cast spells until mobs are dead. When you run out of mana you drink.
---
In any game where there's an end game, there's always going to be a point where a player is "done" with the content. 
---
I think rather than trying to keep pushing back the finish line further &amp; further (the way WoW's expansions have done), it might just make more sense to gradually add new items, a fourth talent tree, new classes/races, new profs, etc which let people play the game in new ways but under the same cap. Additional levelling quests &amp; dungeons also allow for levelling alts to remain fresh. 
---
On top of that, having the durations of the initial release &amp; "expansions" be within much narrower windows also limits how quickly players can get through the top tier raids, as they have less time to level before they open, &amp; less time to progress through them when they do. There will always be top tier players who will be there ready for Naxx as soon as its out and players who clear Sunwell within the first lockout, but that's never going to be *everyone*. 
---
Part of the draw of other raids would be that certain ones would drop gear which facilitates underporming specs like prot, ret, moonkin, etc. Also, people still return to old content *today* to try to get some of the rare mounts, so that variety of carrot will always appeal to certain players. 
---
Then there's always the fact that getting *all* the gear you want isn't as easy as just clearing the raid each lockout. The drop RNG combined with the handful of drops within a 40-person environment means some items just aren't guaranteed. Some folks will beat the raid and then feel like they're done with it. Other players just want to collect that whole set etc. And if every class had 9, 10, 11+ available sets to potentially aquire (particularly if they facilitate different gamplay styles), within multiple raids, some of which aren't even guaranteed to be open for the whole year, I think that'd help to keep a decent number of players around.
---
And ultimately, it's *ok* if players feel like they're done &amp; stop playing. If the game's decent enough, there will always be *some* players ariving for the first time, and there's always the possibility that the introduction of new features could cause past players to return.

---
While I agree with the sentiment that you can get good gear out of raiding, raid gear doesn't surpass R14 gear until late AQ and Naxx.
---
You want attention, I try to give you what you want and then you back down. Typical lol!
---
well i got it to work with : 
---
 /run local \_, \_, active = GetShapeshiftFormInfo(1) if not active or IsControlKeyDown() then CastShapeshiftForm(1) else CastSpellByName"Feral Charge" end 
---
but the thing is, if i click it with my mouse it works, if i use a keybind it doesn't. wtf?
---
It’s hard to find every role for a group. All members have to be on the same stages of dungeon quests. Everyone has to be prepared to spend 2 hours in the dungeon. So it’s not about finding 3 dps, it’s about finding 3 amigos to help you through the dungeon
---
Thanks! :)
---
My question with the MCP is if it will appear every time you make an Gnomer instance in classic.  Like, I don't think Crowd Pummeler 9-60 is a boss right?  But rather a rare spawn, and rare dungeon spawns were only sometimes things right?
---
MCP farming is the main thing that'd has me hesitant about drood.
---
yea having "choices" of casting the same spell because terrible design choices
---
Let me guess, you play Alliance.
---
:-)
---
Look at this nerd and his science!
---
They already did the top 3 F&amp;F your buddy must of had you lower. U/anonbb21
---
You can harass people without saying anything.
---
It opens up counter interactions that are simply not in retail anymore.
---
Asmon's reaction was the reaction of a self righteous .... fill blank. You are reading too much into it.
---
You can be prett effective with a mix of Rank 10 blue PvP set, and the epics from WSG/AB/AV reps.  TUF is really good for how easy it is to get and should do enough to enable warrior in PvP.
---
But if you want better than that you'll have to raid in BWL or higher.
---
Improved Concentration Aura says in the talent tool tip, "additional 5%. So it would be the 35-50 one.
---
I believe the talents and the aura are also additive, so maxing the 5/5 and 3/3 may be overkill.
---
Yes, and getting rank 14 during BWL phase you'll have to be one of the top 3 poop sock'ers on the server. Then when AQ comes out the raider has better gear from raid logging 3 nights as week.  
---
Who's the real winner?
---
A lot can be lost in text. I’m just stating my thoughts here. 
---
Not going to lie and say I don’t want the weapon but coming from a progression stand point wouldn’t it make sense to gear your MT first? I’m at least being up front about it. Would be one thing to try and drop a loot system idea like this on raid day. 
---
Would it be better if I was maining a priest and still gave prio to our MT? Because I would still do that. 
---
I raided as a holy paladin through all of Vanilla. Having a geared MT mattered for progression. I’ve tanked since BC. I am going to Tank for our guild. I can see the worry people would have. But if one of our core players is our MT we don’t have to worry about poachers. It just happens that I am also going to be leading raids because I’ve been leading raids off and on since Classic. 
---
I totally get that people have been burned by that kind of thing. Honestly feel like if we are up front about it in recruitment. It shouldn’t be a big deal. If it affects recruiting to the point were we can’t field players we can always look at a different system. But avoiding having to regear our MT matters. We never saw a boss die in Naxx because of it.  Granted we will have more time this time around but still.
---
Play well, be pleasant &amp; make new friends. Easiest way to get invites
---
I hear that boars are a good option as well.
---
I played vanilla and never read the quest text unless I was lost on where to go or what to do for that quest, but most of them are obvious. For me leveling efficiently and quickly is more fun than reading quests (most of which are just filler and not interesting).
---
That's a lot of money for no work done.
---
I mean you straight up got a clever, conniving gnome byvthe ominous name of Tyrion in Stormwind.
---
There are quite a few ASOIAF references.
---
It's the old World of Warcraft board game
---
Your leaving out the 2 hours looking for a tank/ healer and the Druid was one of those roles. We stayed cause fuck all that effort to visit that hell hike of a dungeo.
---
&gt; Care to expand on this, do you actually have any definitive proof of this at all?
---
The raid group that jumped the in game funeral for a RL death? One of the most known Vanilla WoW events? Probably the most known outside of Leeroy, which was a skit.
---
&gt; As for not having anything against streamers, just stop...you bitch about them in every post you make. As hilarious as that is, it's also a bit pathetic.
---
Only the ones pulling shit like this. Or the one that called me a cheater when I was cheating and tweeting Blizz about it. I've never said anything against Asmon or Esfand or any of the others. It's 2 people. Lol. You defending them is pathetic. 
---
&gt; Streamers are showcasing their game to the world, why in the world would they NOT want to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible and get rid of the complete morons (Like that troll) who try to ruin it? It's common sense.
---
Because that's how the game will be in live. 
---
&gt; I'll just repeat this; If your idea of fun is ruining another persons game experience, stop playing games.
---
And I'll say this, if you think one guy jumping around is ruining your experience, stop playing games. 
---
&gt; do not feel bad one bit if that person gets banned/suspended/moved, grow the fuck up or move on. Why in the world would Blizzard want people like this pushing real gamers away from their game?
---
Please define 'real gamers'. Please tell me why the streamers who were breaking the ToS in 2 different ways were perfectly fine, but this one guy was in the wrong.
---
That's why I'm linking it. It's where the classic wow+ fans *should* go to discuss classic wow+ things.
---
Oh god is soda one of those streamers/youtubers peddling that “sjw political correctness cultural Marxism” crap that borrows from literal Nazi propaganda and about 70 years of the worst reactionary politics. If this people don’t see the parallels between them and the people like Pat Buchanan (who coined the cultural Marxism meme) 30 years ago calling it “political correctness” because they couldn’t out right discriminate against minorities and gay people I feel sad for the future.
---
I’m also sad that this toxic far right reactionary garbage will probably poison the WoW community. Maybe we can all agree to ignore shitty polygon and kotaku articles while leaving /pol/ reactionary crap at the login screen? 
---
One can dream I suppose.
---
I don't think it's incredibly hard, but you have to be proactive. Build a friends list and be prepared to whisper people. Just spamming general chat, or even guild chat, is often not sufficient. The thing is, there are plenty of SLOTS for dps in dungeons, and a lot of tanks/healers strongly prefer clothies in their dungeon groups simply because they are often not rolling need on the same drops (particularly for non priest healers). As a warlock, a warrior tank is likely to be far more interested in you as a cloth dps, than say, a warrior dps or even in a lot of cases, a rogue, and for healers, it can be even more noticeable. 
---
But you have to make sure that you get into those first 3 slots, which fill up fast.... and the easiest way to do that is by doing the organizing. If you are diligent and build up a decent friends list, you shouldn't have a ton of trouble doing the super popular instances. A lot of players are willing to run an instance but not willing to spam trade chat to make it happen, or will run an instance an extra time than they would have otherwise, if you just message them.
---
I won't say I have found it super easy to find groups as dps for all the dungeons though, because a lot of them, experienced players just don't seem to want to do at all. Which is useful for weeding your friends list of people who are super tryhard and not really interested in doing group activities, but it does mean it's a LOT easier to find a blackfathom deeps group than a gnomeregan group. 
---
Also, to be clear, you have to be decent to group with. You are relying on repeat custom, so any drama or bullshit or rolling need on wierd stuff, or trying to reserve items after already assembling half the group, is going to get you on ignore lists, if the tanks are anything like me on private servers.
---
Legendarys on a DKP system is asking for a drama. I can see when other have said the council should be a larger pool of players sure.
---
Post an update later, but I'm very sure the wave is done. You're either lying for some reason or we'll see.
---
lol it's a cold hard truth that the kid didn't actually want the game? sweet
---
Right, but all human interaction is greed-based.
---
As albinosmurfs said, make the group yourself and you don’t have to wait ;)
---
I take it your an undead shaman riding your level 10 racial mount gifted by Thrall?
---
For the Horde! Alliance scum deserve it. /s
---
But seriously my experience is the opposite. Horde have always been well mannered. It's the alliance that's full of 12 year olds that think they're so amazing that they're 40 levels higher than me and can 1 shot me.... A huge reason I will never play Alliance is the culture of Alliance players and how childish the alliance races even look by themselves. 
---
For the Horde.
---
Just don't roll on the same server as them...
---
You just stopped to their level in a matter of a few sentences.
---
There's not that many big wow streamers, just don't roll on their server
---
Good for you, I can't freaking decide!

Guess it was overlooked, no biggie.
---
Nah, they will roll pvp servers 100%, they're excited to.
---
It won't matter that people hunt them because they have fans orbiting them constantly to defend them. Watch some big streamers playing the beta.
---
Uhhhh bonereavers edge???
---
I'm curious what you mean by wall jumping? Like doing g the graveyard jumps and tunnel jumps? Because I spoke to GMs dozens of times from vanilla through wotlk about the jumps in WSG and it was made clear to us that the jumps we're fine as long as you weren't going out of bounds, going places where you couldn't be hit, or doing things like holding the flag hostage on the big stump. All of the other jumps were not considered exploits.

Introduction: Never experienced Vanilla? Feel intimidated by people who have been playing on private servers for years? Join the club. &lt;Ram Ranch&gt; welcomes anyone from the 14-hour-a-day-no-lifer to the person going into Classic WoW for the first time blind. We want to foster an environment similar to that which was experienced in Vanilla WoW 15 years ago. That is, one where most people didn’t know what they were doing but sought a community through which they could figure it out together. We aren’t Vanilla experts, which is what will make the experience of figuring our way to the top as a group that much more exciting. 
---
Look forward to grouping up with guildies on launch ready to quest and do dungeons, calling in the boys in the event of world PvP outbursts, stumbling our way through progression, and making our presence known on the server. Imagine how the Alliance will feel after being teabagged by someone from &lt;Ram Ranch&gt; lmao. 
---
Whether you’ve played modern WoW or Vanilla before, or have never touched the game in your life, get in here and let’s get shit done.

Can you give some examples of players that do that? I only know of monkey news who was confirmed scarab lord on retail vanilla. 
---
Also which private server players were the ones that fell short? I’d love if you could be a little more specific :)

LMAO @ not taking a healer with you to kill a Snake.
---
Loot Council doesn't do anything specific. It's a free for all based on how corrupt your officers are.

40+ member core, with full vanilla content experience, is reforming for Classic WoW.  We have always prided ourselves at putting comradery as our highest priority. The core of Pretty Good has found that we value playing together and growing as a group more than any other element of this game. Make no mistake, clearing multiple raids in a single night and killing Kel’Thuzad are the immediate goals of this group. Where we differ is how we choose to pursue this objective.  Roster spots will be competitive, and expectations will be high.  Memes are highly encouraged, but toxicity is not welcome.

\-Problazer
---
BWL is my aim for classic. It's a shame I didn't experience it during vanilla due to extremely high ping (400-500ms) because none of us were in US.  This is going to be my first WoW experience with &lt; 100 ms :)
---
whats your guilds name?
---
Well, loot council of players that are more concerned with progressing through content than they are with their individual gear can easily look past issues like the ones we are discussing.   
---
Sure you could accuse the loot council of being greedy, but that is why it is composed of a group of people and unlikely to keep members if loot council is truly corrupt.
---
In the video being spread, Tips IRL name is in it. Googling the name links to an article with him testifying in court. Also Google images reveals young pics of him.
---
I want to believe thos was TrollgodX lol
---
Still, you would rather not engage. He would.
---
I will admit, so long as you are 100% up front about things, then the odds of things going down the crapper get a lot lower.
---
I personally have no problem with someone starting the guild with the goal of getting something like a legendary, so long as it is a known thing.  
---
Either way, no matter how you handle it, you are still going to be a casual raiding guild that is using some form of loot priority, and I still think it has a good chance of burning people.
---
Just find out their server and don't roll there, so they all have to writhe in their own feces, but we don't.
---
Trust me, a lot of people are going to try and avoid streamer servers
---
What a lunatic. Let us know what server you’re gonna roll on so we can avoid it.
---
All of that sounds like your own insecurities and not something that will ever happen. Tbh you sound more familiar with those people than you pretend.
---
Why would I want to resto?
---
This is literal gibberish.  The only thing you need to recover is your sanity you fuckin weirdo.  Why would you flex having all this stuff from vanilla when you didn’t even start till mop
---
If you're on a streamer server, then sure sometimes there will be a random mob doing random things. But thats about as far as the concern goes.
---
Accepting a position as Hunter class lead. So much drama.
---
This made me laugh
---
people who pvp with twinks are just unsuccessful pvping with their mains. change my mind
---
Is this from the beta? If so, report it
---
You are absolutely correct, but based on recent events a lvl 1 Tauren can piss off half of the streaming community and their mouthbreathing fanbase.
---
BM is also the best pvp spec at lower levels.
---
Shit post
---
Just look at all the sensitive neckbeards pitchforking against trollgodx to get him banned. All he was doing was using wasd and spacebar. Not harrassment at all. It's a community of whiny carebears now (because they are the loudest).
---
One of the most popular resto speccs goes very deep into balance for reduced mana cost on healing touch, and another crit talent, though they're prolly mostly healing in raids, u still get + dmg and crit dmg to wrath, starfire, etc. maybe that's something? :)
---
Its not even the ms. Its something to do with range leeway on melee.

Except people in this comment chain are claiming that OP is wrong because of private server bias. They now should provide evidence for that claim. None of these clowns have any idea what they are talking about and twist the meaning of "burden of proof" to move any responsibility off themselves because they know they have no proof for their counter argument. It's pathetic.
---
Nope. Nope nope nope. It isn't.
---
They fucked themselves, they painter themselves into that corner and as far as I'm concerned, there's no going back.
---
Personally, having played tens of thousands of hours of retail since vanilla, and having put countless hours into private vanilla servers, I'm perfectly fine with never flying ever again...In Classic.  In BfA, etc, it infuriates me to no end not being able to fly once I hit cap.  I don't even care if it's not account wide, I just want all my max level characters to be able to fly over the dull, uninspired content that doesn't interest me.  Everything relevant to the majority of players interests is instanced anyhow, be it PvE or PvP.
---
Well. I dont but. Yeah. I Just gonna throw a angry Mail to my other Guy now. I am super super angry.
---
laughs in european :)
---
Not sure if it's still true but Proudmoore was an lgbtq friendly server. Maybe another will be designated by the community before release?
---
Yep I think it's called Faldir's cove or something.  You have to swim into all those sunken ships filled with nagas.  It's a huge pain w/o underwater breathing.  Also the quests off the Northwestern coast of Desolace.
---
You said you wanted to level as balance, raiding as balance is a different story.
---
Yeah I sure would have loved to see a movie about the Legion expansion that was about to come out at the time. I'm sure they were smart enough to have made the movie about that, if it ever did get done being made
---
Scarab Lord is so many miles beyond Rank 11, which is very doable. But yeah if you go for it gl man
---
Ahaha damn beat me to it
---
Orc has big shoulders and big brain.
---
&gt; because thousands of people felt that this person was intentionally ruining the game for them, and his intentions were obvious.
---
So, might makes right? Fuck the minority? He was having fun, and it wasn't actually affecting anyone, the streamers were just salty they were losing duels and targeted him as the cause.
---
**Just like Soda got mad and started camping a guy in 1kn the other night for no other reason than he was in a bad mood. He was literally targeting one single person and some would consider that 'targeted harassment', but did anything get done to Soda? No. It's pure hypocrisy, no matter how you look at it.**
---
&gt; but I don't think you should get special treatment for broadcasting the game.
---
But they do. I understand giving them beta keys to get word out, makes perfect sense. But interfering with the game just because they are whining about losing is way beyond the point of acceptable GM/Dev intervention.
---
They Just told us top 3. But I am not in. And I even got asked if I want Join on friday. This is so odd. Not sure if 6 PM is another Chance. But I am Really upset right now.
---
You're totally ignoring the fact that DKP creates an entire metagame within itself. Playing WoW becomes about maximizing DKP, weighing what the most value items are to purchase, tracking other peoples' DKP, and colluding with other raiders to maximize gains.
---
And then if your guild tries to "balance" all of this it gets even more complicated with bidding systems, priority systems, etc.
---
In a loot council, the items are distributed in a way that best benefits the guild. That's simplicity. On to the next boss. No waiting around comparing spreadsheets. 
---
You really shouldn't ever *have* to have a discussion about why decisions are made, the only point I was making is if you're insecure about it generally in my experience officers are open about discussing it.
---
Warriors were never good to begin with. Paladins do 4x as much threats as Warriors and 10x as much threats as Druid. Cant wait to get my wraith blade
---
&gt; Getting invited to my first guild, only because I rolled a female belf and I think the guy was hoping to chat me up.
---
Good times. I rolled a belf paladin in a spare evening once. Got to Org and was immediately invited to a guild. The two guys in the guild immediately start chatting me up so I asked if my alt could join too. They said yes so I switched to my undead mage alt.
---
"WTF?!? Are you a guy?"
---
"Well, yes"
---
*Xxxxxx has kicked you out of the guild.*
---
LMAO.
---
Yeah, being present in the world is a great way to put it. I found myself going through forums looking for guilds a couple of days ago. I seen a comment someone put that made me rethink my approach to Classic. I'm just going to create a horde character on a random server and that is it. I don't want to read the server forums or apply to any guilds. Hopefully I can just bump into some people that seem like good fun and maybe get a guild invite from them. If I don't, then I don't. I don't want to recreate memories, just hopefully make some new ones.
---
Even better. So a guild of 40+ dick bags or some streamer can a whine about someone who killed them and get someone insta banned as a troll.
---
Thank you for reminding me
---
It was a PVP server.  I think he did it to everybody at first, then got a warning from a GM, and afterwards only griefed alliance.
---
I'm just thankful that he wasn't around when I did my Benediction/Anathema event....
---
mine has been getting nonstop whispers to tank rfc wc bfd
---
Because they were the one pvp flagged? If a lvl 1 human would jump around griefing the horde wouldve just killed him since hes ally in tirisfal glades
---
Are you going to repost this again?
---
I won’t be upset because blocking mailboxes is a bannable offense.
---
How do you deal with loot in pug?
---
It's all dependant on if you get the Head of the Broodlord Lashlayer, if you're the one to get it then your guild will most likely support you through it. Basically 1 in 40 chance to be a Scarab Lord :/
---
People are very toxic if you state an unpopular opinion, or if you say you like retail WoW.  God forbid you feel modern WoW is better than vanilla WoW.   
---
Seeing the place over the last year it looks a lot more toxic than friendly.
---
They were jumping 'out of the map' and getting 'underneath' Tristfall. They've also said they were going to make sure anything like that was impossible in Classic, which indicates they didn't want it done, even if it wasn't affecting others.
---
see this is the kind of info I'm looking for! Thank you. I know I wont be the first guy picked for a raid, just dont want to be a complete waste of space.  I'll look into this hybrid more. Honestly I dont even want to raid the first couple of months I hit max, just want to be able to raid at some point after all the min/max players have cleared all the content for months.
---
Warrior can't beat a mage in pvp no matter what gear they have.
---
Beat a High Warlord warrior with a 2050 hp frost mage in green gear and no stamina, without losing any hp.
---
They are extremely easy to kite.
---
Great with a healer though. If you have a healer on you then you need much less gear than you do without one. For most fights it is probably enough to use The Unstoppable Force from AV if you have a healer.
---
Yeah I can’t believe that there’s more to him than this 4 minute video. 
---
That’s just..... people aren’t that complex
---
\#nochanges -&gt; #maybeacoubleofchanges -&gt; #reeeee
---
If layering/sharding is in the game, it's not the game you remember at its core.
---
It was some girl YouTuber. I'm way too drunk atm to find sources.
---
80 comments and 0 upvotes, that’s some sort of record right?! haha
---
I bet.. so much easier to get more HK when you can't be killed =P
---
I wish healers recognized it more in BGs, I've got almost 5k life and jumping around controlling the fight but just die to DOTs far too often
---
It's all greed. Wanting progression is greed too. The world exists only because of selfishness, and people who like to pretend it doesn't always run things into the ground sooner or later. So many guilds died because the GM or Officer went "It's not about the individual, it's about the guild" ... But a guild is just a bunch of individuals. 
---
Everyone's gor something that they want, design your guild so they can get it, and everything works, and you progress faster than some corrupt loot council consisting of the GM's girlfriend and his highschool friends.
---
Yet here you are on reddit with an anon name, no one knows who you are. You're advocating for something South Korea has with social identity tied to all your game accounts. Maybe you don't think it's much right now, maybe you'll advocate for a chinese style social credits system too in future.
---
It will be slow and tedious. Oomkin get the name for a reason.  
---
So expect to spend a ton of money on water and to abandon all the versatility and speed that druids are famous for while leveling.
---
Be a good group leader and they will come.
---
gonna be hilarious when you and your entire guild get banned for harassment. blizzard have banned people for obsessive camping in the past even when its not a streamer. corpse camping someone anytime they log in with the intent of keeping them from playing the game will get you banned in a heartbeat lol. easiest way to deal with it is to just play on a different server rather then showing how much of a lunatic you are by saying youre going to play the game just to camp someone else, youre just as bad as the people that follow them around and spam the chat lol
---
Right. Like Soda was doing by camping an alliance the other night in 1KN just because he was in a bad mood and said stuff like "I'm just playing the game, what if there is an ore node that I want nearby?" to 'justify' him camping another player. Did anything happen with that? Was Soda teleported away? No.
---
I'm allowed to be salty about the existence of these people.
---
Haha, glad it wasn't just me! I was lucky there were already a couple of women in the guild so I don't think they could kick me.
---
Why would you ever dw tank? Just results in bosses parrying more which increases the damage they do....
---
I still drop that in every bg
---
You could have fit another literal in there somewhere

---
No. Easy question
---
&gt;	But: You know, I know and everyone else knows that crafted item xyz is comming and that you need material a, b and c to make it. So: do you sell those items today, or do you wait a month until the new content patch arrives? In anticipation of the new content release, people will start stacking up on the items, thus bringing the prices up.
---
This is the part that’s going to be interesting. Nobody is going to know how many raw materials are being hoarded away. What happens when they completely flood the market and selling Essence of Life pre-patch to the speculators actually made more money than post-patch?
---
Haha fuck the Horde
---
Blizzard... I once thought we were friends... Neigh! Even... Family...    But alas... Silence is what you bring me...
---
It's going to be hard to sync your quests together as 4, but if all of you guys are committed and are able to do it then do it! Nothing better then questing with 3 of your friends while in a voip. I just think it'll be hard, there will always be that one friend levels ahead of the group while the group is offline.
---
BM
---
So again acting like I could care less about the sword is false but insinuating I am forming a guild with that sole purpose I think is jumping to conclusions. You will want your MT to have a TF by Cthune. If people don’t like it they don’t have to raid with us. 
---
But yeah I plan on being very upfront about our gearing from day one. Yes other tanks will have to wait to bid till drop 2 but that’s it. I don’t feel like that is to much to ask to ensure that on raid days we have the best geared MT we could have. 
---
None of this is set in stone and we will find what works best for us as a guild.
---
 I can't help but feel like threat generation is going to be a real handicap for this. You can (probably) get yourself tanky enough for it, but if your DPS is constantly pulling off or having to bottleneck themselves to not overtake you'll be in for a rough ride.   
---
Hope I see you with a progress update when things go live, I'd really like to know if you figured out a way to make it work or not.
---
If only streamers could be confined to just one server, though.  
---
I doubt Classic is going to have even 1/10th the number of servers there were back in the day. Not even close as many as there are now.
---
Beta invites are done im pretty sure
---
This could be the dumbest reply in reddit history. I'm not asking for the dudes address to be published just his character. It's not even in the same stratosphere but, why would you be able to connect those dots.
---
Well all the pirate servers are based on false data so no specific servers. It's all of them. And a lot of pservers claim things like "blizz like" essentially trying to sell themselves as the closest to classic. Which is kinda fine if you don't think of the broader implications.
---
The first sign of trouble was pserver players reporting a ton of bugs that were just classic mechanics. Its evidence that some people actually believed they were playing on a classic server. You add to the fact that players who had never played during classic were competing for warlord or server first raid kills believing they were classic servers. You can see the problem and how that will be interesting to watch. 
---
Also no idea who monkey is.
---
You'ren not even gonna see top 10 damage meters after BWL as a hunter.
---
Streamers exist and will continue to exist. Everyone here should get the fuck over it and enjoy the game on your terms.
---
Yeah I saw that referenced this weekend but can't find what it's from, can you help me out?
---
Different kind of skill, I guess.
---
Just curious, avoiding streamer servers is also an option no?
---
Isnt there a disease in the plague lands that causes spreads to nearby players and deals hefty damage per tick? Get it from some ooze creature? I can hardly remember because I was very young back then, but I would summon a void walker, have him contract the disease and then dismiss him. Summon him again in a newbie zone and watch the newbies die to disease because the disease would essentially pause while the VW was dismissed.
---
Wasnt in the beta but would hope this still worked this time around.
---
They've only done one F&amp;F wave before this one which was a week or so ago. There were no public invites with that wave.
---
It's just a bit suboptimal. 
---
You will level faster than fast Solos, but you will never be looking for people to help with elite quests and dungeons should be super easy.
---
Plus it's way more fun to level with friends.
---
You will be fine.  My crew has run as a four man group since Vanilla with no issues.  We levelled up through instances a few times.  Once we went as Project Paladin; 4 paladins - 1 tank, 1 heals, 2 ret.  we destroyed instances and also had a blast in PvP.   This time we are going Horde.
---
You're going to get a lot of pushback from the toxic group, because it's impossible to like anything other than classic, and if you do you're a "shill" or a "bad player" and if you mention anything you can just "go on back to retail"
---
Sheep mentality is pretty strong here, which isn't bad, because we should respect all opinions for what they are, even if it's not their own.
---
It took 3 friends and me almost a year to hit 60 in a group of four: Warrior, Paladin, Hunter and Priest. We had a lot of fun and didn't hassle about the leveling speed. Of course we still had alts around which were levelled faster. Some quests sucked (gather 30 times X) some were brilliant (no problem getting elite quests done) and in the end we four manned the all dungeons outside of raids. 
---
But we had situations you probably don't have to work around, so you will level way faster: i'd say have fun and see where it goes. If you want a bit of flair: on [https://dwarftasticfour.com](https://dwarftasticfour.com) I have posted a short preview of our 1-60 adventure I made back in 2005/2006.
---
For your group, I'd say take a hunter: Keep the gear split as much as possible (so almost everything has a use for your group) and get proper tradeskills. We had a lot of fun as herb/alch skinner/lw mining/bs and ench/tailoring, it proved to be really effective. Looking back our biggest weaknesses was taking the pally as second dps, and we should have taken a rogue (mage would be best with always-ready cc, but we were Dwarves) instead.
---
But I must stress: Have fun and good luck!
---
OK? And I was in a US top 25 guild because I enjoy killing dragons, idgaf about gear. That said, we're talking about loot, specifically DKP here, which you so aptly pointed out.

I'd interpret it that way as well, but I appreciate the clarification. Some tooltips are less than straightforward (\*cough* anger management), and I wouldn't have put any money down on it
---
Is this still being updated?
---
I liked "Plausible Deniability" back in the day when we were progressing in TOC and ICC in WOTLK. IDK if I wanna use that name or not, I'm stuck between that and "Twitch Reflex".
---
Well no, you don’t have to, but by virtue of playing through the game up to 60 you do learn.  If they just power level, they won’t learn, but yea, nobody is forcing them to
---
Give healthstones to tanks, soul stone the healer and hopefully they add you as a friend. You can also summon so that's a plus.
---
Google hunter leveling for classic/vanilla. Information is out there, why not research yourself?
---
Griefing has always been bannable. Has absolutely nothing to do with streamers. Are you actually this retarded?
---
You can but forming a guild to corpse camp them all the time is literally as toxic and immature as what their followers do lol
---
The same shit will happen on PvE servers tho, minus the killing lowbies part
---
Then you lose the benefit of extra offhand attacks from sword spec procs. Not as ideal as an offhand sword, though a good dagger can beat a shitty sword in the offhand.
---
Wc3 is sick. Can’t wait for reforged.
---
Swifty?
---
Wiping 120 times for weeks straight on twin emps isn't "nothing".
---
Karma fishing, yea, same reason you see a lot of "oh I just got back X character that I played in Y, wow remember the days???"
---
What's worse is when it's not their character or just made on a pserver, and they are literally posting it just for karma, because it matters to a lot of people.
---
So you don't want to follow everyone's advice but you also need advice on how to do that?
---
Thanks for taking the time to read the whole 2 paragraphs before replying.
---
there is a lot of ways to avoid it, like playing on a pve server.
---
I believe it was a common practice on private servers as the parry chance was something like 5.6% and not 14%. So when a raid is on farm, and damage mitigation isn't a limiting factor, threat is more a limiting factor... And so duelwield tank allows for generating higher levels of threat so DPS can do more dpsing. 
---
They would still need to switch to sword and shield at certain times, it was an art I believe.
---
Take tailoring and enchanting as warrior. Sounds stupid and the opposite of what you want, but you will get mad cloth doing dungeons, or just go farm it if you're dps and not a tank. Tank dungeons to get blue gear and level, enchant your own gear, and if you want blacksmithing at max level, simply drop tailoring for mining, look up a profession guide to see exactly how much of each material to farm, farm all your materials for leveling blacksmithing, drop mining for it, level it, get your gear and enchant it. Boom, raid ready with not that much extra work, still less extra work than leveling an alt for enchanting, and quicker if tanking. Just what I tend to do on warriors or paladins.
---
Yea kudose to him for that fosho.
---
I think his point is that he’s concerned that the consideration here was protecting the free marketing the streamers provided by protecting the streamer organized event. Something the players could have dealt with by having the opposite faction in discord to police troublemakers.
---
There were funerals and weddings in WoW. Tons of player driven activities. I don’t remember GM’s ever policing griefers for these events. So it seems a little extreme. On the other hand they helped preserve a cool event for which we’ll always have footage. Maybe one that will get repeated on live. With GM participation we could do some cool in game stuff that will be memorable to thousands. If that means spoiling the fun of a few griefers, should we care?
---
I mean the fact is servers will have popular or famous members who can drive large activities. It’s likely being a streamer will simply make you popular. It’s s change to community organizing and activity from vanilla but it’s fundamentally the same principal.
---
More importantly streaming drives game sales. It’s a valuable marketing commodity. If the GM’s start acting to placate streamers I could see that being a large concern. I don’t expect blizzard to care more about my money than anyone else’s when it comes to cultivating the community, trust me they don’t care if you threaten to pull your sub over a ban. But there’s something gross about a streamers getting special attention and priority beta access. So I think OP is right to ask if this was the right move.
---
cute
---
Blizzard basically removed every human interaction in the game aside from pvp/raiding in the name of convenience. In the meantime, they also took away all the flavour and made all the classes bland.
---
Was questing for Bear form a hassle? Yes, but you also feel like you earned your bear form. 
---
Are tough enemies a hassle? Yes, but you also get to group with people and take on challenges.
---
Was Windfury inconsistent and just a +damage? Yes, but you get so much joy when you Windfury twice in a row.
---
it ain't that bad lol
---
Oh goodness. You are in for a special treat!  I agree the newer versions feel dead and there is nothing to do. The 2 eras that I played the most in were Vanilla and Wrath. Super excited to go back!
---
Okay, that's it... i'm gonna break down and get that swing timer mod already.
---
Damn guess that’s how he gets his kicks
---
wut class shud i play ???
---
You're going to be in for a treat, my friend.
---
Also, I love that you mentioned MUDs. (I played Achaea for YEARS.)
---
...and the line, "My damn parents wouldn't buy me a new computer." That was a fun read! The world won't feel empty. You're going to have a good time.
---
Fury tanking is common among high end guilds on psevers. The limiting factor for these guilds is how much threat their tanks can generate to allow their dps to maximize their output. Fury tanking allows the tank to generate much more threat at the cost of survivability, but these guilds have the healers to heal through this. 
---
This meme was born because most pservers have boss parry rate at around 5.6% when in classic it appears to be around 14%, bringing into question the viability of fury tanking.
---
The best pvp spec for hunters while leveling is bm. You want a spec that let's you keep up both your health and mana.
---
I’m not as familiar with TFT so the only thing off of the top of my head is you at least get the forming of the Forsaken and how that went down. But fair to say the majority of it sets up TBC.
---
Well for the entirety of both stress tests, where streamers were confined to one server, i ran into 0 streamer issues. I'm not sure where this concern is coming from.
---
Having the same back in forth in my mind on the same subject. It seems the general consensus in all forums is that Orc's stun resist is always BIS when it comes to pvp. However, I like the tauren shaman class fantasy better and it sounds like warstomp and +hp is only slightly inferior/ relatively equal in usefulness to an ele sham, which I plan on rolling. This I can live with, but...
---
I'm worried about the other Tauren race traits. Size and range.
---
Is it true that as a Tauren you will likely be targeted the majority of time in pvp groups skirmishes because of the sprite size? Do Tauren players see a notable difference in this aspect that makes them regret their size? (Also, not interested in rolling a female, even if they're slightly smaller.)
---
What does the Tauren's difference in range mean for an ele shaman? I know that it can be both a positive and negative for melee with the increased range of attack and being attacked, but does it have any affect on spell range and casting? Or is it only a defensive detriment for Tauren casters?
---
My experience is getting ganked the instant I step foot into Stonetalon. Is is sunrock retreat that is constantly bombed by alliance?
---
Level 1 HYPE
---
Yes, so, let's say Asmonlol'd and his horde of teenaged idiots all roll one server, and I roll another.  
---
Six months later, Asmon is pissed off at someone else on the server he's on and decides to re-roll or transfer onto the one I am on.  
---
Now what? Oh I should spend $30 every single time a streamer migrates to my server so I can avoid their idiot parade?
---
Tauren are way better imo.
---
Orc gives you two things:  stun resist and blood fury, which is only relevant for enhancement and the downside is worse on shaman than any other class orcs can be because it nerfs your ability to heal yourself.
---
On the other hand, taurens get hp, war stomp, and longer melee reach.  War stomp is amazing for shamans because they don't have any other hard CC in classic, which to me is the best reason to go Tauren.  But if you're going enhance, the increased range is nice too.
---
Both are good choices but for me Tauren is the better choice.
---
"Everyone's advice" are threads from pservers or pre-Beta speculation. They're also based on wanting to level quickly rather than being able to have an edge in wPvP along the way. If I thought it had already been answered, I wouldn't have asked.
---
I was gonna say I can hardly get a summon to a raid half the time I'm told to just walk like damn.
---
this is a compilation of the making of classic and all the expansions. the making of classic is very interesting.
---
Ah my mistake, I misread your comment!
---
&gt;You can say about pserver players what you want
---
They're awesome and without them we'd never have official Classic.
---
Nah totally different for immersion. Mankrik is in the game, so playing on a server  named after him is different than reminding you that some dude named Chris helped build this game.
---
I just joined a blizzlike pserver to kill the time and iron out my 13 year absence from tanking in vanilla.
---
Bfa just feels like a chore to play
---
Well, you're entitled to your WRONG opinion.
---
The subscription is for retail, not classic. Classic is pretty much DLC but you need the base game.
---
No catch, smart business, it's still about money.
---
I'm a flight path whore.  Always have been, always will be.  I've always loved running The Warsong Reports quest just to get the Splintertree and Zoram Strand flight paths.  It's all a part of that beautiful pain you must experience from running so far on foot, while enjoying the scenery and awesome forest music.
---
Looks fine to me
---
You don’t understand layering if you think they will be as small as 250
---
I'd rather corpse run than Hamstring kite NPCs tbh
---
Yes, doesn't matter if you're leveling feral, balance, or Resto, druids level most effectively by embracing their hybrid nature. Rather than open with starfire or roots, a better plan would be stealth up, lay down some dots with pounce -&gt; rake -&gt; rip while waiting for your Nature's Grasp that you precasted to trigger. Once that does, you can pop back to caster and run away to start burning the mob down. With omen of clarity, you may have even gotten a proc from the fast cat form attack speed that you can then use for a free starfire. Don't be afraid of meleeing a bit to fish for OoC procs if you're running into efficiency issues.
---
Second, be aware of what you want your overall spec to be. If you're going to balance/feral, going feral first up to feline swiftness makes leveling out in the world far less painful. Like wise if you're going balance/resto, getting reflection and insect swarm early might be a good idea. Sure both of these set you back 12ish levels on your Thunderchicken form, but worst case you could always just drop a gold and respec at 40 if you really want your moonkin dance asap.
---
As a druid spirit is your best friend. You get insane spirit multipliers, so it's worth taking advantage of.
---
Funny that you mention participation trophies while describing a VERY casual mindset.
---
Gonna also chime in on wanting a source.
---
&gt;How DARE a mass of people be someone else's retards.  Those people should be MY horde of retards!
---
My wife plans to roll healy priest :)
---
This is Classic. This is classic Community. You don't fall into it. You commit to it and help build it.
---
its not bad the idea but the Experience shows the hardest part is 4 members always online. if one of the 4 goes grinding or 2 levels higher the 4 man thing dosent work anymore
---
&gt; Why is the Tauren troll's fun not valid?
---
Because that one cuck's idea of fun is trying to ruin the fun of hundreds of other players. Why should Blizzard protect one guy that is clearly breaky ToS? Banning griefing was a part of Vanilla. Go play something else if you are gonna cry about not being able to break the rules.
---
This was the most annoying shit ever, why does the we axe have to look so stupid when enchanted? What the hell is up with the 3 blobs, the bottom blob isn't even on a blade, it's FLOATING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF GOD DAMN NOWHERE
---
Racials doesnt really matter, id say go for what you like appearence wise
---
\#allow paid race change!!!
---
That would be awesome if they do that
---
Wow this is amazing! Great work!
---
The best levelling spec for speed is BM.  
---
The best levelling spec for pvp is BM.  
---
This is true on private servers, and it was in vanilla, and it will be in Classic.
---
2017, just far enough ago so that anybody sad about Warriors can pretend to be a salty veteran.
---
Sorry what? I've played both vanilla and arenas extensively (in just about every expansion) how does that invalidate my opinion on the mechanical complexities involved? Could you be a bit more cohesive?
---
This is the truth, no one wanted to run back to Org to spam for 2 hours LFH, Sunken Temple then G2G.
---
Sure, but you'd still have the issue of people trying to do achievements and ruin other people's experience because of it. For example doing silly things in battlegrounds. But, it would be an improvement sure.
---
Ehh .. I’d probably do better in my sleep
---
The requirements will be higher than vanilla as it's a new client, but lower than BFA by a lot. If you're not opposed to buying used parts, I think you could get a PC that will run Classic for $200.
---
Literally what happened to our guild. We got stuck on twin emps multiple times. Big part was as soon as we would get close to being back on track we would lose our MT and usually a few other players with them.
---
Sad to hear. I don't really want to wait until Phase 5 to peak in PvP on ele. Or am I misunderstanding and they're fine even before the AQ gear?
---
If Ele becomes good in PvP only when AQ is accessible, can mages and warlocks get away with using PvP gear exclusively/without raiding? Not sure if I'll have time to raid.
---
They haven’t released specs yet
---
survival has a lot of trash talents which most are in melee situations anyways, so unless you wanna be a melee hunter, then i suggest sticking to BM
---
Fishing from pools was added in the game with the ZG patch (1.7). They said it was to make fishing more engaging, but it was really a way to combat the prevalence of pixel color bots that couldn't be detected mechanically. This is when we got the STV fishing contest too.
---
That might make you think it won't come out until Phase 4... however, fish pools are currently in the Beta and Blizzard has stated that nothing directly related to the major content phases will be in the game at launch (Thorium Point for example, Sagefish recipe for another).
---
And finally, it was available on the first Sunday (and every Sunday) of the Beta. Twinks have been rolling around with the hat.
---
While I love the show - I sometimes can’t get past the English/American accents of the supposed Ukrainian/Belarusian, and Russian inhabitants.
---
Bait or....
---
How is lock like compared to Mage? I just don't know what to pick from those two.
---
Make friends with tanks and healers. Be a conscientious, attentive DPS. Maybe offer to Mark targets for crowd control. It's only as hard or as easy as you make it.
---
Is there any indication they'll be smaller? It's just single-server shards intended to smooth out the launch.
---
Just open each xpac as stand alone server options.  I don’t want classic to ever flow into burning crusade, but I would make a burning crusade character on a tbc dedicated server and enjoy it a lot.  Same with wrath.  I just wouldn’t want it to be with the character I make in classic.
---
A lvl Tauren called Trollgodx pissed off 100k+ players by following around participants in the duel tournament and bodyblocking Totems for hours.
---
I loved starting new parties with a theme like that. Wonky combos work better than many might think. Three player parties might need to think a bit about composition but if you are four I would say most things work as long as you have descent players.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPBsAyzuZgM
---
Watch this, it might be long but it is worth it. Learned a ton about how to lvl a warrior just from 1-11.
---
You are right about that, we can end up with a bubble-scenario. Prices will rise in anticipation of the new content being released, but as soon as the patch is released, the supply exceeds demand and the "winners" are the ones who sold just before the new content is released. 
---
Kind of comparable to the .com bubble in the early 2000's. Everyone was hyped about the potential of the internett and everyone wanted a piece of the cake. We all know that the internett lived up to the promises and then some, but the marked heated up too early and crashed. The only one who made money was the ones who sold before the bubble burst, or in this context, before the patch is released.
---
It was pretty normal in the long dungeons. Sometimes people would leave and youd spend an hour getting someone new too. BRD runs could take 4-5 hours easy
---
I roll almost all my characters female.
---
If I'm gonna look at a butt for that long, it's gotta be a good one!
---
Glad somebody else mentioned this. It was way too distracting for my girlfriend to the point she only watched episode 1. While I wasn’t as annoyed and watched the whole series - it was super disappointing to hear, and made absolutely no sense.
---
"BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON!"
---
*poof* 
---
And he was gone...
---
No, I didn't. Being salty because every single game I play is full of streamers and their idiot audience members isn't being on the same level as them. They ruin the game, I'm just playing it.  
---
It's like this: You go to Disney World, you're there to ride the rides, play the games, hit on the Disney Priincesses, and maybe occasionally do something fun with your kids.  
---
Then here comes AsmonGoofy, he's been streaming his outings to various themeparks with his Periscope cam and shit, and he's ALWAYS got a huge group with him just along for the ride.  
---
No, none of them are actually RIDING any rides, but they're definitely clogging up the lines, trying to "save spots" for their FAVORITE streamer. They're clogging the lines, they're blocking the views, they're basically hording around all the attractions while AsmonGoofy is just being his usual doofus self in the foreground, acting surprised at every innocuous fucking thing he can see.  
---
Meanwhile I've been in the line for "It's A Small World After All" with my kids for the last three hours because the 800 streambuddies who invaded the park with him keep hopping the queue and delaying shit.  
---
Are they enjoying the park, too? Sure, in their way.  
---
Is their way of enjoying the park negatively affecting the experience of everyone else? Yes, goddammit.  
---
Honestly if I were Blizzard I'd bar streamers from playing on most servers. Give them their own servers.
---
&gt; Not necessarily. A huge number of rankers take several month long breaks when they finish the grind, or stop PvPing entirely and go back to raiding. Many start the grind over again on another toon. Very few stick around PvPing at a high level on that toon once they finish the farm.
---
There's not really any valid evidence to back this up other than someones personal experience. Mine was exactly how i explained it, yours may be different, that's fine.
---
&gt;Druid is not particularly impactful in most premade groups, outside of a few rare circumstances. The reason I listed it as high impact is because of how hard it can carry PUGs.
---
I agree, Druids have the ability to carry pugs, but even they are limited, as is any other class, because you're playing with other players. You may be an excellent FC, get your flag ready to cap at any moment but maybe your teammates don't have a hop in hell of dropping the efc. Or, you may be a rogue, whos stealthed in, quickly bursted the efc, only for your fc to not be able to cap. Lots of things can go right or wrong. There are many players on many classes that are skilled capped, that are able to carry pugs just based on that. Then it becomes a debate by how much or how often which we really cant keep track of. 
---
&gt;The warriors and healers farming the GY would be high impact in that scenario. Not the rogue or druid who never so much as even see an enemy.
---
Depending on your group composition, and how badly you are stomping pugs, some classes may become interchangeable to a degree. You don't even need to always have X,Y,Z farming a GY. Obviously to even get to a point of GY farm you need to adhere to some meta. But there is certainly flexibility. The skill aspect is very important when considering how to run a premade vs pugs. To say that a rogue would be guarding a flag the entire duration or even at all could be up for debate. That's all I'm trying to make a point of.
---
&gt;This is a ridiculous notion. We are specifically talking about organized pvp, which is premades. And premades are 99.999% dodges and stomps. That's just the nature of the game. You can't have a conversation about what classes are needed in competitive pvp and rule out the meta for rank farming.
---
It's not so ridiculous if you realize that if i swap out a DPS in a GY farm group for a rogue, that he may also STOMP in that situation. By your logic the rogue would be seen as "high impact". Situational, but very doable. The only class i would consider high impact would be a healer, because it is not interchangeable.
---
Yeah, you basically won the lottery.
---
I remember you!!! I was Smldonkey
---
What ever happened to Sodah?
---
The requirements are much closer to Retail than they are to Vanilla 15 years ago. I'd say if your machine can run BFA on Medium or Medium-High settings, you should be able to run Classic on High settings.
---
In vanilla gamon was a level ten pasive neutral npc in the inn.  He was part of a rigue quest involving pickpocketing.
---
My favourite detail is how Tips says it’s an $800,000,000 project when it was actually $800,000
---
Smldonkey remembers you!!
---
If I wanted a horde of retards of my own, I'd become a streamer.
---
The hardest part will be getting a full 40 people able and willing to deal with your shenanigans.
---
Be prepared to respec and regear for if/when the wipes get to people.
---
5 manning with mates will be easy, especially at mid levels.
---
Omg im saying if people need more of an award
---
Just to be clear, wanting to have a unique spec is entirely different from wanting something that is actually good. If you want to play a trap-based LoS-driven wing clip/raptor hunter, that's fine, but expect to get fucked by ranged classes, especially mages. Hunters are overpowered in vanilla because pets are overpowered while leveling, especially when we talk about cats and boars.
---
If you wanted to play something like https://puu.sh/DBeuy/351fcd9df2.png at level 35, I'm sure it'd be a lot of fun fucking with people in those zones. Hunters aren't gear dependent UNLESS you're playing survival and that's what makes them good. What you're asking for exacerbates and emphasizes the hunter's weaknesses rather than playing to its strengths. 
---
Play whatever you want, but don't act hurt when you're given an answer you weren't looking for.
---
That wasn't his point.
---
It’s really not. I have no idea why this community thinks this old shit is their business.
---
Thats actually insane.
---
Laughs with you but upside down.
---
because people cant max dps without fury tanking for the start of fights
---
What did tbc do that was not vanilla but better?
---
Man. I legit hate folks who do that to questgivers (That Warlords launch was awful, mammoths on the survey looking glass), but that's just funny as hell.
---
I would love to have my mage commissioned if you do that kind of thing
---
It doesnt, Soda has played on a pserver with no issues. The neckbeards are trying to gatekeep their precious classic.
---
This. There's also an option to use the original graphics instead of the improved one so requirements in that case should be even lower.
---
I was playing on the first Sunday, the Fishing event wasn't in.
---
I don’t disagree with you. I’m just saying that you don’t need to create an anti streamer gank guild to get even.  Just avoid it completely by rolling on a different server.
---
Built on Legion engine so it will be more demanding.
---
Technically yes, but in practice the guild will decide who gets it and I doubt many, if any, guilds will just do a /roll 1-40. Also, only a few guilds per server will even bother with this insane grind. I want to join a semi-hc guild but will never bother with this :D
---
The ratio of black lotus spawns to players is the same, whether you have a single realm of 3000, or a layered realm of 12,000.  It's proportional, and only matters until phase 2 anyways.
---
Stop sucking, stack defense. Go run LBRS,UBRS, BRD &amp; Stratholme for +D items, collect and save all FR gear as well, you fucking suck!
---
I got my Beta a few Weeks ago, so that means I'm over F&amp;F priority. Good to know.
---
There will be a realm wide Discord, a worldwide in-game chat channel, and a LFG addon. You still won't be "in demand", but you shouldn't have a difficult time finding groups as you level. Sitting in a city and spamming chat is going to be a thing of the past.
---
&gt; soul stone the healer    
---
Unless they're a Druid. Then give it to a DPS if they have a full rez (Pally, Shammy, S. Priest, etc), just double check they trained it (you'd be surprised).
---
I remember this but also have no idea what it was called.
---
Extra final thought to slaughter the dps as a spelladin... 
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449
---
Farm the crap out of that for raids... I am not kidding.
---
Even with Thrash Blade, MS 2 Hander is simply just better. No reason to lvl as DW, the amount of misses you encounter is horrible. 
---
Either do Fury 2H till 40 then respecc, or just do Arms spec that is good during lvling and is your PvP spec at 60.
---
IDK why you're laughing, the only good British/EU streamer WOW's ever had died recently. I'd be sad, really, TotalBiscuit was the man.
---
No I don't hate ALL streamers. I miss the old, good ones.
---
Sodapoppin farmed these from the Crowd Pummeler for the tournament. It looked like it was in every instance of gnomer so it was a boss.
---
Thats how it starts ;)
---
If you don't understand there's no point in explaining. Basically, you're wrong.
---
I can only agree with the above:
---
I have love for all of them, although Warcraft 1 has not aged well indeed, the gameplay is clunky and you miss too many of the luxuries later RTS's offered. Warcraft II, especially the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) edition (which I guess is now standard?) is still great! I received War II as a Christmas gift and still can feel how hyped I was. (wasn't it great to be able to live in ignorance of games being made or close to release? Of course it helped to have parents who of kept an eye out for what you loved!).
---
Warcraft 3, was my first true internet game and it's still amazing, and TFT made it even better. The first time the remastered Warcraft II music popped in got some serious chills.
---
If you thought mages were bad on mana, boomkin is literally a discount mage. 
---
You get half the spells mages get, and you waste more mana to do half the damage a mage can, without any AoE capabilities. Your casts are slow and you cannot heal in boomkin form. No iceblock, no water, no ice shield, innervate is your evocation so ill give you that. 
---
If you want to play a plate mage/healer, play ele shaman. So much burst and you can heal while retaining your high defense.
---
Only advantage boomkin really has, is the ability to stealth&gt;root&gt;starfire. But still, youre wasting 5 talent points to make your crits do 100% more damage, while ele shamans only waste 1 talent point for the same outcome.
---
Rogue standing on top of Venruki round 1 match 3, may have decided the match.
---
Multiple alliance refused to move in the middle of battles making targeting hard for players, especially those new to classic. 
---
They insisted on watching “in person” over just enjoying a stream. And screwed with at least 1 match.
---
You will also be drinking in game as well
---
&gt; I doubt Classic is going to have even 1/10th the number of servers there were back in the day
---
So you're saying it will launch with only 8 servers?
---
Really?
---
lol I misread as "someone who hasn't played arenas extensively" my bad ignore my comment.
---
Still not sure I agree that arena has simplified pvp in wow, have you been playing high lvl arena? I was 2200 in MoP and even at that relatively low rating shit was not simple whatsoever
---
Skallagrim made a video about a similar sword:
---
[https://youtu.be/0UnzFzkQimU](https://youtu.be/0UnzFzkQimU)
---
Another video shows it being able to penetrate cleanly through studded leather armor:
---
https://youtu.be/F7TVg5pKvm0
---
What were you saying about putting words in people’s mouth?  Hypocritical projectionist. Surprising.   I do not want to talk with you.  I want tell you you’re incorrect.  It’s always been about you being wrong.  You cannot do whatever you’d like with your time.  I can’t tell you how to spend your time and I’m not.  I can tell you though, there are limits to what you can do and how you can spend it.  This is the topic.  Call me scared again though, because that is irrelevant like more than 3 quarters of what you’ve said.
---
Thanks for the constructive reply. It seems to be the consensus that BM is the way to go. No one has spelt out the SV issue (gear/strengths/weaknesses) like you have.
---
PS. I'm not acting anything and I'm certainly not hurt or getting answers I wasn't looking for. I didn't ask "give me a SV spec regardless and make it good", I asked "based on my interests, what would you recommend I spec and why?" If the answer is still "BM, of course!", then fine!
---
Dude those Tauren’s definitely fell into the area of harassment. You can do anything you want in the game as long as it doesn’t ruin anyone else experience.
---
\&gt; So, might makes right? Fuck the minority? He  was having fun  
---
You can harass someone and still have fun. Doesn't mean you should do it.   
---
\&gt; and it wasn't actually affecting anyone
---
I, the players, and many more people were pretty annoyed with it. Worst of all, there was nothing that could be done about it.  
---
\&gt; the streamers were just salty they were losing duels and targeted him as the cause.  
---
I think even the people that were winning were annoyed.
---
\---
---
I agree that streamers can be hypocritical, but I want to eliminate streaming from the equation entirely. Streamers muddy the waters because people get especially upset by their existence.
---
My argument is that this kind of behavior should be considered harassment, and the only reason I would consider this harassment over the camping you described would be because there's literally nothing that can be done about this guy. You can't go somewhere else. You can't kill him. There's no mechanic in the game that exists to get around this guy's behavior except to just give up or deal with it. His intention was to make the experience less enjoyable for everyone else. Pretty much textbook harassment.
---
If you could block him and he'd disappear when he's not flagged for PvP, or go into some invite-only tournament instance, then I'd be comfortable agreeing that GM intervention is unnecessary. Unfortunately, no such mechanic exists, and therefore something helpful, but fairly benign, had to be done.
---
Because people want to getting triggered so badly that they stopped reading after the 9th word.
---
I wasn't in the Beta on the first Sunday, but I am now and the tournament is in. It was up yesterday.
---
I thought that was a copy pasta at first
---
Each missile can proc the T3 bonus so I have to assume it can proc other things too
---
Yea, things change, sucks.
---
As u said, streamers are having this effect on many games. So u can just deal with it (i doubt it will be as bad as u think, azeroth is a big place) or continue sitting on your porch with your shotgun, yelling at the kids on your lawn
---
Would be nice to see how how guild loot system omwould work for pugs.
---
He seems alright. Bit dude broish for my taste but he’s had some interesting interviews with some solid classic players and the classic cast is an interesting podcast. I’m no closer to deciding what to roll but he’s one of the CC’s whose been invaluable in learning about vanilla since I played it I wasn’t very knowledgeable.
---
That was amazing, those duels were so much fun to watch... All of those guys are amazing at their classes.
---
Loved watching the Cdew match specifically.
---
Ven is such a fun person to watch and listen to.
---
Lol the caster was tipsout who couldn’t even decide a place to hold the tourney until the end of the first round. Of course he doesn’t make a good decision. 100% needed to be a reduel as it obviously decided the match. 
---
Ven played great but deserved to lose that match
---
Or, we can continue to ask blizz for a few streaming free servers where we are guaranteed not to have to deal with it.
---
youll go oom too much/too fast.
---
Just roll a ele shaman as well, so you can double chain lightning and kill most things
---
I mean, I haven't seen a count, yet, of how many servers will be available at launch. Or how many of them will be PVP/PVE/RP/etc
---
Dude, nice! I'm glad you feel better, now go out there and find other games to play because WoW isn't the only one.
---
Lul most bigger streamers are rank 1 glads besides Asmon, hell ya they are going to play on pvp realms.
---
I mean, sure you can "compete" but it's a 13 dps difference on the weapon, and the stats are way better on HWL, and 20 less AP but 1% crit higher, not to mention the 13 stamina difference.  
---
BRE is a great PvE weapon, but the nature of the stacking proc requirements and it's otherwise mediocre stats and 3.4 speed put it way below the HWL weapons too.
---
Hopefully so, at least currently it doesn't look like I got in :( hope you have better luck friend.
---
My issue with it is just that I am very shoot from the hip. I think you should be able to troll because in a living world you bear the social consequences of being a dick. I even like that villains like TrollgodX can exist. What I don't like is people being able to do it on level ones. For me thats like saying we should allow the level 1 gold spammers back because you know it's their game too.
---
Ok damn, I'll have to check it out next time. I leveled up my fishing and was in STV with Hearthstone set and nothing happened at 2pm server time.
---
rank 1 fire to get rogues out of stealth
---
its faster to cast and doesnt cost mana
---
The real question is when does seal fate swords become viable
---
Why were they where the tournament was being held if they didn't care tho? The organizers even went out of their way to get away from people so the people disrupting obviously cared enough to try to ruin it for other people.
---
Looking at this made me realize that undead horses don’t have any muscle/nerves in his jaw so how would a bit work to direct him?
---
A male horse is called a stallion. A female horse is called a mare.
---
Maybe I overreacted a bit. That said, if you can find good weapons having parry/dodge talents and wing clip would make rogues turbomad. 
---
Really it just boils down to the fact that pets are too good and you need great (not just good) gear to make surv happen while leveling, and good luck rolling over warriors and stuff for solid weapons.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Yes, the rank 1s are guilding together. The rest are playing with pserver players. You wont even notice them if you dont watch twitch.
---
I remember asking one “do all GMs RP? What’s up with that?” And he just replies 
---
“*shrug*”
---
Yes, I agree that R14 is mostly impossible.
---
He actually doesn't work for Blizzard, he made a follow up post sometime after saying things fell through with them.
---
Name also checks out
---
I'm definitely up for ganking streamers but there are a lot of other groups I also dislike
---
Not if your country is miles away from the closest server, no =(
---
You’re just gonna shape shift and run away, I know vanilla druids
---
BLOOD AND THUNDER
---
You could get loot until they took out the ability to in 1.3 or whatever, but I thought you couldn't after that point.
---
why, its unlikely i'll ever see them on my layer again
---
“Wrong dueling tips”
---
Lmfao.
---
Okay bud, have fun with your wand then. Don’t come crying on the forums about balance when you get shat on.
---
He doesn't know :)
---
This classic wow community is filled with social rejects. Mix that in with the envy of someone who makes a living playing a game they’ve played for 14 years and you get the bitter/toxicness of this sub. Hence why these anti-streamer threads are everywhere.
---
You want fury warrior then.
---
Trolls yes, Tauren not so much.
---
Times dont work for me but your name is epic!
---
That's exactly what OP meant. The GMs should go an extra mile to find your real adress to come and do RL roleplaying with you to really achieve that customer satisfaction.
---
It's a very unique dungeon. It's in my top 3 for sure.
---
That was bis for ages as well wasn’t it. Big yikes
---
TBC began forcing the horde to be feminized. No horde wanted blood elves but blizzard forced it upon them, and they were forced to group because no other race had paladins
---
[Droodboy Chickenwing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5W6XK6evyQ)
---
She should go shadow, itll be easier to level and she can still heal instances fine
---
Journey before destination.
---
&gt; Well, it's sort of more because it was actually an RPG
---
That's a generous description, but misses the point. WoW was designed like the other MMOs of its day - have players complete long tasks that are time consuming in order to keep them entertained / playing the game. RPG elements were secondary at best. 
---
&gt; which are more about building up your character with the correct tools to beat content slowly
---
Again, another generous description, but misses the point. In order to slow your leveling down, they often gave you rewards that were subpar for your level / class, or rewards that you can't really use. There's quite a few quests in the game that have you run insane distances that takes 30mins to an hour to complete that single quest Arathi Highlands horde side is notorious for this.
---
Another example is the Paladin. They have a quest at level 10 to get their resurrection spell. That quest chain takes about 45mins to complete and then you can use resurrection. As far as story and RPG elements go, it doesn't really add all that much to your character. 95% of that quest is walking. 5% of it is dialogue and action. The reason it ***feels*** like you're having an RPG moment is because of the time investment you've put into it. The time you spent makes you put a value on that action, but doesn't really speak much for the action itself.
---
In raid content, they only dropped between 3-5 pieces of loot per boss for 40 people. That alone slows down how quickly you can progress in raid tiers. It artificially slows you down so that they could have time to produce more content, and that was the speed of endgame content at that period of time for other games too. 
---
&gt;  rather than having an 18 year old's twitchy trigger finger to dodge the mechanics on mythic
---
So staying out of the fire and doing mechanics is too complicated for you? Then Classic is the game for you. A nice, slow, casual speed for the more casual player with a lot of spare time. 
---
&gt; then being showered in titanmythicazerite-forged 900000ilvl legendaries a couple of weeks after hitting max level.
---
It sounds like you haven't played the last couple of expansions, have you? The developers moved away from gear being the deciding factor on whether or not you could do content and instead made it based more on skill. Skill with your class, skill with you being able to do the mechanics, and how well coordinated your raid is.
---
&gt; In terms of gameplay, BFA is closer to a call of duty cooperative campaign than an actual MMORPG. Challenging? Sure. Rewarding? Obviously not for everyone.
---
&gt; There is a place for both games, but those who want RPG's with character development want classic.
---
Dude if you want RPG for character development, Classic is not it. You should be playing D&amp;D, or a game like Skyrim or Deus Ex. 
---
What's happening is that you're placing a value on what you're doing in Classic because of the time investment you are making. The longer it takes us humans to finish something, the more "pride and accomplishment" we get out of it, and the more value we attribute to it.
---
Twinstar is what makes me proud to be Czech.
---
I don't think you understood him. People will find ways to manipulate batching though how impactful they will be is to be seen.

Hi, /u/mythipegs

Well Just got the Message to keep Faith since it is a process and I am good to Go. So will wait a bit.

He just wanted quick Karma, and posting pictures of old characters like you actually did any of the work for it, on a Subreddit that runs on nostalgia, is easy.
---
Nice, fire with fire. 
---
You showed them!
---
I really hope it can, otherwise AM is just the absolute shittiest spell design ever conceived. Both fireball and frostbolt have trees chock-full of synergy, if AM doesn't even work well with clear casting then wtf.
---
 The fastest character I had ever leveled in Vanilla was an Orc warrior. I leveled him from 1 to 18 in one 16 hour sitting. In two days he was level 34 before I quit playing him. I think it was a combination of being and Orc, Horde questing zone, and finding a nice two handed green weapon really quickly.
---
Why didn’t you craft robes? Bloodvine ones.
---
Actually, yeah. I haven't really drawn since high school, but I was hyped and had some down time at work. Too bad I haven't gotten to finish it yet. I always liked the geometry and perspective challenge of tauren legs.

You are not entitled to have your imaginary perfect gameplay. Maybe you should just accept how other people want to play the game and then decide if you even want to play it because it seems to stress you out the way you present yourself.
---
I imagine op to be a toddler throwing a tantrum 😂
---
Sorry personally I don't know of any, I'm positive they exist - I just didn't play private servers so there was never a need for me to know that information.
---
The best way to level as Balance is to kill stuff in cat form, save your mana, and then heal after. Your damage in cat compared to caster form is roughly the same when your gear lacks spell damage. Which leads to the question: why not just level as Feral in the first place?
---
IMO: respec at level 40 if you really want to be a Moonkin. Don't touch the Balance tree before then.
---
Then what about Soda, the streamer that was complaining the loudest, camping another person for an hour when he was in a bad mood from losing WSG?

You do that and you're gonna run out of space on your friends list real fast.
---
Look at the Hunter SV talents...  
---
Tier 2 is all trash (melee hunter!). Tier 3 is two defensive talents and a trap buff (frost trap's duration increase won't help much in PvP). Tier 4 is mostly trash (hit increase is ok). 
---
So it isn't until tier 5-6-7 that you're looking at good talents. So you want to know why you shouldn't level/PvP as SV? Because you won't benefit much from talents until almost level 40!   
---
Marksman is better than that (not saying much) but BM is just incredibly powerful with good talents at almost every tier. In fact BM almost has too much to pick from. The few bad talents (Imp. Eye of the Beast!) can be trivially ignored.
---
Then what about Soda, the guy complaining the loudest, camping someone for an hour in thousand needles because he was in a bad mood from losing WSG?

Loot council really is the best system. DKP has fallen out of favor with almost every guild now since its not really ideal for progression.
---
I mean you should be killing anyone on the opposite faction anyways whether they are American or chinesr
---
Holy shit I forgot about infinite leashing. I think Im gonna have to roll a frost mage and try some FaxMonkey kiting.
---
Report him.
---
You don't flag for PVP if you just /duel I am pretty sure
---
Orc stun resist is just the best PvP racial. There's no way around it. If it didn't apply to grenades, it might be a contest. You *can* play tauren and not be gimped, but it's just not quite as good. That said, tauren is good enough for elemental shaman where you can really make use of the stun, plus the health racial ends up giving you about 200hp for free. That's pretty nice.
---
People who use emojis on the internet still haven't finished with puberty
---
There's a large range between perfectly min-maxed and complete garbage that goes straight to vendor because it has no redeeming qualities not even looks.
---
I'm happy for you, but you are capable of understanding the number of players within a single closed beta is fewer than a sold out comedy shows right?
---
Compare that to the playerbase base of  other BFA and people coming back subbed for a chance at the beta. 
---
You pullled a lucky ticket essentially... there is zero reason to have your experience be the example or standard for 99% of players.
---
I still have internal battle what to go for :P
---
Maybe, but why? If you're running two classes to do this, you'll just need 3 DPS classes and they can be found more easily than wax in your ears.
---
Manipulating is of course possible. People use spell batching to cancel out enemy spells, that's known. The specific types of things where it almost becomes \*almost\* like an exploit or very uncomfortable method of speeding up your leveling. Those types of things are not doable through manipulating Spell batching (to my knowledge). I never heard of really doing anything besides negating CC and other types of PvP scenarios. 
---
 [https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Tick\_manipulation](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Tick_manipulation) 
---
&gt;Due to the click-intensive nature of tick manipulation, many players shy away from using these methods in favour of more conventional methods, but if a player optimises the amount of actions performed between each game tick, it's possible for them to achieve a much higher experience rate per hour or perform actions much quicker than what would normally be expected.  
---
&gt;While most forms of tick manipulation are technically [glitches](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Glitch), Jagex's stance is that they are considered balanced and accepted due to the extra effort involved.
---
Why are ppl defending this? It’s straight up griefing streamer or no
---
"Jimmy, come down honey. There is a man here, he says it's important. His name is Gorgazor, and he wants to talk to you. I told you to stop talking to adults on the internet"
---
Payo is the best streamer
---
I don't care about imaginary internet points but parts of the classic crowd does seem rather brainless. The first time I saw discussions on the forums, the way #nochanges was used made me think it was just a stupid meme.
---
Yes but why. Two over leveled pet classes certainly coild.
---
How many players in the beta? 
---
More or mess than a stadium's max capacity?
---
Compared to playerbase that BFA and returning subscriptions... you can't base your small % of being selected and say "there's hope guys!
---
I mean you could say that for the 2% chance you'll get invited but you and anyone else like that are just the exception :)
---
I mean we only had 2 years to play vanilla wow so not sure where you get your numbers from
---
I love Payo. Legit the only streamer I really enjoy. He’s convinced me to roll a rogue.
---
glad we agree :)
---
What about that pvp video that starts out with a tauren shaman wearing the hand of rag and crown of flames standing at the lumber mill in arathi basin? Do you have a link for that?
---
Some people have played the vanilla game and are perfectly capable of separating the good from the bad and can admit there was more than a fair share of bad.
---
The AQ Scepter quest series was by far the most magical thing in the game. We had no idea what the next step would be and each step gets more ridiculous than the last. That magic will be lost now, but I still can't wait for it.
---
I legit didn't know Chromie was in classic... I've been playing since 2004... I feel like a failure
---
Only if you are min/maxing everything, which just isn't needed up until aq40.  
---
Cleared most of vanilla as 30/0/21, it was fine.
---
Thank you for showing Tips appreciation for all he has done and keep on doing for a community full of ungrateful pricks that's up to no good than criticizing Tips for his shortcomings. He's far from perfect, of course, but has such a passion for this project and continues to contribute more than pretty much everyone.
---
it's not worth the effort and hardly doable
---
3 man maybe, 2 man is way too hard. Don't forget that this is vanilla and doing RFC with a PALADIN and a 2h warrior tanking is absurd and clearly not vanilla
---
Imagine twinking at low levels when PvP is such a mess in Vanilla, even at 60.
---
Twinking is such a waste of time, imo.
---
Yeah - it's a hard thing to do but, you have to come to a realization that anyone who is putting 100s of hours into the beta will do it all again when classic comes out. 
---
Use this free time before launch to make some good habits before August 26/27.
---
If you have an account active for 14 years and weren't invited you probably have a naughty account.
---
You could likely do it as long as one class has access to a heal and you're at the higher end of the level range. I feel like it'd be pretty slow.
---
"Forcefully" .. running out of range of Tremor and fearing is playing the game.. he isn't chain fearing like a Warlock could potentially abuse it. Didn't Soda lose a round to it, but Cdew got 2 gimmies?
---
Are you sure that skinning is 1.5second cast at all ranks? https://classic.wowhead.com/skinning on this page when you hover over each rank it shows different cast times

I've already used model viewer to design the looks of every Class I plan to roll. Trying to resist drawing them just yet.
---
I want to make a guild called &lt;Dodging Miss Parry&gt; based on my experience as a warrior.
---
Also, I want to make a comic where someone is dying as a warrior and in game it says "I don't have enough rage." but in real life he is red faced and full of rage.
---
People aren’t defending it. 
---
Just kids on the internet with nothing going on in their lives.
---
TBH it seems a little bare. I think you need to....
---
... flesh it out a little. 
---
I'll get my coat.
---
I'm not saying everyone can get in but it's silly when everyone says it is just streamers when majority are unknown people.
---
Alright, I'll message you tomorrow for the link. Thanks.
---
There was no what's? Also it's not hard to spam trade chat LFENCHANTER
---
Isn't your second sentence the type of attitude people have toward streamers that anti-streamer people despise? Seems a little ironic.
---
Pserver bosses do stupid damage though. So I’m sure the meme will continue in Classic.
---
None yet

&lt;Eye of Insanity&gt; **[A] [US] [Pve] [Pacific] [Hardcore]**
---
**_Introduction_**  
---
Eye of Insanity is a guild formed specifically for those who want to be the best on their server and have fun while they do it. We are looking for competitive raiders who enjoy pushing themselves and their guildmates to always be improving. 
---
**_Goals and Expectations_**   
---
Be repectful of the time that everyone puts into getting together. Have consumables ready, do your research of the expected fights, be online and ready to enter the raid at raid time, and be willing to change and adapt as needed during raids. 
---
During raids during any strat explanation or boss pull, chatter is to be kept at a minimum and everyone should be focused on the task at hand. It is expected that everyone raiding understands that the good of the guild is priority number one, and loot will be used to help us succeed as a whole, not just individuals. 
---
**_Guild Culture_**  
---
Classic WoW is very much a game based around community, and having fun, and we want to keep that atmosphere in this guild. You can both be committed to efficient raiding and still like the people you play with. This is an adult guild, so expect adult topics, some swearing etc.
---
We do expect members to be respectful of each other and the fact that people come from a variety of walks of life. Any racism, sexism, homophobia, etc will not be tolerated. There's no ban on talking about controversial subjects, but try not to get divisive over politics, religion, etc. We all share a common interest in Classic WoW, and the golden rule applies here. We are all adults, and there may be people you just don't get along with. We expect people to be able to handle themselves in a mature way. Anyone causing drama will be removed from the guild. 
---
We interview each member in voice chat to make sure that everyone will be a good fit for the guild and for each other. 
---
**_Raid Information_**  
---
We raid Tues/Wed 7:30-11PM Pacific, adding Thurs as needed (which is unlikely until Naxx is out).
---
We use a loot council comprised of the raid leader, role officers, and rotating members of the core raid team.

Feral druid dos RULES
---
So... I haven't ever played with DKP. But it seems like lots of people here have, so it seems like an appropriate place to ask;
---
What's to stop people from colluding super hard? Like, the first thing I'd do would be to whisper everyone else who's going to share gear with me and see if I can't strike up an agreement where we decide internally who gets what: so if I was a fury warrior, I'd hit up all the other fury warriors to set up a system where we decide internally who gets dps plate items first. That way we only ever have to spend the minimum amount on that stuff, and we can fuck over the rogues for weapons and trinkets. Get the rogues in on the scam and we can fuck the hunters, etc.
---
Ahh. EU servers and basically never having to worry about streamers. Small things to be thankful of.
---
Thank you
---
I don't remember if you could bandage underwater but I believe it was possible. But that was a once a minute thing and you'd be able to bandage every other battle mostly. Warlocks realistically were the best to sustain themselves and actually make underwater grinding not annoying.
---
&gt;There were funerals and weddings in WoW. Tons of player driven activities. I don’t remember GM’s ever policing griefers for these events.
---
Exactly, and the only reason they did it this time is because streaming exists.
---
&gt; More importantly streaming drives game sales. It’s a valuable marketing commodity. If the GM’s start acting to placate streamers I could see that being a large concern. I don’t expect blizzard to care more about my money than anyone else’s when it comes to cultivating the community, trust me they don’t care if you threaten to pull your sub over a ban. But there’s something gross about a streamers getting special attention and priority beta access. So I think OP is right to ask if this was the right move. 
---
Thank you for being rational and not a mindless fanboy. I 100% agree that streamers are good for the game as far as advertisement. But as far as in game community, they are bad.
---
The craziest thing about everyone defending the streamers (Soda in particular in this case) is that he was camping (read: greifing) someone for an hour the other night **simply because he was in a bad mood.** He even said as much on his stream, but when his own chat said it was fucked, he backpedaled and tried to argue "I'm just playing the game, what if there is an ore node here that I want?". He's such a hypocritical man-child.
---
Also, by a loose interpretation, sure Trollgod was 'griefing' people (by a very, VERY loose definition from Classic standards) whereas everyone in or at the tournament was breaking the ToS in 2 ways, jumping 'outside' the game map, and communicating with the opposing faction. But the only one with any action taken against them (no matter how minor) was the one guy that the streamers were complaining about.
---
The exact number is irrelevant... it won't be 2k players per server. And it won't be 15k players per server.
---
The # of players per layer doesn't even matter - it's about the playerbase that chooses to select a specific server, and once phase one and layering comes to a close- how many people are left on that server.
---
To put a blanket statement of "xx% will be gone by the end of phase one is ridiculous" 
---
You don't know that, blizzard doesn't know that, they can speculate and look at what their trends say, but to think that there won't be a single server that has 2, 3 ir 4xs the amount of population a server should have after layering is removed... is just bananas.
---
&gt; It's just dumb to say that PvP with flying mounts is even on par without flying mounts.
---
First off, I didn't say it was on par.  I made the case and cited examples of where world pvp still happened, specifically in TBC where each zone had a world pvp objective.  The examples you cited are examples of the impromptu pvp that happened when people would cross paths which I clearly said that flying eliminated.
---
Learn to feel the beat!
---
Unfortunately, the one you are thinking of is in the cataclysm version of Stonetalon mountains; not vanilla.  Still one of the better stories, regardless of what you think of the reworked Cata zones.
---
My favorite would have to be Shards of Myzrael quest line in Arathi.  Just something about doing this huge quest chain across the entire zone, only to be betrayed at the end, and have a boss-like final encounter quite a few levels above you just sticks in my mind as one of the most epic things I've experienced
---
The Battle of Darrowshire questline in WPL is a close second.
---
And people like you must be a fat neckbeard incel, thats just angry at the world. Buy some rope!
---
In a perfect world...
---
This 100%. I play horde. But when I got my wife into it I let her read about both factions and classes and make her own decisions. Try not to persuade her in any decision making. Just think about how you would feel if someone told you about this cool game and made all your decisions for you. Probably wouldn't be any fun. And like someone else said wow will suck her in once she has created the character she wants.
---
I see where you're coming from. 
---
However, I and to be  honest many  others wouldn't have spotted this so maybe let's not blow it out of proportion.
---
Im an avid healer, but this time around I'm gonna pay tank and it is gonna be a new experience for me since Ive only tanked Wotlk and after. Looking forward to learn tanking and becoming a boss tank for my guild
---
How many bots can this guy have?
---
All the people that sont hyper fantasize about what Vanilla actually was, and then pull and cry about things happening in Classic that were always present...
---
They haven't said anything, but in my opinion the logical thing to do would be to use the original realm names, at least the most prominent ones, since as you said, people who played on those will automatically gravitate towards their first realm, potentially reconnecting with friends they've lost contact with
---
Vellums are items you can enchant so that the enchantments can be sold on the ah.
---
People didn't really min max back then like they do now, so many people didn't get their stuff enchanted
---
I'm pretty sure I still know the layout by heart after getting horribly lost the first time.. :-] Good old times.
---
WoW is all about the freedom to say and do pretty much whatever the fuck you want regardless of how other people feel about it. There are few exceptions to this standard.
---
Want to only speak in Dwarvish or Gutterspeak? Go for it.
---
Want to mount up and block the mailbox for everyone in the city? Go for it.
---
Want to talk about politics and other hot button topics in Barrens Chat? Go for it.
---
Want to summon a high-level mob in a lowbie zone so they all die? Go for it.
---
Want to fill someone's bags with Heavy Leather Ball so they can't loot anything? Go for it.
---
Want to corpse camp someone for so long they're only recourse is to logoff? Go for it.
---
Want to kill the other faction's quest NPCs or Flight Masters? Go for it.
---
Want to annoy the shit out of people putting together a dueling tournament? Go for it.
---
Rofl. One guy is, by very loose definition for Vanilla wow, 'griefing' people by jumping around an area that is open to anyone (even though they were all breaking ToS by getting to those locations and talking to the other faction, especially to organize something in game) is very quickly actioned against, but the same streamers, who broke the ToS, and grief people on video on their own streams, and I'm supposed to report him? I'm not a streamer, nor the target, they won't do anything.
---
Where is this list?
---
Calm down, the post is just all fun and games. I dont think leveling a warrior is insanely bad. But it is surely slower then most, especially compared to most casters. I rarely died however, and if i did die it was of my own stupidity of pulling 1 or 2 more mobs and not having the cooldowns to back up such a pull.
---
I'm not thinking much about who to play in classic yet, but I am levelling my first ever vanilla character, neglected since 2006, to the cap.
---
Warlock alliance is usually tough for pvp because of the abundance of undeads on the horde side.
---
Not exactly like you, going to be healing instead of tanking for me. So I'm going to be a noob in that. Hoping I find a few nice people to run the leveling dungeons who will put up with me learning though that.
---
IDK, you tell me
---
Priest has maybe the least utility of any healer though?
---
Okay. You can pick apart one sentence to fit your narrative. World PvP was ruined after flying was introduced.
---
It's like this in the Beta, but after several people commented the same as you here, I reported it as a bug.
---
It still looks the same as vanilla though no?
---
This is what happens when McRonalds opens in your town!
---
God yes! That would be perfect
---
This man gets it.
---
I agree. In the beginning it should be the vanilla purist. After a while they should implement changes the same was OSRS does it. With mass community consensus.
---
Do you plan on making a spreadsheet once we have all classic data? If not, which one do you think is the most accurate?
---
I’ve been trying to find Deathwing’s original spreadsheet from the EJ forums but have had no luck. Sad how much knowledge was lost when those forums went down.
---
did you see the long range auto attack?
---
Bummer, but thanks for the heads up! I really loved this quest line and knew it was in a sub-60 area.
---
i can hear the ventrillo sounds followed by sound boards already.
---
eh, she will do what she wants to do, although I do have her sold on spirit tap :)
---
Jesus, I didn’t know you could do all that. I’ve been playing the game for a long time, now I feel like such a noob.
---
It didn't happen widespread in runescape til they released OSRS
---
ohh look it's the 100th class poll of the week, yay.
---
Loot council also has its drawbacks, especially in later expacs because of cliques.
---
For example, a weapon drops that warriors and rogues want, but because of a clique that developed naturally (or un-natuarrly) LC might want to give it to their warrior friend over a rogue (who maybe deserves it more) because the warrior guildie tanked all those dungeons for their alts/friends. 
---
I didnt play vanilla much, but from my experience from TBC and onwards, cliques form in guilds, and if you are part of the LC clique (willingly or unwillingly) you might get loot priority if you are part of the clique.
---
Yea, running 2 hallways in 10 minutes instead of the entire dungeon. Cataclysm destroyed much of the world.
---
You can also see that I have broken gear. Had no idea that guy was there for the longest time.
---
He was frozen in the trap mid attack, probably was batched but delayed because of that.
---
yeah realised that after i entered it, ah well
---
Since clearcasting procs off of damage, is should be off of each "tick"
---
Hahahaha, you're adorable.  
---
"Anyone who hates streamers are just jEaLoUs that they make money to play vidya and are toxic!"  
---
Or, maybe we're sick of idiotic internet personalities with the warmth and brilliance of a room-temp corndog destroying our games?  
---
Can't match into a Rainbow Six Siege match without a streamer talking over everyone on comms, have to mute that bitch.  
---
Fortnite? Oh you fucking bet your ass if any one of the thousands of Ritalin Rejects are around, oh man, your entire match is fucked.  
---
PUBG? I haven't even played it in over a year and a half but as soon as I saw Twitch/YT/TTV in the kill feed, I quit the match. Not gonna deal with stream snipers, honkers, harassment.  
---
The Division and Division 2? Twitch managed to make the Dark Zone both fun and frustrating at the same time. Fun in that the DZ full of people can be a hoot, frustrating because as soon as the streamer and his squad go rogue, now there's 10 twitch drones running around making callouts when they find people hiding from the rogues.  
---
I ran into them in Black Desert Online. Hell, I used to hunt them in EVE Online.   
---
Star Citizen is interesting, because there's a huge group of players dead-set on ruining Star Citizen gameplay for people who legitimately want to play it, for whatever political or bullshit reason of the day they want. Trying to check out the new patch, fly the new ship, and see the progress made since the last update? Too bad, there's six Aurora LN's outside ArcCorp waiting to blow your ass up and then KEK in the local chat, and "subscribe to DeejayKnight!".  
---
Streamers and the idiots who follow them in-game are ruining gaming. I'm not anti-social, I'm not some kind of sperg who can't deal with people playing the game the way they want. All of what I am describing is legitimate griefing, and legitimately and negatively impacts the gameplay for all who play these games. You're free to disagree, but that leaves me free to call you an idiot, so...
---
Haven’t decided. Maybe a Warlock because that’s what I main now. Maybe a hunter, because that’s what I mained when I played Vanilla/TBC. Might main a rogue, because I have always loved them.
---
In other words, I don’t know yet, all I know is I won’t main a shaman (because I play alliance).
---
Ah my buddy had this back in the day.  Sadly we never got around to playing it as we were too busy playing WoW.  Enjoy, looks like it’ll be fun!
---
Moon Guard has a US top 10 raid guild on it. (at least it did when I last cared in Nighthold)
---
That's an absurdly high resolution. Can you post a screen shot? Probably looks amazing.
---
So this is trollgodx's reddit account
---
I had a tear
---
Reduced raid sizes, alienating groups, you now had to have 50 people to give the same 40 people opportunities for raid loot.
---
It desolated the old cities resulting in scarce help for newer players, resulting in further fracturing the community aspect of the game.
---
Eventually the arena system began to favor the lazy with an every body gets a trophy reward system devaluing those working towards the gear.
---
The new zoning quests were not nearly as thoughtful as the original lines.  There are basically no memorable world monsters for me in all of TBC but yet I have a very long list from the original.
---
Flying mounts are and we're a travesty that was never needed and meant nothing to achieve and get them.
---
The instantaneous devaluation of all hard earned raid gear the second you walked through the portal to TBC, it didn't even hold on for a full level.
---
The migration to a smaller landscape caused many to abstain from the game, it was TBC map or bust.
---
I can go on... All of these items particular the ones that damaged community are the cause wow had begun to spiral downwards.
---
Because people crying over this sort of shit is how we got BFA
---
Reported for suggesting suicide. Have fun, kid.
---
Disagree.  Ven also couldn't target the hunter at one point because he feigned ontop of alliance during the same duel.  It works both ways man.  This was the battlefield they had and he lost.  End of story.
---
Nothing like experiencing the world from a sitting position
---
I had a good one for night elf's or druids/rogues that I used to do in the starting zones of the horde
---
Get engineering and make the explosive sheep it follows you around while in stealth.. usually newbies are curious enough they attack it and die and then get flagged if there in their territory
---
This won't happen. Those names are still in use.
---
I always thought kalimdor looked like half a smiling ogre head, and Eastern kingdoms as half an Eredar's head.
---
you should wait at an inn and see who just came in with the hearthstone and do it to those guys.

- At the moment we are looking mostly for Warriors, Priests, Shamans and Druids. Warlocks and Rogues are close to full. If you want to play a closed class lets have a talk anyway as we are still 3 months away and rosterchanges are happening.
---
- Raid times and days aren't final yet but we will start around 11PM / Midnight and do 3,5 hours
---
- 2 days per week for 40 raids, 20 raids spontaneously on offdays
---
- Loot assignment isn't fixed yet.
---

Raise our champion upon your shoulders brother, so that he will stand above us all in the heavens!
---
I agree with you on all fronts.  ZA was cool too for the niche pieces after you capped stats (like shields without defense)
---
Sunwell was my favorite raid in WoW to date.  I would absolutely play a TBC server if released.
---
We'll get the realm names on August 12th. They'll be all new names as the old ones are all still in use.
---
In 6 years of playing on private servers I've seen exactly two moonkin druids and neither of them were allowed into raids.
---
Yes, but no one will have the gold yet on a fresh economy.
---
&gt;/target caliph scorpidsting
---
/cast moonfire
---
Bind to mouse wheel up and down.
---
Beefydps is a great tauren name. So is Holycow, and Cowbacca. 
---
But I second it. I would play on RP PVP too.
---
Aaaaah, if only Asmongold and Soda would die of cancer, too...
---
Leveling a warrior is an exercise in pain. And I love it.
---
There’s nothing to optimize from 1-10. Equip the highest dps weapon and attack. As you figured out, warriors demand precise mob selection. Throughout basically the entire game you should be looking for mobs exactly 1 level below you. 2 is ok, 0 is ok when you’re closer to the end of the level (when weapon skill and defense have caught up).
---
These are so fucking good.
---
haha no
---
They're fine before too but they scale well with gear.
---
If you don't have time to raid you definitely don't have time to get PvP gear though.
---
True, but following that logic any AoE spell would guarantee a procc every time, no?
---
I can pick apart your whole response if you'd like.  My response was speaking to the fact that world pvp wasn't killed with the advent of flying.  It still happened, was still fun, but it did change.  And again, I stated very clearly that this was based on my experience.  Your experience may vary and that's cool.
---
Sequisha needs to use a sword and board when he's dueling a rogue lol.
---
Yea, that may be so, but you looks WAY cooler than a mage. :D
---
Sorry, I'm not 12.
---
About whether they can, or whether they should?
---
Soz if there was one recently. I myself did not see one on front page for quite some time. Would appreciate the link tho because I made it for sole purpose of making my decision easier.
---
And it's pretty darn silly when anyone says that everyone is being literal to the T that every single person within the closed beta, that everyone opted in for girls *ONLY* streamers and blizzard employees.
---
they confirmed different names already, to avoid confusion with retail players
---
I'd invite a chicken to my group any time. I think being a big fat chicken says a lot about your character and your willingness to persevere.
---
Imagine getting so angry and tilted just because some guy decided to follow other guy in an online game.
---
So you're agreeing there's  another server he could be maining Alliance on?
---
^
---
Should have mentioned your on a private server. The other ones posted are for classic beta which uses the macro api from bfa.
---
 If you're supporting the ban in this case, you're signing off the right to question most bans in the future all together. It's like free speech. But hey, it's pretty clear that none of you remember what it was like in Vanilla. "we want no changes" my ass
---
They didn't used to just do tickets. They actually would have a conversation with you. It was dope. They had 3X as many GM per population,. and service was GREAT. Now, you get some over worked slave and can practically feel "the Bobs" breathing down their necks for efficiency vs actually making a meanful impact on my experience.
---
Yea I’m also rolling a Druid to tank with just because everyone is saying it’s a terrible idea. 
---
I remember back in the day no one had any idea what they were doing, no one followed a strict spec for their class. Everyone was just enjoying playing and learning the game. 
---
That’s my goal this time around. I won’t be looking up BiS or sticking to a specific spec build. I’m playing the game to have fun and teach myself again. Fuckin excited.

The hardest part about leveling as a group is that, as you add more people, squealing becomes a bigger issue.  Someone has to work, or do family stuff, or whatever.  Some players will obviously want to play more than others, and will be tempted to level outside of the group.
---
The best thing to do is have a character that is only dedicated to leveling in your group, then have an alt that you can play solo when the rest of the group isn't on.

&gt; rage about liberals.

Man they're wild.

almost like blackrock depths.
---
Thanks for the recommendation! I'm nearing the end of my podcast backlog and was looking for something new so this is perfect.
---
Man use your adderall for school work not this shit
---

---
i just want an answer
---
I was thinking more in the way of running away like a bitch :p
---
Anyone with an active sub can reserve up to 3 names on Augsut 13th.
---
That's all we know for now, but I'd say it's safe to assume any day around August 1st, we'll have a server list.
---
Well they could append “(Classic)” to them, right?
---
You seem to be getting a lot of hate, but I’m not looking forward to meeting up with a streamer or their gangs that follow them. What if I get into a fight with one and kill him? Will I then be stalked and hunted by his followers? Idk, I don’t watch streamers, I’ve only heard about them.
---
Just my opinion: MTs in casual guilds don't deserve special loot priority.  Your guild is not a cutting edge server-first or world-first contender, so your character can be on the same loot system as everyone else.  DKP, loot council, I don't care what it is, but it should apply to everyone.  
---
Conversely, you're not really offering anything.  You claim that your character should get loot priority because the raid will progress faster, but at 2 days a week you're not offering fast progression.  It just seems like loot hoarding.
---
I would have zero issue with them improving small visual bugs like this
---
Link the patch notes for this rather than a YouTube comment.
---
That's wicked!
---
Good thing is that you dont have to wait for classic to release to do that quest. Just roll a new horde toon now while you wait.
---
yeah im weirdo when i lost my teens years grinding some useless bshit gear and I quit after realm first LK, glad you enjoyed retail failwow.... bought a fresh wod in release week and by the end of next week full pvp gear? nah thanks blizz &lt;3 see you in 60s premades and 29s 39s brackets
---
I just meant the fear forced a forfeit to happen.
---
Hi, /u/DontBlockMePls_
---
I don't
---
Really, at this point Classic and Modern WoW are two different games.  It's like comparing Warcraft 2 to Starcraft.  Both are RTS games, but play completely different.
---
Its against tos and has the potential to get you banned. Do what you will with that info.
---
I played 1-6 on classic stress test, and 1-8 on LH, LH felt significantly harder for some reason, too
---
Original Vanilla warrior here, I felt your pain... 1000s of times.
---
Found trollgodx
---
Lol, living on th edge posting about the L word on this sub :)
---
Are they really that bad? :(
---
"BRB shitting my self"
---
It doesn't work because the old client used .MPQ files whereas the new client uses CASC files... so no, you can't use that patch.
---
Good news is, Classic is based off the 7.3.5 client, and the modding community already is talking about this, so I'd expect a patch to come out not long after Classic releases.
---
Bear in mind that model editing is against TOS, and whilst blizz takes it easy against purely cosmetic modders, you're still putting your account in risk.
---
Two handers, Flurry, crit chance improvement and ability to parry. Lots of nice levelling talents in enhancement tree.
---
He left quite quickly unfortunately
---
Just wait until you realize that Meeting stones are a phase 2 launch, and there is no summons.. EVERY One needs to run thier ass to the instance
---
Can you provide a source? Not to be a dick but I cannot find any official post talking about it
---
I'm looking for a digital copy, does anyone know where a PDF or eBook may be purchased / downloaded? Thank you!
---
Boralus? how would you even get there at low levels without being kul tiran?
---
The heirloom vendor i know of is in ironforge museum-area.
---
&gt; basically artificial lag Blizzard added to simulate the vanilla experience
---
This is quite misleading. It's not artifical, it's not lag, and it's not simulating anything. This is a property of how servers work in every online game, and they set classic to the settings that vanilla had in 2004-2006. There are actual pros to this besides gameplay reasons, such as lower bandwidth and more time to process each cycle.
---
If you've heard of "server tickrate" in CSGO, spell batching is that. If a CSGO server has 64 tickrate, that means it's updating 64 batches per second. In vanilla the number was much lower. I've seen conflicting information, but it seems in vanilla it was in the range of 3-5. If it's 5, that means there is a potential maximum 200ms delay to your actions, and this is completely unrelated to latency (ping).
---
In fact, it helps to negate the downsides of ping because if a batch has just finished and player A casts a spell with 10ms ping and player B casts a spell with 140ms ping, both messages arrive before the batch is to be processed (200ms), therefore both spells will execute at the same time. Of course if you start later in the batch, the lower ping player has the advantage.
---
They could... but I doubt they will. How would Blizzard decide which realms are worthy to be reborn and which aren't? And that naming scheme just gets ugly around the water cooler:
---
"The world server on Spirestone is bugging out, we need to reset it."
---
"Okay, done."
---
"No, I meant Spirestone-Classic!"
---
"Oops..."
---
Bre is one of the best pvp weapons in the game.    And yes the point of the post was if he needed rank 14 weapons to do well in pvp. And the answer is no, raid weapons are comparable
---
Because that one person's idea of fun is trying to ruin the fun of hundreds of other players. Why should Blizzard protect one guy that is clearly breaking ToS? Banning griefing was a part of Vanilla.
---
There is no such channel and Google doesn't find anything
---
Streamers will be a drop in the ocean compared to all the other players I predict.. might not even notice
---
its in an interview with the lead developers.
---
thank you for that answer
---
No. They should use new names to absolutely eliminate any possible confusion between versions of the game with realm names.
---
It honestly feels like rage generation is just wrong.
---
Guess the possibility of there being 1 or 2 servers is dead... damn.
---
Your coin toss redditor response of either 'Who hurt you?' or 'You must be fun at parties'
---
Not guaranteed.  At 5/5 you only had a 10% per instance of damage to proc.  Aoe spells certainly gave you a higher chance if you hit many mobs, but it was not guaranteed with each cast.  Also, I believe it was only on the initial hit, so the damage over time ground effect of flamestrike would not proc.
---
and dire maul!
---
when is the next invite wave ;\_;
---
You actually read that stuff?
---
I like the quest chain in barrens that starts with collecting centaur bracers and then going to the different oasis’ and killing all the centaur leaders and bringing their heads back to the orc in between crossroads and stonetalon. It is kind of bad ass when you think about it, decimating clans of centaur and decapitating their strongest members and bringing their entire heads back to the questgiver. And that’s only at level 15ish.
---
Skullcrusher! That was my server for Vanilla + TBC and your name sounds familiar as well. I was on Alliance. What guilds were you in? I was in Conviction and Vehement on my Druid Krez.
---
My favorite thing about the level cap is that since there is no where to progress to, everyone has to make up shit they think would be fun. The player driven content is very cool and I love it.
---
WeirdChamp
---
You're just a skinner. Be honest =D
---
That said, I tot tally miss the full thing. When do you go up stairs?&gt; When down, Ow crap, I fell off the ledge and aggroed 50 whelps. 
---
Or that time, some one hits Emriss and no one bothered clearing trash packs. LOL
---
How can one hamstring a snake, a creature with no hamstrings?
---
You’d just be a drop of dur in a sea of retards my friend.
---
The game is all about having fun bud. If that's something you want to do give it a try-you could be surprised at how many others would want a casual relaxed environment to chill in
---
Counter Argument, different metas at lower level caps can be an enjoyable change of pace. Your assumption is that someone who has a twink is not successful at PvP at max level, it is possible to be good at PvP max level and enjoy lower level PvP. Two different experiences that do not prevent you from being good at both.
---
same
---
Ive used them for years. I have entire limbs for blink and counter spell.

---
&gt; quickly destroys all gold selling and boosting operations and bans thier customers. 
---
Given the past 14 years of their track record for it, not going to happen.
---
1. They do banwaves every x months. This generally means that you can run a bot for 3 months, and make more of a profit then the cost of buying a new account.
---
2. They generally don't buy goldbuyers. They often don't even take bought gold away.
---
SHUT
---
Cannot unsee, god damn it
---
Yeah, AQ40 and Naxx they are really bad. Still needed for Tranq shot, but you're not doing much in terms of damage. Warriors and Rogues dominate DPS.
---
it works, me and my brother soloed SM all the wings, when we where 40, we even did ZF up to stairs, as Warrior+Druid, both Tauren. Warstomp made is very easy.
---
Whether they should. Obviously they can ban him, they can ban anyone.
---
Think of it this way, you have two weapons:
---
250 average damage, 3.0 speed.
---
250 average damage, 2.0 speed.
---
Which is better.  Hint, its the 2.0 speed.
---
&gt;Now im wondering how hard it is to get in dungeon groups while leveling, cause I experienced problems with that on retail and it would suck a lot to wait hours before getting enough tanks/heals to get a group going. Do you guys think its hard to get in dungeons without playing tanks or healers?
---
Think about it like this - it took hours to get enough players in retail WITH so many in game tools that automates that search.
---
In Classic- if you are lazy and just wait to see "LF2M BrD 1 dps 1 heal" you'll be lucky to see that post, whisper them and be the first to get invited. 
---
You have to be proactive if you want to get into random groups without waiting for hours. 
---
Either that or form your own group, and as a warlock you should be one of the first people to be at the dungeon entrance to be able to summon whoever's not at the entrance yet.
---
And this what to do with World of Warcraft exactly?
---
unfortunately not :&lt; can't say i've seen that one yet!
---
Do it, especially if you accept bounties from other guilds. We trolled a guild so hard that our Raid Leader required 40 screenshots of kills before you could raid that week. They couldn't leave the fucking city.
---
The value doesn’t increase necessarily, the amount of gold in circulation increases then price goes up due to the currency inflating.  So money now might be a better than money later because everything you buy with the gold you earned selling goods.. is used to buy inflated goods.
---
I have more people on my ignore list than on my friends list 🤷‍♀️
---
Oh it matters
---
Anyone know if there are any wheel of time references?
---
It worked in vanilla. There was a story on here of someone who got to lvl 40 or something without even putting in talents
---
Do you need an active sub to get invinted, or can you sub after the invitation?
---
A small Friends &amp; Family wave went out earlier today. That's probably all it's going to be from here on out.
---
I swap between “brb bio” and “brb gotta pee”. One is clearly for peeing and relays how long I’ll be. The other is a polite way of saying “i have to go shit right now” without being vulgar.
---
Dude, you do understand we know what your characters name is right?  We can clearly see that you 100% did not play vanilla and this is a shit post.  Do you understand this.
---
Yes your example is correct, people often choose a worse weapon while leveling because they dont even know WHY a slow weapon is important. They just read and dont bother to think about it. For example ive seen people say that https://classicdb.ch/?item=6975 is better than https://classicdb.ch/?item=6975 because its slower
---
Not trying to argue. Just trying to see your point.
---
Why would focusing on keeping your MT geared so progression is easier not still work in a “casual” guild? Less healing and more threat = easier faster kills. More kills = more loot for the team as a whole. More gear = faster progression over all. If we are only going to raid 2 days a week wouldn’t it be better to get the most out of those raid days?
---
Jumping on top of someone for a month isn’t griefing. If somebody was doing that to me and I reported them, nothing would ever happen.
---
Why not just run tank/healer? DPS fall out of trees.
---
Bruh I love to sit in the farms of hillsbrad with my npc army. Good luck trying to do the dwarf elites I'm sapping ur healer when u pull.
---
You're missing the 2 big tiddy human mages he made bro.
---
&gt; I, the players, and many more people were pretty annoyed with it. Worst of all, there was nothing that could be done about it.
---
I'm in the beta, I was playing that night, it didn't bother me one bit. The only people it bothered were those that chose to be bothered by it. 
---
&gt; You can't go somewhere else.
---
You absolutely can. Go to contested territory and have your alliance kill them, even though that's strictly against the ToS, it was happening anyway (cross faction communication). Or anywhere that it would be difficult to get to at level 1. 
---
&gt; His intention was to make the experience less enjoyable for everyone else. Pretty much textbook harassment.
---
TIL you can read minds of people you don't know and determine their intentions. Neat trick. And Soda's intent was to take out his bad mood and make the experience less enjoyable for that one person. But that was just one person, and a non streamer, so that players enjoyment is less important. Wow.
---
I've been camped in Vanilla. You deal with it and move on. Same these people should have done. But they are entitled whiners who think the game was made for them, not everyone.
---
&gt; Unfortunately, no such mechanic exists, and therefore something helpful, but fairly benign, had to be done.
---
Right, which is why the action taken is not that bad. The main issues I have with it are:
---
1. Anything was done at all. This would have been ignored in Vanilla.
---
2. Streamers were not calling for something benign and effective, they were calling for a permanent, account wide ban of this person. 
---
3. Organizing the tournament in the first place, with cross faction interaction, is strictly against the ToS. As is wall jumping outside of the map, or intended areas. But that was completely ignored.
---
They are all maxing out fishing so they can damage higher level mobs.
---
Yeah if someone is going into Classic 100% only for nostalgia, they will be done with the game within a month or 2 at most. 
---
It's great to have those memories, but to try and will those experiences into existence 15 years later is just setting themselves up for failure.
---
Classic will be filled with fortnite kids and ever quest old people... we will have poggers spammed in the chat and rude people only allowing others to play 1 way.
---
It will be a new experience with old systems and we'll love it.
---
This. Interview with Tipsout/omar from the pre beta meetup. He says they won't use the same names to avoid confusion.
---
Hell yeah!
---
Guild wars 2 has a good amount of grindable/long term content to not so seriously get into for at least a month.  PS4 has free borderlands 2 in a few days as well I believe, which a few of my friends will probably also grab to kill time until classic.
---
Lol. You're gonna have a bad time. I suggest you stick to retail.
---
I figure it will be quite predictable for the first month or two while everyone grinds to 60.
---
My question is- what happens at max level? Once you've got a mount, your enchants...there's not many gold sinks like current retail.
---
Who doesn’t enjoy a present???
---
Grenades, huge part of OvP
---
 Why wouldn’t they be closer to Vanilla? The graphics and effects are all pretty much the same right?
---
It changes a few times in classic.  Where it settled was how you described iirc.
---
I wonder if blizz is preparing an event or at least a cinematic for classic
---
You can do it it's just slow.
---
Agreed. Its so weird seeing people freak out about Sylvanas being a bad guy bad buy. Like.. She was NEVER a good guy? Why are people surprised?
---
Ye sounds fun haha I dunno just sounds like a unique idea kinda similar to like an all Druid guild etc just to be part of a special unit ? I dunno just sounds fun :P
---
What happened? Where'd all the replies go
---
&gt; Why should Blizzard protect one guy that is clearly breaking ToS?
---
Doing nothing is not 'protecting' him. 
---
&gt; Banning griefing was a part of Vanilla.
---
Name one time someone jumping around, not saying anything or actually killing/camping someone, was banned. 
---
Soda was griefing someone like 2 nights before because, in his own words on his stream, he was 'in a bad mood' after losing WSG. He camped some guy for like an hour just because he was salty that he lost a BG.
---
&gt;  Reporting comments won't help your case. It just shows that you're a hypocrite.
---
I'm not reporting anyone, lol.
---
Most likely you are correct but I hope not. The beta sever seems really quiet. Seems like their are not a lot of people playing.
---
Chance (Sodapoppin) was robbed of the win!
---
Gwod
---
You didn't, but okay. I was on my character at the time this was happening, running WSG.
---
You can't beat BM spec for leveling. It shifts the focus from yourself, especially if you aren't geared well enough, to improving your pet. Turn on beastial wrath and its basically an insta-win against clothies.
---
When you do get better equipment a MM focused spec will put out much greater damage making it the preferred raiding/pve spec (especially since raids aren't exactly pet friendly). A survival spec becomes viable once you hit a certain agility requirement but I would still prefer going MM myself.
---
THIIIIIISSSSSS
---
I WILL BE A PIRATE AND NO ONE CAN STOP ME
---
I dont think I'll be that...idk...'laid back?', but I'll he doing 90% of what this sub screeches at you not to do.
---
I'm leveling with tailoring and enchanting and you bet your ass I'm keeping up with it as I go.  I'll be running dungeons, even if it is slower.  I'm not using a questhelper, so I'll be reading quest text.  I'll be stopping to talk to people if they start chatting. I'll be exploring (because it'll be what...almost 9 years at that point since I've seen that world?).  
---
I'm kind of glad I'm almost 30 now and have a different mindset.  Yes, I want to raid at 60...but it's not my primary focus.  I want to experience the world (of warcraft) as both an MMO and an RPG.
---
Ey! Congrats! Hook me up too while you are at it lmao. For real happy for everyone who got in. Enjoy it!
---
The Classic Beta performs slightly better than Retail because the textures and models are lower resolution, requiring less video RAM.
---
The Classic Beta doesn't perform at all like Vanilla because it's using Retail's engine, which is optimized for much more powerful machines than we had 15 years ago.
---
I heard a good rationalization about how that can represent the many regions and accents that the Soviet Union would've drawn from.
---
Keep in mind that you don't have to have a 100% attendance.
---
Not really necessary to make the group structure "faster" if you guys don't care about getting to 60 in a timely manner.
---
Any quest that requires 10 bands or 8 heads, times that by your party members... then factor in the first few weeks of play where every quest is overpopulated due to everyone questing for hours on end.
---
You'll feel the slowness when it takes your group 2 hours to do a handful of quests, but as long as the "rush" feeling isn't there- you'll have a ton more fun than people who solo to 60 :)
---
long story short, he had something on his desktop with his RL name on stream and then people googled it and found info about him, so lesson learnt, clean your desktop before streaming, but yeah he was CEO of a construction company (He has said on stream he lost his construction job and had debts to pay) he signed fake documents claiming 90% of the work had been done but inspectors said they'd done fuck all and banned them for 5 years.  I assume the debt is legal fees as the company got shutdown.
---
I currently don't have any plans to make a spreadsheet - there are plenty of people more experienced than me doing that already. I'd suggest looking for Agamemnoth's spreadsheet, which is what I'll be basing some of my future calculation's on.
---
Delayed animation. That's literally it. The actual attack and damage was applied as he got trapped. This is/was a common visual bug. Sky isn't falling.
---
Alternate reality where Omar becomes the king of SW. I dig it.
---
False. The Night's King exists in the books but as a lore character. He made sacrifices to the others and then disappeared. It's not exactly spelled out but it's easy to assume that he joined them.
---
But yes, the physical representation and him being the big kahuna from long long ago isn't in the books.
---
Yeah but I just can’t make a promise to a guild at all really it completely varies from week to week but even then I just think a chilled out experience mainly focusing on pvp which can be done any time any day would be cool and be known on the server for just being a group who can help Hank players for you etc
---
&gt; Cheers, hopefully I'm not on your server on Classic.
---
You won't be. I'm gonna go out of my way to avoid streamer servers, and it seems like you'll go out of your way to get on there so you can be another sycophant.
---
I didn't think Gamon's kick was in vanilla, but I didn't play then so I'm not sure. In wotlk you could use kick on the auctioneers and it would close the auction window for everyone using it. You could kick afk people of the fp tower but it would be just short of killing them.
---
I’d rather they be more productive than policing all of the streaming platforms to keep an eye on every player to see if they are trying to stream on a “stream free” server.
---
Not in PvP
---
You can't say "STREAMERS ONLY" when it is about minority of players who are. If you want to round up use a number atleast. Alliance are just a bunch of old people who used to play the game a long time ago is all I can tell from my interactions with other players.
---
They banned a guy on beta for standing around in the streamer dueling tournament.
---
&gt;Never expected to get an official wow classic server.
---
And yet you wish to pollute it before it even releases.
---
Maybe enjoy a good thing for what it is when it comes, instead of finding new and creative ways to tarnish and diminish it.
---
I mean if you're shitting yourself you don't really have to BRB, the deed is already done
---
Yea I know it's a strat, but everytime they got feared they would literally just path 1 direction directly away from the flag and couldn't stop the flee. I know it wasn't Snutz's intention - that's just how it was worded in the rulebook. 
---
Soda didn't lose a game to it, but he blew all of his CD'S and when they got reset it fucked him over. It only happened to Cdew once and he wouldn't have fled, but he got feared out of game bounds and DC'd
---
Dude this is SO good. I would love to commission one if you ever decide to do that.
---
As the other guy said more boss hits don't mean anything if one hit deals only a little damage and it's possible that privateservers are overtuned compared to classic. Regardless of that raids are gonna  be so easy that most guilds will never have any difficulties if people just farm the correct gear and consumables
---
Yeah that's fair enough. I think that's pretty controversial, but Blizzard decided to be merciful about it by just moving him out of the zone. I know they used to suspend your account for an increasing amount of time per violation before banning you, and I think think that's a pretty good policy. I would know, I was suspended for 24 hours for using cheat engine a long time ago.
---
Camping someone for an hr isnt griefing.  Havent you played vanilla before?
---
I actually ran an all rogue/druid guild back in vanilla for a while that was just like that.
---
It was a lot of fun getting that many stealth characters together to mess with the Alliance. The problem that I ran into, though, is that players have fun with it, but before long will leave for more traditional guilds to have a core of people to run instances and stuff with. It felt like I had to be constantly trying to recruit people otherwise the population kept dropping off.
---
Maybe not a favorite (and I started in early to mid wrath, so I didnt have a lot of time to see them....16ish months), but I actually just did a questline in the wetlands this weekend on an alt (cursed sailors) and found out it's a big reference to an old questline.  Cant wait to see that one now and find out the exact details. I probably even did it in Wrath, but didnt read quest text and/or forgot about it with my shitty memory.
---
Then we potentially get the choice of having 10 hour queues or free transfer toba realm we didn't play at launch and is probably dead! Hooray!
---
long story short, he had something on his desktop with his RL name on stream and then people googled it and found info about him, so lesson learnt, clean your desktop before streaming, but yeah he was CEO of a construction company (He has said on stream he lost his construction job and had debts to pay) he signed fake documents claiming 90% of the work had been done claiming payments for $80k but inspectors said they'd done fuck all and banned them for 5 years.  I assume the debt is legal fees as the company got shutdown. but yeah some pretty big fraud.
---
It honestly terrifies me that people like yourself exist out in the world.
---
Rage generation on private servers is incorrect. You get roughly 5-6 rage per hit low level instead of the 7-8 rage per hit on the beta, which means you have to autoattack significantly more in order to use abilities. The 2 rage difference may not seem big, but it’s the difference between having to attack 3-4 times per heroic strike vs having to attack twice per heroic strike.
---
Right, and neither is jumping around.
---
It was a thing, but the whole “perfectly timing” auto attacks part of it was always greatly exaggerated.  
---
Mostly it was deadzoning hunters and lining up *mortal strikes* to be in range at the right time
---
Someone suggested that you get the "bfa" talent tree when you hit 60, and use the old tree 1-59. A system like that seems good.
---
And yeah, I get what you're saying, but I'd rather them do new content with that idea since it's fresher and more flexible. The hardcore no changes crowd would want just a regular remake anyway.
---
The only class that out dps hunters were rogues.
---
You can check any of the private servers raid logs and without the buff warriors got right before BC like I said only rogues beat hunters, with their buffs there were some warriors who could get up there.
---
Hunters would always be 3rd - 6th place if not for the rogues or the warriors after they were buffed.
---
Meeting stones also dont summon in classic, so u gotta run all the time^^
---
Bear isn't too bad with swipe spam.
---
But yeah, druids really lack aoe like a mage does, or a warrior/prot paladin with something like Skullflame shield.
---
Buff doesnt cut it. Your dps will be trash and you wont tank anything in progress.
---
9 hours plus mild farm time will take less overall effort and time than getting R12-14 in PvP. And it’ll be more laid back. Farm some herbs while watching your favorite show and relax.
---
Because the server population compared to the millions of accounts are equal...
---
Not only weapon. I mean armors too &gt;_&lt;. In tbc, pvp requires pvp gear but I don’t know if that’s the case in vanilla.
---
i mean 5 years from now , doesn't have to be immediate. Gonna milk vanilla wow for years before i get sick of it
---
Now he deleted it LUL - busted
---
If you cant handle big boy responses you should avoid M rated games ;)!
---
All classes pretty much have trouble with green/blue gear on at SM level or above, even paladins.
---
Same reason cdew lost as well, he got kited and went oom from shocking, shielding and using totems.
---
I could see the argument for loot hoarding if prio went past tank gear but it doesn’t.
---
How am I not offering anything? I will be tanking all our raids. Will be running those raids and helping others get raid ready by tanking dungeons. While our guild as a whole plans on raiding casually, I plan on playing pretty hard core. 
---
That being said it’s not about deserving the priority. It’s about giving our team as a whole the best shot at downing bosses as a team.
---
You level ret and that's it. Nothing else to say on the topic.
---
If you don't see me, just send me a mail!  And you can start leveling without me as well if I can't make it tonight, I'll be in touch!
---
Have fun in the beta, beta.
---
Without a jaw, naturally.
---
I will, thank you!
---
Almost all Duskwood quests (the worgen one wasn't really interesting), Stalvan, Morladim, the scythe of elune, those 3 are my favorite quests, 2 of those quests have you traveling through a lot of zones
---
lol most hunters I knew and myself included were glass cannons from what I recall and damn the dots to hell :p
---
I think I had 3k health maybe 3.3k ? and almost 1300AP unbuffed with  like 28 or 33% crit and was hit capped back then and it felt good.
---
Yeah I actually probably wouldn't mind beefydps I just couldn't think of an actual trash name haha
---
I knew some of these but not all of it. I will be writing it all down. I appreicate your effort, thank you!
---
B-but he missed the jump in WC!!! BabyRage
---
I could only find a screenshot from BC but the pain was still present I assure you.
---

---
SM is a AoE farming instince.  Other instances are about quick killing bosses to vendor their drops.  For instance I used to farm 2 BRD bosses over and over again with my warrior just to vendor the loot drops by skipping most of the mobs
---
If you're going to do farming you should stealth using cat to hit the bosses directly, or use bear to AoE tank the mobs down with swipe and thorns.  Experiment to find your maximum pull size and the best combos with your class.
---
I can tell you it definitely seems big
---
that is true, anyway its a no win scenario in general.  there's a reason why most private servers end up with alot of inflation, hopefully its something they can address post launch or post naxx
---
All of them essentially making your experience equivalent to a fucking retadin.
---
If that's your cup of tea go ahead, but it's a boring as hell way to play.
---
Yea you gotta really project those things. Gotta yell from the gut. Really channel that inner rage monster and hulk out.
---
Breaking ToS to jump outside the map. Also breaking ToS by communication cross faction to organize it. But hey, one guy was there jumping around and he's the real problem.
---
You have to understand, these off specs are significantly weaker in terms of DPS. It's not like you'll be doing 5% less and all will be well.. You'll be doing 25-40% less damage.
---
By playing an offspec you're asking everyone else to work harder to make up for your willing choice to play a spec you know is MUCH weaker. And then you're asking for gear that will provide much more of a boost for other classes.
---
It's fun to say we should get away from the meta but... retail does that much better.
---

---
Orcs are awesome wys
---
She's hanging out upstairs in a house in epl/wpl  iirc
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Dps won't be trash compared to having a 2nd prot warrior, and AFAIK their aoe is better than a warrior's pretty much at all times excluding thunderfury.
---
Oh snap. No way for me to come back from this one will go now bye.
---
yeah but then you have to group with pink twirly moustached gnomes
---
If you follow Hakurai’s leveling guide then leveling a warrior is honestly not bad even with the awful rage generation on pservers. He does a pretty good job of keeping you on an easy route so you won’t have to deal with fighting mobs above your level, which is when warriors really tend to have a problem.
---
even after 3-5 years have passed?
---
Nah, kiting mobs around earth bind &amp; shocking keep it far more interesting. I will probs end up taking stormstrike though to pair with windfury and be a bit more inefficient.
---
Although unlikely to happen, the opportunity is there for them. They can easily make up a story based around Nozdormu showing up and saying the timeline is all wrong and needs to be amended. A lot of people have expressed that as time went on the quality of the game in general went downhill (I stopped playing in TBC so I cant comment) so thats a way for them to re-evaluate what went wrong and how it can be improved.
---
Yeah, would be cool. 
---
They should expand horizontally, not vertically with expansions though.
---
Yup. Wall jumping outside the map? Against ToS. Cross Faction communication? Against ToS. Jumping around in this ToS breaking tournament? Clearly Blizzard needs to intervene on that guy.
---
Helps prevent blood clots in those long gaming sessions...
---
I’d be open to it if they did something much smaller than TBC. This is all assuming it’s years down the road. Something that stays in the current world just adds to it. I really enjoyed TBC, but hated to see the entire world I played in for years just get set aside.
---
It seems like that type of crew may work out better as a Discord community or something.
---
Yeah! Read the quest texts man. NECESSARY for classic, they DO NOT feed you easy to find info.  They will give you vague directions like. "Head to Derbyshire, Its the farm out east." BTW&lt; there are 4 farms out east, and the NOT shimmery quest item is on a spawn timer. You may have to make several trips into the right Barn before you can loot the thing.
---
yeah i agree he should not be banned even if he is a dipshit.
---
something like teso would be cool, i don't want them fucking up with the numbers anymore. Maybe add classes that's it keep the core of vanilla as vanilla
---
yeah soda is crazy skilled at druid, don't think there's any question
---
Ouch.
---
Shaman dispells two buffs per cast, priest one.
---
Fair point I forgot about that. According to [this](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dueling) that should work, but if a duelist flags up mid duel then you grab the tag as well. Pretty easy to DQ that to regulate though. 
---
Just have to find out if /duel opposite faction actually works in Beta. I asked Pikaboo and he said he's pretty sure it doesn't work.
---
Soooooooooo much waiting.
---
So, the game won’t start your auto attack after your first SS automatically??
---
Good luck, make sure to tell me how it goes when classic releases! 😅
---
Question: Do jawless undead in RP servers just gurgle incoherently?
---
Never got to do this instance, stoked on it
---
OIt's moderate, I suppose. All my life Ive had dysgraphia, which has ended with some...interesting results. I was super relaint on my right hand. Then I fucking rolled nat -20 and stroked out in my sleep @ 23 y/o.. Affected my right side. Ive largely recovered and had to learn to use my left side for a while. So its dfficult but workable. I have ful+ contrl of my left side and a nice Razer keypad so keybinds anret a real issue. Its my mouse movements but WoW is actually one of the few games I used to play (along with Runescape) where due to the targeting system and such I actuallly can at least function slightly above average )of the populace) if I focus and practice. 
---
It will be harder for me than a normal person but I think I will be able to do it. Of course, Im reserving 3 toons on the 13-14th ill eventually level (i mean I have up to 100+ free hours a week and all I play rn is Hearthstone)  Priest (have a history of healing mostly), mage, and Hunter
---
But I appreciate you efforts to help. If I cant do it, I cant. But pvp isnt everything and I used to love my old hunters so I dont want to give up yet!
---
It is already happening. Spells may be batched, but movement (sort of) isn't. So if you are running away from someone OOC but you want to get a food or drink tick while continuing to move, you can ideally cast the food or drink tick at the end of one tick (stopping you for a brief moment), then after the tick goes through with food or drink, you can immediately start moving again.

Upvoted and followed your stream :)

Good luck with your journey, thanks for this post and i hope to see you in Azeroth!
---
Thanks haha yeah its been a real stickler in my side :P
---
If you have better gear you will be almost twice as powerful
---
&gt; Or, we can continue to ask blizz for a few streaming free servers where we are guaranteed not to have to deal with it.
---
this is the most retarded crap i've heard. how on earth are they going to police this? what about the dudes with only a few hundred viewers? there's only literally two streamers you need to avoid: Asmongold and Sodapoppin. everyone else won't be an issue. if you're EU, you only need to worry about &lt;APES&gt;.
---
Thank you I will bookmark it!
---
Not listening to your mother is rude and inconsiderate.
---
ill be sure to do that, I appreciate your help!
---
Are you trying to be a tank or just dps? Dps doable bit if you're trying to be a main or off tank I'd say no. You have to be one of the most dedicated players to fill that role/make sure you make every raid night. Guilds will funnel the gear to you and if you miss a night it could really cause problems for your guild.
---
I remember when cell phones were touted as the device you’d never get sales calls on, too....enjoy it while it lasts haha
---
How much better we talking?
---
Lol alrightly Ill make sure to look it up :P
---
Shamans are just as good, if not straight out better in WSG. But it is a class that is much harder to play for sure.
---
Is that true? Memory is foggy, but I thought for sure Fighting for the BRD summoning stone was a thing People did. I defiantly spent dozens of hours MCing idiots into the lava.
---
I mean like 2-3x better. Maybe more haha

EK definitely has the best dungeons, by a distance.
---
You're saying it as if you'd scour every single quest, mob, and zone for bugs. Keep being salty because you didn't get invited.
---
Sorry, I meant how much better gear. Pre-raid? MC / BWL? Naxx gear?
---
hunter is the best class to run any dungeon 
---
eyes of beast and use pet to aggro eerything, mobs cant damage pet because every attack will be a miss or dodge
---
Pre-raid will be twice as powerful. The 3x+ is the later gear
---
Thorns, DoTs, Rejuv, Hurricane, Bear swipe if not dead after Hurricane. Should be a pretty effective method
---
Truth
---
I don't think DM will be out at release?
---
That feel when the biggest star of their last "community event" was some lvl1 tauren guy just derping around.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about. Shadow priest in BG is one of the purest fun I had in vanilla WoW and WoW in general.
---
You absolutely have crazy utility, you melt faces and you are insanely tanky.
---
Not to mention the ton of dkp a tank will hoard to "steal" the shared dps and tanking items, like band of accuria, DFT, Onslaught girdle, among many more. the dps will just salt harder and harder and leave for greener pasteries when tanks gets to horde the dkp because there is no competition among the tanks.
---
Where did you learn all this mate?
---
They aren’t brought to premades, but casual I’m sure they are fine.
---
I really like the Alliance Onyxia attunement chain. Well except Jailbreak. I shudder the thought of doing that over and over and over again helping guild mates attune. 😬
---
Gotcha, yeah with a big population there will be worse.
---
whaaaaat you still have your gems? when I logged in all my gems, enchants, etc were gone.
---
False. The Night's King is a separate entity from the Night King. The Night King in the show was created by the Children of the Forest with a Dragonglass dagger. The Night's King in the books was the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch who ended up 'marrying' a White Walker woman.
---
Why? People will get punished.
---
NP, If you aren't worried about PVP hunters are hella easy to play in solo play. That being said if you want to raid on one. Just make sure you can kite because as a raiding class hunters are not brought as a dps. They are brought as a "support" of sorts where they are primarily valued for kiting.
---
If you do decide a hunter is too much to manage. I would look into a priest. They don't use a lot of buttons to raid and in pvp you can reroll shadow. Which is hyper strong and very easy and straight forward. Good luck with hunter though. Hope you can pull it off!
---
If you plan to play a 'Feral Druid' you will be in for a rough time.
---
If you plan to play a 'Druid', and use it to its fullest with a focus on feral, then it will be much better.
---
I don't see many talking about the Hearthstone-bait that Tauren have over Orc/Troll.  Seems from PvP videos that Tauren make the successful bait pretty frequently.  Maybe noob/levelling allies would fall for it, but likely not in 60 BGs or WPvP
---
:/ ye I was worried about that but that’s why I’d hopefully get people like me who don’t mind taking it slower
---
he's referencing to when tips claimed to be the best warrior in NA back in the day
---
Found the incel 😂
---
Feral is decent for dungeon farming. On big pulls you could try bear form and swipe.
---
yeah, i like the 20/31 - covers all the 5-man bases, and i always lover AoE grinding / soloing stuff like that.
---
You mean getting better servers and internet was a terrible decision?
---
Yeah, you are right about that.  Undead Sylvanas and the rest of that gets established in TFT.
---
seems like that’s what i’m gonna do, if i decide against rolling rogue
---
Wait, do you have a source for this? I went looking for one and couldn't find it.
---
it's much less effective. any time i go in for an attack i get hit 3 times. it's only really useful if you need to let your rend finish them
---
Nah pvp armor is the same as raid/dungeon armor in the sense that theres no resilience or anything  however pvp gear starts with pretty high stats, but yeah other gear can be comparable
---
great
---
Real pros bought the $50 Battle.NET gift cards off Amazon when they were $40.15 two weeks ago.
---
All correct. As a hunter I kited every warrior I ran into to death.  I never lost a 1 on 1 with a warrior that I can remember.  But a warrior + pally? I was in for some pain.  Warriors are PvP gods with a healer.  Without, they're kite meat.
---
Is there a list of beta realm names?
---
Truly a master of the craft
---
The guy won the tournament wanding, also he's a blizzcon winner, who you again? Ah that triggered scrub from reddit.
---
I'll read the books any day over playing the games. I enjoy the writing style.
---
Yeah but let’s not compare mmo griefing to rl. Pretty disingenuous, like you said. Most people aren’t gonna go to the Bronx and yell obscenities at people. 
---
There are a subset of people who enjoy griefing in MMO’s always have been always will be. They pay the same money everyone else does. I won’t lie I enjoy it time to time. Gank a lowbie here or there. Hell in TBC on my hunter I got real kicks out of MD’ing Drek onto my own faction. Even better when the person got real mad and sent me hate tells. Even more fun when they made a toon on my realm just to send me hate tells.
---
You are wasting your play time to send someone hate tells. Says more about you than them. I wouldn’t do that, don’t get why someone else would.
---
If I had known having friends could have this kind of benefit, I would have put in the time to get at least one...
---
Something that WoW and other MMOs with power creep *could* do is to actually space their expansions appropriately. I just remember Naxx being cleared for barely a few months before TBC launched. That's insane. Let the expansion ripen into old age before blowing it up.
---
I'd bet my mage against your hunter any day.
---
The realest pros purchased a surplus of 60 day game cards back in 2005 and have been sitting on them for the past decade waiting for this moment.
---
Man Dwarf Hunters were an animation mess on the beta.
---
If you Strafed Left while shooting a mob, you ran backwards in the walk-backwards animation, making it look like you were speed hacking haha.
---
Strafing right was better, but it still seemed off.
---
Check Shedothedruid on youtube
---
I'm planning to level my rogue with daggers, because that will be my rogue's identity. Classic all about the journey and building your character from nothing. Efficiency be damned I'm a D/D rogue. (Pvp @60)
---
I was tauren over this myself for a while.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about the racials because both Hardiness and War Stomp are amazing and any statistical differences are going to be minimal. Things like the model, size, animations, etc. should take priority cause you're going to be looking at the character for potentially hundreds of hours. 
---
That's obviously a subjective thing, but for me I find tauren too clunky and sluggish compared to orcs. Plus I don't like the scratching.
---
WOW isn't m-rated, cockbag. Suggesting suicide is illegal, cockbag. Welcome to the real world where there's consequences, cockbag.  
---
I mean, in the real world I'd have just punched you in your face for saying it. Which would you prefer? Reporting? Or your face getting caved in by someone three times your size?
---
Was it? I thought the actual tournament was very entertaining
---
Yes the announced the names but nobody is interested so there's no threads about the names or picks.
---
I'm so glad I know most dungeons from back then.
---
I actually farmed up Dragon's Call with a friend so I know Sunken Temple really well. Mara I'm pretty sure I still know. Every time I have to do The Oculus I know exactly what to do and where to go from doing achievements in WotLK.
---
I know the layouts of U/LBRS and BRD but the different events and triggers in BRD still get me sometimes.
---
If it takes away another player's enjoyment of the game, its griefing. You can call it whatever you'd like. Blizzard's stance on it isn't changing. "Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions." In this case, the tauren was doing it for more than 4+ hours in front of over 100k viewers.
---
Hi, /u/Altnob
---
%?
---
As a Hunter main yes, mages are better in every way when it comes to farming low level dungeons.
---
AoE capabilities: Hurricane+Barkskin says hello!

300-400&lt;insert currency&gt; will buy you a pc that can run the game.

&gt; Breaking ToS to jump outside the map. Also breaking ToS by communication cross faction to organize it.
---
lmao you must be a blast at parties
---
i dont think u should consider the amount u play when choosing a class.
---
do what u enjoy best,  be aware warriors are slow to level and need alot of food/a healer to support them to reach full potential.
---
If you dont mind that, it doesnt matter if u play 1 or 10hours a day
---
I stopped playing at the start of cataclysm. I bought the game, installed, played a week or two and just knew it was the time.
---
Wow that is excellent! You have some real talent!
---
No, it’s absolute ass. Only the best can grind it out! Then you hit lvl max and you start lifting fat weight until you make the fucking hulk look like a green Santa gnome! ONLY THEN CAN YOU SWING YOUR MASSIVE DICK AROUND AND SOLO RAG!
---
This is a very interesting DKP system. I’ve never heard of it but it’s I like it. Thanks for sharing!
---
Model editing for years was something Blizzard looked the other way on. 
---
However, in addition to just swapping models, some people were using client-side edits to create in-game shortcuts or advantages for themselves. 
---
In light of this, they recently issued mass bans; including against those who had innocuous model edits. Many of those bans were overturned, but with the stipulation that they will not differentiate between innocuous and malicious model edits from now on. 
---
So, essentially, up until recently you could've gotten away with it, but nowadays it's not worth the risk.
---
How can one be parried by a snake, a creature with no weapon, or hands for that matter? It’s WoW logic.
---
PUBG Car horn all over again
---
Jeez man, I bet you must be fun at parties.
---
I was playing with mage and bear on PTR-alike server and tried SM runs some time ago. With feral just stealth to boss and handle it. Problems do show up with multiple mobs - level advantage etc gives crits which give rage (talent) and that can be turned into that front AoE spam - with good flow of rage it's doable but I did died few times - casters get annoying etc. Just stealth and move to bosses and if you have to pull - try to not overdue it. Get the loot, vendor or DE it.
---
Comparing mage to that - no stealth so has to process mobs and even SM:Lib vs \~tier 2 mage is dangerous if you let them hit you so you have to be agile - but if you are good you can even go farm minor mobs in BRD or LBRS. In low level dungeons AoE allows efficient trash clearing thus getting cloth, BoE if applicable. Bear can tank the hits, while mage works only if it snairs and slows work and you manage to avoid being hit (and gear helps as usual).
---
You'll be the lowest dps in the raid until phase 3 but you'll help your raid a bunch with a Warlock.
---
You can always just invite them to see them on your layer.
---
I speculate that the players who join a casual guild will be more interested in fair loot distribution and less interested in faster progression.  So this loot system will not align with the members' goals and values.  
---
As you say, you're open and honest about this up front, so people are free to not join if they don't like it.  Even so, I don't think the loot system will be sustainable.  That's just my speculation--you can do whatever you want of course.
---
I mostly do this at lower levels so I dont have to right click and can start auto attacking at range. I dont recall if you start auto attacking with ability use in Vanilla. Also if I switch mobs I can use this macro to begin the auto attack on the 2nd mob without right clicking.

Fuckin Jimmy man

HAHA HORDE LOSERS KNOW NOTHING OF LEVELING WEAPON SKILLS IN DEEPRUN TRAM ON RATS
---
Same for survival. You don't have to "cherry pick your gear", everybody does that, it's called BiS gear. BiS gear for survival puts you nowhere near top 10, you likely won't even see top 15.
---
People were shit in vanilla, and had no idea what they were doing. You could get high DPS just by not being bad. This isn't the case anymore.
---
Which is exactly what I was saying. The books only allude to him joining them. The whole backstory of him being created by the children of the forest and basically the source of the walkers doesn't exist in the books.
---
I mean if the layers are as big as they say and respawns are vanilla like it might be harder than 15k pserver launches.
---
It's not uncommon for Wool to cost about 1g a stack, that's what it's even going for on the Beta server now. Linen is very cheap but of course it's a very low level product, you can vendor it or you can actually use it to sell bags, or make low level Tailoring greens and disenchant to make wands out of which will sell really well at server launch.
---
Nah, not really. If you'd simply taken that $30 and put it into a 2005 bond, you'd have ~$50 today, which would have bought you almost twice the game time.
---
They still have plenty of time to learn while leveling when classic hits. When you want to know what a class feels like at max level...you need to play it at max level.
---
Aww poor little sensitive incel upset now? Do you run to your mom when someone calls you gay too? Lmfao 😂!

---
I leveled as Holy in both Vanilla and BC. It was a slow as hell slog but my survivability was crazy good. I made my paladin to heal and that's exactly what I did the whole way through.
---
Though I did use a different spec while leveling than what I changed to once I hit 60. Looking forward to it, while catching up on some anime or something while I auto attack stuff to death. Can't believe I did all that back when I only had one tiny monitor.

Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClB5278A2xo
---
Tanking is easy. You can just blame the healers if you die.
---
Healthstones, soulstones, summons.
---
Unless you get way ahead of the pack initially.
---
i enjoyed BC the most.
---
Classic is the second best in my mind but i will still play the heck out of it.
---
Wotlk was third for me, and i would still play/love the shit out of that addon.
---
i think the raidfinder in cata just made everything "who cares" for me, while before it only a few choosen ones slayed all those monsters (atleast it felt like that)
---
I heard this was the case at launch at least
---
Summons, healthstones, soul stones, detect invisibility. 
---
Pet abilities such as dispelling magic, interrupts, seduce, 5% Stam buff, tanking pet.
---
Niche stuff like unending breath. 
---
Tons of utility.
---
From the sound of it most streamer will probably be preparing for lvl 40 cap. so I imagine this will give them plenty to do.
---
I always had rank 1 earth shock on my shaman hotkeyed. Sometimes the interrupt is more important than the damage especially if mana is an issue(which as a shaman it always is hah).
---
Asmon did the fraud or Tipsout?
---
Is this the “weapon skill is your fishing level” thing? 
---
Is that intended or a bug lol
---
And fits in a herbalist pouch.
---
Wtf is this casual strategy. Should have put that $30 into bitcoin in 2009 and bought thousands of years of sub time in 2016.
---
Payo might be the funniest WoW streamer rn
---
Tips.
---
POGGERS PogU
---
Hmm, wonder if speed enchants, skills, item effects, and procs all stack to get some temporary insane speed to where people think your speed hacking for a sec. Lol
---
If there are no news of reforged you should probably play the old version in august imo
---
Press x to doubt
---
McConnell deleted his character and then restored it.
---
I have no evidence other than it's what McConnell would do
---
It could be. It feels to me though that as I play, I like the feeling I get knowing that my SOR is hitting harder rather than not losing casting time with SF. That's part of what makes classic great though.. minor differences in build based off what you think makes you stronger.
---
Lmfao he jumped on his bed
---
I love streamers like him for one thing: the people they troll with their antics
---
Like I love seeing ppl be like "payo is so whiny" bahahah u got whooshed son
---
Classic Mages know, if he tries to run you cast arcane missiles and pray for Carnage.
---
If you're 100% sure you're gonna stay 2h Fury, I'd say the mace is pretty comparable. 
---
+0.1 dps, +0.8% hit (effectively), and +0.2% crit **VS** 9 top end dmg. 
---
But Arms Axe Skill &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mace skill, so you're probably right.
---
The three most invited classes in original wow are in this order, Healers -&gt; Tanks -&gt; Warlocks -&gt; Everything Else.
---
Tanks and Healers are required, warlocks are convenient, everything else is just replaceable by anything else and not special.  If you wanted to play a dps, you really will find groups easier to get into as a warlock than say another class.   You will also find the two least desired classes in pug groups will tend to be rogues and hunters.  As unskilled melee is well... Really really bad in vanilla.  And hunters are a dime a dozen.  With most of the dozen being rotten eggs.
---
Ohhh nice snarky reddit reply, you think that millions of people with 04-05 accounts subbed and opted in on the Tuesday it became an option in account management?  lol.
---
There's a pattern to going through it. I can't remember the pattern exactly, but it was something like go up stairs, up again, then down, then up, then down, then down, then up...so like 2 ups in a row, then up-down for a little bit, then two downs in a row.
---
Or something like that. I honestly forget. But I remember being able to lead groups through it faster because I knew the pattern.
---
Just sort and filter it around and check out Nharz the Orc Hunter to see what a hunter could really do ;)
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
Hunters are pretty fantastic in vanilla PvP. At least 31 MM 20 surv hunters. You can 1v1 basically any class except SL locks and shadowpriests
---
Only to lose your fucking wallet when you built a new PC and Bitcoin was still worthless.
---
God damn, I hate thinking about that money I just threw away.
---
When the T0 armor sets from classic dungeons were removed and you couldnt do the quests for them anymore. I was heartbroken.
---
Then, all of the rare world drop blacksmithing recipies from the vanilla zones were put on trainers. My old world blacksmithing business evaporated OVERNIGHT. I was furious, distraught, and quit.
---
God reading the comments on this thread is depressing.  I guess its just like IRL where we must smear anyone's character if they are in the news in any way.  Jesus.  
---
Real talk, the duel tourney was awesome and some of the most fun things i've seen on twitch.  Sure it was annoying as hell that idiots were sitting on totems effecting the cdew matches, or scattershotting random alliance, but not bad for a community event.  Also that trollgodx guy is a legend now lol.
---
high end arena players is an understatement.  
---
they're all previous world champions. And for someone so skilled at the game Venruki is insanely humble.
---
I think its ridiculous to say that wanting gear to go where it benefits the raid as a whole is greed in the same sense as someone who literally wants every piece to himself, or only wants pvp gear or something. 
---
It is definitely not impossible to be objective. I dont know how you can even make such an assertion. Ppl like DKP systems because they are objective. 
---
I just... your comment is just absurd to me. I suppose you have never experienced a good loot council.
---
Personally I want the unarmored mounts to be permanently available
---
You’re right. Don’t let these fools tell you otherwise. This video of a ten man Gnomergan run was posted in 2006. They got both xp and loot. https://youtu.be/shlghS5psDo
---
Curses should count too, and banish comes in handy every now and then
---
Thanks for reply. What I meant was, if it is only on the initial hit for Flamestrike and especially Blizzard (being another channeled spell), it might be the same for Arcane Missiles, rather than on ticks of damage. Of course, like another comment said, it would be pretty bad design for the arcane tree to not even synergize with itself and arcane missiles. But everywhere I've read about this topic, people have had different convictions on it, so I'm hoping someone from beta can confirm or deny.
---
I'll definitely be trying out 2h vs dual wield. in my playing so far, ive noticed that i still have a fair amount of misses with a 2h, and it feels like i have wasted a huge amount of threat when i miss with a two hander. but a fast 2h seems like a good balance. What enchants do you recommend? since hunter gear sometimes gets +% to hit, i may need some for threat. at least enough so that distracting shot never misses.
---
I think you're right about the wolf. With a 2h, wolf boosted raptor strike crit you get big hate.  Sadly, my group is stuck on alliance, do you think the night elf +1 dodge is better than the stoneform armor? Thanks for your feedback.

They shouldnt, they have been testing layers to avoid that, you can argue they are going to fumble it, but at least they are trying and i trust theyll have it working by release.
---
Ah fair enough, happens. I've played every class but hunter and druid to 2k+ rating, most to 2.2, my max being 2.5kish on a few. That is from everything from Wrath to legion and bfa. I quit in the last one tho, gosh they messed things up.
---
Arena is definitely not simple, that's one reason i love it - It and Sc2 are my favorite games, where I'm a masters 3 to masters 1 depending on season and race (not below masters 3 with any tho).
---
I'm rather qualify to have an educated opinion on it if i do say so myself. Certainly not as much as actual pro players, but more than most. The reason i hold the opinion all the same is that there are a lot of details in vanilla that were lost over the course of the game, like the jump timing trick against warrior charge - just as an example. Arena is certainly more of a competitive game than vanilla, but that is in large part due to the streamlining of classes (everyone can do anything, especially nowadays - stuns, cc, heals, they all have it - not sure if you've played legion/bfa? It was somewhat true in MoP aswell iirc, tho defo less so). Perhaps you could make the case that wrath was the most mechanically complex, since the streamlining mostly happened in cata, but i would defo not write vanilla off.

They middle of the road but, thats not my point. My point was that they have a very high skill floor. A mage can repeatedly mess up and easily reset. Very few training wheels on a Hunter. You fuck up you die.

I think the attack logically had already happened before he got frozen, but the visual for the attack was still pending, if that makes any sense.
---
"PVP Leveling Spec" isn't a thing. Go BM until level 60.
---
Yes, but when you mind control something it becomes friendly does it not? Like a pet basically.
---
&gt;Nobody thought that Mages would make it very far
---
What

In Vanilla, travel time matters a ton. Every party wants a soulstone for wipes. Summoning portals save time, too.
---
They both dispel 2
---
Hey evey one it's literal Monday! Hoo ray! Oh darn wait a sec ond, that's every day on red dit!
---
Good point. Curses are the epitome of support in raids. Banish is invaluable as well. 
---
Warlocks are probably the pure dps class with the most utility, they bring so much to a raid.
---
Great article!
---
Anyone know how to research questions like this on the internet? 🤔
---
A buff to prevent death (guardian spirit) is a different situation than a heal. Since the player would not gain the buff until the batch is processed, any lethal damage during that batch window will kill, since he didn't have the buff active at the time of the damage. Healing and damage will directly offset each other.
---
All I can tell you is that I assure you it does not feel unresponsive at all. I've done a fair bit of PVP now on beta and never had any issue with it. In fact it feels just like private servers on which people have been doing very ["responsive" pvp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkkyIVt5PlU&amp;t=10m43s) for years and years.
---
Known for its rare mounts. Deathcharger Reins is 0.02% drop chance in classic. ZG tiger &amp; raptor mount also have low drop chance. However, unique model dropped mounts there are none :/
---
Wands will definitely sell well.  You pretty much are mandated to have one as a priest.  It speeds up kill time at level 5 so much too.
---
So you don't know its true? Would people just go on the internet and lie?! /s
---
The problem with you analysis is that premade vs. premade is not the correct analysis to use in vanilla/Classic PvP because premades are going to be avoiding each other like the plague. Shaman is a superior support for quickly annihilating/demoralizing an opposing PuG and establishing dominance in a battleground. Only another premade is going to survive the targeted burst of an elemental shaman and a geared warrior connecting with targets.
---
Shamans aren't as good if two equally geared and skilled premades are clashing. That is also the condition premades do everything in their power to avoid. Shamans are better are doing what premades want to do - quickly annihilating PuGs and farming more honor per hour.
---
So you're right, but you're basically wrong.
---
Top priority on an F&amp;F list, got my invite today
---
"Dkp for everyone except me who gets everything I need" it's like your raid is a constant "reserved" pug with your entire bis table reserved.
---
I feel this is a solid guide. Upvotes for you.
---
How dare he go against the mafia
---
It doesn't surprise me that you can't follow, you don't seem particularly smart either. I hope you don't end up leading anything.
---
The people I know are the main factor, but relatively lower pop is better for me. Less node issues, more familiarity.
---
thanks for the advice about the weapons, downing Onyxia would probably be easy enough, do you have any advice on BiS from dungeons or pre-raiding? Yeah im stil trying to solve the oom issue, rank 1 wing clip for procs seems like a decent enough strategy while waiting for raptor strike, mongoose and counter attack. I'm gonna need mana potions.
---
I'll give wyvern sting a try, the stun from intimidate has definitely saved me.
---
&gt; you have to accept the bad alongside the good
---
No you don't. Excessive griefing was/is bannable in Vanilla WoW, current WoW, almost all private WoW servers, and basically every multiplayer game ever.
---
There is no inherent "if a community wants to X, Y will also happen." It's perfectly possible for a community and/or game developer to take actions against sociopaths who only want to get their rocks off causing misery to others.
---
There's nothing wrong with getting enjoyment from proving you're better than someone else at a game (that's the basis for all professional sports). But you can have that without, for example, making a group of 7 year olds play against Barca.
---
Soul stone is huge.
---
It's the equivalent to a battle rez. Put it on your main healer, and you can avoid a wipe.
---
...Your honor
---
not to say the information is wrong, but this guy's channel is full of pizzagate-tier dumbfuckery. wouldnt surprised if this guy is qanon.
---
O0 we are in 100% agreement then. I was talking about high level organized pvp. The average paladin like the average priest is a monkey and has no idea what cleanse or dispel magic does. If we talking pubs. I'll take an ele shaman all day.
---
Man esfand and staysafe have been saying for weeks the beta could use like 1000 more people, especially now that its been out a bit.  How bout we expand that F&amp;F invite list to just cool people like myself and other fine people on this reddit lol.
---
I think Joana's record is around 112 hours, which means you'll need to play roughly 3.7 hours a day and level as efficiently as humanly possible to get there in a month. Considering people are going to be wasting a lot of time on dungeons, BGs, open world pvping, exploring and professions, I think it could easily take a typical player 250-300 hours to hit 60. I imagine for most people that means at least 2 months of playing.
---
Make it rogue + druid.
---
They still are, you just can't complete quests in a dungeon raid (with the exception of UBRS). The only dungeons that are 5-man today are BRD, Strat, Scholo, and Dire Maul.
---
The real TIL is that all the dungeons used to allow 40 man raids.
---

Because he’s a scrub.

You probably don’t even know why they were wanding.

There is a gnome in Stormwind called Tyrion.

every single time you log in:

"hey accept this invite so if we run past eachother today we'll know it!"

---
I mained warlock in vanilla. It's not a support role but it has a lot of auxiliary perks mentioned. They get old once people get lazy and you have to summon then and gather soul stones on your own. I doubt I'll do another one this go around.
---
Hey, After a long hiatus from WoW, I plan on returning for Classic and would like to get into the swing of things. I will be looking for a new guild to join. I played Prot/Fury warrior through Wrath and into Cata when I raided seriously. I was part of just about all realm firsts at the time. I have mostly lost interest in hardcore raiding, but I would love to find a guild that takes things seriously enough to get stuff done. Some interest in PvP is a plus!  
---
**Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Intended Region:** NA
---
**Intended Server:** PvP (PvE is my priority, but I love WPvP and miss it dearly)
---
**Intended Faction:** Horde
---
**Raid Times:** Varies, looking for EST friendly weeknights, but I will explore all options.
---
**Classes(in order from most to least likely):** Fury Warrior, Mage, Prot Warrior, Shadow Priest(would love to play this, but I feel like this will be almost impossible to find a raid spot as.)
---
**Preferred Contact:** PM and we can exchange further contact info
---
ahhh yes utility is the more appropriate word than support lol! thanks for the info
---
Don't want any of them. However, if we were taking the best parts I'd add guild banks, mounts in a tab rather than in bags, and whatever the wardrobe addon they stole from.
---
If you were going to pick one class that brings the absolute most to the table but is still purely meant for damage it is the warlock.  
---
It's also the fasted leveling class in the game when played correctly due to it's pets, it's inherent ability not to run back to the corpse via soulstone, it's self healing and healthstones,  it's quest based mount instead of gold etc etc.
---
It really is a pleasant class to level and fun.  And when you finally max em out, you can gloriously travel to Golshire and unleash hell on all the new players by releasing your control of an infernal which then goes on a sadistic murder spree across the lands of newbies.  ALL SHALL PERISH, BOW TO YOUR DEMON OVERLORD!
---
Oh damn, what happened?
---
No idea if it's intended,but fishing skill = weapon skill so people can level it higher than the weapon skill cap and use a fishing rod.
---
Lol indeed.
---
But we are in a social experiment. That’s why rl matters. In reality, humans are equipped to be social face to face. As ugly as it is, physical persuasion is as valid a tactic as any other over the course of human-human relations. Physical coercion or not, the mmo sandbox offers more ways to be toxic than to stifle toxicity. 
---
It’s just a function of the scenario. Good? Bad? Revealing to the human condition? Who knows. 
---
But it certainly is a diacotomy between persistent online worlds and the persistent world we live in...
---
Whatever you settle on, there will always be a 'Grass is greener on the other side' effect in classic.   That is just how the classes were built.
---
Meanwhile other players are leveling different classes and reporting bugs and shit.
---
They are the marketing department.
---
And presumably don’t have auto attack on your action bar?
---
Bro...if i want to do as much as READ THE QUEST in BfA, my group is already running ahead and clearing half the mobs by the time i finish...and I'm the healer.
---
Ah damn
---
Yeah for sure. I thought I saw somewhere that you couldn’t do this in Beta.
---
Earlier in this thread you reported someone for suggesting that you kill yourself and now you are wishing these streamers would die of cancer. 
---
You are honestly more toxic than they are and clearly half as bright.
---
relax mate. i’ve just had a lot of bad experiences regarding OCE servers that’s all. just tryna enjoy classic to the best of my ability.
---
i’ll just roll on OCE.
---
It absolutely only procs on the first hit. Same with aoe spells. The confusion is with the text in clear casting. AM can and is only good in the beginning for very early leveling . And arcane will only be splashed for secondary with the other talent trees until TBC where arcane could be an actual spec
---
No they like a warrior are poop with bad gear. That being said. I think you can get away with BWL gear but, I'm not 100% on that.
---
Thanks :D
---
I too am worried about the threat. Once I had built enough gear to survive a crit, I started to realize I couldnt hold threat over the heal necessary to keep me up. The balance isn't there. Since then I've been fiddling with gear, dropping +% dodge gear and picking up raw agility. I'm currently prioritizing like this, Defense &gt; Agility &gt; Armor &gt; Stamina. Raw Agility I think is a key factor, since the survival tree gives you a 15% increase with Lightning Reflexes, its basically a talent increasing your dodge, armor, and threat. After this it comes down to control, coordination, and gear. I think theres no way to avoid the bottleneck of damage however.
---
It's surprising you're still hurt and scared like a small toddler. Time to grow up for the big leagues lol!
---
They wish!
---
yeah i read that warlocks can summon an entire party to an area or something like that. i thought it was really interesting. i like having those kinds of small responsibilites in a group rather than being the "main role"
---
oce it is
---
No they are the poo poo
---
No not really. You are much better off playing a mage with pom pyro if you just wanna hit hard once in a while.
---
you got it boss
---
Cause clearly, you don't understand how sarcasm works.
---
So I think the issue is that people misunderstand what the role of the arcane tree is.  It's not a standalone tree like in Modern WoW.  You are not an "Arcane Mage", you are a mage that is specced into arcane/fire, or arcane/frost.  Arcane is a utility tree.  It buffs your efficiency and give you utility skills such as PoM, and Arcane Power, or a silience on your counterspell.  It's not meant to be it's own spec.
---
Arcane Missiles is an arcane spell, but overall it only has niche uses, such as being able to continue doing damage even if the target runs out of line of sight.  But as a main spell, it's not very good.
---
Hello everyone.  I would like to introduce you to Bourbon raiders. We are a casual, family-oriented guild. We plan on finishing all end game content, but at our own pace. We do have a discord and a guild website.
---
Server: PVP, CST. 
---
Raid times: Friday and Saturday 8pm-12am CST.
---
Website: bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.com 
---
Reach me at: Battletag: Breakout#1905 
---
                        Discord: Algammon#1375
---
Thanks guys! I am open for commissions, you can message me here or on Instagram (shieldsarts). These types of ink drawings take me a long time though so expect around $50-100 depending on complexity, amount of characters, etc. If that's cool with you then I look forward to hearing from you!
---
don’t worry mate, after this thread i refuse to dog the boys. i’ll be rolling OCE :)
---
Well over 60% of the wow audience, and an even larger slice of the random bg audience are barely functioning lukewarm iq morons. Someone attempting to complete achievements would be a help to the average team. As achievements generally ask you to do something marginally useful.
---
Yeah, [this](https://symbio.agency/) is where he works now. It's a boutique design agency in Prague.
---
The general rule is dungeons are harder to pug (1) the higher level they are and (2) the further out they are from a popular questing areas of their level. 
---
ST is really bad in that respect since it's a level 50+ dungeon far away from most of the 50+ zones. Most people of that level are spending their time in the Plaguelands, Un'Goro/Silithus and Winterspring. There are some quests in Blasted Lands but it's never very hopping.
---
It'll take me a long time and alot of gear before I have the cajones to convince a full raid to do it. Easier to build one, but even someone crazy like me knows that only warrior can truly MT in this game. It'll be easier in that case to convince people I'm just a crazy, survival melee dps and hide my tanking gear in the bank until my friends log in.
---
They really shine once ZG comes out and if you can get your hands on the trinkets, but until then, they are kinda meh.
---
You would probably run out of breath by the time your fist hit his face.
---
In my exp a prebis ele shammy should do okay/good against any other prebis geared class.
---
You have no idea how many times I've heard stuff just like that lmao yikes
---
Blizzard forgot that somewhere along the way!
---
Priests are good too
---
**&lt;GET HIM A BODYBAG YEEAAHH)** Is an **ORC ONLY** guild currently recruiting other (preferably male but will make the rare exception) orcs. We will be rolling on a PvP server to be determined at a later date, after all realm names are released. The name of the realm will be related to a strong Orc male in some way.

Our goals will be to get everyone in the guild rank 14 as soon as possible. So if getting rank 14 is not something you wish to accomplish, you need not apply. If you are not going to play a male Orc, you need not apply. As a strong, Orc member of the Horde, who you choose to associate or do business with is your choice but if you are seen acting in a friendly manner in public with any Trolls, Tauren or Undead it will be greatly frowned upon. 
---
If you are caught helping or hanging out with **ANY** member of the Alliance whether it be a night elf, human, gnome or dwarf you will be immediately removed from our guild and shamed publicly on the forums and world chat. 
---
Feel free to be grouped with female Orcs but be sure to always walk in front of them. If you're interested, message me for discord.
---
How do you move away from them without exposing yourself to easier hits?
---
Why? Oh right there's no achievements in Classic WoW.
---
Guess I'll just have to do something else for the sheer fun of it.

Guess I'll just have to do something else for the sheer fun of it!

of course homie. thanks for your help :)
---
With 4 people, the chances of one guy just getting bored of waiting and going off on his own is very high, in my experience, the idea of doing everything with just one buddy can be pretty hard, it's pain in the arse when you have to wait around.
---
I suggest leveling separately after the low teens, and helping each other whenever you can, like with sharing profession mats or doing hard quests together.
---
Okay, but in your original post, you said that the Lich King is inspired by the the Night King because the books are 30 years old, even though the Night King wasn't even a character until the show was made. They have similar names, but they are completely different characters with different backstories and different history. If anything, the show took inspiration from WoW, not the other way around.
---
Here is a quote by GRRM about the Night's King and the Night King:
---
&gt; As for the Night’s King (the form I prefer), in the books he is a legendary figure, akin to Lann the Clever and Brandon the Builder, and no more likely to have survived to the present day than they have.
---
Mind if I ask your opinion on what makes a good economy in an MMO?
---
I'm not saying engineering isn't strong, but most people had it, so all they had to bring were the grenades they already had and the Soulbound trinkets they already had. 
---
As for alch, sure, FAPs would make some duels shorter, but protection options would have made duels last A LOT longer and I stand by that. Pots went on CD instantly, so people would be popping them every 2 min. Let's look at the finals of Venruki vs Snutz. The series was over 20 minutes long. If Snutz was using frost protection potions and Ven was using shadow protections, that's almost doubling Vens health and over half of Snutzs' health. These were long fights already with constant resets. It would have just been ridiculous with alch allowed.

Based on an interview, he wanted the freedom from a lack of supervision. He doesn't even list Blizzard on his CV.
---
Exactly. The 1st thing I do is take it off my bar when I make my character. When I'm low energy and need to auto attack I use my macro. The constant red flashing the auto attack button does distracts me when you are in combat. My brother keeps it on his bar. It is all personal preference.

You got me there... I am planning to play Warlock but I have a soft spot for the classic undead horse. Getting that mount was the crowning moment of the original game for me, ngl.
---
Unfortunately, the warlock needs two other participants to finish the ritual for the spell. So if you have 2 members with you, you can bring the other two. It also costs a soul shard each time.
---
However, if random strangers nearby are feeling nice, you can probably summon all 4 people in your group.
---
That gives me an idea. Camp out near common dungeons as a living “summoning stone” taxi service? Was that ever a thing?
---
I do! You can message me here or on Instagram (shieldsarts).
---
Hahaha this is epic
---
It's the shittiest until you realize you can spec it for 0 pushback while channeling.
---
It's a trolling spec for duels. Go watch some vids.
---
We 10-manned Ragefire Chasm during the first Stress Test...
---
Thanks! Probably about 14 hours from start to finish.
---
just imagine the legendary shitposting to come by the beginning of august.
---
I wouldn't do it, it's very easy for Blizzard to detect.
---
300-400 bitcoin would be a little tight on the budget.
---
But seriously, thanks!

Yeah but can your mage solo princess in Mara or tribute runs in DM north?
---
pvp twinks got more fashionable when power gap got very large with AQ40 weapons. unless you had alts with the means to get DEoI and caster trinkets and such, it was more fun to just pvp on twinks. with TBC however the gladiator gear was competitive enough that pvp alts were fun at max level again, until warglaives and T6 mixed sets ruined that balance so it was back to twinking.
---
It’s insane. 
---
Imagine being so upset that Blizzard intervened by teleporting a troll away from a community event being watched by 100,000+ people.
---
That's awesome! Druid, I'm guessing? The face looks super good, as does the perspective in general! I've always had trouble drawing Tauren because of their strange geometry lol.
---
Similar to the way espionage works. You risk the person/people you whisper either turning you in or they don't go along with the plan. I could lie and say sure we will go in order and only pay 1 dkp for tier sets. But then when the item drops I bid 2 dkp and win the item cheap and disrupt the whole system. Now no one else is willing to go along with colluding because they can't be sure everyone will follow the "rules". So colluding system is tenuous, in that it only takes one person to ruin everything.
---
Also, people worried about colluding with class items. If every class did that, then every archetype would all be bidding on neutral items anyways so it would balance itself out.
---
I'd worry more about loot council. Since that has more potential for corruption with favoritism and you have no numbers to back up your claim that they were giving items to other people over you.
---
Dkp system with mimum cost for certain items can help to reduce mimum 1dkp bids. So if you say T2 chest is minimum 40dkp then it lessens colluding and hoarding for multi-class items.
---
Not really man. Highest I lvld a hunter was 47 in retail vanilla. I'm a paladin player but I love to theorycraft, just don't know much about other class's bis items. Just going with my general knowledge right now. As someone mentioned below, dual wielding lowers your hit chance pretty significantly so mabey a 2h would be better. Requires testing.
---
The engine is the base, not the models or textures, animations or sound. They have an effect but the base is the modern engine that BFA uses.
---
I can recreate Super Mario 64 in Unreal Engine 4 and that doesn't mean it will run just as good as the original on an N64 - it wouldn't run at all even if I could compile UE4 for N64.
---
Wtf is the thing in the bottom right?
---
I'm saying it's taken away some of the skill based options from the game. I could vanish a death coil with quick reflexes back when spell batching worked like it did. Now I can't do that, the lock is guaranteed to get his mortal coil off and have the few seconds to get a fear off. Now it's a solved situation, every time the lock uses his coil it will have the same result, before I could play in response to that. Skill ceiling has gone down in that situation.
---
Yep because if you dont agree that " All human interaction is based on greed and is therefore corrupt" means you arent smart. So if someone donates to someone or helps them out, they are some how still acting out of greed. God what a bleak world view. Clearly only a genius could come up w that. If you think concepts like the nature of human interaction are so easily definable you are certainly not very intelligent. 
---
But lets say a guild's goal is to progress through content. Then they should pick a system that facilitates that, not hinder it. The system can allocate for certain individual desires, but it doesnt have to. Players that are more interested in being able to get exactly the gear they want than clearing content can join another guild that gives them that. Ideally individual goals align with the guild's goals. Pretty simple.
---
This is what we call a “safe bet”
---
Thanks, I've designed a few tattoos actually! Really hoping to be a tattoo artist some day...
---
Buying used parts would mean I'd have to know things about PC parts/how to assemble them.
---
PC hardware is a foreign language too me.
---
Free rolls are for PuG raids or casuals. No serious guild would agree to that because it's all RNG. So one who goes to every raid and contributes a ton could not win anything for weeks, and a new member or low attendance person could win multiple things in a row.
---
Emerald Dream (US) for life!
---
it's like when people say" I'm not racist but..."
---
I actually made a jawless toon on an RP server one time to do exactly that. No one responded to me though : (
---
Depends on the pug and/or how much of the raid was pre-built and how many Puggies they had.
---
Yes but someone had found the glitch back then, right? I'm not aware of any significant effects spell batching had except on some combat interactions. Nothing that would speed up leveling or anything game breaking like that. And it probably wouldn't have been for a lack of trying. I just don't see a case where spell batching opens up an easily reproducible exploit. Sure anything could happen, but that could be true of most WoW mechanics.
---
that is a vulpera,an NPC faction in bfa which is heavily rumored to be playable soon afaik :D
---
i Fear no men, but that thing, it scares me.
---
Look at asmon.... You can tell he's never worked a day in his life.
---
Nah. As long as there are 3000 people interested in each expansion (I'm sure there are) you won't notice.
---
After the pub gaming is the best!
---
I loved the site.. took me back to my leveling way back when... you have the rest of the levels?
---
you can just turn and walk away.
---
The idea is that with a slow weapon, you are only doing damage every 3.5 sec or whatever, you can spend 3 sec out of range
---
but it seems like a lot of work
---
As someone who is using some of my very limited vacation days at launch, I’d much rather spend them playing in a shard then waiting in que or watching the sever crash because you accidentally chose the wrong server with some streamer
---
I've been playing every class on a Pserver, trying to find something that works for me, and the idea of tanking outside of warrior/ druid/palading classes has always been a theorycrafting exercise or many players. You see people saying shamans can tank (threat and shield), warlocks can tank (huge damage reduction), rogues can tank (huge avoidance), but everyone assumes the pet can tank better than the hunter just cause it has growl. Hunters scale better with gear and player skill than a pet does, but hunters are already not desired in raids and groups, and have a bad stigma for being low skill players or easy mode.
---
 Its similar to picking a low tier character in a fighting game, the odd mix of pride and special snowflake that comes from beating people with Dan in street fighter. In WoTLK, I enjoyed tanking some dungeons as an enhancement shaman in PVP gear with resilience. I enjoyed playing as a dual weild unholy Death Knight tank with a ghoul pet in WoTLK as well before the talent changes in cata removed that. After seeing that Mongoose Bite triggered on Dodge, and Counterattack triggered on parry, I realized that the survival tree had buttons for getting punched in the face. At the end of the day I really enjoy the fiddling and building and tweaking to maximize a bad idea.
---
Not anymore unfortunately :( It started taking too much time as more and more guilds started appearing after the beta/launch date
---
Source on this?
---
If ret doesn't interested you, then go for it. Sounds like a lot more fun!
---
Hot Take: The Thread
---
Hey, sunflower, wait til they roll then roll on a different server.
---
Wow! That was easy!
---
that sounds amazing and like something i would do. i watched a guide video and this guy said that normally people will get geared if they're in a guild and good guilds require minimum 2 days per week and raiding lasts x amount of hours. so unleashing mayhem on noobs with a warlock sounds more fun 🤣
---
your mage cannot aggro everything without dying the instant you get in range of 50 mobs.
---
Look at when he created his Reddit account and then look at how many posts he’s made in the 27 days its existed.
---
This dude doesn’t go to parties...
---
Tribute runs? Yes. Princess? I don't know. But mage AoE farming in Mara is more GPH than a Hunter soloing Princess.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el8TI5QrX84&amp;t=) has decent videos while leveling/early ranking and it's fairly good imo
---
They care about maybe 1% of reports. Any game dev will tell you that public betas are terrible for finding bugs because players aren't paid play testers. They don't know how to make a reproducible bug report so the majority of the information is useless for debugging.
---
Not sure how you got down voted so hard you didn't even make a mean comment
---
It’s effective enough early because casters and rogues lack stam, and you are somewhat durable with consistent burst. Without gear you should just purge and place totems.
---
have a main and an alt,
---
and just alternate them so they both get rested exp and play one and then the other
---
Not really look at the statistics of all the servers oof Erin it’s prime. P99 is about an average for we. Ie a money maker to them. With wow it will definitely be way way way higher I’d go no less then half a million for the next 2 years which is roughly 7.5 million dollars a month x 24, so by no means a shadow unless you mean the night time sky which is the earth shadowing the sun
---
Next time try flagrant use of the /e command.
---
Each PUG was different.  I PUGed MCs with half good friends on alts and half fresh people.  Each person was able to get one tier piece, one non tier piece, and everyone was allowed to roll on Rag gear.  The biggest concern PUGs have is only allowing for one roll means "why the fuck do I finish the instance with these people if I already won my only piece".  It's shitty, but it keeps the greedy people in the raid from beginning to end.  
---
There will be many different kind of PUGs in Classic.  I highly advocate people to stay away from scumbags that lead a PUG when they are the only class represented.  Or the one's who think they can reserve loot because they told people to move out of fire.
---
Join the PUGs that are fun, competent, and fair.  But most importantly the fair one's, because they will usually be the most fun.
---
This looks like your average r/science comment thread.
---
The last time I did shrooms (like 7 years ago now) I remember all my buds being there, we were chain smoking, bullshitting, looking at cool...things...
---
Anyhow the next thing I remember was my dog looking at me is weird like he was disappointed. Then i “come to” and found myself on my bed with 3 sets of headphones on playing WoW  and none of my friends are around. 
---
Needless to say, I’m pretty much a hit at parties.
---
Also the enemy will still chase you at walking speed and land a couple of hits while you're moving to the edge of their threatened range, it seems highly inefficient.
---
That's a good analogy.
