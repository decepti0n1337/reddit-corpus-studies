The hole is too small tho?
---
---
---
&gt; (for minmaxing technically mage is the best)
---

---
Really? I'd always heard it was Warlock. 
---
Conspiracy: Blizz is trying to convert retail into a mobile game, especially for a more international (eg chinese) audience, and the loss in quality is acceptable for them
---
Only issue with that is actually finding a PoD
---
What was your IGN?
---
You need leppergnome items from engi to ever catch anyone tho
---
If I remember most 1st to 60 records on private servers, they range in the 4.x days played. So it's possible but you need to know exactly how to do it already.
---
Uldum...kill me.
---
its the same with fear ward
---
What probably (imo)?  50 to 60 should suck. That was the point. :)
---
No reason for it to suck. A game should be challenging and fun. Not pointlessly difficult and tedious.
---
Rogues are a below average but not awful BG class. They are good in flag defense in AB/WSG but are bad in team fights. 
---
A pre-made will want them for objective based play but they are a below average carry class for any BG if you are solo queueing.
---
The late game meta doesn't impact this much, as I'd say all of the above is true for BWL tier pvp also. They remain a top tier dueling class throughout. 
---
The other thing to remember is most guilds only bring a few druids. My guild brings 2 druids to MC/BWL vs 8 warriors, 4-5 rogues and mages, 4 priests/palas, etc.
---
There aren’t a lot of druids so there isn’t much competition for the spots, but then again there aren’t many spots.
---
Lemmings!!!
---
I don't get it often because I gouge /kidney when they start channeling.
---
I know. I'm saying to actually enchant other things you need to be a higher level. 
---
My raid leader goes so far as to call priests “not a healing class, but a utility class.” Palas are the real healing class.
---
You do get, that the only way you're going to get your perfect immaculate vanilla wow is to acquire old server side software and run your own server. If not you just like the rest of us, will have to live with whatever blizzard chooses. And yes going through an old Model T, redoing the paint with modern sealed paints and replacing that shity inefficient engine with four Hub Motors, would be on my top priority. If you don't get this, you have never ridden in one or had to work on one. And that same analogy, works for the poor programmers at blizzard, who are desperately trying to create a vanilla product that everybody will be happy with, but will still not Run Drive and require that he repairs that the aforementioned Model T requires. Nothing personal just saying.
---
I just took into account the damage of the casting mage, since the ignite tick is additive. There are also a lot of assumptions that go into the math but i took what i assumed were reasonable guesses and tried to simplify where i could.  The following is slightly rambling to try to keep it short. 
---
Pyroblast does about 120 more damage than rank 12 fireball, not counting the dot. so a pyro crit will be \~180 damage more than a fireball, so each 2 seconds the ignite will tick for \~36 more damage than a fireball of an equivalent crit. so then the question is, how much damage does a frostbolt do if its cast instead of the long ignite cast time. Pre-AQ gear i guessed that 300+ spell damage would be a safe bet. Probably more but i leaned conservative. That translates to \~250 spellpower for a frost bolt. Rank 11 would then do 750ish damage.
---
Anyway, so the Pyroblast crit does 180 more upfront damage and 36 more ticking ignite damage than the fireball. but the frostbolt gives the frostbolt+fireball combo a (750-180) 570 damage head start.  The ignite ticks every 2 seconds, so to make up that 570 damage you need about 16 ticks. So thats 32 seconds. 
---
Since pyro and fireball scale the same with +sp dmg gear, you only have to look at the difference between the base spells. Any buffs that work by % damage increases (CoE, PI, AP)  would alter the math. Higher spell damage would lean in favor of the frostbolt+fireball combo. You could also count the dots, but in my experience those get knocked off pretty quickly in a raid. Other conciderations, frost is binary and would hedge in the case of a partial resist from either the fireball or pyroblast, extra spell casts give you an extra chance to crit. but i don't want to turn the math into rocket science. 
---
You seem to know a lot about this...
---
Recently on a pserver there was a 60 tauren warrior killing lowbies in Duskwood. I ran out to help on my 51 druid and beat him 1v1, both starting at full health. Putting that scum to shame felt amazing!

If you're smart, you can also just run more than 15 years away and it won't hit ya.  But that means being at max melee range and being on your A game to run the hell away.
---
Chill dude. Just pointing out that both classes lack a lot, in no small part because of each other. I'm not calling my Dad Who Works at Blizzard and demanding they make my Paladin better. It's going to ship how it was, for better or worse. 
---
And yeah. Shaman trees (especially Enhancement) were an absolute mess. Y'all got the short end, and deserved better.  It would take more than a simple tweak anywhere to get y'all in a good place without breaking PvP, unlike I believe the Paladin trees could be. 
---
Besides, Paladins were already quite good dungeon tanks. Was harder to gear a paladin than it was to run the instance. Didn't see the factions collapsing in on themselves because of it while Horde cleared every raid first. 
---
In theory if he never go an initial charge off, the mage would be able to blink every single intercept stun. Although still, I don't know how you'd ever be able to get a reliable slow on the warrior unless he was like backpedaling and keyboard turning to catch the mage after a blink.
---
Frostbite is big for st build, and you can't go frostbite if you wanna aoe. This guide is obviously meant for players who aren't going to be ahead of the pack, because anyone who is won't be looking at a guide.
---
That said, maybe servers won't be nearly as populated as private servers have been on launches (10k+ players), so getting ahead won't be as difficult.
---
Aside from hunter or mage, what class would you say is good for a mostly solo player?
---
I don't know, I heard that every time they try to re-add RPG elements the current playerbase loses their minds. Theres a post on forums I saw with some guy raging because they re-added Pet types? Like tanking pets vs dps pets and he was mad because he wants his one pet to do it all and not have a "role".
---
If the current playerbase rejects rpg elements, making live similar to classic is going to cause a meltdown. Those guys just do NOT want that stuff.
---
Warlock. For all the same reasons as a hunter.
---
Warlock! Lifetap for no mana downtime, life drain to regain, Voidwalker lets you take on multiple mobs with health funnel. 80s mount at level 40!
---
Keep moving that goalpost!
---
Sounds good. Should I decide to try and jump into raids, would warlocks be desirable? 
---
https://youtu.be/WhvvNGeHHME
---
Druids can tank, dps, or heal 5 man content no problem (most people will just be glad to have a tank lol), but expect to heal raids.
---
It is possible to find people willing to take you to raids as a tank or dps, if that's what you really want to do, but those people are few and far between, so bear that in mind before you decide to main a meme spec. Some guilds will accept you, others will laugh at you.
---
As for performance, Druid tanks are actually solid. Dps is your weakest role by far, especially Balance (Balance is arguably the worst spec in the game), so Druid may not be the right choice if you want to main dps.
---
PvP-wise, Druids are the go-to flag carriers for WSG, they're strong duelists, and they're pretty hard to pin down in WPvP. You can pretty much run away from most fights and there's not much anyone can do to stop you. Pretty fun class tbh with a lot of room for skillful players to shine. You don't do much ganking though, if that's what you're into.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This may be an unpopular opinion but I think it's selfish of people to push for classic+ instead of letting TBC fans have their turn. 
---
threat basically no longer exists so i wouldn't be surprised if threat addons were no longer updated
---
Trying to come up with cool characters you'd probably come across while roaming the mean streets of old Brill. Today I came up with this sketch - just wanted to share it with you all! :) cheers!
---
To the people downvoting this, that's what a *mod* said in a deleted comment chain
---
A) Threat exists in M+ with the Skittish affix and B)  when we 3 tanked Argus our 3rd tank had a threat meter to make sure he didn't rip threat off main tanks whilst maxing his DPS as the damage check was really tight. 
---
In vanilla warlocks are the least popular DPS class, especially alliance warlocks. You shouldn't have a problem finding a raid spot compared to a mage/rogue/warrior.
---
&gt;Like tanking pets vs dps pets and he was mad because he wants his one pet to do it all and not have a "role".  
---
He (and others) are mad because they can't use their favorite pets now because they don't offer the best utility.  
---
That's one of the worst places where they could've added "rpg" elements.  
---
I'm quite anti-social irl and so I want to play a class that will push me to reach out and group up in order to succeed, otherwise I'll end up playing a Hunter to 60 in complete silence without ever grouping up or asking for help lol. What classes aren't good for solo play?
---
Huh, really? Did they at least do decent DPS back then in dungeons and/or raids?
---
I wanted to love Uldum so much. The Tol’vir are one of my favorite races, the dungeons had such amazing themes, even my favorite Elemental Lord was there. Then we had Indiana Jones and the Nazi Goblin. 
---
They need a new game. A restart.  
---
WoW has too much bandaids on top of bandaids to make sense anymore without disrupting the game even further.  
---
They need a clean start so they can apply everything they learned throughout the years and not make same mistakes.  
---
And Classic is perfect for it.  
---
Bushido life. Have some honor. Ganking is for shitters that can't win duels. 
---
It's worth mentioning that Alliance Warlocks are unpopular because most Horde players play Undead, and Will of the Forsaken makes Undead immune to Fear for like 8 seconds. So Alliance Warlocks kinda suck for PvP.
---
Adding the quest hub at least provided some respite in between two grinds. The dry spell wasn't just 50-60, more like 45-60.
---
I think they tie or surpass Mage at the end of Naxx but they're not chart toppers before that. Not bad though. Also soul shards can be annoying since they take up a lot of bag space. 
---
I wouldn't say there is a set rotation as will depend on each spells dmg, mobs health, dmg intake vs healing + mana %, nightfall procs ext
---
Just play about and see what works, imm +coa+sl+cor +DL+DL+SL, maybe drop imm or throw in some wanding.
---
Keep eye on soundings and use fear after dotting up move onto second (repeat if mobs dieing quick) dl life 2nd and let 1st come close to kill and loot.
---
Farm humanoids for cloth(first aid + tailoring) and keep a lvl advantage / keep down time min
---
I pesonal always stack shadow dmg &gt; stam &gt; int/spirit (iv dabbled with spirit and found can be a bonus but the aim is to always be dotting or draining so I'd advise int prio) but do remember you health is your mana and vice versa so if you can gain more stam at cost of int do it + bigger health pool will scale better later.
---
Potions /food/scrolls/thorns are all very benifical as well as any player buffs
---
Iv tried very hard to keep my old blueberry out but unless all private vw threat are glitches and memories of vanilla hazy the blue just the slow safe boring style to play imo.
---
My retail lock will 100% be lvling as a aflic/demo build with DP switching to either soul link aflic build or my current farming build of  fel conc +imp dl+Syphon life +Demoic sac vw or suc depending on dmg taken.
---
I find sm ruin or sm ds more down time without raid gear + as you ideally need the crit or mana (without losing too much +dmg for early +shadow dmg pre raid stuff) and without the survivability or flexibility of aflic /demo builds, SL/SL may been abit op spec but I was un killible solo 2v2 arenas for lulz 
---
lol at that
---
The guy who is asking the question of whether he can, likely will not
---
On private servers, you go SoC Ret until level 36 and then you respec into Reckoning. Reckoning is only as strong as it is because you can /sit to force crits, which gives you Reckoning stacks. However, no one really knows for sure if this is Blizz-like or not. You can and always could /sit to force crits, but we aren't sure whether those forced crits are supposed to proc abilities like Reckoning and Enrage. The general consensus is that they shouldn't, which means Reckoning will lose a ton of value come Classic WoW's official release since you won't be able to force it.
---
So yes, you should level as ret.
---
That would arguably make Black Lotus rarer
---
What do you mean by "eat the viability of hybrid"?
---
I can't wait for this game to come out
---
It can't be done in a week. They said you can get 2 Rank 14s in the same week. Which is true but that's because it's based on server population so some larger servers can have multiple R14 per week
---
**Alliance**
---
For PvE, night elves have a higher base agility stat than dwarves, which gives them marginally higher dps. Dwarves have Gun Specialisation, but there are no good guns at 60 so fuck 'em.
---
For PvP, either. Night elves have a higher base agility stat, which I already mentioned, but they also have Shadowmeld, which means you can get the jump on people by casting Aimed Shot from stealth. Dwarves have Stoneform, which makes you immune to poison, bleed, and disease effects for like 8 seconds. You can use Stoneform preemptively to avoid things like a rogue's Blind. Pretty good.
---
**Horde**
---
For PvE, trolls have Berserking, which increases your ranged attack speed and subsequently your dps. They also have Bow Specialisation, which is real nutty.
---
For PvP, orcs have Hardiness, which gives you a 25% chance to resist stuns. This is fucking insane. Orcs are fucking insane.
---
Capping honor, (better) dimishing returns system, making it more heavily weighted towards something other than time spent (like some type of skill rating), cracking further down on account sharing, addressing some of the premade issues (like queue dodging as mentioned in OP)
---
There are many ways to theoretically make the honor grind healthier other than allowing more R14s. Not all are fantastic ideas, and not all should be considered because of the changes it would make to the game, but if Blizzard truly want to improve the system there are many ways
---
They're talking about Shadowmeld
---
Everything here spunds great except the pvp server part. Is that 100% decided?
---
You can AoE quest as well yk
---
I seem to remember rare mobs were mostly soloable in classic, but I only came across a few throughout the game. 
---
The dragon was obviously not soloable for someone around its level, but what about the others in the video?  They still seemed to hit pretty hard vs a 60. 
---
I feel incredibly dumb right now haha
---
They don't need to do that to be successful. I'm both Vanilla era and TBC, with a ton more success in TBC, and I would love to see TBC servers. But even if they announce intent for TBC servers before Classic releases, I'm not going to really believe them until we see how Classic does. If you were a company would you announce that decision without even seeing how Classic does, including what the post-tourist population looks like?
---
I would like to be dedicated but I would also like to get laid 
---
Why I love PvP servers. 
---
I really enjoyed the video. Great production quality imo

Wtb ubrs key 10g
---
I mean.... why wouldn't you want mods who never played vanilla? haha.
---
A healer or tank would be a good option. Paladins let you go either role in dungeons while leveling, which will give you decent loot and help make easy friends. Priest or warrior could also be what you're looking for. People especially love tanks, and if you're polite and half decent they will likely invite you to play with them.
---
The Virgin vs the Chad Warrior
---
The left one looks so much better and more like I remember it. Why did they change it?
---
Quit your jobs, sell your wives and start collecting welfare; it's classic time.
---
No. Absolutely not. Retail WoW has evolved into a completely different type of game, and that is fine. It has it's well paying micro transaction happy audience.
---
This is why we need Classic. Classic for one audience, Retail for the other.
---
And this is why it is so important to not alter one game to make the audience of the other happy.
---
Another DAoC vet here, this is absolutely true^^^^^
---
I remember literally laughing at the idea of not losing exp when you died....
---
Nice write up m8. IIRC I saw this a while back and you’ve added quite a bit since then! And he’s absolutely right about AoE farming, unless you’re 100% no life’ing and grouping up with a more efficient leveling class for the earlier levels it’s going to be ridiculously difficult to get the ideal mobs to yourself and then you’ll be stuck with a less efficient ST spec or waste gold/cheap respecs. I do think post 40 you have a lot more options for AoE farming and with more talent points available it’ll be more forgiving to invest in Imp Blizzard/Permafrost. You’ll also have (should have) mount and Ice Barrier at that point so you can pull bigger packs more safely. I’m actually in the process of making revisions to my own Mage write up to clarify about the risks with AoE farming for Classic launch.
---
This is what happens to this day on my pserver.
---
You get a /whisper saying "hey, wanna kill this rare mob?"
---
How could you say no to something so cool? I actually got some awesome gloves once that I wore for 20 levels!
---
These are the kind of microtransactions we need to distract them from making in-game buyables... keep the profit outside of the game.
---
No, the issue was pally's couldn't push crushing blows off the hit table.....
---
Well that's why I would look at the most loyal and dependable raiders over anything.
---
If the Paladin happens to be that kind of raider, I would be happy to see them get it. A good Ret Pally heals when called upon, maintains a good healing set and provides utility at all times. 
---
That's dumb. Why not just fix it?
---
That's an excellent comment, I'd genuinely give you gold if I had any coins.
---
I was an RPer that stopped playing around the beginning of MoP. As much as I dislike the direction the game has gone, I gotta say, all the transmogs and trinkets must be excellent for RP. I predict the exact same thing, and I'll be RPing as I play but not playing for the sole purpose of RP. 
---
Is that Chipshajen?! Holy shit GIGACHAD
---
Hahaha ye maybe if I rolled with a friend because that sounds so awesome 
---
Incoming meme spec jokes, stick to healing, blessing and cleansing etc etc. -grabs popcorn- 
---
Yeah can't wait to be on NA server for classic.  This method is a bit harder with 150 ping.
---
&gt; 1-2% is still negligible. 
---
Hardiness is +25% stun resist. Bringing an orc to 30%\~ stun resist. It is likely you will resist 1/3 stuns. Far from negligible. Often procs 2-3 times in a single fight.
---
&gt; The racials are overall neglible 
---
I disagree completely. +25% stun resist is MASSIVE.
---
&gt; The only real racial that has more than a negligent draw, is priests 
---
No. Human + swords is insane for pve. Orc +axes for pve is insane. Orc hardiness for pvp is insane. There are MANY valuable racials to consider that are not negligible. 
---
I think the disconnect here is what level you are playing on... If you are someone who isnt actively watching your meters, dabbles in a bit of pve and pvp and just want to have a general good time, your racial choice is VASTLY different from someone who is aiming to farm battlegrounds to get rank 14. If as an orc, you have a 30% chance to resist stuns, you have an incredible advantage in pvp... Absolutely incredible. If the orc racial was only +10% stun resist, it would STILL be the most dominant pvp racial for warlock.
---
How about no
---
Why would you deliberately not level your very first high level character to 60? Weren't you curious about end game content?
---
You're right in saying that it's authentic. However that doesn't make it in any way desirable from a gameplay standpoint.
---
Which is why i don't care about it, think it's stupid, and declare that it won't be in Classic because Blizzard doesn't have a complex with being 'blizzlike' like the emulsion scene devs do.
---
Do your arms hurt?
---
From all that reaching?
---
As a left handed person I’m glad you did it the way you did!
---
I have watched several of those videos now, and every single mob you say there's nothing special about his loot table. 
---
I want to know which mobs do have special or interesting loot!
---
The purpose of this video was just to show rare mobs specifically in Alterac? Just curious. Is there anything special about alterac rares?
---
Where in his post does he ask for a change or a buff?
---
I consistently see you harping on retribution paladins like you have an absolute vendetta against them.
---
To be honest, I agree with your core philosophy. I do not want the developers to rebalance or change any class mechanics.
---
But the way you go about pushing your agenda by verbally attacking people across numerous posts is so toxic. I would think it's very difficult for other to support your ideology when all they would want to do is distance themselves from you.
---
Lock leveling is awesome and by far the best leveling experience of all classes imo.
---
Mage leveling is fun but lots of downtime; if you hate being OoM and drinking this isn’t the class for you
---
Rogue and Warrior are much slower to level, but are honestly much more immersive to level.
---
At endgame, it’s the opposite, I’d say; Warrior and Rogue are more fun at endgame, while Mage and Lock get kinda spammy.
---
I personally plan to play Mage, Warrior and Hunter in Classic.
---
For you I bet you’d like Rogue or Warlock best based on skimming through your post. The only one of the 4 it sounds like you should avoid is Mage because like I said they have a ton of downtime and it sounds like that’s a big turn off for you.
---
It’s called TBC and WotLK servers

FFXIV Shadowbringers launches this summer; late June most likely

To add to this, the difference between races in PVE/PVP is marginal at best outside of Orcs being OP with their PVP racials.

Depends on whether we have the nerfed version of meld or not, which is highly likely.

We'd like to now introduce, WoW - Meta-Classic Patch 54.7-MetaPatch-1.12
---
But didn't you get the memo that adults don't have time to play games anymore
---
Exactly this. I've started tanking mythic+ in BFA and kind of gotten back into the game just to pass the time until classic. There is definitely a significant segment of players that are relatively happy with BFA and the state of the modern game. We just hear all the people bitching about it just like its always been. 
---
I can't wait to get back to a pre-Ghostcrawler tanking paradigm where threat and planning and executing a pull properly felt like it mattered more. I want to main Fury for raids but I'm really looking forward to tanking all dungeons for pre-raid BiS under the old system. I don't think the typical modern player would enjoy it at all and that's just fine.
---
Yeah just go through the blue drops for severa areas related to a level range 
---
&gt;Recently
---
I guess you're new here.
---
Nothing special but they tend to have higher level loot. Bags potions a green thats good or even a blue. 
---
I kind of agree. I think I'd enjoy a 2.0 where 60 is the cap and the gate doesn't open. 
---
This was in extremely poor taste. I LOVE WPvP, it's why I play but this was disgustingly poor sportsmanship. But hey it's from the Alliance so no surprise.
---
Can't wait to piss all over Alliance players this summer.
---
In end game PvE Paladins are expected to heal, as that's really the only thing they can do. Ret paladins can PvP though.

I don't have any obligations but my job and I am going to absolutely spend all my free time on WoW.

easy solution
---
"Blizzard will not fix looting mistakes, pay attention next time and good luck in future encounters!"
---
The launcher could be considered a part of the gameplay element/experience just as much as any other strictly art asset of Classic WoW. 
---
My impression is the current wow devs would really like a wow game that they want to play, which isn't BFA.   Most of them grew up playing early wow and I expect quite a few will play with the rest of us when it's released.
---
The yeti drops a blue boe dagger.  Greens were pretty rare to drop in vanilla, especially ones with relevant stats. You may see 3-4 boe blues drop for you on the way to 60 for normal mobs in the world. Maybe 1 epic if your lucky. 
---
Believe it or not a guaranteed or high chance at a green item was special. Retail rare mobs all seem to drop a guaranteed blue with a high chance at an epic. It’s just how loot worked back then. 
---
Ban first, fix later.
---
I did... And I filed in my special filing cabinet.
---
It’s a series of all rare mobs in every zone. Check out this guy’s channel on Youtube. (Huzzah) He’s done every lower level zone up to Alterac.  
---
This is sick.
---
What would matter is the number of undead vs orc warlocks, not the number of overall orcs and overall undead.
---
Crashing a funeral in real life is illegal. This is not. So therefore the guild should of realized some people would attempt to pk them, and try to defend themselves.  Instead they assumed everyone would be a good person and not attack them, after advertising this all over the forums.
---
You could of done this without causing a bunch of attention to it. I don’t understand why people get upset over people Pvp in Pvp servers when the guild was honestly asking for it.
---
It’s like yelling in world chat, “IM IN ASHENVALE DONT PVP ME! cords are 56.7, 34.2” then getting upset when people come and grief you.
---
Druid is pretty nice for that, from recent experience.
---
Also allows some ease of finding groups as healer or tank :)
---
I wonder if I. An find a guild for people like us. Think there used to be one around called dads of gaming ?
---
Right?! Or that you could just port home safely from wherever every hour! Flight paths, much more forgiving combat especially at low levels, Foo/water making regen fast and ez... the list goes on. This comes from someone that LOVES WoW..... its not and never has been hard lol. Its just any newer PvE content that isnt heroic or mythic is literally faceroll ez. Thats why people say vanilla was so hard

My wife is a staunch hater of video games. I finally got her to cave in buying my oldest (12 y.o.) an Xbox but she made our daughter set it up in the den so we can “monitor the time spent”.  I have tried many times to get her to relax about the issue but to no avail.  I may actually have to play classic in a clandestine manner.  Crazy as it sounds, she might get as pissy about that as if I had a girlfriend.  Feels bad man.  But I’m gonna play classic by God All Mighty
---
Some creep had a manic episode and started spamming the reddit yesterday lol... As if highlighting that paladins are easy makes any difference when every class is easy.
---
If you're going to level a warrior, go engineering.  The goblin rocket helm is a game changer in PvP.  However, warriors are just ok in PvP without a healer.  With a healer, you're an unstoppable wrecking machine.  Without a healer, some classes will kite you to death.  As a hunter, I specialized in kiting warriors all day long in AB.  Or course if the warriors had goblin rocket helm, the fights wouldn't have been so one-sided.
---
I leveled a mage in Vanilla.  I'm not a fan of mage leveling.  Too much drinking, to easy to be ganked while drinking, etc.  However, mages in dungeons are amazing.  Best CC, great buff, free food and water, best AOE(A big deal in Vanilla, where few classes can AoE).  Since there are generally fewer mages on the horde side you'll be in high demand for a lot of things.   I hear AoE leveling is the bee's knees, but my own experience I find it sort of boring.
---
I leveled an orc mace rogue in Vanilla.  Had a blast PvPing with him while leveling and in level 60 bgs.  Orcs are hard to stun and I'm dealing out mace stuns left and right and murdering alliance rogues in full T2.  The downside I found rogue PvE to boring as fuck and maces about the worst spect to PvE in.
---
Awesome read! Thank you for the effort you put into this. I hope it's appreciated by the community. 
---
Watch out for Narillasanz. I got fucking boomed by him many a time leveling in Alterac
---
 Orc Warrior 
---
As far as duels go, the game isnt balanced around duels so you shouldnt select a pvp class based on their duel performance in my opinion. If you are focused on PVP, you are focused on ranking and will gain more from premade BG's and world pvp than you will in duels. Your focus should be on performances that count, in the world and in a BG. As far as you getting bored, thats entirely subjective and I cant speak to that.
---
Rogue/Warlock
---
You mention the Orc racial. Hardiness is the highest value racial ability in PvP. Nothing comes close. You sound like pvp focused guy who also may want to min/max with engineering and trinkets, you should definitley take orc. Leveling a rogue and leveling a lock are VERY different journeys and in BG's you have a VERY different responsiblity. If you want to be in the action, warlock. If you enjoy world ganking, enemy cities and guarding flags/stealing flags in BG's rogue is your pick.
---
Mage
---
Has super high value in pve and pvp AND is a great source of income. Gold matters in vanilla.
---
.... 
---
In closing, youve already attempted a warrior several times and havent succeeded getting it to 60. I wouldnt start with a warrior. For most people, they make a better alt and are easier when twinked.
---
If you still want melee, go Orc rogue. If you are stuck between a mage and a lock, you need to watch some pvp videos to help you get it sorted. Focus on watching high level premade groups and watch a FULL match footage so you get some real context. Dont watch highlight reels and dont bother watching someone who is full consumed with a legendary staff... Try to get a REAL perspective.
---
Hmm... Assuming you started in Elwynn... Then perhaps it would be possible? The aggro range for mobs in duskwood is going to be insane. Even running along the paths I know there are quite a few wolves that Pat too close to it. 
---
Maybe you start as an Orc, run/swim to booty bay and then up to the arena? That may be less hastle?
---
Mage. Warrior is not casual.
---
Tanks can find 5 man spots easy. You wont be invited to tank for a raid unless you know the guild OR are exceptional.
---
Vanillia WoW?
---
Yes.
---
Yes, you can hit 60. No YOU wont be able to do it. The people who can do it, are the ones who HAVE done it. The ones who will play 16-20 hours per day on a dedicated route and MAY have additional players alternately using their accounts. YOU will get more value taking the 2nd or 3rd week off so you arent in the crowd and can capitalize on the full week. You wont hit 60, but youll get far.
---
I feel like it’s the other way around... it’s irrelevant unless they specifically say they are working towards adding something like this.  Adding a system that mimics a server tick function across all categories is by no means a small feat, and for the most part should be expected to be not apart of classic.  It sucks but it’s one of those things we may just have to deal with 
---
right but not that many as listed lol
---
That rings a bell - I'd be up for that!
---
&gt; TBC heroic dungeons and raids to be the all time best PvE content released in WoW. LK on the other hand was the best state of the balance regarding builds diversity
---
Bingo. I'm hyped as shit for Classic, but I actually started in early TBC, so I really hit my stride in late TBC and Wotlk. The pve content was simply phenomenal in TBC, and as a PvP fanatic, in wotlk the class balance was at it's best imo (after they sorted out dk's). Tons of viable comps in arena and most specs if played well were easily viable in pve.
---
Very interested to see where they take it. I'm sure a lot of it will depend on the sub numbers that come in from classic, but if they can eventually find a way to release tbc/wotlk in a way that preserves the integrity of the classic servers, it would be extremely exciting.
---
[They simply followed EverQuest's lead, this chick was on what seems to have been every single EQ expansion](https://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/25182-everquest-windows-front-cover.jpg).
---
To my understanding though, druids are typically asked to heal in endgame stuff. 
---
I'm not a great healer in any sense of the word, so I'd prefer to avoid being shoehorned into a healer role if I want to get anywhere in PvE endgame. 
---
But you're not wrong, druids are certainly versatile! 
---
I've played pretty hardcore, and plan to again. I said from the start that the orc racial was the best of any. 30% stun resist is great. Is it neglible when picking a race? I'd say so. Mage, warlock, shamans- all have 0 stuns. Warriors have 1 combat stun and 2 counting a charge opener which is a 50/50. Shadow priests have a 10% on their shadow spells and same for hunters with concussive, so the resist is coming down to paladin's HoJ, druid's bash, but mostly and most importantly, rogues.
---
Orc warlocks spec'd for pvp- SL will eat rogues all day regardless of 1 stun resist. Orc hunters have a great matchup versus them, but resisting an opener could let them pull far ahead. Warriors should do well regardless, again, and shamans will be 50/50. There's also much less counterplay for all of these classes when the rogue has their cooldowns, so I still say these are neglible.
---
As for axe / sword / mace / gun / bow spec.... It is still very neglible. You'd have to show me exact stats to persuade me, but I can't imagine more than a 2% increase. The best dps trinket in the game gives that much to a melee dps. And that feels neglible. I'm not saying neglect these things, but I am saying at the end of the day, 1 second of misplay has already likely overshadowed whatever benefit was gained, and I'll stand by that in pvp. Pve is a bit more consistent, but it's not to the point where guilds are taking human warriors over dwarves lol.
---
Not the sharpest tool in the shed, are we?
---
Fight the good fight!
---
Wish they didn't have the emblem in the center. The scenes are great though!
---
And here I was, expecting a post about discipline priests, stacking spirit, and the role of patience in maximizing your use of the 5-second rule

We had a similar event back in the day for a wedding, but was obviously overshadowed by the funeral thing. Managed to find the video. Even has some server drama.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hytrMxTrITI
---
Up until now, the zones covered could be considered low level areas, so the rare spawns only have increased chances of green items, bags, etc. This video, and the one on Thousand Needles, show the first rare spawns that can drop blue items.
---
Future videos should have increased blue and interesting drops since they will all be higher level zones.
---
Also, I think The Silverpine Forest video should show you who drops the Black Tabby Cat Carrier; a rare vanity item that summons a pet.
---
In endgame pve, warlocks are kind of gimped by the debuff limit, meaning you can't take full advantage of your dot options. Also, in the first two tiers of raiding, frost damage is way more desirable than fire or shadow.
---
I can't speak to endgame pvp.
---
A documentary sounds interesting. I know in the past real world scientists have conducted several studies on this event. It even hit mainstream media in 2005 (NPR link below). In fact, the in game scenario created the perfect experimental conditions and it is still being studied as of May  2018 (https://www.wearethemighty.com/warcraft-corrupted-blood-incident-disease)
---
2005 NPR Article: https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4946772
---
&gt;I said from the start that the orc racial was the best of any. 30% stun resist is great. Is it neglible when picking a race? I'd say so.
---
30% stun resist is not negligible. Its game changing and in pvp its game breaking. It is FAR too high. It has INSANE value.
---
&gt; Mage, warlock, shamans- all have 0 stuns. 
---
Fire mages have impact so they have a stun. All 3 can use tidal charm. All 3 can use grenades in pvp. Choosing orc, you dont need to worry about shamans because they fight beside you. Warlocks arent your counter and are less of a concern because they are a mirror match anyhow.
---
&gt; Orc warlocks spec'd for pvp- SL will eat rogues all day regardless of 1 stun resist. 
---
PvP that matters is group pvp. PvP to get ranks... BGs and world PvP. In that environment you rarely have a 1v1. Regardless of how well warlocks do against rogues, Orc is better and that racial can prevent you from having to use a cooldown.
---
&gt; As for axe / sword / mace / gun / bow spec.... It is still very neglible,  You'd have to show me exact stats to persuade me, but I can't imagine more than a 2% increase. 
---
Its not my responsibility to tell you how glancing blows work or what % of your dmg gets nullified by glancing blows. I know it, but im not obligated to explain it to you. But heres an example for you. Ever heard of edgemasters handguards? They are widely considered to be the best leveling gloves from 60-70 during BC. Good players were taking of their T3 gloves to equip edgemasters because they were so strong. Weapon skill matters... A lot. Go look it up.
---
&gt; There's also much less counterplay for all of these classes when the rogue has their cooldowns 
---
This is exactly why 30% resist matters. You resist the cheapshot (1 in 3 chance) you win as an orc. You resist the cheap shot and they are out of stealth and down 2 points... They will need to try and get a restealth by wasting VERY important CDs, BUT youve likely already dotted them. Youve also offset their energy. They are now way behind and you STILL have a 1/3 chance to resist their kidney. Its game breaking. Not that I take orc to counter rogues, they just make an excellent talking point due to their heavy reliance on stuns. Most high level Alliance rogues dont bother to stun Orcs at all due to the imbalance.
---
&gt; 1 second of misplay has already likely overshadowed whatever benefit was gained 
---
Im not sure what you mean by this. A player could do EVERYTHING right and if their stun is resisted, they will simply lose. A stun is often a cooldown, and in most cases its a very important cooldown like bash for druids, hammer stun for pallys or grenade for rogues/warriors who need to close the gap.
---
&gt; Pve is a bit more consistent, but it's not to the point where guilds are taking human warriors over dwarves lol. 
---
No one will choose their allies based on race. Not for PvP and not for PvE. I never implied that this would be the case. For most players, it would be mostly appropriate to choose based on aesthetics. For those of us who want to min/max, Orc is incomparably overpowered in PvP. They are broken. With NO close second.
---
as long as they keep Classic around, I say go right ahead
---
They are good at levelling, but they have a big dip in strength once they hit 60 until they start shining again with ZG/AQ+ gear. Not having the free +6 hit talents really hurts your raiding in MC/BWL compared with mage. Fear/seduce is in the majority of cases a worse polymorph in dungeons. Their aoe is good but not amazing like mages. PvP wise again they really need some gear to shine. Prepare to have a very sad time vs hunters/rogues/warriors until you get a good bunch of + stam/dmg gear. They can be fairly ineffective in organised PvP too because UD is such a popular class on horde and priest/pally cleanse spam makes for sad times vs alliance. You can spec soul link to be a very strong dueler but then you can basically be ignored till last in group pvp because it has poor damage output.  
---
  
---
So yeah they have their moments but they just aren't the strong all round class mage is in vanilla.
---
Those are some very sound points. That makes total sense! Thank you!
---
That's what you think.
---
True! Ugh I kind of wanted to play one in classic for a change but rogues warriors and mages are too strong! I guess I’ll be the same old mage
---
A 1987 Honda is easy to drive. Doesn't mean it's any good.
---
I think 2 crit is worth more than 33 spellpower when the casters are decked in naxx gear
---
Warlocks blow in pve. You basically just put up coe/cos and shadowbolt. Youll get yelled at for using dots because of the debuff limit but you wouldnt want to anyway. The real problem is that warlocks dont have a threat reduction talent like other dps specs or ways to drop aggro. So if you chain a couple shadowbolt crits together youll pull aggro. The aoe is also pretty crap with either rain of fire doing bad damage, or you kill yourself with hellfire. Not to mention healers will bitch about life tap. Then you cant even use your cool demons and are on blood pact duty. Pve is just terrible on them, and carebears vastly outnumber pvpers.
---
Then when you actually look at pvp, you deal with warriors being basically immune to your only defense, wotf + trinket is also rough to deal with, and youre basically a free kill to a rogue if caught alone. With a team warlocks are pretty good, but are pretty weak in wpvp.
---
And mages are basically the polar opposite of all that, which is why they are more popular.
---
I miss talent trees :(
---
Like others are saying, green drops are relatively rare and most people are going to be wearing some common/white quality items even at 30+. Rare mobs are a safe bet for a green item drop 95% of the time or at least some potions/bags. Same thing with treasure chests that have yet to be looted.
---
I've been playing an ironman on Old School Runescape. Slowly leveling and just kind of chilling. I plan to complete all the quests and then retire the character before Classic comes out.
---
 The nostalgia factor for me with Runescape is pretty much gone, but I genuinely enjoy the game, and I think WoW Classic is going to be the same eventually.
---
Dude is that a Lemon Party cd? That was one of my favorite games back in the day and I forgot all about it until now! I'm gonna see if I can download it somewhere now!
---
Mages can AOE farm the Crocs and get a ton of bijous and coins. You can be exalted within first day easy
---
I may be a little over selling it but not by much
---
Difference here is that you don´t need anyone else to play Diablo 2 with you. You need them for Classic.
---
Singleplayer games can survive easily with small community. MMOs need community of decent size to remain healthy and let´s be honest here, how many players will be there once they get all the gear they want and clear everything they wanted to?
---
Yes, new people always come and they were also coming on the server I played. But it doesn´t matter that you are able to meet a player during levelling every once in a while when community doesn´t have enough players to form dungeon groups in reasonable time or to do BGs and raids.
---
I don't think that 2.5 years is when the semi-casuals will clear Naxx 40.
---
The beauty of Classic WoW is that the whole game is fun, it's not just a funnel to end-game.  It will take a lot of time for players to tire of the content.  Personally, I found that in Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath, I didn't get tired of content until the next expansion was announced and I knew a gear reset was coming anyway.  
---
And TBC would be better than anything Blizzard could come up with for new content.
---
Just to clarify, you're asking what items existed in Vanilla but were later removed in TBC, WotLK, etc? And your goal is to collect these items for fun in Classic once Classic is released?
---
If so... uhhhh that's probably a crap ton of items. I'd love to see such a list as well!
---
Mages can:
---
* AoE Grind
---
* Give people water
---
* CC a LOT easier in PvE
---
Warlocks are great, too.  Healthstones are nice, summons are nice, you get a free mount, leveling is IMO easier (mage is faster, warlock is easier).  But the Mage has a lot of nice advantages.
---
I don't want to play vanilla for 10 years straight. I want to play it, move on, and come back to the same game eventually. Not be put in the same position I am now where I can't go back and play a non-bastardized version of a game I used to enjoy. 
---
The hunter one, by the paladin/engineering trainers in Silvermoon, cozy little room with taxidermied animals. Spent a lot of time there.
---
I've already got a good amount of paid leave stocked because I'm a loser that really likes my work and very rarely takes time off, but if I didn't have a lot of paid leave, I'd be banking that.
---
Also, save up an emergency fund to afford Dr. Pepper, Combos (cheddar cheese cracker flavor obviously), Sour Patch Kids, and beef jerky.
---
I get the analogy you're going for, but the two generations of Hondas from 84-87 and 88-91 were literally some of the best built cars in automotive history.
---
Playing other games 
---
I agree with this.. also adding TBC would be a f*****g gold mine for Blizzard, they’d be retarded  for not adding it
---
My dad played Vanilla when I was younger, and got me into it when I was only 7, now I am 20 playing BFA. I can't wait to relive Classic and the fun of adventure in the start of Azeroth again! I played a Tauren hunter to level 39, but I would constantly go into BGs and play whenever I could. Or play BGs on his rogue for him in BGs. Amazing times I tell you!
---
I was 17 in '07, started a BE warlock. At first, I meleed with a dagger, only paid attention to the armor stats on gear, nothing else. Eventually I learned but wandered into STV/WPL at low levels by accident and that was pretty amusing.
---
&gt; I think my plan is to play on a main but to have all my other characters act as mainly bank vaults for items no longer obtainable or will be removed in the game. 
---
I think you're confused about how classic is going to work. It's not starting back over and going through all of the expansions that have lead to modern wow. It's just going to be vanilla wow and nothing will be removed over time.
---
Gotta throw in my two cents: 
---
You know, you always have the option of a threatmeter? Pulling aggro is easily avoided this way. 
---
And the pvp thing? After T2 that said rogue, would have to spend all of his cds for a chance to kill you. Either that, be undead or he would be your bitch.
---
Blood pact duty is usually one warlock in the tank group. 
---
Cool demons would often be sacrificed anywho.
---
Dispite what the #nochange crowd thinks, if like to see vanilla expanded in one or two ways: firstly I don't think it hurts to put another handful of quests in areas like azhara. Secondly one or two more low level and mid level dungeons could be fun. 
---
Leveled to 60 on a pserver, and leveled many other characters I wanted to try. Then got very sad because why grind hard now when I can do it for real this summer.
---
So now I’m kind of bored playing mostly old private servers of my other favorite past games. OSRS, Warhammer, Aion, stuff like that. 
---
I want it to be released already...
---
The waste paper basket! 
---
Gotta love that retail frost mages forget how to cast fireball... Wtf. 
---
My opinion is that retail is beyond redemption.  There are a lot of problems here:
---
1. Remove the features that ruined WoW for us, and you lose the current community with no guarantee you get the old community back.
---
2. One of the issues is the real money store.  Now you either need to remove those assets or find a way to earn them in-game.  If you remove the assets, that will upset those that paid money for them.  If you find a way to earn them in game, players will know that half the characters with those items bought them instead.
---
3. If you start removing the cross-realm stuff, you're going to break some guilds apart.
---
4. You have several expansions worth of baggage, which is why a lot of the changes went in.  If you make Vanilla leveling speeds, nobody will ever hit 120.  If you make everyone level professions like they did in WotLK - where you have to go through the Vanilla and TBC content first - then players will have to level through 825 points of professions.  If you have set levels for all zones, they have to redo all the balance for the entire game.  If you get rid of LFG, now you've gotta figure out how to make it work better for leveling dungeons.  Lots of mechanics that have been done for several years would have to be redone for every expansion.
---
5. If you make the game require more prep time, then players who already have stuff would be in a great advantage.  For example, if you made it go from taking a week to level to cap, to making it take 6 months, then a new player will be way behind where someone else might have leveled 20 characters in the same amount of time before.
---
Honestly, this is why I've wanted a WoW 2.  I think a game with a \*few\* modern niceties (mostly in the UI) but true to the original WoW would be great.  The more WoW exists, the less I think it's possible that we could get that.  Classic is definitely superior to live as an MMORPG, but I'd like something that's the essence of Classic, but made for 2019.  I don't trust any game studio to get it right, because nothing has surpassed the Classic/TBC/WotLK era of WoW.
---
Museum approach includes post-naxx content.  It's called TBC.
---
&gt;  For those seeking to play as a meme spec, turn on your brain and let those fuckers see that you are worth to be accepted
---
And that is the entire point , should some specs be " meme spec " ? , for what? just cuz the developers did not get to fixing them due to obvious time constraints? .
---
FFXIV and Dark Souls
---
I've leveled and am raiding on a pserver. The server is so matured there are literally Naxx PUGs.
---
People that think vanilla servers die after Naxx is on farm are sorely mistaken. The top of the top, while some of them do leave, they mostly become more casual and start goofing around.
---
Plus there are always "newcomers" constantly progressing. There are guilds progressing Naxx and even some new guilds in MC with fresh 60s.
---
Playing on a pserver is very easy. I initially only made toons there to decide on a face/hair combo lol...
---
Made a spreadsheet with all the characters by name, class, and professions.  Also have a 5 step plan for each character for the first part of my game
---
Wiped my 32 inch curved screen HP all in one. Got a dedicated 1Gig line. Looking at a new ergonomic chair.  You know, the usual.

**&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA - PVP| Semi-Hardcore** 
---
Undaunted will have a decent core of players that have played for many years in both live and private servers but even if you are new to classic we are accepting all. But we do want dedicated players that will stick around and help. We are wanting to do both PVP and PVE. Our goal is to progress at a strong pace but leave no one behind in the roster. We are recruiting all classes.
---
**&lt;Rules&gt;**
---
Be kind and don't push elitism onto others. Just be respectful and polite and get to know the other members of the guild. Raid members are expected to be prepared to show up to raids on time and be ready to pull but remember to enjoy the game as well and not take it so serious. 
---
**&lt;Raid Time&gt;**
---
We do not have a set raid time as most likely a lot of members might have different schedules by the time classic releases but we will get together and establish a raid time that works for majority.
---
**&lt;Discord&gt;**
---
We have created a new discord channel that will have class/boss guides to help inexperienced classic wow players to look for good information for help. If you are an experienced player we encourage you to post tips into the correct class/boss tabs accordingly to help out. Feel free to join us and chat: https://discord.gg/y8rBXsJ

Or add me personally at Feral#0846
---
Seasons like Diablo, fresh/paragon/something where you can get a fresh vanilla server ever 18-24 months. Some sort of cosmetic/mount/pet/toy or something that carried over to the new season.
---
If they force me to move to TBC or just leave the same Vanilla server up for 10 years, I'll drop Blizzard forever. They can't be so ignorant to ignore the "fresh" meme. People like seasons and fresh starts in all these types of games, so they better implement some kind of season/fresh system for Classic long-term. Reincarnating your character... Something....
---
I have to disagree on the TBC stuff. I first played in TBC and TBC was great, but I think it was the first step in the wrong direction that took wow to where it is now. Firstly, TBC introduced the more theme park-esque design we see now. You were no longer just an adventurer, but instead a grand hero sent to uncover the misdoings of illidan and the plans of the burning legion and all that. The world felt more tailored to the experience of the player rather than just a persistent world that you were only a tiny part of. I would love to see vanilla expanded upon without the use of “expansions” in the sense of huge themed content release with an epic thematic tale to accompany it. Maybe something like the ESO model would work where it’s mostly smaller content releases and little goings on that your character hears about and goes to discover then every once in a while a themed “expansion” but one that doesn’t just completely overhaul the entire game and basically reset. I think that process of resetting and every expansion having to get more “epic” in some sense is what led us so far astray. 
---
If you think people are playing D2 alone you are sorely mistaken.
---
Russian neckbeards in their mom's basement have it working.
---
Tell that to the dudes over at /r/2007scape
---
Becuase the average bfa cod player will not cope with classic, it's too demanding for them. 
---
There was an NPC you could talk to that would cleanse this debuff IIRC. 
---
Divia 19 hunter, Prissie 19 Priest. Good times.
---
Not that I'm the most hard-line NoChanger ever, but if I were this is what I'd say.
---
The game doesn't need to be kept fresh, and it doesn't need a large, active player base. When it inevitably declines in population, *that's okay.* The game's integrity as a historical piece is more important than tacking more stuff on at the end, even if ends up being good stuff because that's an unnecessary risk.
---
There are private servers for other MMORPGs like EQ's P1999, FFXI's Nasomi, and while they're far from perfect, and they aren't booming in population, they've been trucking along perfectly fine without taking OSRS's route. Blizzard is under no obligation to make Classic+, and asking for it is kind of missing the point of a recreation/restoration of WoW as it used to be.
---
If Classic absolutely must be kept fresh and active, they could try seasonal servers emulating the private server scene's F R E S H meme.
---
Think i will do something like this just when the date is announced. 
---
I doubt it. Activision Blizzard increasingly censors its content, particularly for the Chinese audience.
---
Seemingly no one noticed that in the WC3 remake cinematic, the orc and human hands at the end of the cinematic are no longer cut off but instead are intact - due the China frowning upon dismemberment.
---
Due to corporate and global pressures, Activision Blizzard will become more censured, not less.
---
Unfortunately, it would be extremely unlikely they would bring that back.
---
This is the one time I'd happily pass up an item to a ret pally.
---
Classic needs to be just that - classic.
---
No need to keep changing it. It doesn't matter if people stop playing *after years.* New players will come just as some leave. Servers can merge if they must.
---
There has to be a preservation of *classic* WoW, and that's what Classic WoW is meant to be. An authentic recreation of the classic experience of Vanilla WoW.
---
And are they playing in groups of 40 (raid) or 80 (AV) people? And if they do, does this happen often?
---
Because I remember how Warcraft III evolved over the years and extreme difference between frequency with which I was able to play custom maps (that weren´t DotA) and how that frequency decreased as years passed.
---
Could I still play them today? Sure. But would I be able to log in and play them any evening I wanted? Nope, because the community became smaller.
---
1. Kill the other faction
---
No there is no way I would play again. So I don't care what the current devs do and don't need.
---
They would need to do a full reboot. I mean social media is such a big part of a lot of people's life and you tell me they think they can be successful with no social interaction in an mmo?
---
They have completely fucking lost the plot. 
---
&gt; A rogue resisting your fear by chance or removing it WINS a fight. Similarly, resisting a rogues stun can singlehandedly win or lose a fight. Just because something is passive and isnt actively controlled by the player, doesnt make it less valuable
---
Yes it does. 
---
&gt; Do you NEED to be a specific spec? No, but their are optimal specs. Do you NEED to take engineering? No... Do you NEED to be a specific race? No... They all add up.
---
Specific specs significantly increase your damage and survivability.
---
Engineering **directly** increase your potential to damage/stun and counter other classes. 
---
Races sometimes do that too. 
---
&gt; And Orc offers a MASSIVE, yes massive, advantage in pvp.
---
Only 30% of the time. 
---
&gt; Correct. But most serious PvPers will choose Orc anyways
---
So everyone who's ever gotten to R13/R14 as an UD Warlock is no serious PvP-er? 
---
&gt; because they want every advantage they can get. 
---
Because they're tryhards, simple as that. They have no confidence in their skills or ability but they still want to fit in a place by imitating others. 
---
&gt; You also wont be cast out if you dont have engineering... Ive even premaded with some people who didnt take the time to get first aid... Does that make first aid useless? Every. Advantage. Matters. They all add up.
---
Yes, but some advantages are more significant than others. If First Aid only healed you 30% of the time, I don't think I'd bother telling people they NEED to have it. 
---
&gt; Orc. Is. Better. You can squirm and scream and have a tantrum, but its better.
---
It might be, but it is not "FAR BETTER, UBER BETTER, MASSIVE ADVANTAGE" the way you prescribe it. You can lie to yourself that you (or anyone else) playing that race has a MASSIVE UBER advantage in PvP and anyone who doesn't play this master-race is not "serious" but you'll just be coming across as a tryhard. 
---
And I'm not worried about convincing you otherwise, it's just that I don't want this kind of advice to keep permeating in a bubble towards newer players. There's plenty of high-ranking PvP-ers who play UD, the argument should've ended right there from the stat. 
---
&gt; RNG wins fights
---
It wins them sometimes. And though Hardiness does have more value on a long enough timeline of games, you are overestimating it in terms of its actual effect on the result of all outcomes. If you're winning a duel just because of a 30% chance, then it's likely you're going to lose it 70% of the time. The people who actually win in duels often do so because they have engineering + on-use + consumables, not because of Hardiness. I've never seen a R13/R14 not have those, but I've seen R13/R14 not play Orc. That's how you determine what is and isn't essential and that's why playing Orc is not on par with everything else listed there. 
---
One kill only. I don't like corpse camping people and the only time I'd consider it is if that person has been going out of their way to attack me constantly.
---
All of this means nothing in context of Classic. Classic is a way to relive old days of WoW. It is not meant to be "new MMORPG with old-school mechanics".
---
And with this purpose in mind, release of TBC Classic is much more logical than developing new content for Vanilla.
---
Eh
---
Exactly. I think even really idealistic people who want a "Classic+" with all their hearts should understand this sentiment.
---
They 100% would not. M+ now is literally aoe pull+ kite and stealth skips. 
---
Paladins that can't buff a raid properly are trash. Just saying.
---
Left looks better but I am confused which is whoch.
---
19 hunter is just too fun for me to not go. Other than that? Not sure.
---
Locks are top tier dps in naxx.
---
War is war.
---
They don't give me a reason why the Horde needs this jungle in its campaign against the Alliance, I'm just a soldier to them. Soldiers don't ask questions.
---
When I'm knee deep in tigershit and jungle vegetation, and I see this dwarf roaming through STVietnam, I have to take him out.
---
Sure, he might have a wife and kids waiting for him back home, but this man is told the same thing they told me, and that is, that he's the enemy. 
---
Sure, he could be a low-level just minding his business on some mission to collect gorilla-ass, but I've seen it happen firsthand where my brothers-in-arms and myself let what we believed to be an innocent man go, and right after, he alerted his buddies, and all of sudden we're being ambushed on all sides.
---
Do you know how it feels to hold your best-friend and watch him tick down to some Warlock DoT and all you can say is "Its gonna be okay" fully knowing he's doomed? 
---
I don't think about the men, gnomes, and dwarves I've killed. That doesn't keep me up at night. What keep me up at night is the ones that escaped, because for all I know is they went off and killed my brothers out here with me.
---
So when I knock my arrow, and point it at that dwarf's head, just know its nothing personal. War is war. 
---
They play in groups of 8, the party limit in D2.
---
The D2 meta is +90% running chaos runs or baal runs as 8 people over and over again. People still do this, mostly with PUGs, sometimes as 8 friends or a premade.
---
There are other activities to do and specific things to farm like runes, which people do together.
---
More than 90% of all D2 play is probably done multiplayer, even leveling (which is almost always done with the aid of higher level players).
---
There is extremely active trade, active chat lobbies, the whole game is active. People aren't playing D2 to play alone.
---
Seasons don’t work, imo. They have a sort of half-life where some people will be excited about it, but many will leave when they start, many will leave during and eventually low participation. Diablo is pretty much a dead game at this point and seasons have done nothing to help that. 
---
Legality is a fragile barometer for ethics. They did something shitty and deserved to get called out for it.
---
The same country that allows a dog meat festival...
---
I don’t care about the ethics of the matter. Doing so will prevent a civil discussion without change, due to the fact what is good or bad ethics is subjective.
---
But Classic isn’t a private server. For blizzard to keep running it, they will require some commercial incnentive to do so. I’m certainly all for keeping an intact vanilla server that doesn’t ever progress past that point, but the whole project needs to keep players engaged otherwise it will be cut off from resources and eventually closed down. I guess part of my question is: is that preferable to “Classic+”? Are you opposed to Classic+ if there’s a legacy server that stays 1.12 forever? 
---
Why do people want to play Zandalari trolls so bad?
---
The gap between mages and locks isnt that big as it may look from this threat. But yeah, warlocks are considered slightly worse than mages in terms of damage output, they are largely sought after though for their curses in raids. A general rule is that locks tend to be more utility based opposed to mages. They have more tools in their disposals, curses dots summons healthstones etc. Mages are the glass cannons that produce huge crits. Locks are the ones that have better sustain and can last longer. Also Life Tap is amazing. If you feel like playing a warlock, dont be scared to do it. They are amazing and have a pretty different feel from a mage. They are very demanded and by the time AQ and Naxx hits, they get almost on par with the mages. 
---
The population will decline greatly though. Very greatly, as it did in OSRS. I remember seeing sub-10k concurrent on OS homepage right before the release of Zulrah(one of the first major unique content updates on OSRS) and now its pretty consistently at 100k. I just say this to show the ratio of interest in the game to the ability to actually bring in and maintain a player base. I don’t think Classic is an exhibit in a museum for most people and I think dead servers will sap people’s resolve pretty hard as far as nochanges goes, but that remains to be seen. 
---
I started a NE Hunter when I was 12 and then my step dad started playing as well and he levelled a Druid.
---
Once I saw him use Cat Form, I instantly reloaded and a Druid was my main all the way until WotLK. I quit a few months after the Colosseum(Conquest?) came out.
---
I always disliked my Druid but I felt I had to stick with the character that had been through it all.
---
In Classic however, I think I will be playing a Warlock, (or maybe a hunter... I haven't decided!)
---
I was just trying to explain why people were upset about it, not start a debate on ethics, sorry for any confusion.
---
Twist: China bans all foreign game publisher's IPs after Blizzard spends money for the Chinese games, resulting in a huge loss on Blizzards part as they basically commit sudoku.
---
I'm going to buy a couple of ounces of weed and my I'm going to heal every dungeon while leveling with my best friend of 20 years. Hippy Tauren Shaman is going to blaze to 60.
---
I’ve read about about this event and the people who were mostly upset about it were religious and took that in consideration on a video game ( the Westboro Baptist church used to be serenity now when a couple of their church community played wow.)
---
let me know if you find a way to play it on windows 10. I also had simcity 2000 in that stack. good times
---
Pretty much yes,
---
You see 2hand fury is gets hitcapped at 9%. Once you start getting AQ gear, you have a hard time staying below this just because all the amazing dps items all give hit, though possibly if we have the overpowered version of Bonereavers edge you could prolly 2hand in AQ too.
---
I have to disagree with that also. I think Classic is a philosophical rejection of modern wow in favor of an old wow. It manifests itself at first as a reincarnation of vanilla and maybe it’s best that it stays that way, but maybe not; that’s the essence of the debate around it, I believe. 
---
Idk anything about your relationship beyond that 1 comment, but if your wife is truly that unreceptive to something she knows you love, that seems like a pretty big red flag. 
---
Shes supposed to be your best friend, not someone you have to sneak your passions around for fear of criticism.
---
I would like to see content planned for Vanilla but made the cutting room floor. 
---
Wouldn't be a full expansion just some added content here and their. 
---
Not everything.
---
I would also like to see added quests in dead zones. But that's me.
---
If Chinese gold farmers can aoe level on 7k pop servers, then I'm sure somebody can aoe level on 2.5k pop servers.
---
I can see where you’re coming from, which is why I’m sure they’d leave up a legacy server that stays 1.12 and leave a window for people to make clones of their current characters or something so that that world is always there, I guess I’m more getting at the essence of opposition to post-naxx content, rather than protectiveness of vanilla. I think vanilla will be preserved in some way or another because blizzard would piss off too many people not to, as long as the whole “Classic” project remains commercially viable. 
---
Ah, remember soloing that dragon while being under 60 as a holy/shadow priest. Was such a challenge. Sadly I seem to have lost screenshots I took from the kill. Weird enough I never saw that dragon alive after that.
---
Warlocks are just as strong as mages in end game PvE content (meaning Naxx) and can be quite strong in PvP however it requires high skill to pull off; the difference between a good warlock and a bad warlock is greater than possibly any other class.
---
Warlocks aren't as popular as mages for many reasons: Not as strong in early raids, more of a utility class, requires more pre-raid preparation time because of soul shards, lack of mobility or 'oh-shit' buttons (Blink/Ice Block), damage limitations with debuff slots, and old Vanilla bias still set in.
---
Mages offer a fairly easy playstyle with high reliable damage output and even the highest possible dps in the game (with rolling ignite). With their access to teleports/portals, strong slowing aoe, and free food/water they offer a strong solo experience that is more tempting than the group oriented warlock.
---
Check [Raserisk's AQ40/Naxx Boss Guides](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQdjATUIMPRiV9_a3xer6Q/videos?disable_polymer=1) to see Warlocks consistently top the dps charts on most fights. (Keep in mind this is from a pserver so there might be some small differences when Classic releases)
---
Check [Drakedog's PvP videos](https://youtu.be/NZIg4OZlA-4) to see high-level warlock PvP. Warlocks probably require the most skill of any class to play effectively in PvP; any warlock can fear, dot, fear spam but it takes a truly skilled player to use the entire warlock kit effectively. 
---
Enhancement or elemental?
---
TBC/Wrath is when the subscription numbers peaked massively. This is when so many new and old players fell in love with WoW.
---
I personally love TBC but Wrath, not so much. Neither will be as good as Vanilla TO ME, but I'll never put down the people who want it as badly as I wanted Classic to happen. They deserve their game too.
---
I personally think that rolling out fresh servers periodically is the best option.
---
I say start with 3 years for the first wave and stick to that plan, if all 3 versions of the game are available, they can schedule the rotation to allow for at least one xpac to roll out a fresh server every year.
---
I play for said 2.5 years and quit. People who want infinite vanilla are insane.
---
They should periodically release fresh servers thus allowing people to reroll and enjoy the new server feeling of not being behind the raidlogger power curve. This cycle has kept people coming back to vanilla pservers for years.
---
Yeah we’re definitely rolling on a PvP servee
---
Blizzard gets money from subs you know? Classic will be a low maintenance game like HOTS now is. It doesn't need million of players to run. Heck there are still Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3 servers around without Blizz getting money from those games.
---
i will nolife the shit out of classic. never played it before. there is no better time to be a neckbeard :D
---
This isn't a modern game that's designed to keep people logging in daily forever, and having a beginning and an end to the adventure is a part of the fundamental design. Long term retail players and private server first-timers tend to have a weird attachment to material things they own and can’t even fathom the idea of starting over. What really matters is that you get to play a fun game with like minded people because it gives meaning to what you’re doing, and that’s exactly what vanilla wow offers.
---
The meta shifts around so much depending on what patch the server is in that you’re happy to do BRD and UBRS a multitude of times on a new character again after you’ve been struggling with AQ and Naxx content for a year, as long as you get to do it with your buddies.
---
I doubt people who call for post-naxx content truly understand how much the game breaks down after tons of people get decked out in quality gear. Everybody runs around one-shotting each other while plebs can’t even 4v1. The only thing the game needs by that point is a reset which means either TBC or another Vanilla server.
---
The developers who are responsible for the greatness of the two first expansions haven’t worked there for a decade, and the ones who are left don’t have the first idea of what a good game looks like. If creating a game by “just taking the philosophy” was that simple, everyone would be doing it. As weird as some aspects of vanilla might sound, very few of them don’t make sense in the grand scheme of things which is why the game still holds up today.
---
That´s what she said!
---
The devs literally said Classic is going to be a museum piece we always can go back to. It's a recreation of the old game, not a relaunch of WoW.
---
"Seasons" have sustained private servers for years. 
---
best take in the whole thread
---
Ditto. Those were the times. Pirated so much stuff and hosted a dc++ hub.
---
15 years running :o
---
That dude in the comment section was absolutely triggered beyond belief. 
---
warlocks are the 2nd best leveler, mage is like 4th.
---
warlocks are the strongest 1v1 class and the mage counter.
---
they have 1 spot in premade pvp (with mages getting 2-3)
---
3-4 raid spots (mages have 3-7)
---
they do lower damage than mages in MC patch
---
they are on par once ZG comes out
---
Classic is a one time journey. It's okay for it to die after naxx. 
---
Again, I probably oversold it a little ...bit not a lot 
---
You could argue that having multiple pets for different roles is a RPG element. On the other hand a hunter bonding with his pet and having one "best friend" around for his adventures is arguably a even bigger RPG element. And that is why ppl have been pissed off. They needed to stop using the one pet they were playing with trough all their adventures for years and needed to use random pets that they have no bond with. 
---
i just decided which race and class i want to play and which professions i will chose. i think preparing to much (like leveling routes or something) would spoil my fun.
---
These words are from WC3 where one of the Night elf inspirations was Arabic. Also why they had a muezzin singing in their soundtrack. 
---
There was a guy who used to do similar things in my first guild that I didn't like because he whined in gchat about everything irl constantly and was never offline, but he loved his Teldrassil.  I would just chain create new night elves and mail my warrior the stuff after graciously accepting the gifts and then delete them.  Gotta farm gold somehow.
---
Thing is, people didn't care about the RPG problems in TBC and Wrath because the progression was worth it.
---
People notice more because it's the only thing in the game.
---
I agree.
---
Problem is the same can be said for Classic and we've been asking for Classic servers since Cata dropped.  (Some for even longer).
---
They pretty much went too far and retail is now a completely different game with a completely different playerbase. Those guys dont want any of the RPG elements, they want it exactly like that. Changing it to RPG would make them lose all of those players, so you pretty much have to launch a different project. I think they went too far and retail cant really be "fixed" at this point 
---
Yea, no.
---
A dad reporting for duty !
---
&gt; One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, we're in the WOW Classic business forever. Once that starts, there's a commitment on our end that we're going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft. I think there will be people that come and do the nostalgia trip, they go to the Barrens and find Mankrik's wife, and then they're done. That's fine. Some amount of people, however, are going to create a new Classic community and that's what we'll be providing.
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-04-wow-classic-blizzard-answers-some-of-the-big-questions
---
Of course you could still go the "It's Activision" route, but I'm currently going to assume they're not blatantly lying about everything.
---
Maybe on low key's, on high key's, esp last season (i didn't do high key's current season yet) both hard and soft CC was very important to handle the Infested affix and actually succeed. 
---
I really hope I can find a relaxed endgame guild that has a single raid night weekly.. aint no body got 3 free nights a week for gaming like old times 
---
Hell yeah it would be profitable. You would target a much larger audience with all 3 expansions. They should obviously launch them after some time though
---
Go to google images, search WoW classic/vanilla, add your desired resolution, and there you go.
---
This is a private server fevered dream. No other debuff in the game stacks this way, there's no reason why JoC should be any different.
---
*chuckles in Druid*
---
I personally think it’s worth the sub price just to know that your character is safe. If I’m going to put that much time into a character I like the security that comes with it being on a Blizzard server. That’s one of the primary reasons I haven’t tried out private servers. I’m happy they exist though because they have allowed a lot of good testing and I’m sure it was a huge factor in showing Blizzard there is a market for it. 
---
Yes 2 ounces should suffice for a 2-week paid time off work to play Classic. Lot's of junk food and I'll also be leveling with a close friend of over 12 years.
---
I'll be a Human Warrior, making my way to the Blasted Lands.
---
I did this with my twink on a wotlk pserver, got the first 6 one without anyone showing.
---
I levelled it to lvl 10 to get stealth and sap. Managed to get a lot trinkets from some lvl 30+ leveller by sapping them and looting the chest while they are incapacitated (most don't have insignia).
---
My man
---
Vanilla peaked harder than TBC and Wrath if you look at growth, while Wrath had the absolute peak but growth was prety low during Wrath, almost stagnant.  
---
But during Vanilla the game went from 0 to nearly 8 million subs. During TBC from 8 million to around 11 million and during Wrath "only" from around 11 million to the absolute peak of 12.4 million. 
---
Did the same without the 5 step plan but have general tips for content progression like what items to hold on to. 
---
No way! I am Donwack
---
At least druid have insane healthpool and armor to make up for it. Paladin are just sub par warrior with less stats (because they don't have warrior tiers set), while not able to push crushing blow and hold single target threat.
---
Yeah and taunt isn't gonna help him if he can't keep threat on single target fight. 90% of boss are not tauntable. 
---
His goal is to archive all rare mobs. Which I think is really cool
---
Myself (and others) are mad because we can't use our favorite weapons now because they don't offer the best dps (specific weapon types have either crit, stun, or double strike talents available for them) 
---
That's one of the worst places they ever added "rpg" elements.
---
If you'll play on EU, definitely! It's a shame things fell apart after the shutdown. I miss muh bois. 
---
Yes but so many people started late enough in Vanilla to where they never hit 60 before TBC therefore the end game content at 70 was their prime WoW experience. 
---
You already know there's a huge crossover of Classic fans who love TBC and will play it. I don't don't see them passing up that opportunity which could be considered a safer route next to creating new content geared towards the essence of Vanilla.
---
Somewhere in Blizzcon (iirc, or some other source) they said they don't care if it's 2 servers or 200 servers, paraphrasing here.
---
It does put the onus of population management on Activision Blizzard's back, though. They need to merge servers as needed, or offer one way transfers, or whatever it is to solve it.
---
They're already thinking about these issues as evidenced by the fact that they're considering all the day 1 "tourists" and their impact on pops.
---
I think it's a more global strategy than just specifically China which just happens to be a big market (but so could be India in the future). They don't want to be censored anywhere and they wish for their products to reach everybody, regardless of culture differences. For better and for worse.
---
If /camp won't work like in private servers, then you can logout(escape &gt; logout) and then let leader kick you out and then login and u should spawn outside instance too.
---
Yeah man, we had a few games post shutdown, but that was it. Damn, forgot about the servers not being global... I know Rapownzi is EU, but most others like bb and zz are NA. 
---
I have many awesome screenshots that I look back to from time to time, so many good memories man
---
China is the 400 pound gorilla, with such a disproportionate amount of potential profits coming from the Chinese market they really have the power to influence Hollywood and the gaming industry, even if they don't try (which they do).
---
India isn't quite there yet but it is well on its way to be a massive market. I'm not familiar with what kind of taboos or censorship they have there.
---
That’s really interesting I’ve never known about this. Frozen Throne was my first experience that time.
---
Dont forget soulstones - one less BR on your tank.
---
Whats the use for a hybrid paladin for example when you can just respec for 5g?  Having lower respec costs will also trivialize content by making min-maxing way easier
---
I've watched this evolve quite a bit the last few weeks. I've already got it bookmarked and will be using it when classic comes out. Thanks man!
---
Behind that nuance is the old debate about what is an RPG. Whether it should have many stats that you can chose while staying balanced or whether there should be maximum freedom to mimic a living universe.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the subscription fee itself. But I think one-time payment + lower subscription fee, lets say $10 for one-month payment and $7,50/month for a 6-month payment would be more fair. The main reason is that there's no expected further development of the game, classic WoW only costs will be keeping the servers and customer service running.
---
If I planned to play a lot, it would be a different story I guess.
---
From rogue pov it may be cool to vanish blinds and other tricks, but isn't this behavior responsible for million stupid vanish breaks from pet attacks etc. ? I considered vanish to be broken during live TBC, a bug which blizzard wasn't able to fix at the time. 
---
Very casual, it will depend on where BfA is going - i am stil enjoying this thanks to the great guild i am in but if that falls away i might be more serious in Classic.
---
People who played at launch will soon be dodging the first casts. Something tells me they should have stayed and fought. 
---
Warlock had the "Hellfire" master key at every door.
---
thanks for the guide, just wanted to ask what professions are you planing to go for?
---
And wear cloth dresses as well :D
---
Mine is far more easier - kill them all and let god sort them out. I wont go out for a hunt on lowbies, but if an opposite faction crosses my path ill attack him, whatever his level.
---
I think the RPG elements were still strong back then because they still had good characters to make the story interesting. Now, it's kind of just confusing. The raid content is higher quality than it has ever been, pretty much objectively. The fights are always introducing new and interesting mechanics and the fights get increasingly complex every xpac. Raid content isn't the issue, making the raids feel meaningful and giving players something to strive for is the issue. 
---
While I hope that you are right, unfortunately we don't really know that. 
---
The day Classic goes the osrs route, is the day i quit the game.       
---
I'm here for something i know and like, not something i may or may not like.
---
awesome stuff!
---
About Spellweaver's turban: the internet has some conflicting information about when this item was added to the game. If it is available it is superiour to everything you can get in MC, if not I like the fact that you list an alternative for it, many people will forget about that. Also the turban is fcking hard to get, since half the groups only do rend... Good job!
---
This isn't a private server though. It's going to be one, consolidated server(yes, a few of them, but more consolidated as in all blizzard servers). It's going to play out differently and there will be less of a cyclical nature to it where some players go and some come. You will get huge spikes of players early on then a long term decline in active players. How severe that decline is is up for debate, but it would be astonishing if it didn't play out that way. 
---
Lol nice one, besides the trinket does the chest give good loot? i'm playing on a tbc server and I get maybe 1-2 level 40ish greens.
---
Could easily make 1g pretty early for food/water and get ahead by reducing downtime.
---
Well, that is interesting. Either way, they will still strive to make it commercially successful, but always being subject to the will of the players, since this project is being done at the demand of their players. 
---
Lol same.
---
I'm worried about there being too many servers too, unless there are cross-realm BG's. Anyway, I sent a message. Hope to meet old friends on the new classic servers.
---
Damn I used to rock those rare mobs with my frost mage back in 2008. This game was just something else
---
I remember a raid evening would last about 4 hours - but notice that a lot of time is wasted getting the group together, after a wipe getting everything back buffed up etc and also preparing for a pull took a longer time then nowadays. That will be part of the vanilla 40 man raiding experience :D
---
Thank you! I started in wotlk but i will be playing classic as a mage!
---
I'd like it to change.  People are far too stubborn and utterly intoxicated by their own nostalgia although that is something I'm sympathetic to.  That said, additions like that are just not going to happen.  There's not really anything they can do.  Even if you wanted to do new raids, you couldn't make the gear much more powerful without the game's systems just breaking down (see last year of Wrath of the Lich King).  So without better gear, not enough people will be interested to make new stuff worth it to develop.
---
What they should do is fix mostly broken specs, but that technically has nothing to do with keeping Classic going like you're saying.
---
If you want to level quick and efficient reserving time is good, but having a pre-made group to work together is even better. If you are far ahead of the main population you will find it hard to group up for dungeons as an example, or group quests. So try to find some friiends and team up!
---
Sorry i don't see "many" people playing Classic for 18 hours a day.
---
You have not finished classic until you have completed Naxx on all races/class combinations. So there is quite a future still :D. After completed this, we can start talking about adding content - but that would be TBC i guess and im not sure Blizzard want to redo the XPacs as well.
---
The only change we would want on loot is to remove the NEED option for hunters.
---
Nothing.
---
*Why* does it have to be kept "fresh" and have an "active player-base"?
---
The only *real* reason to ask this question is to want to play it forever and want to change it to suit you as you play.
---
You have played Vanilla then they changed it so it remained "fresh". Now it's shit, so you don't like it. They are now bringing back Vanilla. "Yeah! Let's play it! But Blizzard should change it *again*, so I can continue to play it!"
---
If Blizzard fucks it up *again*, you'll have had your fill *twice*. If not, you'll certainly had your fill twice and can continue playing. "They are catering to me!" Who cares about others. Don't you see how selfish that is?
---
What about those people who want Vanilla? Shall they petition Blizzard to bring back Vanilla *again*? Shall we have a "WoW Classic - Classic"? It's idiotic.
---
WoW Vanilla is historic game. A very important part of gaming culture. Even an important part of general culture. It should be available for everyone, at any time.
---
Also, it's part of WoW. It's *not* a separate game. It's *WoW*. WoW is being updated. You want fresh content? Wait for the next patch/expansion.
---
Actually this is how Blizzard sees it too. It'll be a "server option" for WoW, not a separate game. You'll get access to it by paying for *WoW*. And they'll keep it running, regardless of how many people play: "once we’re committed to doing this at a Blizzard level, which we are, whatever happens is going to happen. If millions of people show up and play for years, that’s awesome. And if just tens of people show up and play for years, we’re fine either way." - Brack
---
lure your guild to classic
---
Well, the two aren't mutually exclusive. You can have a vanilla server that remains intact and have a classic server with more content, so the whole premise of your argument is flawed. I don't think the quote from blizzard demonstrates what you think it does either. I think he's more making a commitment to keeping servers up, rather than pristine...meaning you're over-interpreting that statement. 
---
Yeah you can do some stuff with a spellpower build, but it wouldn't be Seal of the Crusader that you're using. You'd want to use Seal of Righteouesness, because how SoR works is that the yellow  damage works as if it's an additional melee swing in terms of giving you a chance to proc abilities... i.e. you have fiery enchant on your weapon and you swing with SoR active, it gives you 2 separate chances to proc fiery enchant... This works with a number of things. Weapon procs, Dragonbreath Chili, Shadow Oil... I am not convinced one way or the other if this is better than a straight physical damage build. You can put stuff together on a PTR and test, which I have, but at the end of the day you don't really know unless you can do the testing in a "real world" raid environment, and doing all the raid content because tbh every boss is different and how you need to play as a ret paladin varies from boss to boss. 
---
There are some bosses where you have to nightfall bot, and some that you can't even DPS really.
---
Ret is a fun spec to play, and if you can prove that you can at least pull your weight and give max effort, then you may be able to find a guild that lets you do it. But it is generally outclassed by Rogues and Warriors on paper.
---
Also.. in reference to your OP. I wasn't a streamer when I started raiding as ret, and I can't stream my raids anymore. At this point I occasionally raidlog with Salad Bakers to try and get gear and do more testing on my original character, but if you want to watch my old streams they're all on my YouTube channel.
---
Don't be like that bro. They are not shaman, they don't understand...

Oh well...

Old times I had 5 nights a week for WoW. Now with wife and kids it'll be just the one night. But what a great night that will be.
---
I find it very hard to imagine a scenario where a non-updated "1.12 forever" Classic would eventually fail to the point where it would be unable to keep players engaged and be cut loose. Even outside of the statement Enua quoted in response to you - I believe a "1.12 forever" Classic would very much be a "set it and forget it" project, and that even in the face of massive decline, justifying it's continued existence would not be very hard.
---
Regardless, neither one of us (I don't think at least) are business or industry professionals, and we're only speculating as to the economic realities of the situation.
---
To answer your follow-up question, no, I would not be opposed to a Classic+ if official servers of the game as close as possible to how it was were also an option. I would probably prefer to play Classic+ in that scenario as well, provided the content is good and in the style of older MMORPG design as well. My opinion however is that making an old game playable again is more important than making a new, possibly better game. If we can have both, great, I just think it would be a damn shame if actiblizz flew too close to the sun with this project. So I argue for erring on the side of caution.
---
Screenshots are from early Nostalrius to late Nostalrius 
---
If they keep Vanilla servers around, I don't care what other things they do. So there is that.
---
Also, there is absolutely no point in changing Classic and expecting only a few people to play it. That's throwing money away on development. So yes, that quote means exactly that they'll not change Classic. (They could change their mind, of course. But I'll give them a little benefit of doubt.)
---
prob gonna no life for 1 week cause ill prob burn out after that.  but im planning 7 bottles of wine - 1 each night.  about 4 beers to carry me through the afternoon/early evening.  2-3 packs of cigarettes and a lot of fruit and nuts so my body doesnt die in the process.
---
good quality filter coffee for the morning too
---
If we assume for the sake of argument that they also release TBC and wotlk then it would still make sense that they make progress into the next expansion optional as the entire point with releasing classic is to give players the option to play re-live (or experience for the first time) an old version of the game. It simply wouldnt make sense to force new expansions on people that in essence want to play "That specific expansion".
---
I am 100% certain that it will be voluntary to move to the next expansion when you feel the time is right, if they decide to re-release TBC and wotlk.
---
i appreciated the night elf "demon hunter" on the box giggity goo
---
Im leveling a druid right now. First time playing the class, haven't played WoW since vanilla, so I forgot a lot about the game.
---
I'll just casually level up, do some raiding until Classic comes out. Read the guides, check out the zones I haven't leveled in.
---
This way at the start I'll know what I'm doing and I won't make the same mistakes (like going to a zone too early or skipping a zone accidently)
---
By lurking here.  I'm already prepared for years :D
---
Wonder if my blizzard bear code will work 
---
I agree. Retail is a lost cause. You can't have any kind of RPG feel to the game if people are flying around on their weird mounts, wearing all the their transmog gear. 
---
You'd have to hit the reset button. If Blizzard were the same company they used to be, then I would say the answer is to make a World of Warcraft 2.
---
AQ is dropping in one month ish on our server. So prepping for that.  NR gear and pots.
---
Keeping tabs on everything needed and saving the knowledge for Classic.
---
I love seeing these. I was going to ask for the screenshots earlier, they are great memories.
---
I love reading horde bitch posts about AV but god forbid anyone bring up wotf or orc hardiness racials being OP.
---
Well, at start even the starter zones had red mobs that aggroed you, unlike the yellow ones today. No sense of real danger anymore, vanilla always kept the level of adrenaline high for me :D.
---
I'm not booking a week off work to wait in a queue. Just shard low level areas, it'll be a decent fix, the best of a difficult situation.
---
Wasnt that Indiana Jones Dude allready in wotlk? 
---
Good luck on Stitches, even at the same level, even as a hunter or mage....
---
This would be the dream.
---
Unless I see a duel flag Ill go straight in there and hit every button I have.
---
It might have worked if you didnt bring it to peoples’ attention haha
---
I agree.  In a way, the OP is completely right in that it strongly represents some part of MMORPGs.
---
I am watching too many youtube videos trying to decide which class I ll play. Not gonna play on a private server. Just wanna hop in fresh and innocent as soon as Classic hits.
---
Depends on the guild. Do you need to flask everyone 24/7? Probably not. The private server scene really popularized going all out in speed run fashion but that isn't necessarily good all the time. 
---
Imagine being forced to flask as a rogue or shaman healer for farm content. Yikes.
---
Ahh... the big-foot-that stamped-you-into-the-ground encounters... yeah, made a lot of noise, made the ground tremble and still stepped on me quite a few times.
---
&gt;In the end pacifists will always be killed more than kill but as the human being behind the keyboard I can't rationalize being emotionally weak and pretty 24/7.
---
??
---
If the enemy player rolled on a PvP server, presumably they are fine with me trying to attack them.
---
The only weak behaviour is being too spineless to attempt the fight.
---
That's fair. I would hope that as long as any version of Classic existed, there would be at least one pristine classic server, just for those people who are actually *that* in love with it. I agree with pretty much all of what you said. I would hope, since it's such a player-driven project anyway, that if they did do post-vanilla content, they would implement a polling system like OSRS, where a large majority of players have to vote yes to new content, although it might be a tricky situation because some people might vote no to everything just to be spiteful, but I don't know. Some way to let the community have veto power over things. I don't know if you've played or know about OSRS, but content updates are, in many ways, negotiated between developers and players. It's a pretty unique dynamic. Basically, they give an outline of an update, poll it, tweak the outline, poll that, make a final cut, release it, then poll further tweaks(i.e. stats on gear, drop tables, etc.). 
---
No. Consumables were an excuse made by shitty players. The reason naxx wasn't progressed was a combination of naxx being a big jump up from aq40 and the looming gear reset announcement soon after naxx release which caused a lot of why bother in guilds. You don't wipe because a few people forgot troll blood elixirs.
---
Sure you can go try hard and full buff for meters, but none (minus loatheb) is truly required if you do mechanics as you know. 
---
That describes all of Classic class design, honestly.  They just gave up towards the end because they had to get something out the door, and then they didn't have enough time to fix what needed to be fixed because they didn't have the resources to both do that and make new raids and stuff to keep people playing.  Classic was a shitty game because of it, but I understand the nostalgia.
---
your post is an odd mix of exciting and depressing. 
---
None of those bosses require GNP Pots unless you are terrible. A case could be made for rare circumstances like a dc being called out on thaddius just before a polarity switch.
---
Amen to that ! It will be amazing and I dare to say even more satisfying to plan and dedicate an evening to a dungeon/raid/set of quest in a zone  rather than coming home after school to absorb content day after day.
---
Watching Classicast have we?
---
If anyone is worried about costs just don't roll a tank or caster dps class. In doubt many guilds will go full retard and force hunters or healers to flask.
---
Yeah definitely. It will be frustrating too though. Classic is a slow grind, and spending just one night a week on it will make it even slower. 
---
But I'm in no rush. Time to chill and enjoy the world with no rush and no expectations.
---
If classic Player love wow as much as the wotlk crowd then it will stay for 10 years with Players no Problem. Like some wotlk private Servers are nearing their 10th birthday 
---
&gt; Imagine being forced to flask as a rogue or shaman healer for farm content. Yikes.
---
I did.  There is always non farm content you need to prepare for.  The fact still remains acquiring consumables is a large time investment, we're not talking strictly flasks. E'ko farming, fishing, herb gathering/songflowers, elemental farming, or just straight up gold farming to purchase the materials.
---
Yes, if the server launches with the chest spawned then it would be a good idea. Orc or Troll would get there fastest with the boat from Ratchet. I saw a video where the new character run to the arena was 8 minutes. I think there will be more than one person per server thinking that, though- I don't think it will be free. I reckon there will be enough people interested to make it an interesting lowbie challenge. 
---
"Chores"... sure. We all remember that post about paladins from old WoW forums.
---
I don't think so. In theory yes but remember that there will be a lot of people playing at launch. So even they do use sharding at launch I am still quite sure you have to wait for spawns and compete to get mobs tagged.
---
Oh please no... Why Cant classic people be like the wotlk people and enjoying one Server for 10 years :D
---
Go to r/wowservers for stuff like this. This sub is specifically about Classic WoW coming from Blizzard.
---
I'm playing WotLK (best expansion so far IMO) on a quick leveling and populated server and then I plan to play in an instant 60 server just to decide my 2-3 characters I'll choose to level up in Classic. I'm not wasting my time on a x1 server just to see those servers getting shut down once Retail Vanilla releases. I'll save the grinding for the real Classic. 
---
Basic consumables were never that hard. Only on progression content or a fight where you consistently are on the edge of not beating enrages would something like eko really be needed. Hell look at the long consum list in a lost above claiming you needed resist pots for heigan and frozen runes for God damn grand widow. Ridiculous 
---
And a cars name COULD be considered a part of its driving experience.

---
There are a lot of things you COULD do. Doesn't mean they make sense.
---
I’m taking a week off to reach lvl cap. Then raid logging on my nights off (8hours a night) and farming/etc. two hours after work every day
---
I definitely agree that many of the changes are utterly irrevocable.  Some have also been in for awhile, so many of the players like them and are used to them- in the same way that many of the changes weren't fair to players who didn't want those things, the same is true going the other direction now.  
---
I think retail is just going to keep going down the same path it is on, there's definitely a seriously large playerbase who likes at least most of that stuff.
---
I actually want to play an MMO without any content updates. Bug-changes, maybe. But vanilla WoW isn't that buggy to be honest.
---
I've played a few single player games like dozens of times, ever year I play those games, even though they have zero added content. Why can't we have an MMO like that?
---
Sure, people will go through WoW classic in a year or two, clear Naxx and leave.
---
But others will come. People who never played. People will take a break, then return a year later and create a new character in the opposite faction. Or level a new alt.
---
People will keep WoW in their PC, log in every now and then for a BG. Not to grind, but to pass the time.
---
It won't be millions of people, but enough to warrant the maintenance of a server or two.
---
He was in TBC
---
How would you know?  
---
Blizzard also said that official Vanilla servers would never happen, but now it does.  
---
I'll have to remind you that it will be much less work for Blizzard to release TBC servers, than releasing Vanilla servers.  
---
For WoW classic, they are downgrading the new client all the way down to Vanilla, which is a lot of work.  
---
For getting TBC to work, they just need to apply the patches, because they allready have a Vanilla. Just apply the patches, and voilá, you have TBC.  
---
Stop saying things are never going to happen, you have no clue.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it!
---
Its not the devs that design the game. Its the product owners and designers. Devs just implement the stuff they were ordered to implement.
---
Writing a screenplay for a B-rated horror film called Lake Everstill.  It's about a group of Alliance explorers looking for some relaxing adventures in a scenic little town in Redridge Mountains.  But shit goes horribly wrong.  There's an unfriendly indigenous population gnolls in the hills, sea creatures terrorizing the beaches, a sinister owl beast slaughtering visitors and the townsfolk. 
---
That and shit posting on here.
---
What /u/Olmaxx said!, I'm trying to document every zone before Classic launches as a helpful guide/information thingy-ma-bob.
---
Yea but they don't have a threat reduction talent like mages so their already worse damage just doesn't hold up. Perhaps that was the price for spending the entire next xpac making mages irrelevant.
---
No, they don't. Most of current players hate RPG elements and want more quick action content.
---
&gt; you get a free mount
---
That costs like 900g :/
---
Its not every single mob that has non-interesting loot, but basically what other people have been saying. Loot and items were a bit harder to come by back then and killing a rare would almost guarantee you a green item &amp; sometimes something extra special. If you also factor in the ability to sell that on the AH for some money it makes killing any of the rares quite an attractive thing to do.
---
I just really like spending time looking at all of the cool and unique creatures blizzard spent time adding into the game as well. My videos are probably not the ones you want to watch if you just want a list of the blue items in a zone, that's not really why I wanted to start making them :D
---
When will people just leave paladins alone... There is just TOO much talks about paladin viability/easiness/mechanics and so on.
---
I had a netbook with an atom n550. Tried to run 1.12 on it and it was slow even in low populated areas. 
---
Add to this, that remaster will run on a legion's engine, so it will require more resources, than 1.12.
---
May be, netbooks on atom n2xxx series will be a bit better (they have a bit better integrated gpu), but it still not enough. 
---
Out of sheer boredom earlier I downloaded the PTR for live, and copied over a level 90 hunter I had on retail and went through old dungeons from classic (you can play PTR without a sub if you just want to look around etc). Dire Maul, Mara etc etc.
---
I mean I doubt it'll take 5 hours for 1-6. There's a LOT of projected volume for launch day and they've learned lessons from previous launches. 2500 player cap (og values from John Staat) across a lot of servers divided by 6 starting zones = it won't be a total disaster. Clusterfuck? Yes. Enough of a clusterfuck for 1-6 taking 5 hours? That's like 5 mobs an hour lmao. 
---
This could work, and it could actually be a good idea, depending on sharding. I have not tested this myself, but other people have written that on launch on pservers there has been so many people in the starting zones that it is virtually impossible to kill mobs/do quests to level up. Which means the fastest way to get to level 3-4 and be able to kill higher level mobs before everyone else, is to explore. So, if you start out as a human and run all the way down to Gurubashi Arena, you will probably get level 3-4, get the trinket and be ready to kill the level 6 mobs that others will be too low to kill.
---
Usually give a few lvl 40 green, sometimes a blue (not sure if it can in vanilla) and recipes. Sometimes nothing else than the trinket. With some luck you could get 1 or 2 gold vendoring what you get in the first chest
---
&gt; What state do you HOPE that the game reaches after, let's say 2.5 years
---
All content released, nothing more changes. 
---
&gt;  if the game stagnates and active players start decreasing,
---
Server merge may be a solution.
---
&gt; what would you implement to keep the game fresh
---
I don't want 15 year old game to be "fresh", it can not and should not be. Classic means Classic.
---
&gt; and the player-base active?
---
Unless bliz starts opening new servers like pservers do, old ones will not die out completely.
---
&gt; They should periodically release fresh servers thus allowing people to reroll and enjoy the new serve
---
You mean "thus allowing non-tryhard players to constanly be in a hurry to clear content, beacuse when a new server opens the other starts dying"?
---
That was the first moment for me too. I get through a tiny bit of *actually* really cool questing, getting imprisoned in one of the max-level dungeons (which was still relevant at the time, and had a level of mystique, before heroics got ran over and over in 3 minutes and you hated the place), and escaping with a new lore character. It was all sensible fantasy lore to appreciate and be immersed in. 
---
And then you find the first Harrison Ford quest. And you think, "haha. sweet, a harrison ford reference. funny joke." And by the 3rd quest and 10th mini-cutscene, I felt like I've wasted my time. I don't care about rescuing a harrison jones paper mache of tropes for 3 hours of cutscenes and vehicle combat, to then find out I'm spending another 3 hours infiltrating *zhe enemeez*.
---
A joke or reference is cool, but goddamn, that was the first time I got frustrated with the game on a real level.
---
If i say i want vanilla to be unchanged for 5 years, that does not mean i am going to play it constantly for 5 years you know.

---
Died at the wrath gate. 
---
This is in fact why they removed Crusader Strike and Holy Strike for Seals and Judgement.  No one should be concerned this means less DPS as the spell data for both Strikes shows that Paladins would have had the same DPS even with the Strikes.  They're actually better off with Seals and Judgement because of being able to apply all of Judgement of the Crusader at once instead of having to repeatedly stack it to 5.
---
My only preparation has been to create a battle.net community with all my friends, new and old, in preparation so that we can roll on the same faction/server and end up in the same guild. Got something like 40 people, I'd be happy if 20 of those stuck around for some classic fun :)
---
It's not about what is "required". It's about setting oneself up for success. A 40 man raid without any consumes will have a much harder time than 40 people with all consumes. Some will find a a happy medium. Some go all in to have a smoother, faster run.
---
Then you won't clear naxx each week like OP asked about.
---
This... is... dragonmaw!  
---
Wasn't even funny at the time, when sparta remixes were everywhere.

I've put together a Google sheet with my class BIS lists per role (playing a hybrid means multiple gear sets), drop locations and drop rates, which stages they'll release in according to Blizz release schedule. List of items I'll need to accumulate for pre-raid craftables, for Darkmoon quests, for T0.5 questline (which I'll do for fun, even if I don't expect to need the gear). Plotted out my levelling route, when and where I need to pick up key recipes, or skill training, or acquire certain key gear items or do certain key quests. Planned out alts and where I'm going to park them. Basically playing the game on paper for a few months until launch.
---
I feel like in the last two months I've got my money's worth already just poring over classicdb and various guides.

Warrior. But you're really going to have to make an effort to socialize even though you don't need to, no matter what class you play. Even the weakest solo class warrior really doesn't need to group up with others to complete quests 99%+ of the time.
---
Or the mobs that cast a 50% miss chance on you during their fight... Especially when you fight 2 of them at the same time.
---
Disease? Not disease bro :P
---
Image the outrage that would bring today. 
---
I agree with you on the first point, Orc's are definitely better positioned in PvP due to their racials than any other race. Yet still, this isn't so game-braking to warrant a massive influx of Orcs (in my opinion). 
---
My mistake on fire mages, was pretty tired and glossed over Impact. I don't think we need to worry about concussion blow in regards to pvp, as prot warriors are entirely feeble vs 95% of every enemy. Grenades are a good point. Mace spec is still more of a rogue thing, and they already have the most stuns of any so it's been noted. 
---
Also, a good rogue isn't jumping players without their cooldowns unless it's a free kill, in which case resisting a cheapshot doesn't matter- they still have the 2 combos -&gt; 3 combos gouge -&gt; 2 more and it's CB evisc GG anyways. 
---
We both agree, Orcs have the best racial abilities out of the 8.
---
However, do you concede that as far as Alliance races go, it's all very negligible in terms of pvp? If you can't even concede that... I just don't know who I'm talking to anymore heheh.

Er. 2 long replies to 1 post. Anyways, I'll just address the Warlock vs Warrior... your spec is going to be a much more determining factor than anything else as lock vs war. Not Soul Link? Ok, go Soul Link. Now have fun devouring every Warrior within 10 ilvls of you like candy. It's a joke really, and even them proccing some lucky stuns isn't going to change that outcome when lock's have 2, 2k shields to rage-deprive a warrior...
---
I'll be silly and say the power of SL warlock is so much higher than most, let's just say they are at 200 and something like CB Prep rogue is 150. All arbitrary. Orc warlock puts em to 220, every other race, 205. It's cool, it's minmax, but it's still kind of a joke in terms of just how strong SL is, why worry about that little aspect? It's like not going out in WPvP cause you don't have a flask of supreme power and an elixir of shadow power. Really not worth the fret.
---
for real. i am on this sub every day. so often. i just cant wait :(

yeah works if the rogue is decent i guess, although demo shout is a pretty hard counter if both players have those kind of reactions :)

Hey Esfand,
---
First of all, thanks a lot for your insights, they are very valuable to me.
---
Interesing to read that you also covered a similar set-up, albeit with SoR instead of SotC. What you say is correct, we don't have enough details (procrates, coëfficients etc.) for the 'real' classic servers yet, so theorycrafting is currently a hard thing to do.
---
I kind of gave up on 'traditional' Retribution when I was looking at your raidlogs. Knowing that you have all the gear and still the logs were showing low numbers was really disheartening. I wasn't aware however that you weren't going all-in during those raids because it wasn't necessary; this gives me renewed hope! I'll go and delve into your older vids on your Youtube channel to see if I can spark the Paladin-vibe again. I do not think I'll ever post numbers of the same league as fully decked out Fury Warriors, but at least pulling my weight (a.k.a. doing more damage than the MT :p) is my intention to achieve.
---
Thanks for the buffs, see you in Classic!

Releasing new content takes tons of time and is very risky. Honestly I doubt blizzard would even be able to make content that follows the "vanilla mindset".

Releasing TBC is the only logical choice for blizzard going forward.

**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one char.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
A very looooooooonnnnggggggg time

Probably 2 years or so

Warrior is one of the hardest, if not THE hardest class to level in vanilla. In terms of pve: things will be slow due to frequent downtime, lack of travel methods, need for constantly updated gear and taking on more than a single mob is punishing. PvP, you're a sitting duck for anybody ranged that gets the jump on you. You won't have alot of tools to outplay opponents so you often end up relying on brute force and survivability as every fight quickly becomes an uphill battle. Most of that starts to quickly change for the better at about mid game though, so its also one of the most rewarding classes to play and the class fantasy is just absolutely incredible.
---
Warlocks are a breeze to level, between having a pet and the loads of resource management means you barely ever have downtime. Lots of utility will also make you a welcome addition to any group. They're well equipped for pvp as well since they have tools to deal with just about any class, even rogues who get the jump on you.
---
Rogues dominate in pvp at every stage of the game because they have options to deal with every single class, but rely heavily on being able to outplay them. If worse comes to worse, they can simply run away from an unfavorable fight. Their damage output, cc, mobility, and stealth makes pve easy to manage.
---
Both Orcs and Undead are great choices overall since they have racials that are applicable to any class. Stun resistance is a life saver in pvp and the infamous will of the forsaken doesn't need any explanation, so if you had to pick as a lock, I would think about which of those 2 racials are more attractive. Personally, imo undead benefit less as warlocks since they already have underwater breathing as a spell and their excellent downtime means you don't need to cannabalize as often but those are minor in the grand scheme of things.
---
Well classic is kind of this WoW 2. It's the reset they needed, while appealing to both of the player audiences. Pretty smart move considering that there is demand for both types. 
---
It also is a kind of test of the market. The performance of the classic servers is going to be crucial - IMO if the results are good, it could give a way to an alternative path for Blizzard to follow in similar fashion, for example launching new RPG heavy projects in the future. But that will only be the case if Classic proves there large and active audience to appeal.
---
Just remember to not google Lemon Party guys

The sad part is, they prolly make the same amount of money with 3 million players and shop as they did in WotLK with 12 million subs.

Don't worry about it

Whats a sub?

I thought Reddit was for Classic only

WSG and AB takes painfully long time to get to exalted. If you are ranking to rank 11+, you will get them no matter what, but if you are justba casual PvPer, the grind is going to be long. Possibly few months with playing 1 hour a day. The exception is AV rep that you can get a lot easier. Not only there are various quests inside the BG, but when it's AV weekend, it's entirely possible to get exalted in that particular weekend if you dedicate to it and play at least 6-8 hours a day. If not, you can just get it over the course of several AV weekends.
---
About half a year ago, I talked to my SO about my plans for Classic release. She was fine with me taking a week off from work and going hardcore leveling. And also fine with me gaming a couple of hours a day afterwards.
---
About every week since I've kept reminding her of my plans and our talk, so she has no excuse of "forgetting" what she had agreed to.

Hardcore PvE Guild, with PvP Events

The Philosophy
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, and hopefully realm first, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we only need to recruit people.
---
What we expect of you
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay.

(Preliminary) Raid Schedule (GMT+1)

Thursdays 18-23

During new content release we expect to raid when servers open up

You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or another from the Leadership. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!

---
I’m in the SAME boat with my wife. But she knows how important it is to me. I make plenty of time for her and I enjoy my time with the game. It’s a fight worth picking!
---
I fully agree with this guy. Curious to hear all of your thoughts on this.
---
Remember he's talking about only a numbers change. No changes to abilities etc.
---
Both are great classes and equal viable.
---
Warlocks have a easier time lvling and speed is about the same Get a free mount and at max their mount is at a discount altough it requires a long (fun) chain quest.
---
For PvP we do fair but less locks are required in premades. The benefit is that SM ruin is the most comon premade spec and this spec is also viable for PvE.
---
In PvE on average less locks are in raids. Early on our dps is slightly lower than mages for Classic however we will catch up allready in stage 2 of their current thinking as we then get acces to more hit items.
---
Also as we get 16 debuffs from the get go the diff wont be as big as on some other less legal servers.
---
Warlocks bring curses meaning on average guilds will bring atleast 3 (CoE, CoR, CoS). We also bring Soulstones and healthstones and Imp buff incase you are SM ruin.
---
Having a Corr slot and curse along side with managing health as a resource and managing threat makes the pve gameplay a bit more interactive aswell altough it is still mainly spamming shadowbolt.
---
For anymore faq, guides, spreadsheets and community i would highly recommend you check out the [Classic Warlock Discord](https://discord.gg/D6TrRkq).

This is my favorite WoW video of all time. It's everything I enjoy about MMOs. 
---
same here. she does not understand gaming. or like it. but she knows it is important to me. but if she nvertheless tries to stop me from playing classic, i just dont give a fuck
---
Vanilla WoW was continually being patched with tweaks and class balance. 
---
Therefore wouldn't a completely static game be more of a change? 
---
Did my job for me.
---
God wills it!
---
True but in actuality I wasn’t gaming at all when we met Bc I was knocking out 90 hour work weeks trying to build my company. So it wasn’t a thing for a long time simply Bc I didn’t have time. 
---
I disagree.
---
Even in pservers few people give a shit about optimal builds. Sure, everyone is using cookie cutter specs like in every other MMO, ever. But 99% of the guilds will have trouble getting 40-50 reliable people to raid and won't force the optimal specs.
---
Just look at those MC first kill pics. You'll see some weird specs and a few boomkins as well.
---
People will also use specs that aren't min/maxed but are good both PvE and PvP or both tanking and healing, or heal and dps.  People want to be able to do quests or farm while raiding once a week. Or hit the battlegrounds occasionally.
---
Yet I see comments in that vid talking about rouges and warriors getting r14 before MC. Bitch please.
---
Absolutely not. Neither the retard that made the video, nor OP, nor anyone at Activision Blizzard today should be redesigning Vanilla WoW.
---
If Activision Blizzard were capable of making a good MMO they would have done it in retail.
---
What we need, and what we *want*, is the classic WoW, ie Vanilla WoW.
---
okay. FUCK WHAT? cloak of shadows is not available in classic? i just started in tbc so i didnt knew that. i mained rogue a long time and will play rogue again in classic. how the fuck do you survive anything? as soon as you have a dot on you u are screwed???
---
I don't care about class balance, I will play whatever class and spec I like, I don't give a fuck if I deal 2% less DPS in high-high end content. 
---
FYI the guy who made this video is the same guy that did the popular 'World of Warcraft is garbage' video: https://youtu.be/cEzhg6HtASU
---
If you tweak the classes to make every spec viable it's basically BFA style gameplay.
---
Imagine enh shamans do on par dps as rogues. why would you need rogues then? period. why have 1 rogue in a raid? unlike rogues, enhs got reincarnation, two round of totem buffs, offheals, and all the totems utility. why you ever want to ahve a rogue in your raid? only reason rogues are in raids, cos they do superior damage, its their perk, their role, their function, there bring no utility at all.
---
Imagine you make moonkins do similar dps to mages. then in most occasions moonkins would be a preferable caster, cos they can BATTLE RES, offheal decurse, INNERVATE all HEALER. imagine how broken it'll be.  if you know anything about vanilla raiding, and how healers mana goes.
---
Also raids in vanilla arent = raids in retail, they are way less strict or hard you can say, you can run all kind of stuff. and ppl do run it, in all kind of specs, and you can explore new specs and possibilities, its not that strict. like feral dps. and so on, its really free flowing. apart from two raids which actually challenging which is  aq40 and naxx prolly.
---
In general, hard to listen to him cos he doesnt know what he is talking about. obviously didnt play on private servers, so he doesnt have a direct experience of how it all plays out, FOR REAL. not from some theoretical perspective.
---
Personally I disagree with this video for high end players. I think that we have seen with other games high-end games that try to balance things and it doesn't ever work. There's always an optimum that is never reached. Think League of Legends or even retail WoW, with every balance update, there is always a new meta and a new class, hero, weapon that rises to the top or another that falls to the wayside. 
---
As a filthy casual as well, the lack of balancing means I can play any class I want right now because I doubt that I'll get to 60 and pretty much most classes are viable for the 1-60 grind and dungeons etc.   
---
Having said that, as Classic is going to be here to stay, maybe there's more chance of me getting to 60 at some point and at that point, if my class isn't 'viable', I'll be sad. It's a tough one, but I ultimately disagree with the video and think it should stay as is. 
---
I'd say more like BC style gameplay. I'd say BC was the time that class balance was best.
---
&gt; playing a Mage in Classic will mean I'll have longer dungeon queues 
---
Should we tell him, guys?
---
You can disagree with people without calling them retards.
---
This guy is looking at this in an elitiest veiw from an elitest standpoint in order to justify his own wishes for change, sighting it as a fix for a problem that hasn't happened, he made up and is apparently huge.
---
He clearly has little to no idea about game design if he believes his suggested changes wont effect how the game plays.
---
At the end of the day there are MANY issues with Vanilla. And this project needs to include them all imo. It should be as close to a 100% recreation as it can be, regardless of playstye.
---
I actually disagree with him too, I dont think it'll happen and I don't think your skrewed if you play whatever isn't optimal. I can be damn sure of this even, as boomkins will have a place in my guild alongside other "useless" specs. Like I said he's using elitism to justify his changes.
---
Can we stop with this now? Seriously? You guys cried for changes and were told it wasn't wanted, then you lobbied for change again and Blizzard said no because that isn't what this is about. Now? Your making videos using fear and elitism to try and get people on your side who just haven't though deeply about it.
---
Just stop. There's not going to be any reworks or changes with the ecwption of B-net and some behind the scenes coding. Let it go. 
---
It will cost a few bucks, but Wallpaper Engine on Steam allows you to have animated wallpapers. There's quite the selection of Warcraft ones in the Steam workshop, and to help pass the time I've been making some Classic WoW wallpapers of my own!
---
If the private server even a slight reflection of what Classic will be like, then finding a group for a dungeon at 60 as a healer will be horrible.
---
Seems like every man and his dog remembers the days of healers being rare and in high demand. So they've all decided to play one now.
---
Ok that's great, however you write "I dont care if loot sharing is a thing and that ninja looters won't be back".  
---
That would be a misunderstanding - with loot trading, a class of sinister, lucrative and systematic ninja looting is made possible. Loot Ransoming: You enter a pug raid pretending to not have certain epic items that might drop during the raid, so you can roll on it. When they drop, you and your friends (all of the correct armor class) roll on it. You take note of who also rolled. After the raid, you whisper the other rollers and tell them that you didn't really need the item as much as they, and to be nice to them you wouldn't mind loot-trading it in exchange of 50-200 gold... (the fact is you didn't need the item at all, this was a gold getting scheme all along). If they call you on it, you just deny it openly and/or call them on their "harassment".  
---
Loot ransoming is a way to abuse loot trading in a systematic and lucrative way, that was never possible wit vanilla need-ninjaing. In short, vanilla ninja looters are kindergarten amateurs in comparison to the loot ransoming scammers that may run rampant as a consequence loot trading. Thx for being aware.
---
Based on what you've said, and what you have in mind, I would reccomend Priest for you.
---
I was also torn on the same question, but I had other pros and cons I considered, I ended up going mage, but for you Priest sounds the best. :)
---
This is gonna go well..
---
Hear hear.
---
Me too man, 2004 is gonna be lit!
---
Perfectly wording my thoughts after reading this post
---
Once classic releases, I would forget about tinder though...
---
You can disagree with people's choice of words without feeling the need to type it out and adding nothing relevant to the topic at hand. Yet here we are.
---
[I think the new one looks better.](https://i.imgur.com/orJWeLd.jpg) Much more demonic dominatrix and less anorexic bikini.
---
Enhancement Shamans were nearly competitive with Rogues in BC and there would still be plenty of both classes being included in raids. Personally I see BC as the peak time of class balance. 
---
Not preparing at all.  
---
There's absolutely no hurry, it's useless to "get ready" for it.
---
no you are wrong, there's no need to panic. Keep the rpg elements, we don't want a homogenisation like retail wow. If you are a shaman for example, chances are you will help your raid by buffing it as well. Find decent people that lets you play w/e you want don't worry so much about the min/max potential because that's the true RETAIL mindset talking
---
Clearly a significant amount of people don't understand what loot trading is and don't understand how it can be abused to cheat people - specifically randos - out of loot.
---
I don't have anything relevant to add to the topic at hand so why would I? I'm simply calling out what I consider to be toxic behavior.
---
Sadly that's not in classic, would love to get the op trinket reward!

AV is the easiest epic mount in vanilla by far
---
 &lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server.  If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it.
---
Feel free to join the discord. We'll talk! [https://discord.gg/vEezjx](https://discord.gg/vEezjx)
---
I'm in a very similar boat, my friend!
---
Question for you, though (since we have very little information on Classic): if when we start up you find that it isn't the same as you remember or they have blatantly changed one of the core mechanics of Vanilla (let's say, as an extreme example, elite quests are pushovers; they aren't as difficult as Vanilla; you can easily solo them,) will you continue to play?
---
I know it's a very broad question.  My other dad friend and I have been having this conversation for almost a month now. "What if it isn't the same? What if it's like retail?"
---
We both want the true experience of Vanilla back, but we are hesitant with what has been happening with retail-WoW.
---
Would love to know your thoughts.
---
Sublime did a cover. I prefer the cover 
---
I see that continuous re-balancing as something essential to an MMO. Every class might get its moment at the top. Vanilla WoW was always being updated and, if things hadn't moved onto Burning Crusade, I imagine there would have been many more updates.
---
I know there is little trust in modern Blizzard, but the Classic team seems to understand what is important. I don't think small amounts of re-balancing will ruin the Vanilla-ness of Classic at all.
---
As a casual - I don't think the changes would even be very noticeable. These balancing tweaks were always happening in Vanilla. The backlash and debate from patches was all part of the fun.
---
This gets me excited because I can’t play 6 hours a day like I did 14 years ago. My progression will be a lot slower so knowing that the content won’t progress way faster than me is exciting to see. 
---
If one chooses to look at it that way, in a sense yes, but that's where the WoW Classic-team made a choice, they chose 1.12 and the 4 phases as to not recreate the whole patch-by-patch plan some people wanted (and could have become hella tedious for first-timers to Classic). Less confusion and around as to what content comes out next and when, I can understand that. 
---
What the dude in the video is suggesting is to fundementally change the game by tweaking values to make classes more valuable so the game doesn't become stale. I'm sorry, that's not what Classic was/is about, it might have been riddled with problems and class design issues we can point out today in 2019, but changing it because someone fears the game might suffer seems a little ignorant to the legacy of the came to be honest. 
---
I feel the changing of number-values should only be opened for discussion after a year or to of Classic and tons of feedback from the community on where the game should be headed next, be it TBC, F R E S H or a 1.13-server. 
---
oh yeah resto druids being immortal gods from season 2-4 for pvp was sure balanced and fun for everyone
---
Don't neglect the kids for a game dude
---
Currently recruiting more local players for my guild.
---
It should go to a rich ass paladins &amp; shamans imo but main focus should be on someone that has actually earned it regardless of class or spec
---
Most specs not viable... Except game is not only raiding :D. Stop this balancing shit. Btw gj comunity for down voting these shit posts.
---
Even more important is to stop with the big changes like mega servers or removing crossrealm BGs. 
---
Mandatory "don't you guys have phones?" post
---
Pvt Server raid guilds seem to raid on a 2 day a week schedule - at least with MC/BWL in the game.
---
I dont think anyone here would ever argue that Classic was balanced, it depends what you want to get out of the "Classic WoW" experience...
---
Silvermoon was also heavily inspired by middle eastern culture. Dark Elves in Morrowind too. Curious considering elves come from norse mythology.
---
haha I remember that I once got to level 60, and thought quest were a leveling thing, and I'd now only raid, so I deleted all quests from quest log.
---
Guess, it would be better to unmatch all matches...
---
what do you mean, it fit in my disc tray just fine
---
Really?
---
I'd say priest since you want a little bit of everything 
---
We really dont know if the world is gonna end tomorrow, but you know.. probably not
---
Disc Spec was used? I cannot recall that.
---
Imo let vanilla be vanilla. The ones that play it, even on a pserver know that it was far from perfect.
---
You played this game in middle school... and you have 3 kids? Jesus. You can't be older than 29 unless the middle school thing was a lie.  
---
So while I don't want any game-breaking changes to take place, he speaks truth to Blizzard's philosophy here.
---
TBC got this right in the class balancing regard. As a raid roster pretty much compiles of very heavily on the objectively best classes for their role, rogues &amp; warriors for great melee dps, warlocks for their OK dps &amp; debuffs, mages for their AOE/CC and good DPS potential (fire in AQ becoming a huge factor for raid-wide DPS) &amp; hunters for their Trueshot &amp; Howling buffs, kiting potential &amp; Tranq ability along with their OK DPS(at least early on). I would be interested to see if they were able to pull off some type of Hybrid in druids, paladins, shamans &amp; priests. Some of the aforementioned already have perks that make them somewhat viable, as he said in the video, in regards to having one dedicated SP after 16 debuff slots boosting shadow damage &amp; one feral druid that can off-tank &amp; DPS with LotP as an added bonus. You could make these classes stronger in more subtle ways that wouldn't come as a detriment to PVP or raiding.
---
Say for instance Mind Flay didn't function as a debuff, but rather as Arcane Missiles, so as to not take a debuff slot. You'd find some way to make bleeds viable without taking up a debuff slot. In this regard, you've not really made any difference in PVP or to the raid, but you've done a lot to make ferals and shadowpriests more viable options. That being said, these are already semi-viable options to have in a raid roster. For Enhancement/elemental shamans, moonkin druids &amp; retri/prot paladins, you'd probably have to lower mana costs for certain spells, which becomes iffy. What they did to make them viable in TBC was add more offensive spells, buffs, and debuffs to make them a niche that you could bring to raids. In TBC you could bring an elemental shaman or a moomkin druid, because their dmg was good enough so that their added bonuses made them a viable pick over another mage or warlock for your caster roster. 
---
Mee too. My dad thought i bought a Shrek game 😭
---
Blizzard doesnt care what *we* want, they care how much we are willing to spend if *they* make changes. They care about the number at the end of their excel sheet. It doesnt matter to them that there will always be a hard core vanilla playerbase. If they would implement a balance schedule every year or something and it increases the playerbase x3, you really think they wouldnt do that just because a couple of die hard #nochange people on Reddit wouldnt like it?
---
Making balancing changes when we are like 1 year into classic will change things up and encourage players to focus on new things, come back to level their favorite class/spec that was shit tier before and barely accepted in groups/raids. New PVP meta, new itemization, new PVE meta, new talent combos, new theory crafting, new rotations, etc. 
---
Everything that was great about vanilla is still there. Gameplay and the feeling of an RPG isnt lost. The only thing that changes is seeing paladin tanks, good Boomkin dps, etc. 
---
Nothing vital has to change. On the contrary, everything that made vanilla so amazing is back. Feeling like a scrub untill you figure out what is best for your class, finding out what talents work with your playstyle, finding what classes complement eachother in dungeons/raids/BGs. All these things you can experience again just like when you first played. All this information is available about 1.12 already. 
---
And its not like Vanilla itself didnt change from 1.1 to 1.12. So #nochanges also goes against what Vanilla itself tried to do, which was evolve and keep things fresh for its players.
---
I recently afk'ed my way to exalted with the alterac valley repuation. Im not sure how much rep I needed when I begun but i had done the 4 race quests for easy lvls and i had done some av's before, so i guess i was early honored. 
---
It took me 18 hours of joining AV (not in a grp) and then standing in 1 of the alliance bunkers and then just waiting for 1 of the teams winning. 
---
If any1 is interested in how i did it: 
---
I got a stopwatch addon (there isnt one in vanilla) and then making a macro that put the countdown back to 5 min every time i pressed it. I then moved my char every 4-5 min to avoid getting flagged as afk and then hit the macro. If you stand still for 5 min you'll go afk. 
---
The reason why i did it this way was because it was right before aq patch and i didnt have a 100% mount so i couldnt join premades. If you manage to find a premade you'll get to exalted much faster.
---
Not when you're an elitist prick.
---
only with that attitude
---
Vanilla wow retail had paladin tanks as well as rets
---
This is such a typical BFA-player perspective... I can't even count how many wrong and/or oversimplified "facts" he's just tossing out, and basing his arguments on.
---
The worst one being that 2/3 of vanilla specs are not viable. This is just so blatantly wrong, and shows he has done little to none research. What he fails to recognise is that vanilla specs are designed to excel at different areas of play. He has a misconseption that "balance" means equality and that every spec can excel at every role. The latter perspective is one of the things that imo ruined WoW, and is a reflection of why modern retail wow isn't interesting for me (so little class/spec identity).  
---
I don't get why Classic WoW would seem like an interesting game to play for someone who thinks the game needs to change this severely (apart from getting easy views from classic hype). 
---
Tl;dr backpaddling bfa hunter streamer wants to change classic wow, and I disagree
---
No big changes, but some minor changes are necessary. 
---
I meant more that if I log in and I have only two hours to play, I can queue up pretty quickly (and reliably) as a healer compared to a Mage, which might be quick some times but not every time. Isn't this the case? 
---
I agree that they shouldn't do the same dps, but I do think the gap is too large, lots of times you can't even put out half the dps of a pure dps, especially in the later raids when most if the hybrids run out of mana not even halfway through a fight.
---
Attack speeds didn't change until 2.0 or 2.1 IIRC, it was movement speed (ie. the frostwolf and the ZG bat) that got the nerf in 1.9
---
*woosh*
---
Confused, sorry :(  - can you explain? 
---
AV like a month, the other two like a year.
---
everyone loves mages, theres a lot of them but since they have high dps, cc, food, water and portals its still easy to get a group.
---
Warcraft has been trying to do that for years.
---
Doesn't mean it worked or was a good thing.
---
This isnt supposed to work like a normal game. It isn't supposed to evolve and get better.
---
This is supposed to be a history peice. As close to "as it was" as is humanly possible. Otherwise what's the point. 
---
I would like to see some small tweaks, mostly something equivalent to slice n dice for rogues (except for mana regen etc) an ability that isn't good for pvp but helps on longer fights, aq and naxx the fights are just too long for mana hungry  hybrids to even attempt to compete.
---
I'd recommend this laptop. WoW isn't that demanding of a game to run and I'd image this would chug through it just fine.

---
Do not try and Join the queue, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth...there is no queue. Then you'll see that it is not the dungeon finder that queues, it is only yourself.
---
I would love more content. Just like Runescape, the rulesets have been almost the same, but they keep adding content.
---
Would love to see a TBC expansion with the same extended content...
---
Are they running off modern wows client? 
---
There’s no dungeon finder in Classic. You have to talk to people and find group on your own.
---
Don't worry about it.
---
Thank you :) Yes I think I am leaning Priest way and this post was a kind of coin-toss moment, after asking the question I think I realised what I wanted

**\*\*Introduction**:\*\*  
---
Knights Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft’s launch on the Zul’jin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was “The causal guild that raids hardcore” and to a degree we will continue with that mantra during Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  Our goal is to progress through all raid tiers at a very strong pace.  
---
**\*\*What we Expect of Members**:\*\*  
---
We are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community.  It’s important to remember that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.  For raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and prepared to pull by raid start time. 
---
**\*\*Raid Times:\*\*** 
---
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday 8:00 -10:30 PM EST.

Oh, gotcha. I played vanilla and my last WoW experience was TBC aside from trying the free trial a few months ago. I was just using the term 'queue' to describe it, totally missed the joke! I guess my mind was not looking for a pedantic answer...
---
&gt;People have already played the game. Vanilla is almost 15 years old. Everyone knows everything about the game. Game could go stale.
---
This is awkward considering the popularity of private servers over the years, especially Nost. Like many, I passed on private servers because I didn't want to lose my progress. There's a huge demand for a "stale" 15 year old game because it's a good game. It's an MMORPG. Most people already know what to expect.
---
&gt;Specs are irrelevant, classes revolve around one spec maybe two at the most. People will stick with the best spec most of if not all of the time. If you want to play a melee dps, you're going to have to play a melee or a rogue. Range dps, mage or warlock. Class distribution problems.
---
Isn't this true for retail today? I mean just look at [this Mythic first Coven kill from Legion](https://i.imgur.com/wzoY3Ys.png). Yes, the guilds aiming for server/world first will ALWAYS bring the flavour of the month, but the majority of the playerbase will not. Vanilla is also an entirely different game from retail. Certain classes are outright support classes (like pallies and druids). He doesn't even take PvP into consideration where specs like Shadow and Ret pallies truly shine. **Raiding is only one aspect of Vanilla. Don't fuck with the numbers to please the PvE-only crowd** I plan on playing a priest or a hunter, not a mage or a warlock. And I plan on raiding and PvPing.
---
Unlikely. Private servers had and have the same/similar role percentage as Vanilla did.
---
The difference is the playersbase being 5 times as big on private servers, meaning find people for a group is much quicker.
---
In classic, Healers will still be in demand, tho not as much as tanks in 5mans.
---
A tip, if you already know the name of the server (not the individual realms but the overall server projects) there are subreddits for those.
---
But on the other hand, that huge weapon in the hands of a guild member is a nice status symbol for said guild and perhaps worth more than some extra moneyz for raid pots.
---
Class balance is actually fantastic. The min-maxer folks are coming up with "ideal raid specs" that include no more than 6 or 7 of any class and no fewer than 3 or 4 of any class. And these are the elitist nerds that do the most hand-wringing about how hunters have 2% less DPS.
---
PvP, same thing. The ideal AB/WSG groups have every class represented.
---
Maybe people confuse "every class is identical" with "class balance."
---
Money is the point. Do you think Blizzard is doing this out of the kindness of their hart? 
---
This isnt an attempt to make history and preserve WoW in its semi original glory. This is about making money off of the people wanting to play the game.
---
LOL didn’t even think of that
---
Thank you!! :)     
---
I know it's very hard to see but I did put notes on a lot of cells throughout my document, if you hover your mouse over the Spellweaver's Turban cells you will see that I adress this misconception :P.   
---
This item (along with Diana's Pearl Necklace, etc) got added in 1.10 which also includes the T0.5 quest chain, however those items have nothing to do with the quest chain itself as this is the result of a loot table of a previously available update, pre-1.10 General Drakkisath couldn't drop the Turban and when 1.10 did hit the live servers, he then could drop this new item, it is not ties with the new quest chain so I'm in firm belief that this is safe to assume that those kind of items will be at launch (at least until further information, if Blizzard decide to not use the 1.12 loot tables I will then modify my document accordingly)   
---
Anyway I hope that this isn't too confusing, but for the sake of making things clear I'm gonna answer that on the FAQ section as well, at least for the sake of visibility because I'm sure a lot of people are also wondering why I'm straight up suggesting this kind of items that early into the game. :P
---
So much money, so much time.. life is great that way!
---
&gt;This is such a typical BFA-player perspective... I can't even count how many wrong and/or oversimplified "facts" he's just tossing out, and basing his arguments on.
---
Exactly, completely overlooks the specs that shine in PvP or open world. The game didn't revolve around raids, and the only people who cared were the guilds going for first kills. This is true even today!
---
Always awesome to hear, thanks for the kind words man I always appreciate it a lot :)   
---
(ps: I hope you bookmarked the URL that redirects to the "Info" tab, somebody actually used a URL that linked to a tab that I deleted so he thought that I have nuked my entire document, don't do the same mistake!)
---
I remember them being in between normal and elite; soloable, but they left you hurting.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=2633 your welcome.
---
You must be a really good druid or a really bad one. Probably the latter.
---
I remember grinding in STV and got a BoE epic drop. Went back to the same spot the next day (it was a good grinding area) and got the SAME epic BoE. Made for a good nest egg.
---
terrible example because you can transmog weapons :)  
---
gj brainlet  
---
Well he should stick to making videos about retail since he obviously has no clue about vanilla.
---
I'm not. I'm just waiting for the release.
---
When it releases, I will create my char, and I will play it.
---
Isn't it better tho?
---
Thank you!  
---
During the leveling period I'm gonna go with skinning, it's not much but with packed servers this is hands down the best profession to make money with, herbs and ores will be sniped very quickly so you won't be able to level up herbalism/mining enough to continue gathering materials throughout the zones, on the other hand you're gonna kill a lot of beasts while leveling so the skins will all be yours, anyway this is just to guarantee a mount right after reaching 40.   
---
Once I reach 60 I will then learn Tailoring because I need the Robe of the Archmage, the Bloodvine set bonuses and frost resistance gear for Naxxramas later on, also switch Skinning for Engineering for PvP purposes.   
---
There is not much use chosing money maker professions as you will simply farm your gold in DME/DMN, leaving room for other professions.
---
How many 'minor changes' does it take before you end up with something so different that it would be considered to be completely unoriginal.
---
The problem is, you likely have an opinion on a small change that you would personally like, but so do thousands of others, and those small changes are different from yours. And that one change that you think is insignificant may be a problem for someone else, and vice versa. 
---
If everyone gets their way, you will end up with too many changes and everyone will be unhappy. 
---
Considering the fact we all are asking for this game, and are collecting here to discuss how much we love it, why does it need to be changed at all? I can't see the logic behind it. 
---
Still, you already knew she loathed one of your main hobbies
---
Surprised you didn't get banned for that as private server GMs are usually on a powertrip. I got banned afking in a bunker on Nost while talking a dump.
---
Sadly, all we seem to get from "influencers" is that "Classic means Classic" which means any reasonable suggestions such as this will be shouted down.
---
When did Nosalrius start?
---
What is the meaning of this
---
You need 42k rep to be exalted.
---
If you are with a good premade that have 100% winrate, you get about 1k per hour.
---
If you pug, then it depends, you can still get some rep in ab while losing, but in wsg you have to cap flags to get rep. Worst case scenario is then 50 rep in 1 hour (you still get 1 mark while loosing)
---
Av is fast if you do it during av weekend
---
My main still isn't exalted with the Warsong Gulch one. And I even got rank 10 at the time of vanilla. And in TBC etc I always queued random BGs to get honor for off pieces etc...
---
I'm exalted with all other BGs, I really don't know what happens with WSG.
---
Why would you power shift as a tank?
---
If red, it's dead.
---
As a druid I am finally the one jumping from stealth, not vice versa. If I see an enemy, I'll wait for him to tag mobs. For him to sit down. Anything that will give me an edge.
---
Only rule I have is that if I kill somebody 3-4 times, I move over because it gets boring.
---
I also sometimes play the innocent "dont hurt me im just leveling" part when facing a big enemy party. Then I start asking for friends, turn around, stalk the enemy players, ambush them, murder them.
---
Will your dad play classic? 😁
---
I agree, like personally i would love a dual spec option for like 1000 or 2000 gold or so, so we have option to change talent from pvp/pve etc. 
---
This would only be possible to be changed at the trainer ofc, sadly i realize this is something "i just want" and some might disagree and even if they do decide to change something like this they might aswell change 50+ other things that other people want, which some of them i don't like. This is like i also don't want changes, some changes might be something "i like more" and some might be something "i don't like" but overall the ones i dislike can feel like it destorys the ORIGINAL game more then the ones i like improve it.
---
*hybrid feral / OT. It's so you can have decent DPS as a feral when you're not tanking.
---
You know, I actually put down "wow classic 2019, will be moderatly busy" on my tinder profile, hopefully I can attract the right kind of people.
---
It had, they just were terrible
---
Huzzah's stuff is excellent!
---
so much this!!!
---
playing 16-18hrs a day for that week off? Else its gonna be pretty hard hitting 60 in that time, especially as a warrior
---
10-4
---
I'm fairly sure the first 2 years we should exspect #nochanges other then what we have from the start (first 2 years = until nax is out etc) 
---
If blizzard hears that a lot want "classic+ or BC" they will make that oboiusly. 
---
Now we can't really know what they will do after they decide they want classic+ or bc. They kinda have a few options here.
---
1. Make you able to get into the classic+/BC via character copying, so u have 2x of same char.
---
2. You will get to decide if you want to stay on classic realm or want to transfer to the new classic+/BC realm.
---
3.  They will make new realms that is for classic+/BC that will be made months beforehand and people will know they will turn into BC/Classic+ later.
---
This is what i think will happen if they decide it, i think no matter what they will keep classic realms but if they see more profit in the future in BC/Classic+ they will do 1 of the 3 things.
---
 Ah, good. Another volunteer. We're getting a lot of you these days.  
---
I hope it's enough.  
---
The human lands are threatened from without, and so many of our forces have been marshaled abroad. This, in turn, leaves room for corrupt and lawless groups to thrive within our borders.  
---
It is a many-fronted battle we wage, Leagueofjohan. Gird yourself for a long campaign.
---
I dont play on the server you are refering to (for the record, I have my own server so I can test things easily all by myself) so I'm not really familiar with it, but if I had a guess I wouldn't be surprise to hear that those people communicate and bring people to constantly gank the players that makes the Mage AoE grinding being less efficient, whether this person is from the same or opposite faction.    
---
Also no matter what the population number is, it doesn't make much difference, if 2.5k / 5k / 11k people are playing at launch, just a couple of players killing mobs (or you) without the are a that you are currently farming, you are already gonna be much less efficient, I don't want to bullshit people and tell them that they will be able to do so, if we are realistic there is no chance that you're gonna AoE level in peace so just figure out the best single target build you can make (I have one included on my document) and brute force your way through if leveling fast is what you want.   
---
Anyway I've already answered this question a million times so I think I'm gonna start to redirect people to my FAQ section as I adress it there, long story short believing that you will be able to AoE grind at launch is a desillusion, what you want to SEE happen isn't what WILL happen, if you want to be efficient you got to prepare for the worst, not the best.
---
Looks like a lot of healing touch icons on your hotbar
---
Watch his "World of Warcraft is garbage" video. He's very pro Classic: https://youtu.be/cEzhg6HtASU
---
&gt; My plan is to go HotW/NS spec so I can tank 5 mans for BiS, heal raids,
---
Druid healing is almost as useless as feral, to be honest with you, because:
---
&gt; or will my heals constantly get sniped?
---
Yes.  On pservers at least it's easier to find good healers than it is good DPS and the general attitude is "you can't overheal it."  That changes as you get into better groups when they realize they can raid with the safeties off and you start seeing the fury/half DPS gear tanks who need threat more than mitigation so their DPS core doesn't have to hold back and things die fast, and groups will run with fewer healers.
---
But my experience has been less than what I was hoping.
---
1) Healing 5 mans is doable, but difficult because at that gear level DPS can go from zero to dead faster than a 3s HT, and since you don't have a res, it really sucks when DPS pulls threat and dies and has to run back.
---
2) Healing raids - it *can* be okay, but generally, in MC there will be enough hpals that you will rarely get a heal off.  If you don't spec rejuv/SM and another druid *did*, then you will not be casting rejuv either, so you basically stand around.  You get invited so the mages don't have to decurse, or they need warm bodies.  ZG is okay if you have only 3 healers or none of them are holy paladins.  As soon as you have an hpal or 2 in the raid, you're just the rejuv/dispel bot.
---
Yeah I don't get the delusion people have where ret pallies did anything but BoK and that pally tanks didn't just run out of mana then lose aggro, or just die.
---
Good to know. It should also be noted that there are seasons in D2 while Classic, if left at its 1.12 state, would be static game with nothing new added in and no resets.
---
And tell me, what is there left to do for hardcore raider who cleared Naxxramas? This is my main issue with the idea that Classic will be fine even after many years. Content draughts are real and something has to be done to solve inevitable content draught at the end of Classic.
---
Some people think development of new content is the best idea, although I don´t agree. Continuation to TBC and/or reset of Classic is the way to go, to keep the experience fresh.
---
Are you confusing the Felsteed, with the Dreadsteed?
---
See even changes like that affect the "permanency" characters had because fuck paying that 50g to respec. Changing that would affect the economy, and just flow on from there.
---
I agree it sucks to pay that 50g (I was a tank in classic and it was fucking shit that I had to respec to farm) but... I think that change is too much.
---
So what if I went horde so holy paladins weren't available. Would my healing be any better off then? Also, I don't care about healing 5 man dungeons cause I plan to tank those.
---
I don't know if I will ever get to nax tbh, I'm not that hardcore. So that is alright with me.
---
The mods don't care. They don't do their job, they just like promoting their own content.
---
2004 lines ... Year 2004 ... Say no more 
---
"Classic means Classic" sounds too much like "Brexit means Brexit" for my liking.
---
They could add multiple servers for different game modes. For example "Seasons" from Diablo, or maybe some sort of challenge mode like Ironman from Runescape. But I don't see them adding any content after naxx, because that would be its own game and not "Classic".
---
There are other subreddit(s) where you can discuss private servers in general or specific servers. It's not allowed here as this subreddit is only intended for WoW:Classic and nothing else.
---
Warsong Gulch, at level 60, you get 35 rep for a flag capture, and you win if you get 3 flag captures before the opposition. A win awards 3 tokens, a defeat awards 1. You get 100 rep for handing in 3 tokens. 
---
So, winning WSG = 205 rep
---
Losing 3-2 = \~103 rep
---
Losing 3-1 = \~68 rep
---
Losing 3-0 = \~33 rep
---
If you are in a premade that can regularly win WSG in &lt;10 minutes, and you don't have big queues, then you can earn close to 1000 rep per hour on a good day. 
---
Outside a premade, winning some and losing more, with long battles that finally end after 30 minutes in a 3-0 defeat, and with longer queues, you will realistically earn 100-200 rep per hour on most days.
---
Neutral to Exalted requires 42000 rep, so probably somewhere between 50 (if you're insanely organised and lucky) to 400 (if you're not) hours dedicated to WSG.
---
(Decline)
---
okay I missed the tooltip, as it is not clearly visible where those are. Good job!
---
was thinking more of a name like "Dads of Azeroth"
---
Or u know. Remove Classic vanilla warrior cosplay with rule 1 then remove their post. 
---
Unbearable! Usuaully raiding druids start with healing and offspec into tanking if they want to. Overly dedicated with pumelers can think about focusing more on feral dps/tank than HPS resto even.
---
As for healing in Classic - you have HoTS but if you will be tank healing - you will be expected to overheal due to long casting times in general and the need to cover spike damage going into tanks. HPS will be a secondary value.
---
He needs to find another game to play then? If he thinks modern wow is garbage, but want to make changes to Classic which reminds me of modern wow? He's going in circles.
---
Yup, for some dumb reason we can't discuss privates here.
---
You can go to /r/wowservers to discuss them, but if you want a vanilla-specific discussion then you'll have to filter between all the topics in there, which sucks.
---
I have raided MC/BWL/AQ40 as druid and my experience would be summeruzed thus:
---
- Playing Hot-Bot (standard full resto) is pretty boring after a while. Atleast if you prefer a sniper playstyle.
---
- NG (Natures grace) spec is pretty fun and definitely competitive in terms of healing meters.
---
- Gearing is super easy. You will probably be 1 out of 2 druids in any 40man raid so you'll get your T2 and other druid-specific gear very fast.
---
\&gt;   As an adult in 2019 with three children and a wife, I will undoubtedly sink a crap ton of time into this game. My memories from middle and high school will bring back the Nastalgia demon inside me. 
---
As an adult in 2019, I have the right to unemployment benefits, and my mother is missing me, and also changed her view on video games. She'll gladly give me accommodation and food in her house for free, if i decide to stay with her for a month.
---
Yes, you're right. This means sitting and playing, with no cut cables, and with no begging for prepaids.
---
True, but I think its much more sensible as an adult with responsibilities and loved ones to have only one dedicated game night per week. Sure it will be slower but the game won't consume my job and family. But that doesn't mean I won't log on during other evenings, but that playtime is flexible and for a grind here and there, a quest or two, not for time consuming raids or dungeons and never unless my LO is asleep. I watched my uncle play away a marriage with two children and he has never been the same since, I also watched my friends play instead of homework, resulting in high student loans and graduating years behind schedule.
---
Priest can DPS and heal while Mage can be a bartender, sheep herder, DPS, a farmer, a tailor, an enchanter... There will always be a need for healing or healing + utility (like shaman). Mages will be popular but even mages will have need and spots in dungeons or 40-man raids.
---
I would love to see murky and CE pets personally as that is what was in Vanilla, so it should be in classic. There view of this is its own product and not the "real" Vanilla and just a Copy that wont ever interact with live services makes me slightly belive they may want to do there own things with it. New CE pets or something. Though i wouldnt understand this outlook unless they are going to tie it to BFA as well.
---
&gt;I’ve heard this for years but first time I see it written
---
because you've never played Warcraft 3
---
fucking matt lol
---
No changes means no changes from 1.1-1.12. 
---
If they patch it like they did in 1.1-1.12, it is ok. Anything not from this period is more of a change than a static experience.
---
You used to get 35 rep each flag currently (45 with bonus), so it took forever, but you currently get 100 rep per flag + 100 rep for winning on retail, so I finished up the Conqueror title in no time.
---
this picture on my wallpaper made my Windows-related video flagged inappropriate for youtube
---
I would imagine the answer is probably, but I don't know enough about resto shaman healing.  Resto shamans have chain heal which is very valuable for a lot of fights.  As a druid, your kit consists only of spells that are worse than what other classes have.
---
I love druids.  They're a joy to play in general, but objectively, they are the worst healers by a pretty significant margin.
---
What's the story?
---
Heh unbearable, as in un-able to be a bear.
---
Thanks man, I really worked my ads off the last couple months, I'm surprised to see how much I've improved this document!  
---
To adress the AoE leveling thing, as I said a couple minutes ago bellow another comment I'm gonna redirect you to the "Info" tab on the FAQ section, you can also read the comments I made on this post but long story short, no, there is absolutely not way that people are gonna be able to AoE level to 60 no matter the population cap of the servers, only the people who will manage to get ahead of the pack maybe will be able to, no matter how good or knowledgeable about the game you are, you need an insane amount of luck so don't plan your leveling route using an AoE farming method.   
---
Now about the talent thing, not having at least 2/3 is gonna make your life incredibly hard as mobs surprisingly resists a LOT of your spells, basically against mobs that are your level +3 the first and second rank gives you +2% hit each and the last rank gives you "+1% hit" if that makes sense, so what you can do is spend 2/3 EP and spend the rest into Imp Frostbolt (3/5), I don't think you meant "don't pick any EP ranks at all" but whether you did or not, my answer is that this talent is extremely important or you're gonna miss a lot of damage, especially with the talents I'm gonna talk about -&gt;
---
Frostbite is needed because by freezing the mob you can cast more Frostbolts before he reaches you, and can "proc" Shatter.      
---
Ice Shards will make your Crit go from a 1.5x multiplier to x2, making your Shatters much stronger.    
---
2/2 Arctic Reach will allow you to cast one more Frostbolt before a target reaches you, thus gonna increase your chance at having a Frostbite proc and therefore, lead to a Shatter "proc"    
---
So basically you want those talents asap, besides Arctic Reach you're gonna have them all before Shatter so by 29 you are gonna have your setup ready, now imaging if you didn't have Elemental Precision, that would be a LOT of damage wasted :P
---
&gt; if you want a vanilla-specific discussion then you'll have to filter between all the topics in there, which sucks
---
exactly. Like "do you think this strategy will work this time?" - "well, I've played on a few private servers, and saw noone doing it"
---
You can reach level 60 within a week, if you play 20 hours a day and follow a extremely optimized route on realm with no competition.
---
The other day a mod removed a Classic vanilla cosplay due to not being Classic. Very funny and thread blew up. 
---
well, the grayed-out "Decline" button was actually a part of the mechanics.
---
I thought this was the best thing ever when I was a teenager. It feels kinda bad now, but this is life on a PvP server.
---
Yeah that's true, that's the downside of having a black background, I'm totally aware of the issue I think Google should let us modify the little triangle's color to make it more obvious, but until then.. didn't find any solution to make it more clear :\

**Dedicated PvE with a social atmosphere**
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.

**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule:**

#VICTORY FOR SYLVANAS
---
Cross realm BGs came with a late patch back in Vanilla, which means that both having it and not having it would be “blizzlike”. 
---
Sometimes a cointoss is all it takes! If you find yourself disappointed with the result, you know what your heart truly desires :)
---
This are pservers. People play exactly that addon cause they enjoy the content as it is.
---
actually my guild clears MC/BWL/Ony in one night, so it is possible but I joined them when all that was on farm - I imagine the gearing up/progression stages will require 2 nights.
---
Casually mentioning pserver experiences in this sub is usually fine. It's more explicit stuff like starting a new thread specifically discussing private servers that will get removed.
---
Well not that terrible I mean a well played and geared paladin can get a higher amount of threat then a wel played and geared protection warrior.
---
That being said they are a awesome solution for aoe tanking like the imps in molten core or the goblin bom trowers in bwl. More better then any prot war.
---
They do lack taunt witch is the main reason that they can not main tank specific bosses, however the bosses that do not require taunt they will do absolutely fine.
---
I have seen it with my own eyes.
---
Also keep in mind that almost every private vanilla wow server isn't as good scripted as vanilla wow. For example most private servers count pallys judgment on spell hit rating while it should be melee hit rating. There are tons of class specific things on private servers that where different back in the day.
---
Here's a prot pally from vanilla retail tanking gluth trash mobs.

Yes and Blizzard has decided to go with 1.12 which means removing it would be a huge change. If they change their mind and go with 1.7 or something that's a different story.

**Epoch of Thought [H] **| NA-PvP | Wed, Thu, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore 
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes, attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thu, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; specifically seeking: Shamans, Rogues &amp; Warlocks. Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message (Lne#2710) or Bnet message Lne(1326), but the less social can also fill out an application on our Website &lt;http://epochofthought.shivtr.com&gt;  You can also jump on our discord at &lt;https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT&gt;

"read each quest"
---
AHAHAHAHAHAH. You will stop reading each quest by level 15. 
---
U could always find a price based on data that makes it so you don't lose money in terms of the economy (since people don't respec everyday u can find the amount it should cost) I don't care if it's 1k or 5k, i just want to be able to respec as much as i want without feeling like it's a waste of money, i like being able to "invest" it won't be something every class should/want to get if they don't respec very often. But something healers/tanks wants to get if they also wanna be able to farm gold on that char. 
---
I definitely agree.  With kids and responsibilities, it's going to be hard to raid a lot, but even one night a week would be great.  
---
A guild where I could raid a night a week and get to experience these raids would be great.
---
A week off to hit cap? You must be HARDCORE...
---
Lol i hadnt even looked at that. That dude went so ballistic he came back a year later to keep bitching.
---
a beast of a pun :)
---
Seems like all this still holds up 😬
---
If we don't have kids how would we know? Nothing to compare. 
---
It'll be interesting to see for sure, OSRS was slowly dying after the initial 6 months since there was no new content. When they began adding content that fits the oldschool theme only then did the playerbase skyrocket. Went from 24k concurrent players to 152k.
---
Now obviously WoW is a different sort of game but it'll be interesting to see what happens to classic servers after Naxx, post naxx vanilla content would be something I'd love to see, but I know its not for everyone
---
How do you deny screenshots of whispers? Id take them immediately.
---
What does she do to relax inside the home? Surely she doesn't watch awful "reality" TV or the Real Housewives, or talk shows right? Never watches a 2 hr movie or The Office on Netflix does she?
---
I know she doesn't knit, arts and crafts, or have a book club for fun does she?
---
I don't understand people who "hate" video games. Like its perfectly acceptable to watch basketball on TV but not play a video game?
---
Aren't there some (elite) mobs in STV that drop white items that cure stuff?
---
Literally nothing? No spouse? No dog? No nothing?! You just come home everyday to free time?!
---
They are using the authentic Vanilla client. There is still a great deal of engineering involved in the *server side* of WoW, which they accomplish.
---
Thank god!
---
I will roll a rogue and i remember how hard it was to find a group or raid.
---
So i convinced my wife to play a dwarf priest...problem solved.
---
Discussing Vanilla experiences in most contexts is fine. Specifically naming a private server is not allowed, or attempting to bypass the automod's filter isn't allowed (exception: Nostalrius, because it's defunct and uniquely relevant to Classic's development). This philosophy was originally implemented to differentiate r/ClassicWoW from r/wowservers, when r/ClassicWoW was *much* smaller of a sub.
---
Pretty much. You had to really pick your targets in vanilla, once you had hunters mark or FF you were a fish out of water
---
I play on a very mature (old) blizzlike pserver.
---
The hardcore guilds have progressed so much that there are literally Naxx PUGs.
---
Some of the hardcore players aren't as active anymore, sure, but there are plenty of people still progressing Naxx, even while some are farming it.
---
Not only that, *there are guilds still progressing MC.* New guilds form and disband all the time, and the good ones where people are happy live on. There is still a steady trickle of people joining the game just as people quit or take a break, and they still want to raid, and they progress MC, ZG, AQ, and so on.
---
People underestimate just how much there is to do in Vanilla WoW. Even if the absolute most neckbeard no-life guilds will have Naxx on farm in 2 years, which won't happen on every server btw, there will still be people pushing the content for 4 years, even more.
---
People may take breaks, come back again to PvP or roll alts, etc.
---
You *do not* need expansions to keep Vanilla going. If you want expansions, the latest one is very easy to get into.
---
  **&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
   
---
Hey everyone! 
---
We are an alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual". 
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory. 
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO. 
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004. 
---
**Raid Times (PST):** 
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Necro Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders. 
---
**Membership:** 
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They      will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things      with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the      end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend      recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that      is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of      Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a      period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move      on. When they come back, its like they never left. 
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the      effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to      keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100%      sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they      are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have      a full 40 members every raid. 
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to      keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no      special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known      each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is      great for members of our guild. 
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and      stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any      major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and      will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals. 
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

Honestly neither of us have much downtime anyway. 3 kids, 3 companies, horses etc.   I’m gonna carve some time for classic somewhere though.  Not at the kids expense but the horses can go a few days without a curry brush.  I am gonna make it happen. I have not played since the release of TBC. I’m ready to get back to it. 
---
&gt; My plan is to go HotW/NS spec so I can tank 5 mans for BiS, heal raids, and provide support in PvP. Is this spec capable of doing all those roles well?
---
Mained a Druid in vanilla retail as Resto but quit before 1.12 Talents.
---
Levelled my first pvt server character as a Druid recently, hit 60 over Xmas and am now 6/8 t2.
---
I was HOTW/NS until recently, respecced to 39 Resto to try and improve performance on meters.  Am still finishing bottom of 11 healers but I've joined a guild that has BWL on farm and so their healers have a significant head start on me gear wise - so far all I've gotten as a trial has been Stormrage.
---
&gt; 1) Healing 5 mans is doable, but difficult
---
lol no.
---
&gt; Healing raids - it can be okay, but generally, in MC there will be enough hpals that you will rarely get a heal off. 
---
lol, no.
---
Hopefully someone with more time than me makes this happen, going to be tough to find a gm 
---
Mage CC is also a lot better which helps on some fights, KT for e.g. 
---
I remember seeing the epic AB pauldrons on a warrior in vanilla and instantly knew I needed to have them. I grinded with a premade grp that was trying to get their friend to grand marshal and they took me along any chance I could get in.  Looking back, those players did me a huge favor. The grind was fuckin long but those shoulders helped my dps considerably and looked sick. 
---
Would advise Goth's PvP videos as well. Felhunter micro is outstanding. 
---
Are you asking me to explain the human psyche to you? Same reason it's important for some people to get likes on instagram. 
---
The only reason it matters to me if this thread is voted up, is because it shows up on the front page. I don't come on this sub to read fan fiction. 
---
as far as I recall, I was leveling after 1.6, but never did any Searing Gorge quest before 60.
---
Though I was grinding a lot of un'goro gorillas for morrowgrain, so it would make sense.
---
Dude shut up.
---
&gt;Adding the quest hub at least provided some respite in between two grinds. The dry spell wasn't just 50-60, more like 45-60.
---
oh yes, I remember, sometime in Burning Crusade, I was swapping zones every level, to avoid getting outleveled - between Searing Gorge and some zone in Kalimdor, don'T remember which one. Felwood?
---
I am in the same situation, with literally the same classes/races.
---
I played lock/mage back in the day, but playing on pservers I had forgotten how mana hungry they both are, and how squishy lock pets are.
---
I switched to DK at one point and loved it, but there isnt a viable 2h pvp/pve dps except warrior and they are not so great without support
---
Rogue would be my choice except I really miss cloak of shadows, FF and hunters mark suck so badly as a rogue.
---
In closing I have no idea what to pick either lol
---
Blizzard doesn't care what we want, no.  But think about the game dev's who are making this game.  
---
They all want the same things we do.  They are most likely more hardcore gamers than anyone here and know more about WoW than anyone.  
---
The ones that played Vanilla most likely miss it a ton and want to go back to that play style.  I think at first, it'll be great and they will add only the features to the game that make sense to change. 
---
But after a couple of years, management will probably come in and say, we need more profits, then things get ruined.
---
I work in a major corporation where people are EXTREMELY passionate about our products (not video games). The engineers throw out an awesome product that they love and everyone loves, and it's great for a couple of years, then management wants more profits and it gets ruined with various changes.  I think that'll be the case with classic as well.
---
Horde are no better. 
---
I appreciate the counter point. What has your experience raid healing as a Druid been like?
---
what if it was flipped by the selfie mode in camera?
---
&gt;no fewer than 3 or 4 of any class
---
I am absolutely no changes, but the above is just not true. 
---
By Naxx 2 hunters and 2 druids is pretty great. Cover their niches whilst having better classes stacking.
---
Accept
---
That video sucks. Just Preach's video from MoP with forced anger added. 
---
no, Gruul was added later
---
How will sharding make starting zones less empty? It wont be cross-realm if im not completely misstaken
---
just moonwalk
---
A limited beta like that would be a crap beta. 
---
this too got removed. How can it be not related to Classic WOW?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/kORl8TD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/kORl8TD.jpg)
---
Thanks. I clicked "accept" and received Wowhead.
---
I remember having a conversation with a beautiful night elfie, we were together sitting on the ramp to Aldrassil rooftop, and watching beautiful moonset over Teldrassil
---
Wait. I think that's what my GF did to me. Holy shit.
---
Paladin, Feral druid. 
---
If this quest was only added in patch 1.11 (according to wowhead), what was before it?
---
I think that's a little harsh.  Paladins needed a lot more than just taunt to be a functional tank.  And they eventually got the needed overhaul in TBC.  
---
What I didn't understand is how he knew Ret did terrible damage and even buffed them in a test patch but didn't release that to live.  Adjusting numbers would seem simple to implement compared to an overhaul.  I'm not saying things should be perfectly balanced, but when you know a class does half the performance of others, you can safely boost them without fear of balance repercussions.
---
P.S. I have to give Kevin kudos for speaking publicly about the game's design.  He's been a good sport about being willing to listen to criticism.  Wish we would focus more on the successes of WoW's design where it's deserved.  For instance, compare EQ's warrior to vanilla WoW.  He created wildly fun and skillful gameplay out of nothing.
---
GL doing infested Shrine at any decent key level with "AoE pull and kite".
---
you survive by stunlocking people so they cant even cast stuff  
---
What. 
---
No, dude - Day one Vanilla was just as this is gonna be. Server caps reached and everyone fighting for everything.
---
And again just like Vanilla, It'll spread out after the first weekend passes and never be an issue again.
---
Sharding changes the experiance and makes the future uncertain.
---
It has no Place in Classic.
---
Just let it be a shit show. It's how it should be. 
---
I've received a lot of messages throughout the months, I think people do appreciate it! :D          
---
That's awesome I'm glad people like it. :)
---
You play on GM client right? Their is a command that makes you get 300/300 in deffense (so they don't  crit u all the time)

I'm happy to know that people are interested about this guide, thank you guys!

I actually did play Frozen Throne but thats when I was 12 and could barely speak or understand English let alone to notice this 
---
**&lt;TBD&gt; [H] RP-PvP* Central Time**
---
I"m putting together a guild that will focus on organized world pvp in the first few months after release. On Wednesday nights we will attack an alliance city/zone depending on numbers and average level. Once we have enough raiders to enter MC, Wednesday nights will be for MC/Ony. An additional raid night will be added later on based on group consensus. 
---
Loot: Non-set items will be obtained via DKP. Set items will be distributed by an elected loot council. Loot council will be elected by core members of the respective role each season or raid tier. 
---
*If there is no RP-PvP server in the central time zone, we will roll on a standard PvP server. We believe an RP-PvP server will have a more stable, adult community and allow us greater opportunity for world PvP ;) 
---
Get off tinder thirsty boi
---
Flight paths, in fairness, were actually lifted directly from DAoC's horse routes....there's even an AMA somewhere with an old vanilla dev talking about it :P  
---
Not on Phoenix, but I've been keeping an eye on it.  Kinda lost hope in DAoC freeshards when Uthgard went to shit.  ATM my wife and I are waiting patiently for CU and are *most definitely not* playing on anything that sounds like dorthnale.....
---
Sharding will indeed make starter zones more empty when needed, not less. 
---
&gt; if they enabled sharding just for the starting zones, this would make starting zones feel less empty
---
Its the complete opposite! Sharding splits up the players in different phased shards. So even if there are hundreds of players on your realm in one zone you cant see them...
---
Just imagine how this will ruin world pvp. People ask for help at crossroads and you rush there to help and even though there is an epic pvp battle on one shard you cant even see it because they are phased...
---
rofl
---
If you're interested in this type of thing(world pvp tom foolery and hijinks), I'm putting together a guild on an RP-PvP server for Horde. We will raid weeknights with lots of world pvp as we grind to 60. 
---
\&gt; I now long to actually read each quest 
---
Ha, i hear this a lot. Will see how long it lasts...
---
I agree with what your saying. Paladins were aoe tanks in Vanilla on very specific fights. They were more useful than communuty perception believed.
---
The gluth vid is an example of that. Perfect for them. 
---
Rares can be either elite or non-elite. The dragon is obviously elite, possibly the yeti as well. 
---
wait, what level was the twink with \[Arena Grand Majster\]?
---
I will play a shaman in Classic and even I agree ;)
---
I saw the dragon in the thumbnail and was like wtf? Never knew there was a rare dragon in hillsbrad/alterac, that’s pretty sick.
---
Chest Wont be there on launch, fastest to chest is orc/troll via jumping to ratchet from starting zone
---
Dunno man murder? You open up on a guy even if you stun him he can still blink away. Or he freezes you and blinks away. Then he can sheep you if he wants. Or keep kiting you.  
---
I speced specifically into improved sprint so it would break CC so I would have a chance against these guys. But even then the fights were never easy against a decent mage.  
---
Maybe if you have great gear you can burn them down easily. But I was just a rogue in leveling greens and never found frost mages an easy kill
---
I don't think the two descriptions of the class design are mutually exclusive.  Chess' challenge is cerebral, it is not a dexterously demanding game.  Kevin said he envisioned pallies would need to plan their moves ahead which is what the seal/judge system aimed to create.  I think it turned into a pretty decent design in TBC.
---
I salute you on your endeavor! My first time through it took me almost 4 months to hit cap, granted I was I my doing 2-4 hours here and there.
---
assuming you are able to consistently hit the warrior...  
---
you would be oom by the time he is at 80% life.
---
you tried mang
---
Days/weeks/months for av/ab/wsg respectively.
---
From the position of a mostly solo queued horde player on retail back in the day.
---
I remember the effect called with a ribs icon. I actually called it "ribs", and when I got it, I said "oh no".
---
It was something like -50% attack speed or something, so I really hated it. I hated it so much, so when fighting a mob that was applied it, I shapeshifted out of cat form and kept moonfiring/wrathing with roots up all the time.
---
&gt;Up until now, the zones covered could be considered low level areas, so the rare spawns only have increased chances of green items, bags, etc...
---
actually several of the low level rares have unique named greens that only drop from that specific mob, or other items like bags that are unique to that mob. The 1-20 zones have more of these unique items than higher level zones. 
---
&gt;This video, and the one on Thousand Needles, show the first rare spawns that can drop blue items.
---
don't forget Talon of Vultros (blue dagger) from Vultros in westfall :D 
---
Nice, but to be fair. We are not talking about 2% but around 50-70% less damage in raids for the weak specs.
---
Go with honor, friend.
---
Taking a full week off just to play WoW will get you burned out. You need to spread out your days over the course of 2-4 weeks imo so you can stay fresh. At least that's what I'll be doing. 
---
I think a lot of people are going to find this out for themselves like I did last private server launch. After I played like 20 hours straight I was like holy shit I don't even want to see a computer screen for a while. 
---
Dude if you can't tell the difference between getting stunlocked in street fighter and crashing a funeral, you're a lost cause. Ethics don't fly out the window as soon as you log in either. There's a real person behind every player character, so your sense of morality towards them should still apply in some capacity.
---
That's not a counter point, that's just typical immature internet community behavior.  One more user to add to the block list, I guess.
---
Read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ip12s/resto_druid_pve_pros_cons/).  I'm not the only one saying these things.
---
This is the funnies thing that happened in WoW's history.
---
Yeah and the version that classic is using has a system that makes spell batching obsolete because it has a more advanced ticking system.  Going through and completely redoing that system is nothing like mimicking the server side ticking in a private server.  
---
2015
---
I was trying to be nice and get him to elaborate.
---
Naxx is still such a small percentage of the game that it doesn't make sense to say they are equals
---
Man I don't even play Alliance and this made me want to make a human warrior and RP my way from oldest son to war hero.
---
Wife material there! 
---
I personally think sharding should be used heavily at launch and tapered off over the course of a week.  I think they should give us the precise schedule that should be used and the rules applied to it.  Like:  Day 1 - All zones sharded max 100 characters per shard.  Day 2 - All zones sharded max 100 characters in starting zones, max 200 characters in other shards.. Day 3-7 only starting zones sharded max 100 characters per shard.  
---
Obviously not those exact numbers but something like that where we know the exact limitations of the system going in and when it will end.  Having a specific schedule will make the whole thing more tolerable.. imo.
---
every post about "class balance"  is only ever referencing PvE situations, without a thought for PvP.  I have never seen a vanilla PvP player advocate for "class balance"
---
That isn't true :P without the gold sink prices inflate slowly. Good example is if someone joins quite late. They'll have 0g by the time they're 60 and can't afford to tip a mage for a port if the tip is like 100g :P
---
Or if someone never farms properly and all they have is the money from killing mobs they won't be able to afford anything. Or if someone takes a long break from the game. 
---
45+/hr work week, gym 5 days/week, part time MBA program, wife, taking care of the house ... I like to think I'll get to play but reality will be 7-10 hours a week. I weep inside =( 
---
Always help allies even if it's a hopeless situation. 
---
Usually maintain some sense of a truce when questing or grinding solo. We are just two adventurers crossing paths, but it's time to fight if there are groups of horde and alliance. 
---
Dont ever let the opposite faction control farming areas. 
---
Call in reinforcements if getting yanked and help those in need.
---
LOK'TAR OGAR

I hope he will, it will definitely be a bonding experience for us both (we both work the same schedule so we will have time together!)
---
I’m taking 3 days off from work and will effectively disappear from the planet
---
Yeah, Im not subbed to BfA. I wouldn't even play that if Blizzard payed me a subscription...

That’s the plan!

Also, a lot of people in the thread you linked are saying Druids are very viable in raids and that only elitists consider them otherwise.
---
So thanks for the counter points. 
---
One is not better than the other, only different.
---
Level 19. The quest can be done at any level, though it's a challenge to gather 12 pieces of them.

Getting WSG rep, just to buy an item
---
Damn. I remember it. I was level 19, patch 1.12, Blizzard has just created battlegroups.
---
What changed? That now, almost all horde players in 10-19 were level 19 rank 3 tauren hunters, and almost all alliance players were level 10-12 rank 0 gnome mages
---
I wanted to give my side a bit of boost, and to get to rank 3 and exalted, and buy those items.
---
But hordes, who already had what they wanted, kept getting 3 marks, and me, who needed rep, was getting only 1. After shitloads of grind, I made it to friendly... and passed out.
---
I decided to try level 20-29 range, maybe that would be better. But again, level 29 tauren hunters, just with a higher rank.
---
Gave 30-39 a try. Liked it, and was quite fun, because I had travel form, and rest had just feet. I realized how OP druid was. I was just in cat form, stealth, and track humanoids, and when I was seeing no red dots, I jumped into the flag room, snatched the flag, boots, dash after boots expired, and travel form after dash expired.
---
But, even with this tactic, my team was still losing most, because if 39 tauren hunters.
---
I kept hearing that 40-49 is much better, so gave it a try... and ended up being the only one without a mount. I felt it a waste to get a mount, which I have to cast, and has only 20% increase towards my travel form. But, I was always behind without it.
---
That was the end of twinking for that time.
---
Then, in late WotLK, I created a character on another realm, which was RP, and found out that Alliance was the most-winning side on that battlegroup.
---
But, 4.0.1 aired, they merged all battlegroups, and "horde always winning" became the new standard. That was the definite end of twinking for me.
---
Choices bro; how important is that MBA when you can have a fully decked out T2 Paladin running around Stormwind? ^(/s)
---
That date is a Sunday. Blizzard releases games on Tuesdays.
---
and wait... it was possible at level 19? The grand master didn't require any level?
---
And 16 hours a day is impossible?  HMB
---
Lol I honestly don't need to prove anything to anyone. Really don't care about your napkin theory crafting either. 
---
In your opinion 
---
I like the idea of mage, but the realities are too frustrating honestly. So much drinking. 
---
Feels like you spend half your time in dungeons drinking, and inraids you're just spamming 1 spell. 
---
Implying only first hand experience is the only way to make valid decisions about anything is really silly lol
---
I love being 31 married with no kids. I had siblings growing up, I worked in a daycare for a while, I'm well aquainted with what having kids is like after helping friends/families with theirs
---
My wife and I LOOOOVEEE being the cool aunt/uncle that has money and free time and can give the nephews back when we're done spoiling them. 
---
It rocks.
---
"preedings"
---
"see jå round"
---
Basically, how a Dane would comprehend the WOW's human accent. The 'p' was caused by the "targeting" sound effect.
---
I am in a similar situation.  I am off all summer because I am a teacher, so hopefully that speeds up the leveling process bit.  I will honestly be happy if i make it to max level and get to occasionally do raids during alt runs or something .
---
I’m really interested in how questing evolved in vanilla. I imagine there was a ton of grinding in earlier patches.
---
Correct. The green trinket [Arena Master] requires level 35 to wear, but the quest it starts has no level requirement. Once you complete it you get the blue trinket [Arena Grand Master] which has no level requirement either.
---
Things like the fishing rewards [Lucky Fishing Hat] and [Nat Pagle's Extreme Anglin' Boots] work the same way.
---
strange, as ishnu-alah is one of the few texts that aren't in English - well, at least on the English version
---
Right, fortunately I don't remember running into that a lot while playing, the amount of time you need to cheap shot before stealth is broken by another damage tic is so small it'd be NEAR impossible to do it, but if the warrior has cat like reflexes then the rogue is screwed lol. 
---
&gt; Server caps reached and everyone fighting for everything
---
not this much as it would be in 2019. If they put queues up the same way, it could be 5-digit numbers.
---
thottbot :Ð
---
it was actually a link to thottbot, but... you know.
---
While some items were removed, many more where changed or... normalized...
---
And after those 30 minutes you tag one mob and it immediately reapplies
---
50-60 is faster if you're questing. You hit shitty quest zones somewhere beyond Tanaris/ZF (~44), like before you can quest in Un'goro.  I could be mixing up where you hit the wall.
---
&gt; How will sharding make starting zones less empty? 
---
that there will be less tons of other players to bump into
---
It was literally asked if having no kids is "better"
---
First of all thats subjective.
---
Second of all you can't state whether something is better than another having not experienced both.
---
"Coke is better than Pepsi" oh. "Tell me what you don't like about Pepsi." Well "I've never actually had Pepsi, I just know Coke is better."
---
Whats your point? As I didn’t understand English then, I didn’t bother reading either and I’ve heard it since then and heard it in WoW through the years. 
---
Thanks for the unnecessary note that Ishnu-alah wasn’t English.
---
&gt; Second of all you can't state whether something is better than another having not experienced both.
---
Yes you can.
---
I think drinking a Coke is better than being impaled up the ass with a giant spear.
---
If you need to be fucked with a giant spear to decide between the two, there might be something wrong with you, internet pedantic guy.
---
Yes but you have to sub to it in order to access Classic. It's not what we want but it's the reality.
---
100k subs day one will be very small compared to launch today.
---
So no today’s launch will be nowhere near what it was at first launch.
---
I wouldn’t expect anything less than 1 million people picking up Classic day 1.
---
SJW BS didn't exist back then... 
---
Not preparing in-game at all, as the game is not up yet.
---
I'm not doing any theorycrafting or any special planning in advance. All I've planned is my character's race, class, appearance (to some point), and name (hopefully nobody'll take it)
---
I'm creating a hyping playlist of old videos, to play just before classic releases.
---
And also, I'll be preparing a list of pre-BiS items, and ways to get them - quests, etc. So I don't get stuck at level 60 not knowing what to do to easily get gear. And, leveling dungeon quests, because the more the better.
---
If possible, I'm hoping to start playing in late morning or early afternoon - just like I did back then. It was a warm, sunny day, and I felt no rush or hurry at all. I remember it.
---
Very well done! I really wasn't expecting such an outstanding quality!
---
I think you got it all wrong, bro. They said that 1.12 will be the *foundation* because it is the most complete version of Vanilla WoW. This does not mean that they will include EVERYTHING that was in 1.12. 
---
I have seen this being discussed numerous times already. Whatever they choose regarding Crossrealm BGs will still be blizzlike and 100% accurate comparing to Vanilla. 
---
AV can be done pretty quick depending on how fast the games are and if you win. 
---
AB/WSG are painfully slow. I think in all my 200-300 days BGing, I've gotten 2 characters to exalted with WSG and 0 with AB. It's kinda ridiculous if you think about it. By the time you can buy those faction epics, your gear is easily much better from raiding. 
---
Yeet
---
Wow man, thanks a lot for the kind words :)
---
What is it?
---
Writing angry messages on r/wow about how crappy retail is in a hope that blizzard will gi e us classic earlier 
---
Let us all pray for a beta opening 
---
Hhuummmmm 🙏🏽
---
Naxxramas.
---
&gt; overlooks the specs that shine in PvP or open world.
---
See... I support classic more or less staying the same, but arguments like this I absolutely hate. Mages shoot this argument in the foot when you take into account that they excel at every aspect of the game they’re able to participate in. Highest DPS class in Endgame, Best CC in the game, AoE Farming, Open World, Kiting, etc. 
---
Are people looking at this from the wrong direction? Do we need to bring the outliers back down into the curve? Warriors should get absurd scaling and be the only optimal tank. Hunters shouldn’t be relegated to being Tranq Bots in the endgame stages.
---
all the things you've mentioned are choices. I could see how someone would rather choose time for themselves to do whatever they would like. 
---
Seal of Righteousness fades
---
If I recall correctly: Grey mob kills only gave 20% of the max rep if you killed them while they weren't grey, but I believe quests still gave full rep. The only reference I was able to find was this: [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Reputation](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Reputation) so as you said it was a fairly difficult question to answer but that source matched my memory. Perhaps someone else will have another source.
---
Yeah no way this is from retail. 5th screenshot "dank meme bro". That's recent language, definitely a private server. Nice screenshots though
---
Since I blocked Mr. "lol no" I can't respond to your "thanks for the counterpoints" response but I'll say this:
---
I'm not telling you they aren't viable.  *In my experience playing one*, my heals are constantly being sniped and I spend more time canceling to avoid overhealing than not.  Objectively, I could have not been in the raid at all, and the healing would barely have suffered because a 3 second cast is too slow 95% of the time.
---
Most of my resto experience has been dispeling and sometimes rejuving if I'm the only one there, because I'm running the same HT build you're talking about.
---
And it's not fun.
---
Maybe not prepared enough or strong enough... You've always been good enough, kid. 
---
Thanks man, great guide! I've been putting together my own little mage guide every now and then when I find something useful, but this about summs it up and adds a whole lot more!
---
One question: which server do you play on and are you sure that the aoe leveling you showed also work on retail? I've seen some videos were people noted that some retail mechanics (like nets/roots in the entrance zone of BRD) arent implemented in most private servers, thus making differenct techniques possible
---
Yep. All these “how are you preparing for Classic” threads with people taking vacation, buying Mountain Dew and Hot Pockets and so forth... here I am praying my wife will adjust to me spending ten hours a week on the computer and that my insane colleagues around the world will not notice the sudden increase in me canceling meetings during raid times.
---
Item level doesn't matter on classic - while items have item level, it says nothing about the stats. Ilevel 45 item may have exactly the same stats as ilevel 42, or even worse.
---
As far as I remember, AQ items have ilevel 90, which means raid level + 30. MC items have ilevel 70 or something, thus level 50 epics won't have ilevel 80.
---
I think that Blizzard has abandoned the ilevel concept at some point when making WOW - and not returned to it, until Cataclysm.
---
When Naxxramas is released, there is a scourge invasion. In which Kel'Thuzad teleports the Necropolis to various high lvl zones (including Tanaris, Azshera, EPL iirc) and it spawns waves of high level undead mobs. As a result, you can see the Necropolis floating above some ofthese areas when it is spawing the undead mobs. You are also likely to see "/yell" voicelines from Kel'Thuzad himself when the Necropolis is in the area.
---
This is all based on my memory from over a decade ago, so take it for what you will.
---
Wish I had your dad. Mine just guilt tripped me into thinking I’d be a failure because I like gaming.
---
So! Intimidating!
---
Yeah I think I gave up doing BGs on WoD so it makes sense lol
---
This escalated at a rapid pace.
---
More mechanics doesn't always mean more complex.  A lot of time it's just more pulses of damage and things to move out of.
---
this ripped a memory out of my skull about the time I grouped up on my low level Hunter to take down this drake. 
---
complete 'inside of the original box' moment.
---
In fact, Quests were added at a later point during the alpha. Initially you'd been supposed to grind your way to the maximum level. Quests were then added as a guideline for players to know where to find monsters of the appropriate level next.
---
EPL is also one of the best designed zones IMHO. Love questing through the plagued mushroom forest and going into ziggurats to take them out.
---
Don't forget the mana issues.
---
Someone on reddit once described that he’d set up his whole life so that—outside 40 hours/week at work—he’d have to answer to no one but himself.
---
I kinda dig that.
---
I also kinda dig my wife, though. And kids might not be so bad someday.
---
But I get where he’s coming from and am a bit jealous at times. It must not be easy to have the strength to go solo, but it is truly “free.”
---
I think you had to find the Marshal McBride in the Abbey yourself. 
---
I guess some people pre-1.11 never found even their first quest, because they did not have the reflex of visiting the nearby building.
---
the 'weakness' of using fear in dungeons is actually one of the reasons I'm going Warlock.
---
juggling fear and curse of recklessness until the mob runs in a safe direction is the type of interaction I want, it feels rewarding.
---
Well, I could just use that classic example of "I've never eaten shit but I already know it won't taste good" but then again, there are people that like eating that so...
---
Guess it depends on each person. I never wanted kids and I really hope I never do.
---
No you have to sub to Classic in order to access BfA.
---
TIL! That's pretty dope. I'm really glad they added questing to the game obviously, but mainly for the story element. So many great quests have really fleshed out the lore of the world and its zones.
---
The idea of a pure grind WoW would have been really cool actually if group exp wasn't gimped.
---
In almost the same position over here. Haven’t really gamed in years and years, but getting back into it now.
---
Fortunately the wife seems semi ok with it so far. I don’t think I can just go ham though, that might raise alarm bells.
---
5 digit numbers?
---
So your assuming 10k pop on Classic servers, yet your post is asking for an
---
&gt;"authentic vanilla experience".
---
lol.
---
You're saying you want changes to create an *authentic vanilla experience,* yet what you really want is changes to allow/create an experience that isn't authentic at all.
---
Good enough to enter? I didn’t even clear BWL and I was able to enter. Attunment was easy. Maybe not being good enough to kill or clear, but entering wasn’t hard. 
---
That’s what modern wow is missing and why Classic was so great. Inaccessibility makes you feel like one person in a much greater world. Lets you set goals and strive to one day reach that point. Nowadays, if that came out, people would just play it on easy mode normal difficulty or even queue up for it in LFR, ignore mechanics, and kill Kel’Thuzad. Why kill it on mythic? I already did it on LFR/normal, and the “achievement” doesn’t really matter or feel rewarding anymore unless you’re the first in the world. The loot from there would become invalidated by the next tier’s LFR...
---
Paying $15 a month doesn’t give anyone the automatic right to “see content.” You wanna see it? Put in the time and get in a guild and get your ass there. MMOs need to feel grand and challenging like this again. I can’t wait for classic to come out. 
---
No one crashed the girl's IRL funeral as far as I know.
---
What happened is that alliance players decided to cast spells on horde players in a PvP allowed map.
---
3 companies I could do.
---
But 3 companies + horses? Have mercy.
---
Agreed. It's really tight
---
Your logic makes absolutely zero sense btw. 
---
If you sacrifice a void walker, you are basically immune to a warriors offense.
---
I think it depends on what do you like in your life.
---
I like having a lot of freedom, having lots of free time and not working ("farming money") a lot.
---
For me, having a kid would be terrible because I would surelly lose all that (or I would be a terrible father, no good option here)
---
I mean, it’s gonna be the same, at least initially (years not months). Don’t worry about big changes. Not gonna happen.
---
So much this. I’ve argued this for so long and most people look at me like I’m an idiot. 
---
It was good that I never entered Naxx, it was good that I could never get in Black Temple. It was something I always wanted but didn’t invest enough in to obtaining. It made these places so mysterious too me, made them legendary.
---
Getting the rep needed to enter with the Argent Dawn was a friggin grind that most players did not do.
---
Thank you! :D    
---
I'm playing on my own server which uses the code from "Light" (I know the bot can automatically remove posts that contains such names, but you know what I'm referring to :P).   
---
Sadly I haven't seen any video from pre-2007 that proves that this is indeed possible if you are talking about the Maraudon farming method, so I guess we have to hope that there are no elemental earth types of mobs patrolling in this zone.    
---
That being said, isn't Maraudon one of the rare places untouched by Cataclysm? If anybody who reads this post can tell me how that little spot looks like (the worm + turtle spots, right after the room where you kill Celebras) that will be really nice.    
---
And yes you're actually right but not everybody knows this, the dwarf-type mobs nets are Blizzlike and there are casters-type mobs on top of the arena making BRD farming impossible, I guess you can still farm the lower level with Blink and Escape Artist to get out of the nets but that would still be really inefficient.
---
There was a good video I can't find now explaining rep gains and why it is important to get your rep quests done in time. 
---
What I recall is that reputation gets diminished dramatically if your character becomes 2 levels above the moment the quest becomes gray. 
---
For example a lvl20 quest became gray the moment you hit lvl 28 but you still should be able to get a good portion of rep by doing this quest if you don't go above lvl 30. 
---
Nah. Unless the raid is clearly short handed on dispelers/healers I don't see why the ret paladin would need to cleanse.  If it gets to this point you might aswell stand back and cleanse full time
---
Seriously. Skipped the MBA two years ago (didn’t get in) and got Benediction yesterday on my priest.
---
Still got the post-MBA job a few months ago, without the debt and lost income, and I got to do what I like after work along the way.
---
It’s that #slackerlife paying off!
---
(And a shit ton of privilege and a hot economy.)
---
Yep, I saw it in Blasted Lands before.
---
I remember when they started multiple difficulties and then queueable raid content. I used to bite my lip and let everyone say “well now we can all see the content!”
---
I’m sick of that care bear mentality. You should have to EARN your way to the pinnacle raid content. I never even stepped into Naxx in original vanilla. I was never geared, skilled, or dedicated enough. Guess what? When I saw someone in Orgrimmar wearing full tier 3, I would shit my pants, inspect them and just be in awe of them. In an MMO, that sort of feeling like you have to work for things and are handsomely rewarded is the most important feeling. And it’s gone nowadays...
---

CUT HIM UP AND THROW HIM IN THE DOWNVOTE SOUP
---
every rogue player will love that 30 minute debuff that does some damage every 10seconds, which basically disables stealth :D
---
Thank you.
---
That's not how I recalled it. On my server we had 1500+ server queues and all the starting zones were packed with people. 
---
I'm proud to say I stepped in with my guild and we managed to kill 2 bosses. Felt like a God among ants.
---
Then our guild blew up :(
---
you needed at least honored with the Argent Dawn and then had to pay a huge fee of arcane crystals and other end game mats to enter, so a bit more to do than just killing Draki...
---
Exactly! You know when I “got to see the content” of Naxx? When I was level 70 in BC and me and some guildies went in to clear bosses. It was epic and we still couldn’t get past 4 horseman! 
---
It's a good way to engage people who make outlandish claims such as "You can't judge anything you havn't experienced first hand"
---
Show them that you actually can by setting extreme upper or lower boundaries, then they accept it's a possibility, just not with your example.
---
Then you can dial it in to find a middle ground compromise.
---
AV is quick if you power play on AV weekend and you dont get zerg bgs but only both factions rushing the opposing sides bosses
---
AB and WSG are really hard...
---
Druids are brought to raids for
---
1) Rebirth / Innervate
---
2) Loot diversity
---
3) Heals
---
in that order, IMO. 
---
Everybody's gangsta until there are 8 priests in the raid trying to roll on the T2 legs.
---
I'll be playing druid in Classic and I'm more excited to just become a beast 5/10/20 man tank, and a force to be reckoned with in world PvP.
---
Not seating gorge but my favorite quest name in classic is Are We There Yeti? So much grinding for those pristine horns.
---
The fuckery of oldschool blizz were that they could make a normal rare mob have elite stats and still be rare tho.. so be careful ;P 
---
The way it should be. The biggest reason we were able to live in a game that way and still love it, was that the entire game was relevant content-wise and EVERYONE had things to do. I spent my time world pvping, doing bgs, and doing the lower end raids. I still had a blast. This notion that only the current raid matters and everyone should get to see it is just cancer. There’s nothing to do anymore in modern wow besides the current raid and PvP. Even during naxx, the vast majority of players were doing the lower end raids because naxx took that much preparation and dedication. That is FINE. Raids should never become irrelevant! Until maybe expansions, even then it’s debatable imo. 
---
This time around, I’m going to work hard and strive to be one of those elite players that makes it into Naxx. But the entire game is so good that not everyone needs to do that to have a good time. I can’t wait!!!
---
Mmmm durability loss. I can taste it now. Delicious. 
---
The key point about the rare greens are that the stats are usually really good for the spec/class they drop for.
---
A lot of quest greens and world greens had kinda meh but still good mixture of  stats, while rare greens tended to be really solid priostats
---
shoutout for Ð, the greatest of letters
---
It’s about ability to play. Do you think they are going to launch with enough servers to hold everyone wanting to play at launch?
---
I don’t see blizzard or activision launching wth enough classic servers to hold everyone. In comes sharding, you increase caps therefore lowering queues, and allowing everyone to play. Without increased caps classic launch would be fucked beyond belief. Even with increased caps and sharding there will be queues.
---
On a pvt server I went back to Searing Gorge at 60 for Thorium Brotherhood quests/rep.
---
Not sure what full numbers should have been but rep gain definitely felt diminished to the point of not being worth it.
---
Yes and it was all just pixels on a screen as well. You can boil anything down to its bare components and make it sound insignificant, but context is key. 
---
Also I never said IRL funeral.
---
well mages are overall the best quality of life class in the game. They have great damage, strong CC, buffs, can make water and have talents that boost their hit rating and reduce their threat generated. So in any group composition you can fit in a mage in one of the dps slots.
---
Warlocks on the other hand do more or less the same damage as mages (I know, I know...), but lack in CC (fear cannot be used in dungeons), dont get +hit or threat reduction and they have that anoying soul shard mechanic. On the other hand they bring tons of utility (curses, health and soul stones, summon, imp buff). So warlocks are a great class, but do not fit as nicely as mages do.
---
PS: I play warlock and I love it
---
Agreed completely. I've gotten into discussions with people about how they can only play one hour a week and that they should be able to obtain the same gear as someone who plays 3 or 4 hours a day. If it was learning to play piano for instance, you wouldn't expect to have to the same skill level as someone who devotes more time, that's just how it works.
---
At one point soon after osrs released, the player base went to less than 10k online at any time. That lasted for a few months untill godwars dungeon was released and the game has had a steady climb in players ever since. I hope blizzard takes note of OSRS success. 
---
Yeah same. I have leveled a warrior to 60 recently. I can't bring myself to farm dungeons or proffessions because in a couple months I can do everything again but then it's the real deal. Don't want myself to burn out.
---
Currently playing throuth the Risen series. Great RPGs.
---
I played in Vanilla and had the same experience although I loved healing. I was usually 1 of 2-4 Druid’s so I was juiced for gear as well. As I’ve mentioned before, I picked up a crapload of feral gear which made PvP during non raiding time great.
---
Druid’s have fast heals if you down rank so I didn’t get sniped too often, and if I did, oh well I didn’t spend that much mana. I always considered my role to be taking care of everyone, particularly with HoT’s as Druid HoT’s once you are juiced on +heal are absolutely phenomenal at keeping people alive.
---
spirit is a strong leveling stat for warlocks, because of imp soul drain improving the effect of mana regen
---
Not to mention the atmosphere of it. I feel like a lot of zones lost their "feel" with the Cata remakes.
---
*laughs in Priest*
---
&gt;And now... For your viewing pleasure... Wordlife goes necrobestial on Satsloader's corpse.
---
Holy shit I exploded.
---
I see you are a man of class. Welcome to the fold.
---
By not playing any MMORPG so the experience will be as fresh as possible. I don't want to feel burned out before I even begin!
---
Juiced for gear messaging you had just as difficult a time gearing up as other classes? Also, where did you acquire feral gear so quickly, raiding?
---
I am right there with you my friend.  A lot of us are hoping to put in as much time as we once did. But I have a feeling RL priorities are not going to let that happen. I'll be happy with 10-12 hours a week. 
---
I think they will attract different crowds and I’m okay with that. Classic will attract the RPG players, a lot of the originals, the pacing will be slower, there will be more random grouping in the world, a lot more emergent entertaining situations. I strongly suspect people won’t be rushing though dungeons like it is in retail and I think classic players won’t mind this, in fact, I think they’ll enjoy it much more.
---
Retail player numbers will drop a bit but I think the people that are easily distracted by shiny trinkets will continue play retail. I am very happy if this happens. I played classic, what made it fun is not the epic loot you got, it was the adventures you had to go on to get it.
---
r/workingadultsguild
---
We are looking for more members. As the title implies, we are all working adults with regular schedules(work, kids, wives,etc) but we are all WoW veterans with varying levels of pvp and pve experience. We are rolling horde and will do raids twice a week no more than 4 hours per raid. Also premade pvp and leveling groups. We will be relaxed but structured and completing end game content.
---
Please check it out we have quite a few members and are rounding out our first 40 man group. 
---
This is actually what I have my fingers crossed for. Personally I want to play TBC 24/7. TBC was my Classic and I only got to run Black Temple and Sunwell Plateau a handful of times.  
---
I also want to experience Classic 60 for a considerable amount of time. So if something like this does happen. Optional migration would be incredible. Heck, even keeping 1 char on 60 but duplicating for TBC would be even better.
---
We're not planning to have kids for another couple years, so I probably have time to clear all Classic content before I have all my free time sucked away!
---
That sounds normal, cant expect gem, peb or lokamir as trial, try spam zg for jindo loot and enchs, maybe the ring set if you have poor ones
---
You will be an innervate-bitch for the Priests in raids. Get used to it. Even when you go oom, you will be expected to provide for other classes who do better on the healing meters. To that end, have your innervate macro ready to go. There is nothing louder &amp; whinier than a Priest who goes oom without his innervate.

Well, it's like 10-15 runs of strath or scholo, considerably more for revered and exalted though. What most people didn't realise is that during the scourge invasion event you could get exalted in an evening and get some pretty powerful alt gear. It wasn't stronger than AQ gear but it certainly helped alts. 
---
I'd like to say that nowadays we know about this and everyone will be exalted immediately. However what I've seen on private servers is that by far the majority have no clue about anything. They just play the game and kinda stumble their way through instead of reading Reddit, forums and watching youtube. 
---
yeah I don't expect to get loot over people that helped the guild get BWL to farm status.  I was in charge of my retail guilds DKP system in 05 so I know what it's like to have people whine about loot.
---
Am exalted with ZG and AV, just need a good one hand to drop.
---
This is my own opinion but if u want to have fun, reliability,  and still be invited to guilds and raids then honestly mage is the way to go.
---
I cannot express how much fun they are to play in pvp, and then when it comes to dungeons (5mans) my mage could tank most pulls besides bosses in vanilla and tbc. Didn't need a real tank, this really only happened when a tank would ditch us or disconnect but it was rly fun being the glass cannon tank role. 
---
Mage have food and water for free, teleportation , cc out the ass, and fun to use high dps. I really suggest u making a mage and perhaps make him and enchanter and tailor so u can hook ur priest up whenever u make 1 of them 
---
Yes it's a Warcraft 3 knight.

I won’t be rushing to 60. I’m not going to purposefully waste my time though, but I’m not going to rush.
---
\*\*&lt;Requiem&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore\*\*
---
\*\*Intro:\*\* We are a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.    
---
First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild. Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression. Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.    
---
\*\*What we're focusing on now:\*\* Building a core group\* of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.
---
\_\*If you have past experience with being a raid/class leader (or even no experience at all) and are interested in applying for an officer position, PM me.\_    
---
\*\*Expectations:\*\* Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.    
---
\*\*Raid Schedule:\*\* Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.

They absolutely diminished as they got grey in classic. It was important to do the quests as they were within your level range. This is what actually began things like Gnomes making the pilgrimage all the way to the Human starter zone at level 1. You didnt want to lose all that rep you got from Elwynn forest for SW by completing them when they were aged down and only giving partial rewards.
---
It made rep grinding hell on earth for the city factions in particular. I cannot remember when they changed it, but I know it initially worked that way for certain.
---
So it's not just grey quest, but 2 levels above grey?
---
Also, quests become grey after you're 8 levels above it?
---
We all know that classic sucked in terms of class balancing but it what it is. Just leave it and play on a future expansion where you think you can agree with its design.
---
I'd much rather see them go back in design philosophy on live servers not make it more casual.
---
Thanks for the Input!
---
I'd suggest you to add the "Stats/PvP" gear tab above that all. 
---
You know, stuff like this [neck](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14558), [ring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17045), [chest](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16700),[2H](https://classicdb.ch/?item=812) and so forth. 
---
Currently NOONE mentioning this in their guides, people are only suggesting items like bloodvine leggings, which has +6 int if i remember correclty. 
---
That gear can only suit raids and ONLY raids, however, the other pieces can have T2 worth of stats on it. Which is useful in duels, battlegrounds and even AoE farming (if you're doing bosses, elite DME part, ZG tigers etc, in other words it's something harder than underleveled lashers). 
---
You can technically nobrain "of the Eagle" highlvl greens, but there is better options around, and you can be the first one who put an effort to mention it :3
---
I wasn’t level 60 during the scourge event so I don’t remember.
---
In your case that's obvious. 
---
You can't just sit there and say one product is better than another simply "because"
---
Just like you can't state whether or not having kids is better than not having kids, seeing as how you DON'T in fact have children you simply don't know. Clown boy.
---
How does a mage tank mobs in 5 mans? Sure they can tank 1 mob if the healer is really on top form, any class can. But how does a mage tank 2 mobs, 3 mobs, in a standard 5 man pull? How does he hold aggro with a rogue backstabbing, how does he taunt? I'm not entirely convinced, but interested to see your reply nonetheless! :)
---
I agree...?
---
I healed dungeons as a Druid during vanilla and I didn't find it too difficult - quite the opposite actually. I believe at that time I used the Clique add-on, which would downcast to the most appropriate rank. 
---
Lol... u forget classic wasn't straight up easy mode. Cloak of shadows is a VERY OP tool for rogues. I loooove my rogue and I used CoS all the time but in classic u won't have it, jist like other classes won't have certain spells. U have to choose ur timing better. Make sure the caster isn't straight focused on u or jist use ur stun locking. There will be times where all u wanna do is remove a 30 minute long debuff from some low lvl mob but u can't without a priest pally or shaman
---
The great thing about vanilla WoW is that there is always another goal to do. Some people will still have personal goals &amp; grinds, even after a couple years.
---
I would welcome additional content, provided that it is in the spirit of the original 2004 content and builds off of the original gameplay, perhaps one of the unfinished areas of the original maps.
---
&gt;Full reputation is still gained by questing at a higher level. For example, completing low level quests with a level 80 character now gives full reputation. This makes it easier to get to exalted and buy another faction's mount.
---
This is the problem with using online data. The source you linked is not vanilla specific, despite claiming to be vanilla information.
---
Lol did u ever play fire mage ? I can't even count how many times I was tanking in vanilla and tbc both. If u can kite, u can tabk. It's pretty easy to hold aggro as one of the higher dps classes. I remember when I was lvl 44 in dungeons and a tank would dc or leave and we went on to finish the dungeon. The only mobs I couldn't full on tabk were the bosses. But when it came to 4-5 mob groups we could cc 2 and easily kill the other 3 on my lead . 
---
Wow eu launched on friday
---
It's not the easiest to share, and many people will not take them (because they are morons), but I certainly agree that this is the way to go. 
---
haha, isn't it funny how you can completely forget something like this and one small thing can trigger all those fond memories! :D
---
How did people get up there anyway?
---
So rather than have authentic Vanilla with enough servers, you're advocating for 10k pops and Sharding instead?
---
Why not just make a statement about having enough servers?
---
It's better and more likely to happen. 0\_o
---
In the end I don't care about the reasons people pull out of there heads - I don't want sharding anywhere near Classic and I'm not alone.
---
Me neither, started in Wrath but I've read a lot about vanilla and stories from those who played then. 
---
If you want to you can prepare a lot for Classic, but most people will just play the game as if it's their first time, which for quite a few will be.
---
I thought exactly the same while watching the vid.
---
I don't know why, but I keep seeing a minecraft hand in the right corner. 
---
I think i've been playing too much minecraft. 
---
As soon as he said mage has 3 viable specs and arcane as a maybe I tuned out. Hes chatting rubbish. Firstly "Arcane" in the sense of using arcane missles for example in raids is not viable. However Arcane Power spec is ( go deep into arcane and finish off in frost and you spam frostbolt - simply put) There are many viable specs for mages some not being viable till ZG/AQ (Fire) but you also have the new guy raid spec who gets to be winters chill bitch, you have 3 min pvp mage, aoe leveling/farming spec you've got elemental mage, PvP frost spec. These are all viable options. It all depends on your needs and wants. The reason so many people think warrior/rogue/mage are the top dps is because they dont see the benefits of the "meme" specs (ret pally/enhance/ele shammy, boomkin,spriest) They provide huge utility and super nice buffs for your higher dps classes while also giving innverate, dispells, Nightfall proc. You dont need to sit at the top of the charts for your dick to get hard. Min-max what you like but classic wow was about variety of utility to help the raid succeed as a group not about individual dps as threat was largely an issue also. (theorycrafting has helped this somewhat)  
---
Hope this makes sense.
---
He was there, but he had a tiny portion of a zone for a few quests. Quests where we gained knowledge on the trolls IIRC. Not like Cata where he is the focus.
---
Welcome to classic. You might realise that its not the game for you.
---
I dont mind it and even encourage it.
---
At first I thought "10 hours, casual" but then I remembered I'm also not a kid anymore and I have a job and going to college and I have a girlfriend so 10 hours actually seems pretty accurate...
---
Nothing constructive to contribute? Dealio. Guessing you’re gonna be a DPS Warrior, Mage, or Rogue?
---
Grand Marshal Garithos, leader of Alliance's Resistance (last remnants of six northern kingdoms's armies). The last person who stood against the scourge, when everyone else fled like cowards. He hated dwarfs and elves, xenophobic, selfish man. Yet he sided with some undead leaders to destroy other undead leaders. Hypocrite. What do I think about him?
---
"There's no cure for being a cunt" - as ser Bronn of The Blackwater said once.
---
Hes still active on youtube, i feel like messaging him and asking him exactly why that video made him so mad. Maybe it will open up some old wounds.
---
Weird time to get on your soapbox. 
---
Well some classic armor sets look horendous but I agree up until maybe wotlk but for sure tbc a lot of thought was put into armor design.
---
Today they seem to fit a general theme of the current raid/story of the game.
---
Elite plate set looked gorgeous last season though.
---
I recently played a resto druid in a horde side progression guild and this, as you describe it, was my experience too. 
---
I was never the absolute lowest on the healing meters though (maybe because of horde). Because of innervate I was always assigned, together with a priest, to keep a specific tank alive so i did'nt always have to fight to get a heal off. I precast/cancel bigger 1000-1800 heals on tanks and small &lt;500hp rejuvs on the raid. If you land your Nature's Swiftness 3k heal onto a struggeling tank you are gonna feel great. 
---
Priest and Shaman outshine you in almost every way and i would advise only to play druid if you can forget about that fact. 
---
Old ancestor of the crimson chin.
---
I probably got it from the event honestly. I didn’t raid much. I had haunted mementos though. 
---
There was a portal you could step on that would take you up below it or somewhere in the area.
---
Dwarves are the only right choice for rogues
---
Getting my wife acquainted to the MMO atmosphere by playing The Secret World Legends as she's SUPER into the horror genre and this game fits nicely in with her likes (she LOVES the game, btw). 
---
I myself have made a spreadsheet w/ all bis gear for the classes we'll be playing. I still need to go in and adjust it for lower level dungeons so I know which ones to hit for which items, but, in due time. One grief I have about Classic DB is you can't search for quest reward items specifically, so if I wanted to filter swords by ones you can only get via quest I can't do that (fortunately I already know of a few but still). 
---
While that's going on I'm also going to stock up on TV dinners (we have a restrictive diet though so ours are expensive, so been getting them 2-4 at a time for the last few weeks) so that we have enough for 18 days (accounting for 2 weeks of vacation, 2 meals a day). 
---
Once we have a release date, I'll probably jump onto a pserver for practice for 1-2 weeks with her, that way we can get familiar w/ the /commands and hotkeying abilities, but I want to save as much as possible for the live game. 
---
Other than that, refreshing this sub every couple of hours to see if there's any news (there hardly ever is....)
---
Dwarf Priest, Holy or Shadow. Whatever is needed. 
---
Ah! I was wrong. I specifically went looking at Thorium Brotherhood Rep because there were a TON of guides on it in the old days. This post is from 2006. : [https://www.tacticalgamer.com/forum/mass-multiplayer/world-of-warcraft/26452-thorium-brotherhood-and-you](https://www.tacticalgamer.com/forum/mass-multiplayer/world-of-warcraft/26452-thorium-brotherhood-and-you)   
---
So the thorium brotherhood has a series of quests that give you some initial rep and I searched to see if anyone talked about saving the quests to do at a higher rep level to make it easier and I found this:  "You start off at neutral and should actually start working on your rep between 46-54. Trying after that makes the process more painful than it has to be as the 7 quests drop in rep value from 100 to 10. "  
---
So it would seem that grey quests give similar to grey mobs. Perhaps all the way down to 10% of their initial value. 
---
Lol I’ll take em. I’m also the guy who inspects people who might need the same gear i need. Both before the run and after they get gear (mostly if its boe if its after) to make sure they equip it. 
---
&gt; Just like you can't state whether or not having kids is better than not having kids, seeing as how you DON'T in fact have children you simply don't know.
---
And YOU can't say that you would not enjoy having your dick cut off because you never have!
---
I hope that illuminates how dumb your argument was. You can absolutely judge things without first hand experience based on numerous witness accounts, intuition, and more.
---
Otherwise tell me how you know you wouldn't enjoy having your neck bitten by spicy ants? Give it a shot! lmao.
---
Imagine having so little agency that you can't make basic decisions without trying every option first. How do you even shop for clothes without trying on every single piece of clothing available??! Living with you must be a nightmare of indecision.
---
I think part of the problem is that since Wrath, the sets were designed to fit the dungeon where you get them instead of being designed to suit the class wearing them. It means every single set is going to look similar, with some variation depending on wether or not it's plate, mail, etc.

Depends on the class you want to play. Considering you are asking this question the answer is probably no. You will take a good lead over people though.
---
Those comments were so stupidly wrong and inaccurate that /u/consulIncitatus didn't deserve any more time.
---
The notion that a Druid can't heal 5 mans is absurd, absolutely absurd.  Shit I didn't even put any points into resto until I was filling in for guild BWL runs as a pug
---
As for the second point, all you have to do is look at legacyplayers for raid heal logs to see it's absurd.
---
Yeah but that’s generally not the case. I think it’s generally agreed that WoW’s end game pve content is top notch, it’s just literally everything else in the game that pretty much sucks. 
---
I agree, there will definitely always be a vanilla version of Classic available to those who want it. 
---
But there is also a lot of questions surrounding the release of expansions, how can they do it without fucking one or both servers? The only solution I can think of is to basically label all servers at launch as "permanent vanilla" or "progressive content." But that probably isn't going to happen. 
---
So holy. Possible with enough points in Shadow to get Shadow Weaving.
---
Enhancement is more viable in PvE and offers a more unique PvP experience with Winfury buffs and all that jazz. As Elemental, you will be more or less unviable in PvE and will be a worse mage in PvP. Also, you will be Shaman, not "enhancemenet", so prepare to be required to heal often. Not saying people won't let you be enhancemenent, but I am saying they won't let you take a good axe or mace from the warrior because you wanted to be a warrior but played a shaman instead.
---
But HoTW isnt Feral. It's a hybrid build and it's excellent at both Tanking, DPS and Healing as long as you stick to 5man. For raiding you obviously want to go Balance or Deep resto when healing.
---
Don't worry, Paladins will be left well alone once Classic launches. 
---
Kill elves
---
Those comments were so stupidly wrong and inaccurate that [y](https://www.reddit.com/u/consulIncitatus)ou didn't deserve any more time.
---
The notion that a Druid can't heal 5 mans is absurd, absolutely  absurd.  Shit I didn't even put any points into resto until I was  filling in for guild BWL runs as a pug, and by that time I'd already  been healing enough ZG/MC pugs to get good enough gear to fill in for  BWL
---
Edit:  Druids at 1. and 5. out of 11 healers in BWL  [https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=31349&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=46153](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=31349&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=46153)
---
This is Garithos
---
Not having a ressurection spell kinda is a big deal when you are pugging though. He's not entirely wrong.
---
Where's the question? Yeah, they are versatile. Oomkins are very rarely brought to raids, ferals usually have 1 position in the raid for the buff AND are required to farm consumables (you will need a lot of pummelers to be somewhere in the damage meter) and they are the worst healers, with only their utility and cool buffs making them stay in raid groups. Not saying are bad, but they are versatile!
---
There really will be no way to stop this sadly. As long as there is not an influx of gold coming into Classic and being able to buy gold/time directly in Classic this shouldn't be seen as an issue. Having to go through a 3rd party, or risking getting scammed one way or another (Player 1 trading Player 2 classic gold, Player 2 happily scurrying off without trading Player 1 the retail gold that he promised). I don't think many people will be partaking in this activity, unless a reputable 3rd party becomes well known and trusted to facilitate the trades.
---
For the Bronzebeards
---
Also, that "weakness" comes at the trade off of raw power. Polymorph is a simple, straightforward skill that just works. However for locks, seducing + fear kiting + even banish sometimes is more situational but far more powerful, and with the added fun that seduce does not undo all the Dps work you've done on the mob. Then factor in that your dots can all be ticking away at the enemies while you're doing your CC thing. The skill cap for a lock is just crazy high.
---
Or a mage can just say screw all that noise and AoE down the mob, because mages are all about murder. Both are pretty damn fun.
---
They are. Druids are capable of achieving some of the highest HPS values in Vanilla through hots in encounters where there is heavy raidwide damag due to among other things, the healing over time component of Regrowth lasting a whopping 21 seconds.
---
The issue is generally that hots do not stack. So the value of each druid decreases the more you bring, which is why you generally wont see more than 2, maybe 3 Druids in a raiding roster.
---
I've owned that for almost twenty years. And it just now dawned on me that her waist is impossibly twisted to the side, and spinal cord probably snapped in twain.
---
Warrior is the perfect choice, really. If you will manage to stay on the road of leveling, you will love to get into groups and slowly but surely may become a leader of some dungeon groups. If you want to become social during leveling, you pretty much want to avoid classes with the least need for help, meaning Warlock and Hunter. Being a healer will sometimes get you into a group by itself and so classes like priest, who wand their level to 60 and heal themselves into not needing a buddy, are also unoptimal. I would say be a warrior, a rogue, a paladin or a druid. They cann all deal damage and warrior and rogue really appreciate help while paladin and druid have the healer factor.
---
Correct answer
---
Grey quests didn’t award any rep, greens very little, yellows normal amount.
---
Grinding city rep was painful and vanilla and required pre planning your quest routes.
---
And THAT is why you respect that little shit gnome on a Night Elf saber cat mount.
---
I am not sure if it was exactly 8 levels to be honest, but somewhere around this number. 
---
I found that vid btw: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28uB4ym6TCM
---
sounds like a casual ;P
---
I'm not disagreeing with that.  WoW has always had good dungeons and raids in my opinion.  I'm more arguing with the idea that because the raids today are good, the raids of yesterday were bad, or were less.
---
We are talking about raid healing though, not 5 mans. A lot of things are better in 5 man dungeons than they are in a 40 man raid environment.
---
INHUMAN BEAST
---
Enough servers so that half can end up dead ghost towns?
---
But then merge? Have you been part of a merge, or a server that had transfers to it? I haven’t talked to a single person who played in vanilla on a server that had transfers to it that liked it. Sure the people transferring to a server did but the ones on the server generally didn’t.
---
Think beyond yourself and you can see that sharding is the lesser of two evils in this regard. Would I prefer it not be there? Yes. When the options are sharding, or half the servers dead and requiring merges or transfers. I’ll take sharding every time.
---
I believe you can discuss them here as long as you do not mention the name of the server. Considering Vanilla private servers have been active much much longer than Vanilla ever was, they are very relevant for discussing the game as most of the current meta from vanilla has been figured out on those servers.
---
EPL/WPL along with Tirisfal and Silverpine were my favorites.. Just had that eerie feel to them, you just KNOW you're in bad territory. 
---
Depends on how fast you are. If you are really slow - like 2 months slow - you might as well take blacksmithing and mining. Otherwise I recommend going skinning and then either herb or mining if you feel like doing 2 professions. I don't think you will have enough bag space for skinning junk AND mining junk (it is not just leathers and ores, you know), so herb is a good choice for 2nd profession.
---
Don't get engineering and enchanting as those are expensive and moderately useless professions until much later. We are talking PvP Honor patch later and After Raid BiS later.
---
I only attack if I'm attacked first. When someone walks by me I'm thinking "do it do it do it do it!"
---
There are exceptions to this rule, like if I'm playing a hunter and a mage is walking down the road at me, I'm not going to casually let him drop a frost nova and initiate the fight by deadzoning me. I've learned not to trust those gnome fucks. 
---
I get more time for games now than I ever did in high school or college. Back then I had to worry about exams and homework.
---
Now its kids to bed by 8pm, and uninterrupted gaming from 8-12.
---
Always baffles me when people preface all of these classic wow comments with stuff like 'well now the playerbase has grown up and has no time for raiding anymore'
---
Reckoning is not at all that good during leveling. I recommend doing ret leveling, then going for weapon hit after 40 and then going for the 2 +10% talents in holy + consentracion. (prolly spelled that wrong).
---
Are you sure?  I thought rep was the same reward regardless as long as the quest was not grey-  IE green/yellow/orange/red all gave same rep
---
Bad Dads guild might have to be created for us filthy casual dads in Classic
---
If you do the 19 bracket, pick hunter. Even an undergeared hunter can kill a god tier rogue. 
---
Paladins are known to be the best healers. If you had that raid leader, then he was a bad one. Only exception would be Four Horsemen, where that mindset would be fine.
---
Same rep and exp regardless of color until grey. Color was just to show how difficult the quest would be to your level.
---
No we aren't, he said 5 man's are difficult for druids
---
This is nonsense
---
I played a raid-specced fire mage for most of Vanilla and open world PvP was not something my spec was any good at. Multiple classes were auto-losses (if played by a decent player) and almost every class was dangerous. 
---
So just as some specs shine in PvP, others wither in PvP. 
---
The fee went down every level of rep (honored, revered etc.) you had with the Argent Dawn I think. On top of that, I feel like enough people will have "how to make tons o' gold" guides available that Classic's economy is going to be a little inflated, and the like ~300 gold + arcane crystals won't be a huuuge deal.
---
I know on pservers they certainly weren't, but I get that those are a different story.
---
Glad he died
---
I guess if you plan on playing very casually, the doubt is at place. However, I doubt there will be any lower sub for the game. You need to realize that they haven't increased it since 2005. To put it into perspective, if you took a 100 bucks in 2005, that would be worth 128 bucks today. In other words, if the sub cost 15 bucks in 2005, it should cost 19 today.
---
Private server thing, really, so you can only hope, though I doubt it. Release is set to "Summer 2019" with community theories behind July 16th.
---
Wowhead only shows 1.11 as an addition because that’s when wowhead started. Nothing on there will give you an added patch before 1.11.
---
Okay. I am asking about Druid raid healing. And I'm OP here. That's pretty much the main question this thread is about.
---
I learned from the best!
---
&gt;Anyone that thinks Druids can't heal is obviously a bad player.
---
Of course they can heal. But not having the ability to ressurect is objectively worse than being able to, because it means every mistake which ends in a death will cost the group a massive amount of extra time.
---
Garithos did nothing wrong
---
damn thats a cool art style. nice.
---
That’s hilarious!
---

He was a symbol of the darker side of humanity, and his role in the story has more or less been dismissed as an anomaly within human society. Players always claim he had no official authority, and that he and his army apparently didn't represent the Alliance in a significant way. 
---
I really think that exploring that racism theme, which could very easily come up given the history of Azeroth, would have been interesting going forward. It's still there, but the Alliance has more or less been scrubbed of all evil and wrongdoing since Warcraft 3. Garithos is now a "renegade" in the eyes of many players and Alliance apologists, and Daelin Proudmoore was more or less disowned by the Alliance in the latest lore. Or at the very least, the Alliance was adamant on not retaliating for his death. 
---
It's discouraging, even as an Alliance die-hard. I would like my own faction to have some depth and deep flaws to it, so it feels real and not like a faction of do-gooders. Feels like playing as the Saturday-morning cartoon faction. 
---
I'm currently raiding BWL/AQ40 on a pserv as a druid with the moonglow spec and here are a few points:
---
\- Dungeons after I dinged 60 were fine with guildies, with random players you may struggle to find a group (because no rez) and to keep people alive when DPS get aggro/when you get hit and can't cast/generally when people are messing up. Overall quite frustrating as you can't really carry a group like a priest would with all his tools: massive aoe burst heal with inner focus + prayer of healing, fade, shields, etc.
---
\- Raiding: if you like efficiency moonglow spec can be enjoyable but you won't be topping meters by any means. I play Alliance so yeah HT rand 4 does get snipe a lot be the better you know the fights the better you can anticipate the damage and the less it becomes a problem. Rejuv has its use on fights when you have to move or with a lot of raid damage but you have to coordinate with other druids. I think the spec you mentioned is fine for healing in raids up to AQ40. Basically your role as a druid is to innervate priest, provide clutch NS heals when the tank gets hit hard and help out with rejuv when appropriate. The rest of the time you just spam HT.
---
\- Gear: due to not many druids in a raid Tier pieces are easy to get. It can take some time to get a nice weapon in the beginning. From BWL on, raids have nice feral pieces that usually nobody wants (except rogues sometimes) that you can snatch.
---
\- PVP: as Alliance I found playing against shamans really frustrating as they will purge any HoT that you try to put up. Also orcs seem to resist 100% of your stuns. Warsong gulch is a lot of fun as druid of course. If you're open to it I would recommend playing horde as the extra tauren stun is pretty nice and you will get dispelled less. Also there seems to be less tauren druids.
---
Sorry for the long message, hope it helps a little. Personally after playing priest in 2004 and druid on a pserv I think I'll back to priest when classic comes out. It's just way more fun (for healing).
---
Oh, I don't think that. I mean, Vanilla raids were pretty simple, but there was so much more going on outside of raids and, in the context of the vanilla world, the raids felt a lot more badass. Venturing into the depths of Blackrock Mountain and fighting the elemental lord of fire in a big lava room...bad ass af...nowadays everything in the entire world feels huge and awesome, so the raids don't really have that cool factor. I don't think vanilla raids were designed with the same thing in mind as modern raids were with the idea of pushing players to the limits of their ability to coordinate or whatever, so I don't scrutinize them based on that concept. 
---
what a trash post  
---
the reason they look similar is because they are themed around the raid they come from, which is more RPG than getting a holy pope suit from a fire rock boss  
---
A big part of that community was that it didn't have sharding. Also just because you don't care about loot sharing now, doesn't mean you aren't going to be super ticked off when you continually get screwed out of gear trying to get pre raid BIS.
---
Every change made to Classic so far either directly or will indirectly hurt the community. Sharding in the modern game is also done because the servers suck. It's not by choice. They HAVE to do it or the game will turn into a slide show. Blizzard has not confirmed whether that is the case for Classic or if the old game can magically do this better than the new game on the same hardware and client. 
---
I’m not talking PvP here, but alrighty let’s go this direction then.
---
&gt; I played a raid-specced fire mage for most of Vanilla and open world PvP was not something my spec was any good at.
---
If you were Fire more most of Vanilla... well, to be blunt, you were playing it wrong. Fire doesn’t work in MC. Or BWL for that matter. So unless the argument is that you did ZG a few times as fire and then got dumpstered in PvP... well that’s a gameplay issue. 
---
Being fire definitely cuts into your ability to AoE farm, but it doesn’t stop you from being the best DPS spec in the game (which is what it is), doesn’t stop you from having the best CC in the game (Polymorph is amazing), and it barely affects your ability to kite someone forever with rank 1 Frostbolt.
---
However, respecing would allow you to be the best AoE farming spec in the game, one of the best PvP specs in the game, the best kiting spec, on and on. There is not a single aspect of the game that mages do not excel in, with the exception of aspects that cannot physically preform.
---
Hunters are Tranq Bots. No matter their gear, consumables, skill, or extra effort put into the game, hunters will always be solely brought along to remove enrage from bosses. That should not cost them 40%+ of the DPS of other Pure classes. Rogues aren’t dumpster tier because they can do lockboxes and get you through the suppression room.
---
I don’t care about hybrids not being able to prefer multiple roles, that doesn’t matter and plays into the concept of the Hybrid Tax, but classes that can do nothing but deal damage being left in the dust due to design limitation and garbage scaling isn’t that can be chalked up to “shining in different aspects of the game”. As long as mages, rogues, warlocks, and for some fucking reason warriors stand as symbols of this hypocrisy, I won’t accept that argument.
---
Too much time to start worrying now.
---
WPL is nowhere near as good as EPL IMHO.
---
I like silverpine and TG though
---
* Silence is SOP for Blizzard
---
* The demo was likely a version from several months before the actual demo, not a snapshot of the current state of code just so they were confident the demo would go smoothly
---
* Since they're remaking an existing game there likely won't be a long beta, just more of a "stress test" right before launch, and even that will be less of an issue since Blizz is far better at operations now than they were
---
* Employees being laid off are from other departments, not development resources
---
* Blizz-Activiion cost cutting.....yeah that doesn't help
---
"2) Healing raids - it can be okay, but generally, in MC there will be enough hpals that you will rarely get a heal off"
---
Also bullshit, he doesn't know what he's talking about
---
Come to the druid discord and speak to people who know the class instead of snowflakes that clearly don't
---
&gt; Dwarves are the only right choice
---
ftfy
---
they just reconfirmed a summer release during an interview for a computer magazine here in germany 2 weeks ago?
---
Allahu Akbar!

---
I think at Exalted entry was free, or a pittance.
---
I felt so rewarded for having ground out Exalted by the time Naxx came out. Granted, the guild I was in killed maybe one boss (I still have the boot tokens from that - not the boots, just the token), but that almost makes it better - I didn't blow a bunch of cash to not get to see much.
---
Oh man, the 70s bracket was so active in cata. I really miss it. I had crux of the apocalypse on my rogue and maxed a ton of gemslot gear with wotlk agi gems and could literally oneshot people. I would hunt down glaive rogues for fun just to show my dominance. Thoridal hunters could be scary though
---
went on a private server and lvled the class i want to play at classic release to lvl 45ish to get a feel for it. (didnt play for 9 years as i quit retail in Wotlk)
---
also wanted to prepare some macros until i realized we will get the retail macro system in classic
---
Fuck it, hotw spec ftw. Cover all the bases
---
Starting off?  In between 100g and 300g... 100g for just flask/emergency pots, 300g if youre going to minmax/pot to start every fight. 
---
If you get yourself into a good guild (doesnt have to be super hardcore) you can work something out with the guild bank.  If you are an herbalist and you farm a crap ton of herbs to make everyone else pots, you get your enchants for free  and you get to repair out of the guild bank etc...
---
Just blew a lot of hours grinding Strat instead :P.
---
&gt;So holy
---
Possible. I did not look into it yet. I just never really played Holy in my wow history.
---
I'm at my PC no so I can give you more insight into my opinion. The majority of my wow experience comes from pservers. Wotlk and Tbc mainly. I chose those two expansions because they are my personal favorites of a good state of wow.   
---
Vanilla is far from perfect. I assume most people who love classic agree on this but it has a lot of elements that made the early iterations of wow so worthwhile. No sharding, class fantasy, "things" to do and grind, hard dungeons etc. which felt like an actual MMORPG.  
---
Some specs were the "goto" spec but all the "worse" specs have their niches and are relevant in one way or another. Priest had their unique racial ability which was for dwarf "fear ward". Such an important spell on Alliance that you just got picked because of that (regardless of Holy, Shadow or even disc\^\^). Furthermore not all specs had to be good in raids and were just purely used in PVP.   
---
I personally hope they release all the iterations for wow by time and just leave them as they are. If you cannot agree on an iteration just wait for the next one until one fits your needs.   
---
Wishing changes for Classic does not help anyone. It does not lead current wow back to the roots and it takes away the fun from people like me who honestly just enjoy state of Vanilla as it is with patch 1.12.1 even it's not my personal favorite.  
---
Your limited information is clearly visible.
---
You should knew already that the demo wasn't even by a little bit relevant to how much of Classic was already done back in November. The demo was a SEPARATE PROJECT and it was entirely designed for Blizzcon.
---
They already said that there might not be a beta testing, and if there will be, will be VERY SHORT. We can have a beta in May, for 2 weeks (it is more than enough), and Classic can still come in June.
---
What is a REAL update, in your view, one that is RELEVANT enough? We already KNOW almost EVERYTHING, except very few hot potatoes (loot trade clarification and patch progression).
---
They can update us in March, or April, on loot trading and patch updates, and there will STILL BE ENOUGH time for Classic to be live in June, or July, or even August.
---
As for cutting costs and shrinking budget...all of them are affecting CURRENT games.
---
I see ZERO reasons for Classic to be delayed.
---
In fact, I see it hastened, looking at the current state of Acti-Blizz.
---

I'm a troll hunter leveling in un goro crater. there is a quest to escort a goblin to the northern camp of un goro. Whilst doing said quest I am ambushed by a feral druid and dwarven hunter. They wreck my shit.
---
I go back to the spawn location of the goblin and wait to start the quest again. The whole time I'm thinking about what I could have done to survive that situation. 
---
He spawns and I make it halfway to the camp before I see a night elf druid and a dwarf hunter coming at me. 
---
As soon as the druid pops into cat form I cast scare beast on her and she's hard cc'd. I then turn to the hunter and pop all my cooldowns. This clown just sits there trying to cast aimed shot at me while I'm hitting him so fast that his castbar never gets past the 1 second mark before he dies. 
---
I hunters mark the druid as she shakes off my fear and then pick her off no problem.
---
I catch up to my npc and finish the escort mission. 
---
Turns out they both sucked at the game but used a numbers advantage and the element of suprise to win one over on me. 
---
Being able to out skill two opponents like that is a big reason for loving wows pvp. 
---
The post is about variety which OP is right. Today they are themed which is good nor bad... it's a different approach.
---
Most of the game is already done. People were able to get into other zones in the Demo client and apparently use camera mods or Nvidia Ansel or whatever to get a ton of footage. STV, , Tarren Mill/Southshore area, Undercity and Undead starting area, day night cycles are all on this guys channel and some of them with 4k /1440p quality. The "classic mode" is mainly shadows. The low setting = Vanillla as Tip's Out showed with a lot of this footage and they don't have to do this for every zone or anything.

As far as the raids the scripting is all there, the values are all there. UI is the biggest difference and I doubt they will waste time on a lot of the UI like raid frames. NO ONE uses those old raid frames anymore and spending weeks fixing something that any raider is going to replace with lunaframes is a complete waste of resources and time. The fixes will instead be on crafting, skills.
---
IF they wanted to make it as accurate as Nostalrius, they could punch in itemization in a few days as Nost already did all the legwork by using internet archives. I only say days because Blizzard could have a few guys verify the list/stats on the archives.
---
People like Gummy with mainly himself did all of TBC (and vanilla) in like 3 years, having to painfully recreate all the scripting. escort quests, dialogue. Things Blizzard doesn't have to touch and **Blizzard already did most of the hard work getting the old game to work on the modern infrastructure.**
---
The only complication Blizzard had (showed it at Blizzcon) is when they use the old client on the new software sometimes you get a error with a texture or UI or have things they simply need to turn off like LFG. So they had to fly around (which they have been doing for a long time) to check the working new client with the old working 1.12 which they have, check professions, check tooltips and icons. Not to say this isn't exhausting and a lot of work, but since they have the original to check against, it makes it a lot easier.
---
IMO the next 6 months or whatever should be being used to see how all the changes Ion has made changed tier 1 and 2 raiding compared with AQ/Naxx. It should be pretty apparent that Tier 1 and 2 are a complete joke with itemization 16 debuffs. These are not hard fixes. Rebalancing raids would be, which is a stupid thing to do in the first place and they already said they aren't touching classes.
---
If you can easily do raid 1 and 2 with half the raid? It's broken. Try it with correct itemization and 8 debuffs. Does it work now? Then go with it.
---
Just think that if this event happened today in retail somehow (yes I know modern mechanics won't allow organic PvP like this but bare with me) then imagine the sheer media shit show that would follow. All these articles and videos talking about video game violence and toxicity!
---
So. Many. Stratholme runs.
---
its irrelevant what post is about, he's complaining about RPG aspect in modern wow and then he will proceed to make a post about how Vanilla is great because of RPG aspects (he already did that).  
---
Its not relevant at all.
---
By now, a majority of Horde dont queue AV anymore, "because allies win" or the horde strategy takes too long.
---
Because, in the end, horde can win every single AV if they simply defend at Iceblood choke and backcap. But pugs are too stupid for it. Retail AV actually favors Horde for PvP zerg and alliance for PvE rush.
---
Papa Kaplan?
---
Well, I do not look previous post of a user up. IMO I like the sets that were designed for a class rather than a theme myself but I don't mind it really as long as I like them.
---
Yeah, I vividly remember seeing the portal to MC in BRD for the first time and not being able to enter because I wasn't in a raid...
---
Just to back this up, they are actively recruiting positions to support Classic. I watch their job posting site quite a bit, and recently there was a linux systems engineer for a "new project" 
---
When you can fly over top of a zone in mere seconds, it loses the impact of when you're grounded and have to walk or fight your way through.
---
Every zone loses the atomosphere when you gain flight, except maybe some of  BC.  There was so much hidden away on floating islands and entrances that needed flight it was cool.  It added to it.
---
Blizz never confirmed a July release. That is based off assumptions and speculation. Until you're told otherwise assume you won't be playing this game until September. 
---
Did you ever play on Gnomeregan or Blade's Edge? Your name reminds me of a guy who had many "whoopazz" toons on both those servers. 
---
Anyway, I'm down to join your group to reproduce the loot sharing issue if you need people. 
---
Oh man, the wolves in the Hinterlands have a disease with a similar effect :/
---
I can help you with the quest item swords if you remind me 
---
I mean flight paths arent what made it easy I just remember thinking it was so convenient to fly over stuff instead of around it on a horse. But Phoenix is cool give it a try. Much faster xp, HUGE pop, and you can /train anywhere which is actually super nice
---
I was saying I’d take the full 3/3 Elemental Precision before the full 3/3 Frostbite, as a lot of mobs you’ll be hitting for ideal questing routes will be +2 levels, and some more than 2 (it’s just unavoidable sometimes). And yes, AoE leveling before 40 will be impossible, but post 40 you have much more options and much less regret about using a respec because your already covered mount cost. So 40-46 you sacrifice some ST efficiency to have the OPTION to AoE when available and at 46 you can start farming Maraudon to 52, and DM: E from 52-60; both uncontested AoE farm.
---
Sorry if I wasn’t clear. I had a super easy time getting gear. We used DKP back in the day so I was always strapped for points, but because Druid specific gear wasn’t rolled on by Shaman, and in addition to set pieces, you usually had a really strong base to work off. Unfortunately that resulted in it being hard to get rings, trinkets, weapons, etc due to a DKP deficiency.
---
Most of the best feral gear is from raiding and no one wants it. I’ve used the example before but Malfurions blessed bulwark, taut Dragonhide shoulderpads, wristguards of stability etc will literally never have anyone rolling on them so you can usually horse trade with other Druid’s and get the stuff you want. 
---
I would rather see it released later than released full of bugs and half assed. (Altough I want it as fast as anyone else)
---
To quote Shigeru Miyamoto: 
---
"A delayed game is eventually good, a bad game is bad forever"
---
If they don't have a BETA they are simply hiding something. I would bet the farm that the server virtualization doesn't really work in large PVP events, just like on modern WoW servers if we have no BETA. 
---
It's the only real reason not to have one and to hide something. They know if some of these big streamers get in a beta it's the first thing they will do. 
---
If the servers are like modern WoW Classic is a broken product due to world bosses, 40 man raids always meeting when entering raids. They might as well cancel it to be honest. Outsource it to someone who will use the old client and beef up the warden to secure exploits.
---
I was fortunate enough to have been picked up into a raiding guild mid burning crusade. I did Kara and Gruul’s and parts of SSC and TK with them for a bit before the guild disbanded. But by then I had enough gear and experience that I was able to join an established guild that had just gotten attuned for BT. And I was able to join them. My first thought sitting in those dank sewers was “Wow... I’m in Black Temple!”
---
I’m still subbed to modern WoW but that’s an experience I fear I’ll never have again.
---
I think you guys saying this stuff doesn't realize how easy it is for an actual professional development team to fix the gameplay related stuff (which is mostly all that remains). They even said that the hardest part to bring classic WoW alive was to get a working and stable version of vanilla WoW to successfully integrate with their new system, which was done just before Blizzcon.
---
The next steps were to fix lightning bugs, energy restoration, spell balancing, damage balancing, etc etc.. which is easy but takes some time which he explained/showed during the classic panel. So summer 2019 was probably even a conservative guess by them.
---
Not to mention that employees getting laid off has not affected the classic dev team at all.
---
so you like less RPG elements in that area then  
---
Whoops, my comment was meant to be a reply to someone's comment in my comment chain. Guess it got turned into a normal comment somehow. 
---
But thanks for the input! That's good to know. 
---
That's not for classic.  
---
Classic runs on modern wow so they don't need anything like that.  
---
Wait, there are quests in this game ??
---
I would say if you casually play 1 hour/day u wont be exaulted in WSG or AB before TBC hits 😎😂
---
You don't think they have engineers maintaining the infrastructure the game runs on? They run a pretty lean operation sure, but thinking they have no systems/infrastructure engineers for classic is just....lol
---
If you've got the WoW diary, it's a great read. 
---
I always felt BC was the apex of wow, still had the real hard to accsess content but smoothed out the major issues.
---
Having played FireFall during its beta which seems to have done sharding a lot better than retail WoW, I think that if sharding is in on launch or not is really not as important as how it is implemented.
---
For example, in FireFall you have a home shard, that is like a mini-server, and there was a strong sense of community within your shard. Not sure if chat was cross-shard but you saw the same names in chat and the same people around when you played. I was one of three people who shared the first four letters of our name, and I definitely saw the other two all the time.
---
Even something as simple as using your character's unique ID to make sure that everyone in the same starting zone shard will always stay in that same shard even if they leave and come back, would probably do wonders for covering up the fact that sharding is in the game.
---
As you get to the higher level zones you could then feed everyone from multiple shards into the same new shard. That way no one is disappearing from your sight when you enter a new zone, there are only new people appearing.
---
Is it perfect? No, but I think that how Bliz does sharding will be far more important than if they do sharding or not.
---
Xrealm is cancer. Play retail. 
---
I think those raid sets from Dazal Alor actually look amazing.  
---
More skill metrics, sure, I'd go for that.
---
Now that same tactic is used by every mobile game
---
Dunno :) Anything that makes sense.
---
Tich until WOTLK. Old account was sold because I thought I was never going to play again and I was a poor college student. TBC burned me out. Respec costs for arena, nonstop raiding progression. TBC was like a job. If all you care about is PVE and have one spec, then TBC is good. If you cared more about the world, pvp, community, it was awful. 
---
Arthas trailer got me back after a few months. I just wanted to see the end to his story. After WOTLK all I did was Arena and carries. Still how I pay my WoW sub. I have money now, but carries are easy and I have a sub until like 2020, Blizzard money cap (350) and max (10) tokens in my bag. Haven't logged in for months. Have hated rogue design since WOD. I did like Cata/Mop sub and it was as fun as Vanilla imo. I think the expansions were bad though. Mop had solid arena though.
---
Man warlocks are just shitty in pve, shitty in pvp, blizzard should just delete them from classic, they are useless.
---
This has always been the dumbest fucking argument. Anyone who believes this is not worth addressing as a person. 
---
??? You want changes to vanilla?? That's exactly what's wrong with this sub. #nochanges ffs
---
Things I bring up here:
---
* What is the best build for X class (that I'm currently leveling)
---
* Stories from the Private server that have me looking forward to Classic
---
Things I don't bring up here:
---
* Join me in this private server
---
* Player X on this private server is a loot ninja
---
* Private Servers are better than classic will be
---
The community should be open to change. Vanilla WoW was not a perfect game. Classic WoW is also not Vanilla WoW, it is a different client, and a different server. There *will* be differences and changes, even if they aren't intentional. The question is more of how far people are willing to go.
---
You know what won't kill classic? If the UI was more responsive and Blizz didn't waste the time stripping out the handy QoL features added to the AH UI. I really, *really* don't want to type out the price over and over again if I don't have to.
---
Vanilla WoW is dead. It is gone. It isn't coming back. What we have in Classic will be very similar, but it won't be the same. The community can either be elitist puritans about it, or take the time to try and figure out where the line in the sand needs to be.
---
Honestly, I've seen more groups looking for a mage than a healer.
---
Doesn't matter anyway, if you're not a tank you'll be waiting.
---
Basically the main reason why I have 2/3 EP on my build up until level 39 is because all the talents that you're gonna pick pre-39 are absolutely mandatory, and right before 40 where you get Ice Barrier there is that one little point that needs to be spent somewhere and all the mandatory talents are already taken BUT the last 3rd EP rank so that's the perfect oportunity to finally get this last rank.   
---
The reason why I chose 2/3 EP and then get the 3rd rank later on is because if we are assuming all the mobs you're gonna encounter are at least +2 levels above you (Just for the sake of efficiency) the first 2 ranks are gonna give you +2% hit each, but the third rank is only gonna give you +1% hit as you'll go "over" the hit cap by one percent.      
---
So TL:DR instead of having 1% chance to miss at all times against targets +2 you'll be having 2% miss chance, and between the levels 14 to ~33 it's better to have 3/5 Imp Frostbolt than 2/5, so basically you're sacrificing 1% hit chance for faster Frostbolt casts which turns into slightly faster kill time especially if you have enough time to squeeze a wand shot right before using Frost Nova when a mob reaches you, which could be tough with -0.1s cast time.    
---
(Also helps you in PvP and other scenarios that I'm can't think about)   
---
Now I'd like to point out three things about AoE leveling:     
---
1) When you reach 40 when Classic launches and you know for SURE that you're ahead of everybody, you can consider to respec to an AoE build but be very careful, one player being at your farming spots can screw you over, so be careful.       
---
2) You can farm Maraudon from 46 to 53 but you'll have to find a group to clear Maraudon for the Scepter so don't count on it, if you're ahead of the pack you won't be farming this place as the Scepter is mandatory.     
---
3) I'm not sure why people doesn't know this but the scripting of the garden section of the DME is absolutely horrible, I have made a video about 2 months ago explaining everything:       
---
https://youtu.be/XZBfm8C29Ss
---
This video proves that the DME scripting of the server I'm playing on is correct:
---
https://youtu.be/M3zA1qH02VA   
---
Long Story short:
---
- There are Death Lash along the walls, so you can't hug the walls to avoid patrols, you're gonna have to sneak your way through.
---
- Because of the elite patrols aggro range you can only start farming this place at level 53, not 52 (up to 60).
---
- The upper part is actually Blizzlike, there are 2 packs of 7 Whip Lasher up, however the lower part is not, there is supposed to be 8 packs of 10 lashers down in the "garden" area, so that's 94 mobs total.
---
What's the point of that kind of threat? Just shut down the hype before being sure of anything?
---
No one will concretely contribute to what you are asking. If you want Classic to succeed, we need players. Therefore, stop making them go away for nothing.
---
A valid question.  I don't know why everyone is saying "don't worry about it".
---
There seems to be an unspoken agreement between the mods and the rest of us. As long as you don't implicitly give a name to a specific server and only talk about them vaguely then you should be ok.
---
They won't. I am ready to see endless "buff ret damage" threads once classic launches.
---
They won't code in bugs that aren't in 7.3 or whatever the client is. 
---
Of course it could be delayed, Blizzard is infamous for taking forever to release their products. That being said, none of the stuff you listed supports that assumption. Updating us has no relevance on the product, a Beta is not super relevant or telling as Classic is a proven game already plus it's way too early for one anyway. Employees being laid off have no relevance to projects or timelines they've committed to and Activision cost-cutting is something all companies do regularly, it's normal. It's not the first time Activision has done it, it's just the first time it's been so public so people that are unfamiliar with business practices are worrying over it.

Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
Therefore, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

Gonna try to find your write up, but if I don't, link?

Linky link?

This should be stickied

Hm. I remember seeing screenshots posted on the forums when we were discussing lighting and the plaguelands in particular (around the alliance camp) had a glow to it, like there was light cast over everything. And in the original it's obviously very foggy and dark. 
---
Comment made my night 😂
---
Ditto. I remember first making it to an actual Sunwell guild after my third BT/Hyjal guild failed. Magical moment. 
---
It’s basically r/politics but in WoW.
---
The paladins themselves will still be here, but as far as raiding and endgame does, ain't nobody giving a second thought to a non-holy paladin. 
---
+1 I will make it right out of Northshire 😂😂
---
&gt; You won't ever convince belf fans that  elves are flawed in some way. It's always someone else's fault that  something bad has happened, they're a meme at this point. The blood  elves are the descendants of the elf caste that were thrown out of  Kalimdor for trying to mess with the well of eternity even after a  demonic invasion caused by abuse of well's magic almost destroyed the  world. Then during the troll wars it was the humans that stopped them  from getting destroyed.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Then during the  Second War they arrogantly told the Alliance to essentially fuck off  despite a sworn promise to help them and instead gave them a small token  force. They didn't commit their forces, didn't prepare for invasion and  when Quel'thalas was invaded - human forces marched there to put a halt  to what was going on - they drove out the majority of the Horde and  stopped the forest/homeland from being completely burnt to the ground.  Guess who they blamed? Everyone else.  
---
&gt;This  is what led to people like Garithos losing his entire family and land,  Alliance soldiers were called away to defend the land of the people that  couldn't be bothered to commit themselves in the first place. After the  war the elves immediately pulled out from the Alliance and happily sat  behind their enchanted gates while Lordaeron and the rest of the  northern EK were being scourged. When ever any of this is properly  brought up, the Garithos card is thrown around in a desperate attempt to  scramble the points being made.
---
Quote to explain Garithos' reasoning. Generally speaking he's just a convenient excuse to lead Kael'thas in the direction he went, a plot device. I think he could have been a far more interesting character and in the old lore/MMORPG (which is completely different in every sense of the word, tone, storytelling, artstyle etc) he could been an interesting character.
---
Yeah, I never liked that. I wanted to look like an epic paladin/mage, not a raid mob.
---
Yeah ofc xD I don't really care about RPG at all. Especially gear. If I like it, I like it.
---
Hunter
---
Remove the second digit and I'll call this accurate 🤣
---
Exactly. This is the same reason the Honor System should stay regardless of it’s flaws; the r14 items being unobtainable for 99% of players creates a certain allure that is such an integral part of the game’s unique feeling of “epicness.”
---
We already know Blizzard already have *some* sort of these metrics already from Overwatch, for example. They have a system that determines how good certain plays are and produces Play of the Game and automatic highlights, based on how much damage was done, whether you saved your teammate, the timing of the play and whether it swung the tide of battle, etc. It would be a huge undertaking to implement in WoW, and more suited for something like WoW2 than a Classic remake, but we're on the topic of theoretical improvements to the Honor system. I just think Blizzard doesn't really care for it, or else they would've implemented it in retail WoW by now. They clearly have the personnel that can do it.
---
No Taurens or Trolls, No Gnomes or Dwarves.  
---
Sizeist!
---
Good lord sick of seeing this "omg if you made hybrid dps the same then pure dps would be awful." No shit, nobody is suggesting you make hybrid dps the same. They certainly didn't make hybrid dps the same in TBC. 
---
The vanilla hybrid problem is twofold:
---
1) Hybrids so much less damage than pure classes their utility doesn't make up for it.
---
2) Hybrid dps specs don't bring any unique utility to the table that their healing counterparts do.
---
TBC fixed both of those while in fact making classes and specs play even more unique from each other than they were in vanilla.
---
This is the generation that brought us participation trophies
---
I would rather have server merges than sharding. They still merged servers in vanilla, so its gonna happen either way. Also, with sharding you lose community and merges you lose community, so either way its a lose/lose. But I would not be able to stand running along with someone into a different zone and have them shard away once we enter that new zone. I would hate to be stalking the other faction just for them to be sharded away. If merges are required later to avoid this from happening, Im all in.
---
I understand your position. I guess if you have a small carbon footprint it's ok, if we are to consider the environment. I think it would be fine with smaller cities with a rural feel as well.
---
WotLK had the blandest gear *because* Vanilla + TBC players whined and complained and made endless posts and memes about *clown suits.*
---
To be fair, I’ve only played ps versions of vanilla (didn’t play in actual vanilla wow). I don’t have time to watch the video at the moment but I quickly looked at it and you’re coming in from a different entrance than I do. It’s also hard to know for sure how classic will script DM: E so I can’t really comment on whether or not the farm will be possible (I haven’t encountered any other DM: E scripting other than the one that’s used on the current...very popular private server (trying not to say server names lol).
---
It’s also worth noting that there’s no way in hell I’ll be able to no life to the same extent some people are. I’d say for most people starting with Mage, there will definitely be many people at the ideal level to run the first wing of Maraudon by the time you hit 46, especially considering that Mage is slower than at least 3 other classes and you don’t need a 100% dedicated tank prot Warrior to tank that. Another point about AoE leveling is if you’re not no lifing 100% you will have more rested experience, making it better.
---
I’ll look into the videos you posted more when I’m off, thanks for the links and the feedback!
---
Then people will just cap out on honor and have to compete for that much longer.
---
I think it would be a great addition to the system. Perhaps something as simple as ELO and removing honor.
---
&gt;In this context "necessary" obviously means something like "necessary to perform the critical functions like tranq shot or tanking without getting crushed that are such an important part of progression raiding everyone takes them for granted". Not "so necessary the raid will 100% wipe on the spot without it no matter what the other details of the scenario".
---
So tanking without getting crushed is "so important to progression everyone takes it for granted". But having raid heals from multiple priests is not? Having multiple paladins for blessings is not?
---
Thanks. You sound reasonable.
---
The horde have claimed STVietnam, and it is rightfully ours. We’ve lost many good men in the jungle, and the enemy will be shown no mercy. I may have a code of honor in the other 95% of Azeroth, but here it’s war. Most don’t like to talk about the things we’ve done there. The men, the women, and the children. It haunts me every day, but deep down inside I know the all must go. There’s plenty of other zones for the alliance to level in and raise their young, but not in STVietnam; Not on my watch.
---
Enjoy bfa kiddo. 
---
There's so much they can do. Rewarding World PvP more than BG spam. Rewarding a rested xp type system but for honor. When the "top PvPers" are spending every waking moment spamming BGs and never out in the world you should know something's wrong. When everyone rides past each other in AV to go do some PvE because it's faster honor/minute to rush to the boss instead of doing actual PvP you know something's wrong. When the top rankers don't do WSG or AV unless it's their appropriate weekend but just 5 cap AB all week long you know something's wrong.
---
Crossrealm BGs were a major selling point of the Drums of War patch, a.k.a. 1.12
---
How dare you tarnish its legacy with your modern WoW discrimination. You're the one being cancerous here.
---
its "new project"  
---
they don't need linux engineer for classic because they most likely already have one for wow  
---
and when they say "new project" its unannounced stuff  
---
&gt; How many 'minor changes' does it take before you end up with something so different that it would be considered to be completely unoriginal.
---
I feel like people are confusing changes with bug fixes.
---
Remove wall-jumping is not a change. It's a bug fix.
---
Loot trading existed in Classic. Because of the way GMs work today, copying the old method of loot trading would require doing what Nost did: Remove Loot trading altogether. This would be a change.
---
So in order to preserve Loot trading a compromise is made: Automated Loot trading.
---
Sharding at launch can be arguably not a change because it's being implemented to preserve (not destroy) the original population cap dynamic.
---
So be careful with what you call change or no change. Progressive itemization did not exist in 1.12, yet so many people are asking for it so that they can play some semblance of what WoW actually was like and not just the three months before TBC pre-patch.
---
Amen to that brother.
---
They never told us what we were getting into when we stepped foot in that jungle. 
---
You can leave STVietnam but STV never leaves you.
---
How is either option more or less RPG than the other? Themed to class or themed to dungeon seems pretty equal to me. The only thing I can think of that would be 'more RPG' is if you could only loot gear the Boss itself was wearing, which obviously only works in limited circumstances.
---
Sharding in starter zones would means you won’t see the other faction sharding. Unless you’re in their starter zone, or they’re in yours.
---
Sharding hurts the community far less than merges. You can still communicate and chat with anyone on your server. You just may not see them  unless grouped.
---
Ultimately sharding is a minor inconvenience unless it happens in contested zones then it’s bad, like really bad.
---
&gt;your kind
---
Care to elaborate on that?
---
Also, I'd have preferred if WoW used the token system since the beginning. Obtain magic essence from boss, use it to forge a raid piece. Non-raid tier pieces can look like it was taken from an enemy mob.
---
Simple fix, caters to both types of armor aesthetics and adds an RPG element.
---
How is it RPG to you to get a druidic tree-leaves set from bosses in pits of hell?  
---
That makes no sense.   
---
What makes sense is getting pits of hell set themed around druid.  
---
&gt;The only thing I can think of that would be 'more RPG' is if you could only loot gear the Boss itself was wearing, which obviously only works in limited circumstances.  
---
No, that would be "even MORE RPG".  
---
Monster Hunter is perfect combination of those two. Since sets are themed around monsters you kill but they can't wear armor, so you make armor out of them.  
---
Tirisfal Glades/Silverpine Forest = Darkshore
---
After that no it's just the Barrens, beautiful, flat, sexy orange Barrens.  Autowalk for days.
---
Ashenvale is a contested territory.
---
But you can literally never have to step foot in the Barrens for a quest if you don't want to.  
---
No more git gud, just get loot

 **&lt;Always East&gt;   |   Semi-Hardcore   |   PvE/PvP   |   Server Region: NA, but all are welcome!   |   Faction: Alliance** 
---
  **"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"**  Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us. 
---
**ABOUT US:**     
---
\- We are players spanning throughout multiple expansions of Retail WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content.     
---
\- We look forward to reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts.     
---
\- Everyone earns their spot with us, regardless if you are a Raider, PvPer or Social.     
---
\- Above all else, we strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"**(edited)  
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**     
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever!  At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.       
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.  
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up.  Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but again - as stated above - we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic.     
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people!  We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!(edited)  
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics.  Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!      
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!(edited)  
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**     
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week, with a floating third when/if needed; **Wednesday and Thursday** (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - **NOT** when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than **8:15PM EST**.  
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around **10:00PM EST** for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than **11:45PM EST**.       
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be **READY** to raid when the time comes.(edited)  
---
**Reach out if you have questions!**  We can be reached at  Parker#1571 or Tharkun#4460 on discord.  Or drop me a DM via Reddit.
---
&gt;Care to elaborate on that?  
---
circlejerk posters  
---
just peek at his submitted history, its full on "Old good new bad"  
---
T2 is the best gear for any class hands down. I adore all of them. 
---
Define starting zone. Level 1-10? 1-19? Redridge is a contested zone and it starts at lvl 15. With sharding, the group you level up in the first week may not be there next week. Merging, basically does the same thing, a completely different group of people you are forced to start playing with.
---
Since you mention Ashenvale, I assume contested zones are in the mix. Hillsbrad Foothills come to mind, and after that Feralas.
---
Starting zones, I'd say Mulgore is the most beautiful zones to level in.
---
faction specific questing (zone appearance wise) is completely finished after level 30 so i don't know why anyone would complain about that.  30 isn't even half of the leveling experience 
---
Die mongrel
---
Beautiful. 
---
The cheapest too isn't it? Its hard to remember since they swapped the riding skill and mount costs.
---
a ground portal teleported you to a ledge under the necropolis. the ledge had 4 portals to enter into the dungeon, one for each wing, with a raised portion above the middle which took you to sapphiron + kel thuzad.
---
you might be able to still see the ledge in the naxxramas in wotlk, the outside structures were the same.
---
I haven't been into WoW for some time and I just started looking into some WoW Classic threads, but as a former druid who healed every dungeon in OG vanilla all the way through Naxx, I don't know what the hell that guy is going on about.  Trouble with 5 mans?  Wtf.
---
This is the greatest moment in WoW history. I remember watching this over and over and sending it to everyone I knew that played.
---
I've told this story a 1000 times but.
---
Back in vanilla I was playing on my level 60, but very noob priest, questing out in EPL. 
---
I had a regular mount and was going somewhere when I noticed an Alliance coming towards me on an epic mount. 
---
Oh shit! I thought. This is a PVP server and I was probably about to get ganked. 
---
He rode right past me without a glance. Then I noticed a few more Alliance right behind him. A LOT more Allaince! 
---
I just stopped and watched them.
---
All of them were on epic mounts, some I didn't even recognize (later learning that they were from ZG etc) and they looked geared to the TEETH. 
---
They all rode right by me, some emoting as they passed. I remember being awed by the gear and mounts and only later figuring out that they were a guild raid heading to Naxx. I didn't even know that place existed! Once I did I knew that I was never going to see that raid, and it was totally ok with me! 
---
It was epic and mysterious and really made the Vanilla Azeroth seem truly great  and inspired me to try and play my character more so that I could see as much of that world as possible.  
---
Modern retail wow completely lacks this now and it's very sad. 
---
I chalk this up to catering towards casuals, who probably make up the bulk of WoW subscribers at this point, so in a way we cant really blame Blizzard, they're doing what they're playerbase wants. 
---
Hopefully with the launch of Classic Blizzard will see that there still is a dedicated playerbase who wants to explore a big and mysterious world that doesn't care if you see every piece of content available. It's simply up to the player how much they want it and how much time anf effort they devote to see it.
---
Classic has no problems at all. You are the problem.
---
That would be a great help, I'll be playing Horde so I know that Sword of Omen and Thrash Blade are up there....but, it's not JUST swords that I'm thinking about here, literally all gear is subject to this logic where it's not exactly easy to find quest gear on top of, say, the minimum level requirement for that quest. 
---
The closest I've been able to do is search Classic DB for the slot that I wan't (let's use leather chest armor as an example). I'll filter for Leather Chest armor of green/blue/purple quality and then organize by Req (min level requirement) and the blank ones are typically quest Rewards. Now, the item level helps me get a general idea of what level range the quest is available, but I'd have to click on each and every one to see the quest and things of that nature. 
---
Kind of a pain but, I'm not sure if there's a way to narrow it down and get what I"m looking for....although thinking about it now this could be a cool project for myself. 
---
There's a game full of xrealm for people who want it. 
---
&gt; personally i would love a dual spec option
---
Sure, it's a quest, the item starts the quest drops off KT.  Only one per kill.
---
PVP:  Reached Field Marshall (Rank 11) as feral/resto hybrid.
---
PVE:  I raided MC thru Naxx (resto).  Bear (off) tanked through AQ or so (this was very much before feral was considered remotely viable, so it was cool to be able to be able to pull it off).
---
In vanilla gray quests gave. NO reputation.  
---
My concern with Naxx is that the gear is far too powerful at 60. Tier 3 at 70 was still good and those with T3 were able to clear TBC raids with relative ease. Eventually the PVP will be very broken. I don't mind broken - hell, thats half the reason Vanilla is so fun. You can use low level items at max level and be very successful. But a rogue in full T3 is very faceroll.
---
As a mage and late night player I can't count the times I had to fly out to let guildmates in the damn instance because I could port back.
---
what are the basics of felhunter micro? I see most vanilla locks keep them on passive for PvP which I would understand vs a Warrior.
---
I'm trying to improve and am not 100% sure what im looking for when I'm watching these videos.
---
Why are you so intent on changing 1.12? Is it because you don't like retail that much?
---
You're letting your hatred of retail cause you to ask for small changes in Classic.
---
It's pretty cancerous.
---
Stranglethorn Vale, the MOST peaceful of any zone out there. Will make you feel like youre running through Elwynn without a care in the world. 0% chance of getting killed by the opposite faction too, because what kind of mad man would do pvp in Stranglethorn? /s
---
T2 is better.
---
Restodruid here, i play resto since vanilla and raided AQ&amp;Naxx back then.
---
To be honest, a druid will only be accepted as healer in most of all guilds. One reason for this is that feral isn't too good, but could be played as DD. Owlkin is just bad. BUT your cat dps needs debuffs on the enemy boss and every boss has a maximum of 16 debuffs. Your DoTs would even kill the damage of other classes. This is one reason why mortal strike for warriors had been forbidden in many guilds.
---
If you heal, there is one capable build with 24/0/27 that is really good. The talents in the balance tree can be variated. Everything else, going full heal for example is worse. Your hots can not be stacked with  other druids and the highest hot of a spell will override the others.
---
In raids, you will mostly heal with healing touch. You will use different ranks of the spell, that can vary from rank 2 to 11. Which rank you take depends on your playstyle and your equipment. You can use the addon TheoryCraft to show calculations of your spells on HPS, Heal per Mana etc.
---
Your healing touch has different casttimes per rank. If a spell is casted faster at low ranks the bonusheal of your equipment downscales. Rank1 has a casttime of 1s, rank2 1.5s, rank3 2s, rank4 2.5s, and afaik rank5-11 take 3s. Rank 11 can be gained via a spellbook dropped in AQ20.
---
If you have just reached lvl 60, you will use spells like rank 3,4,7,10. Due to the downscaling you will not be able to use rank 2, as it heals not enough. Once you got some raid equipment, you can switch your spells around. Rank 2 can be used with T2 equipment. It works like a flashheal, but with a fairly low amount of heal. When someone is damaged slightly, you will just flash him, faster than other healers could. If you have to use big heals, like rank 7 to heal for several thounds of HP, it could happen, that a priest was faster than you - as result, you would either lose mana, or you can stop your cast. Stopping your cast is what you have to do all the time. If you want to heal tanks in raids, you will NEVER just start the heal and let it go! You will always watch the HP bar of your tank and if he is on full life when your heal is finished, you must stop the cast before you waste your mana.
---
When you have really good equipment, you can flashheal everyone extremely fast, faster than the other classes and you still have better mana management!
---
You will need a lot of experience to master your druid, but the druid is capable of outhealing the other classes if you play smart. Many people say, that the restodruid has to give his innervate to priest. This was only true for me in the very beginning when i started raiding as druid. Once i knew how to play, the raidlead wanted me to use innervate for myself and i also got those of our owlkin (yes we had one, lol) aswell, just because my healing output was so huge.
---
IMO restodruid is the most fun healer in classic, but also has the highest skillgap! For 5man dungeons you always had the risk that someone dies and you cannot ressurect him.
---
Remember though, T3 will take an insane amount of time for people to grab. Loot is much harder to come by in classic even if you can kill the content. Drops are low and raids being so big means lots of competition. Even then, a minuscule part of the population will be geared, dedicated, and prepared enough to take on Naxx at all - let alone have it on farm. Only staunch private server hardcore players will probably farm it out with any degree of efficiency. I would bet that a tiny fraction of the player base will be full Naxx geared in PvP and several months, if not longer, after Naxx launch. At that point of classics life cycle I’m pretty okay with it. That’s the super ultra end game, and I think having some crazy items that are still stupidly hard to get your hands on is only an enhancer for the game. 
---
Good to know there’s a few bettersafethansorry peoplenout there, and next time I’ll try to be that dilligent. It should be a community effort to strike down hard on ninja looters of all kinds
---
yeah and the snowflake blocked me, lol
---
Rogue in t3 vs full geared warrior... cheap shot hemo hemo cb evisc dead
---
Summer could still mean September technically right?
---
I understand what you're saying, I've just never met someone who considered sense-making a scalable element of RPG's. I personally file that under immersion, which every genre grapples with. 
---
For the sake of the discussion, I, (personally) find both dungeon themed and class themed to make the same amount, (little), of sense. It's not like I actually collected Ghuuns teeth &amp; bones and made that gear, in fact it's amazing how talented a fashion designer my character is off-screen, he's able to make some lit outfits from dungeon scraps. 
---
That kind of hand-waving was the same for class themed gear to me; instead of head-canoning that my character was just able to channel Coco Chanel in between raids, I just believed that after killing Big Bad #4 my character was rewarded with Class Artifact #6 from the higher ups of my class, (or whatever organization we were assisting atm), between raids. 
---
Again, I don't think you're wrong or I'm right, just interesting discussion.
---
Its the same price as regular faction mounts if you are exalted with the city in question. 720 G if exalted with AV for mount, same price if exalted with Darnassus for a Tiger.
---
&gt; Grey quests didn’t award any rep, greens very little, yellows normal amount.
---
nope.
---
100% rep granted green to red.
---
- 1 level overleveled into gray: 80% rep
---
- 2 levels overleveled into gray: 60% rep
---
- 3 levels overleveled into gray: 40% rep
---
- 4+ levels overleveled into gray: 20% rep
---
Why do monsters have gear that fits people on their person anyway? I just assumed the Smaug effect... They hoard gear they acquire from people they kill.
---
Those new sets look amazing, but the issue with it is that they're homogenized between armor classes... Cloth, Leather, Mail, Plate.
---
We're not even getting drip fed any news. :(
---
Cool story!
---
The problem is that there's 1 set for each armor class. A druid is wearing the same shit as a rogue &amp; demon hunter.
---
Well, most people who played in Vanilla weren't there on day 1 launch. The population grew after the fact. 
---
This time around it'll likely be the opposite. A huge influx of players at launch then the population will decrease over the following months before leveling out.
---
Something to keep in mind.
---
They can't shard the AQ event though, that would just ruin the experience.
---
would be even worse if they had to design raid themed for every class, they are already similar enough  
---
there are more variety sets from other sources tho  
---
&gt; In Vanilla, there was no starting zone crowd - only a small portion of players started playing at day one. 
---
I laughed so hard at this. The first day of launch is actually one of the moments i remember the best.   
---
I made an NElf Hunter and one of the first quests was to kill some sabers. There were literally 20 or more people waiting on every spawning position. Ping was &gt;9000 with disconnects. Thats why Blizzard gave away dozens of one day subscriptions for free.
---
Exactly. I try to stop ninjas before they can effect others. It only looks bad on you if you call them out with no proof. I want to believe people but I can’t unless they can prove it.
---
My Main until 85 had 100k kills and battlemaster, but only i think 3000/21000 Warsong, arathi even less and those were my favourite bgs so go figure 
---
If you are brought to the raid for innervates you just heal bad. Restodruids have the capability to outheal the other healers. Back in classic the officers wanted me to hold the innervate for myself and i even got those of other druids, just because you can heal so much and efficient as druid.

The reason people want Vanlla is because they don't like the changes that occured after Vanilla ended. Changes to make classes more balanced is what eventually lead to homogenization of the classes and a complete loss of individuality and character identity. How can we guarantee that making the same changes a second time would not have the same result?
---
&gt;I understand what you're saying, I've just never met someone who considered sense-making a scalable element of RPG's  
---
But almost every RPG thing is based around that.  
---
Hunters need arrows. They need quivers for arrows.   
---
Hunters use pets. Pets need to eat to survive and be happy.  
---
In order to learn new unique spell, you need to undergo proper training for it (class quests) etc.  
---
&gt;I just believed that after killing Big Bad #4 my character was rewarded with Class Artifact #6 from the higher ups of my class, (or whatever organization we were assisting atm), between raids.  
---
That would be the case (literally) with tokens. Not so much when bosses themselves drop stuff upon death.  
---
Lol, I'm not sure how long ago this happened, but I have you tagged as "WoW moron that doesn't understand DKs/honor system."  Good to see you're being consistent.
---
Who hurt you?
---
At a certain point in the leveling process most of the zones become contested and intended for both factions to use. Even the Barrens is aesthetically similar to Westfall in my opinion, but if your goal is to skip the Barrens entirely then you could follow the path below, but it would probably require some grinding, since the Barrens is absolutely loaded with great Horde quests:  
---
Tirisfal Glades (1-10) similar to Elwynn  
---
Silverpine Forest (10-20) similar to Elwynn  
---
Stonetalon Mountains (15-25) similar to Redridge
---
Ashenvale (18-30) Both factions
---
Hillsbrad Foothills (20-30) Both factions
---
I'm glad you enjoy bfa, I personally think it's a piece of shit, it doesn't give you the right to advocate for changes to vanilla.
---
People have been playing Vanilla over and over again on private servers for years. Class  balance is not a problem that prevents people from enjoying the game. I don't want to risk ruining the game just so someone can raid in Boomkin spec.
---
I think part of the issue is people excited about Classic are more than just those who want Vanilla again. Classic is the only proper WoW that will exist. But many of us our just as nostalgic about TBC.
---
A version of WoW that took the best from TBC and Vanilla, but kept everything in Azeroth would be my dream situation.
---
This is simply not true, but always stated on this subreddit. If you force a restodruid to give his innervate to other healers, there are only 3 reasons: A) the druid is totally undergeared compared to the others, or B) the druid is a bad player, or C) the druid is overgeared, doesn't need all his mana, so the innervate neither, but outheals the other healers anyways.
---
As someone who never played classic, I'm very excited to experience it. I've been waiting for an MMO to beat me down like dark souls
---
Spice things up a bit then. Play an unconventional spec: (warlock tank, melee hunter, etc...)
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/JNOxz9paA6E?t=30) really portraits a lot of what felt epic about Naxx. The shot at around 0:47 feels so epic as well!
---
There are people who are nostalgic about every expansion. Some people loved Wrath, Mists, Cata (IDK who but apparently they exist).  Its hard to say that classic should include the "best parts" of TBC, but not extend that further. People have been asking for vanilla back for a long time. Can we not just have that first and then we can start thinking about TBC?
---
That is funny me and wife are doing the opposite, were playing Alliance and were still trying to figure out or race/class combo. She loves priests but hates the way female dwarves look.
---
Yeah great video again just isn’t there a rare spawn Kirin Tor by the Dalaran dome that can also drop the Kirin Tor wizard robe?
---
There will never be peace in STVietnam until the alliance are eradicated.
---
Tirisfal -&gt; Silverpine -&gt; Hillsbrad
---
But I dunno man, is you playing Alliance a big issue?
---
&gt;But almost every RPG thing is based around that.
---
Yea, but everything you listed is true for every game. FPS's need bullets, Survival games require eating, just change the words around of any of those points and they'll fit pretty much any genre. I don't see that as RPG exclusive.
---
&gt;That would be the case (literally) with tokens. Not so much when bosses themselves drop stuff upon death.
---
You're right, but we're talking about before they implemented tokens, (and even then, why is Arthas holding on to Sanctification tokens, and why does the Silver Hand care?). 
---
I like how people are using Chinese gold farmers on 7k population servers as an example. 
---
That server has been open for quite a while— the while 7k population isn’t currently leveling. The ENTIRE server’s population will be leveling for a classic server’s launch. I can assure you there were very few Mages (only the most extreme cases of no life) who were able to AoE level at that server’s launch; its even difficult to do now, months after launch.
---
I had over 300 days played on a Lock in Vanilla. They went from being one of the worst to one of the best classes in the game.
---
They’re genuinely great fun to play in PvP, and they’re easy to play in PvE. 
---
Plus. They’re by far the coolest looking class, with the best pets and the sickest armour sets. Come on. 
---
Eh.  It always was an unhealthy design.  Most people shouldn’t be having to raid like it’s their second job just to see the end game. 
---
I quit before Mists, but I’m glad overall that things became more accessible (didn’t do Naxx, but did do MC and BRD).  
---
Maybe things went too far and I understand some of the annoyances, but I don’t think any game should encourage unhealthy habits and WoW definitely was for a bit. 
---
I played as Alliance and Horde in classic, raided AQ on both sides. In my experience, druids outhealed paladins in many fights, but shamans had strong groupheals with healing chain. Next to this, every groups likes to have the shamans totems. Shamans have saved raidspots if you play horde and bringing 8 shamans to a raid is just fine.
---
Also, your argument has completely shifted now.  First, it was, isn't a constantly changing Vanilla still Vanilla? Now it's why not have classic be Vanilla + TBC, instead of just Vanilla? What exactly are you trying to argue for?
---
Except with sharding you can always communicate with them via zone channels. With merging you are literally being thrown I. With a bunch of people that you’ve never chatted or played with.
---
Yeah, I always thought getting rep from main faction races was kinda too tedious or ridiculous to be reasonable.
---
A great hero Dwarf warrior, who hath slain all evil that threatens the homeland, from Ragnaros, to the dreaded Nefarian, and even halted the Scourge advance by assaulting the necropolis of Naxxramas.
---
Stormwind's reaction: "Meh, he's alright I guess. He didn't bring us any cloth."
---
Thaddius its pretty much required. The rest are optional yes.
---
Them taking tier sets out of the game was a big deal to me, that and the gameplay made me quit BFA. I actually enjoyed Legion for the most part but BFA was a whole different beast of disappointment. 
---
No, just grey quests. But for example, if a quest is green and you level up and it turns grey it only grants 80% rep.
---
If you level again it becomes 60%, then 40% and 20% where it caps.
---
So a quest that you BARELY outlevel still grants more rep then a quest you're 20 levels above. It's still best to get them before they turn grey. 
---
Which definitely sucked for OG vanilla players who were 60 before Thorium Brotherhood was added.
---
With good equiment your druid can flashheal faster than other classes. With T3 you could bring up 800-1000hps with 1,5s flashheals while you regenerate mana. With less equipment, like from BWL/AQ you would heal less for sure, but can still flash faster and with more mana efficiency than a shaman/priest. I am not sure about Palas.
---
I don't understand how you're going to hold aggro as a Paladin in vanilla.
---
I think alot of us didn't make as good of decisions as you did lol. So while we had plenty of time then, we are paying for it now.
---
Resto is fine. Some people enjoy the healing style, some like others.
---
Overall, I think if you're rolling with a fairly casual guild, you'll be fine to roll with that hybrid spec. At the end of the day, and in most instances in vanilla, gear matters far more than spec. Not in every instance, but most. 
---
So if you have the healing gear for the raiding and the feral gear for the 5 mans, you'll be set. You might want to spec into just one of those at first and respec to hybrid later to be efficient.
---
The answer is cleat
---
&gt; Also WoW was not hard at the time, it was seen as easy and forgiving compared to other MMOs
---
I can attest to this.  I never played any of the other MMOs of the day, but I remember WoW constantly catching ridicule from all the genre vets for being too easy, newb-friendly, simplified, watered-down, etc.
---
might be possible if you swap to stonetalon early and grind, but silverpine basically has no content between lv16-19.
---
Its not exclusive. Those are all RPG elements which game can easily do without, but loses "soul" when they are gone.  
---
My angry faced moustache sporting male gnome mage sported full Netherwind Regalia with Staff of the Shadowflame and a hyacinth macaw. This was when BWL was current. 
---
I look good IRL ofc, but this was just another level!
---
To be honest it would be pretty tough for a third party entity to find a way to facilitate this safely, while breaking even, cost wise.
---
They could potentially charge people for an account...but that a deterrent for anyone that can’t afford to lose the sub fee if things go bad. 
---
It would be hard for them to be ad supported, as a site like that won’t really get a lot of traffic. 
---
They could maybe actually act as a middle man in both games, but then they run the risk of having gold on accounts that get closed. Plus if they don’t just sell gold, there’s no way for any gold they collect during these transactions to be “cashed out” on the Classic side.
---
Tl;dr I agree that a third party could make this easier, that’s not likely due to the challenges involved. 
---
I mained alliance in vanilla but have been planning on rolling horde for classic. I am particularly excited to quest in new zones when classic comes out because I realized how much I missed out on by only exploring and playing as alliance back in the day. 
---
Some people here are talking about contested zones being accessible for both factions but realistically there are certain paths that make more sense travel wise for Horde vs. Alliance. In general I find the horde have far more access to both continents. I never really got into Stonetalon, 1000 needles, desolace, or feralas as alliance, but I am excited to level through those zones with questing and grinding. I always took the same route as an ally main and it never made sense to me to venture that far into Kalimdor. Usually all I ever touched were the bottom 3 of Zul Farak, Un Goro, Silithus. Which you would start to access when you had completed the bottom part of eastern kingdoms and take boat over to ratchet or theramore.
---
Yes, after 15 years, you have magically theorycrafted a viable ret paladin build. Noone has ever thought of this and you will surely wow your guild in Classic with your incredible knowledge.   
---
I am sorry, but all these people trying to find a way to make this shit class viable is getting really old. 
---
I'd 100% play a Warlock in vanilla if they were more mana efficient and didn't need Life Tap. 
---
For whatever reason, I hate it. It doesn't feel good to stop dps and emo yourself just to keep doing dps. I think the spells and everything are more interesting than mage, especially Nightfall procs for instant-cast Shadow Bolts. 
---
But that's my weird nitpick. Warlocks do scale great with gear, maybe only second to warriors in scaling power.
---
Actually, that'd be their parents, considering a bunch of kids didn't get together and decide how to hand out trophies in the early 2000's, but people who were already in their 30s/40s in the early 2000's did, so........
---
Exactly 
---
##1.0Forever
---
True but there's runes, mage blood potions and major mana pots for that
---
Great video!
---
Great video from an actual expert on vanilla
---
I think that even if you had a pretty rich guild, there will always be a long list of stuff you could spend money on that would be more beneficial than buying a Hand of Rag so someone can look cool in PvP.  
---
Hand of Rag costs roughly 10 000 gold. That could buy flasks for your entire raid many times over. It could buy enchants, rep, NR gear, FR gear, Hourglass Sand, other consumes, prebis items for your new players. Hell, buying your tank a Teebu's to use for tanking is probably a better investment than hand of ragnaros. I am sure your guild was stocked up in Vanilla, but I am sure there was still more stocking up they could do. 
---
I don't recall any items but I do recall lots of comparisons between crafting in SW/IF and somewhere deserted like Darn or an empty zone were fairly significant like 20% or so just because of server lag etc. 
---
My argument I guess is for an improved Vanilla. I loved a lot about Vanilla. The world, the sense of community etc. But I think it also had many flaws. 
---
TBC fixed a lot of these flaws, but introduced many things that started the decline of WoW.
---
Some specs were not particularly great in Vanilla. I think all specs could be made viable, and the hybrid “tax” on dps could be lessened without threatening what makes Classic WoW have that special thing we all loved.
---
So more precisely, the original items Blizzard made for WoW back in beta were assigned an item level as a way of budgeting stats/power on the item. The problem arises in two places: 1. That these budgets and levels weren't applied consistently. And 2. that these items' stats were set up early in development and then the stats and how good they were and what they did were changed later.
---
That's why one of the most ridiculously bad crafted sets in the game is the Mooncloth armor. Mooncloth, of course, is super expensive. And the reason it's bad, especially at that price level, is the stats. It has an absurd amount of spirit. And little else. Hell, +healing and +spell damage I don't think even existed yet when this set was made. Spirit was actually nerfed in alpha or beta because it was too strong, and if you were a class that could kill mobs fairly quickly but the real issue was downtime, stacking spirit would make you a mob grinding machine. It affected in-combat and out of combat regen. So I bring this up to point out that items and how they have stats in Classic is a messy, awkward thing.
---
ilvl was brought back in Cataclysm, but that's part of a larger change on design when Blizzard wanted to change up stats in general. So all classic gear was either gotten rid of or re-statted with new stats. Haste was added in BC and no items before BC content had Haste until Cata, for example. So that's where ilvl comes from, is the revamped stats in Cata.
---
Classic wow items, for all purposes, have little consistency on item power. 
---
Alliance is fucked up. The lore of the deadmines in vanilla. I 100% support vancleef and I thought horde was the bad ones. Tsk tsk. Horde ftw.
---
Soon™
---
I killed the final boss in the necropolis naxxramas yesterday, for the very first time.  It took me 13 years. .  I had been in naxxramas in 2006, 2013 and 2018 but never made it to the end for various reasons.  
---
Humanity is in peril
---
We did two wings there. It was such a weird feeling going from farming for purples to fail after fail.  
---
One day, I dont care if I am living in a senior residence and not being able to do anything, one day I will clear Naxx and no-life 360 dunk through it..
---
Possibly the stupidest video I have ever seen. Guy is outed as a complete fraud and never played real vanilla because he has no idea about debuffs in early raids. So let me some this up. **The same people who got modern WoW ruined now want to ruin Classic, trying to insert impossible "balance" while they complain classes are not different in the modern game, when that is what you have to do to get the impossible balance they want.**
---
Please stop playing MMO's. 
---
I regularly top meters as a resto druid in both BWL and MC in a semi-hardcore guild. I'm one of two druids, and our other druid usually does less than half my healing despite having the gear to do a lot better.
---
There are two types of druids in vanilla that I've observed: those who put in the effort to challenge the idea that they're underdogs, and those who embrace the idea that druids are the weakest healers so they can phone it in and collect loot while doing little more than casting HoTs on the tank. It is 100% true to say that resto druids have the most prominent skill gap between good and bad players. A lot of this comes down to spec, willingness to pop consumables on CD,  and generally just understanding how the class works. The class has a very high skill ceiling with a variety of viable specs that most druids aren't interested enough to explore. So the notion that restos are categorically the worst healing class is a falsehood that perpetuates itself. Druids can and constantly do triumph over other healer classes, it's just seen less frequently because it requires more skill to reach the class' potential.
---
Was planning for Druid (to combo with GF rogue) but I've been sort of mulling over Warrior to eventually tank.  
---
I love tanking, but I don't know if I have the time to devote to getting geared.  On the flip side, a stealthy druid would make the rogue combo pretty lethal in pvp.   
---
I guess I just have to decide if I want to focus mainly on PvE or PvP content end-game...
---
How much damage do you think a hybrid DPS spec would need to be doing in order for people to bring them to raids?  70% of a fury warrior? 80%? 
---
Even at 80% of their DPS, why bring a ret over a holy? How will this be achieved in your mind? How will you make them have 80% fury warrior DPS and not completely break PvP?
---
Swiping 20 targets &gt;: (

Swiping 3 targets at a time :D

---
You can sense the passion he has for the game. Makes me want to roll a priest.
---
Or, just stfu and go whine about sharding instead of contributing mate.
---
&gt;I am sorry, but all these people whining instead of contributing to any discussion is getting really old. 
---
FTFY
---
I’d say 80% is about right. The hybrid tax still existed in TBC, and it worked well. I know it sounds like I want a TBC server. That’s not the case. Vanilla WoW was a better game in many ways. I just think the class balance was still in development in Vanilla.
---
More than anything I feel like Classic should feel like a living game, where patches are added and things are continually rebalancing.
---
I remember getting beast stalker shoulders. I thought i looked so awesome. Still think that's one of the best looking sets. Definitely going to play hunter again..most fun class for me
---
see guys, this is what we need more of
---
I can tell you that my dial-up having ass would have LOVED not losing exp because my internet decided to shit itself.
---
LFR isn't out yet, and the last wing won't be out for a long time.
---
 Normal is still pretty hard for your average raider, would be surprised if normal/LFR level players are killing jaina yet. Also FYI, normal was literally all that existed in vanilla and if you think fights were actually harder in vanilla you are dreaming. Without even getting into heroic/mythic there is more to do than pretty much any fight in vanilla. Vanilla was gated by gear &amp; time requirements, not skill. 
---
If you think cutting edge/aotc doesn't matter you clearly don't play current wow lol.
---
If you're going to jerk off about vanilla, at least be honest about it.
---
Back in Vanilla I won the lottery and had a Krol Blade drop off of a random mob in EPL. That almost single handedly paid for my epic mount.
---
Queue advantages. Stopped reading after that
---
A 10% damage increase isn’t too spooky when you can root enemies and nuke them or just shift into bear form and roll HoT’s on yourself when necessary.
---
So to answer your question, the former.
---
In game gold? More like in game copper.  Silver if he's lucky.
---
I started playing in May of 05 and quit a little before Sunwell or ZA (forget which) and only ever saw 1 epic world drop, but I didn't get it. 
---
So, I had made friends w/ this other rogue on the server, ran into each other questing in a previous zone and they were nice and knew what they were doing, so I added him to my friends list. He popped on one day and I whispered him, "hey, I'm questing in Feralas if you wanna join!" He replied, "sure, I'm in Org but I'll head there now!" 
---
So, I started farming around Camp Mojache waiting for him and there it was, [my first epic ever](http://classicdb.ch/?item=868) (not just world drop). Sure, it was a shit mace, but it was purple, and I wasn't exactly rolling in gold either. So I rolled on it, and so did he....even though he was still flying over the Barrens....and he won, and I was furious. 
---
I couldn't really be like, super mad at him, I probably would've done the same thing but it left a really bad taste in my mouth, he didn't do anything besides happen to be in a group w/ me but won it anyway. I'm pretty sure not TOO long after that Blizz put in a mechanic so that you had to at least participate in a fight in order to loot on it, and when I read that in the patch notes I instantly thought of this scenario. 
---
The only other epics I ever saw were in raids. 
---
Why would you choose Imp Renew over Healing Focus?
---
I love your comment. Especially the end &lt;3
---
Let's not forget that the warlock pvp trinket does not include stuns in its dispels.
---
"moderately"[hu, amateur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v20Ko1pKsg0)
---
Fuck you.
---
I want Retribution to have Crusader Strike as their 31 point talent. Every single other melee dps spec in the entire game has at least 1 instant melee attack. Even Shaman get Stormstrike as the ultimate fuck you.
---
Ret paladin is the derp spec simply because Blizzard refused to give it what every melee dps spec needs to not feel shit.
---
I know that's not gonna happen, but I can still want it.
---
\&gt;Actual expert
---
\&gt;cast desperate prayer on tank
---
It really isn't, for the people still doing cutting edge raiding. Fights are better, harder, have more diverse mechanics &amp; supporting systems and less room to carry retards than any raid in vanilla.
---
Have you actually watched vanilla boss fights recently? They are a snoozefest. If they were released today for today's population they would all be cleared in about an hour
---
I guess I could word it differently.
---
People are asking to join groups in trade chat right? I'm guessing Discord will also be pretty popular when Classic comes out. How do tanks compare to other rolls when it comes to demand.
---
Are they in high demand?
---
First epic for me was a nightblade, was 100% convinced it was the best weapon ever and stayed level 39 on my warrior to pvp for a couple weeks.
---
I think you should try priest. Shadow priest is strong in pvp which sounds like you are big on. 
---
They level fast and healing 5 mans is easy. 
---
Some cool abilities like mind control. 
---
You can farm dm east. 
---
The priest life is pretty cool.
---
What do you want to get out of this thread? Do you want someone to try it for you? Do you want some hand wavey, pseudo theorycrafted reason about why this is good or bad? 
---
You're right about focusing on the right content and what matters.
---
I obviously am more busy than before so i do not expect to hit R14 anytime soon of not ever.
---
I never finished leveling a warrior to 60 because of real life occupations.
---
Ive watched my way too many vanilla pvo over the years, players like Goth(warlock) - monkeynews(warrior) - perplexity(rogue) hyped me the hell up on these classes.
---
Monkeynews has so many clips of him fighting and sometimes 3 enemy players with skillful plays. Quite attractive really. But yeah reading your comment makes me think that I'd maybe better off as orc rogue. Hmmmm
---
You are correct, he's based in Ambermill which is technically in Silverpine forest. you can see my video on Silverpine forest [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCAq-1GgUAs) :D
---
&gt; I would rather have server merges than sharding.
---
Congratulations. Your server has merged with Asmongold's and his 9,000 REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE followers.
---
Did the hybrid tax exist in TBC? Because I remember OP resto druids that also had flying form, and a number of hybrid features that just made you say "why would I ever play a different healer?". I remember paladins every where and very few warriors at all.

Youre right I've thought about priests! Although I am not psyched about healing in raids (I have healed before and it was great).
---
No idea why im so against it tho
---
Shadow priest are great 1v1 but run oom so fast it's mind boggling :o
---
Normal is basically LFR for guilds. It is completely easy. 
---
Obviously the last wing isn’t coming for a few weeks but like my point stands. 
---
Vanillas fights weren’t hard, the resource management, logistics, preparation, and things like threat management. Naxx was still only seen by a tiny margin of the player base, let alone cleared. The inaccessibility and epicness of getting there was more what I’m commenting on. And frankly, even on private server where people are very geared, I’ve seen absolute wipe fests on vanilla fights because it’s just simply a different kind of a challenge. Things like locks pulling aggro or healers going oom. 
---
I have gotten at least AOTC every tier since Legion came out and cutting edge a couple times. I finally unsubbed a few days ago because I’m sick of the modern game. But way to just assume. No one fucking cares about those achievements besides the extremely thin margin of players within this game that high end raid, and if you actually think that a large amount of people who aren’t high end raiders care about aotc and cutting edge, you’re delusional. 
---
I don’t appreciate you calling me a jerk off because you disagree with my view of the modern game. No reason to act like that over a video game. I was critical on wow in my post but I never just directly insulted people. There’s a reason BFA is being seen as worse than WOD by most people I’ve seen and talked to, and there’s a reason that if blizzard doesn’t fix the game very soon, it will die. Warfronts, islands, and hamster wheel systems like AP grinding and weekly loot boxes are pretty unfun. 
---
Yes. For 5-mans, tanks always have been and always will be sought after the most, followed by healers. Guilds usually have their MTs for raids already though.
---
Miyamoto's quote deservers a huge asterix for online multiplayer games that can regularly ship updates. Sometimes you need to get it out in the world so you can figure out what's there and what to fix.
---
Yes there are only 4 sets, cloth, leather, mail and plate...  And I agree they area but dull but the raid themed set is nice.
---
But...
---
There is 4 versions of each, for each difficulty level.

So there is actually 12 sets...  And since there are 3 more classes now, it's asking the art team a bit much to make 12 class sets and then not reward raiders for doing it on different difficulty...
---
Not to mention the entire first tier just reused T3 models with slightly different colors.
---
Is mage tier gear that bad until tier 3?
---
So leveling is a small part of the experience. Warriors take something like 30% extra to level on average. Not the end of the world.
---
A good tank never has any issue getting a group together and you and a healer can basically make people play by your rules in a party. But you have to be good to your healer because you are useless without them.
---
Tanking is classic is fun. But, you are still expected to know every pull and do it flawlessly. Sorry. I mean, you have to learn it of course and things happen but when a tank fails to do something everyone sees. Its always been this way. I also generally think tanking in classic is harder than in live. You have to tab target everything you're tanking and rotate through in a much more active way than in live as very few of your abilities are going to produce threat across the entire group your killing. You also most often will have to assign the CC and kill order. This being mostly in reference to 5 mans. Alot of raid tanking is single target. But in dungeons the tank is the natural leader. I found vanilla tanking extremely satisfying and enjoyable. 
---
Bad? what do you mean?
---
Yes off pieces are a thousand times better!
---
On a new server warlocks are much faster then mages leveling.  Mage is only faster if you can aoe grind which in most cases you cannot.
---
&gt;Its just another brainless "Old good new bad" circlejerk post.
---
And you are just whiteknighting retail when the sets clearly are more bland and boring than older sets. Just look at the screenshot for crying out loud. I couldnt even tell if they were different sets until I clicked the image.
---
&gt;But you can literally never have to step foot in the Barrens for a quest if you don't want to. 
---
Well, unless you're a shaman. Or you don't mind not being able to use fire or water totems.
---
They do, and I don’t think OP is saying they look bad. Just that they are all very, very similar and don’t have any class identifying features
---
That wasn’t my experience. I saw all classes. I played an enhancement shaman. Got very respectable DPS, but was usually outdone by the straight DPS classes. My buffs were useful, but only to the point you’d choose one enhancement Shaman for the group. That’s how a hybrid class should be imo.
---
PVP I definitely didn’t fancy my chances against a rogue or fury warrior. My healing was negligible.
---
I had no idea, thanks for the guide dude.
---
On the other hand, retail had tokens for many expansions now. Having sets designed to look like they drop from the dungeon when it's just some NPC somewhere else handing you the gear in exchange for the token is just as bad for immersion as what you are saying.
---
No problem, glad it helps
---
&gt;What do you want to get out of this thread? Do you want someone to try it for you? Do you want some hand wavey, pseudo theorycrafted reason about why this is good or bad? 
---
Nope, just wanted input so I can better test it myself later on. And I wanted to know if it's been done before so I don't waste my time. And I got what I came for. What is your purpose for commenting here? Seeing if you can call me out on something?
---
There are no healing focus in your healing specs, but more critically, you claim that desperate prayer can be cast on other targets. Dont call yourself an expert if you dont know the basics.
---
Lol @ a 9k pop server merging
---
Just trying to get some content on this sub that isn't yet another thread trying to make ret viable. 
---
You can tank in DPS spec, so just do that. There's zero reason to level in a tank spec, since it'll make the 90% of the time you are on your own painful, and will make very little difference in dungeons. Actually being correctly specced might save you, what, 1 out of every 10 wipes? Most of the wipes will be from the hunter pulling extra mobs, a pat, the healer running OOM/fucking up, you not holding aggro on side mobs, DPS split focusing, etc. Usually not because the tank was taking too much damage, unless they are underleveled. Just keep some tank pieces and a shield, and you'll be fine.
---
Tanks are still high priority, and will get into dungeons quickly, but it depends on some other factors; namely how popular the server is. It isn't *hard* to get into a group though as a DPS class, just more time consuming. Since there isn't a dungeon finder, it's not like tanks can just insta que. Sometimes they'll find a group that just needs a tank, and that will happen more often than dps being the last slot, but sometimes they'll be stuck looking for a healer. For the most part, if you are questing/grinding while you wait, it isn't really "lost time" or anything either, so it's really not as bad as you might think.
---
Healing focus is just so damn good, same with matyrdom. Half the reason I love priest is the talents, especially these two because 1: they are early in the tree &amp; 2: they only take 2 points where other classes take 5.   
---
2 pts instead 5 is pretty darn good for 70% cast interrupt reduction. Obviously it's mostly PVP so on a PVP server and BGs I would use 4 pts on these amazing talents
---
&gt;Is it still worth it for the group/queue advantages?
---
Yes, if you are looking to run many dungeons then already having a tank will make the group forming process go much more quickly. As a DPS it can often be hard to find a tank if you don't already have a healer and vice versa. Since raids are so much bigger however it can be difficult to be a guilds main tank but far from impossible; many warriors are off-tanks so you should at least be able to do that until you can find a guild to main tank for.
---
&gt;Is levelling as Warrior bad enough to not be worth trying to tank?
---
Leveling a Warrior is not necessarily 'bad' or 'unfun' per se but it is slow. Plenty of people enjoy the playstyle but it is definitely hit or miss. They do have some of the best class quests in the game so there is that but the only way to tell if you will like the leveling process or not is to play it.
---
&gt;Is it fun to tank in Classic?
---
Again this depends on the person some like it some hate it. Tanking isn't nearly as difficult in Vanilla as it is in retail; the rotation is like 2 or 3 buttons and boss mechanics were much simpler (Many retail dungeon bosses have more mechanics than vanilla raid bosses). People are generally less likely to shit on the tank in vanilla for mistakes here and there since community reputation matters and there is more time investment into getting into an instance. It all depends on what 'more fun' means to you.
---
It is also important to mention that the leveling experience takes a long time and is the real bulk of the game. If you do tank it will mostly be for group quests in the world and the occasional dungeon. It takes a good time investment to get a group together, walk to the instance, and complete it- dungeons were large sprawling mazes for the most part. 
---
For 5 and 10 man dungeons tanks are always by far the most in demand role. But it is expected that you know what you're doing, know the way through the dungeon, be able to maintain threat on all mobs, assign kill order and cc targets with marks, etc. Tanking is always the most demanding role in dungeons no matter the expansion and that's a big part of why tanks are in short supply.
---
For 40 man raids competition for tank spots is fiercely competitive. Generally speaking to be a tank in a guild you either get in the guild while its still early in the process of getting its raid core together, and run the risk of being in a guild that implodes before managing to get a solid, consistent raid core. Or you start off as a DPS warrior in a guild, have a tank set, and offer to be the 3rd, 4th, etc tank whenever that many tanks are needed for a fight. Then eventually one of the already established tanks quits and you move up a rung.
---
Literally have feral druids both off tanking and dpsing and shadow priest in 45min MC and BWL clears. This video is full of inaccuracies as the other commentators have pointed out. Please at least do your research before you try and ruin a game you know absolutely nothing about. Dps isnt everything, that's something modern wow players need to get out of their head if they want to play classic. Every class brings something valuable to a raid that are more important than dps numbers. Balancing the game is what ruined the game. **NO, not every class can do what the other classes can do, that's the point of having different classes!**
---
Private server numbers may be. I kept a few on me in case of a disconnect nut nope not required on retail vanilla.
---
Well, the thing is, the difficulty wasn't just mechanics like nowadays, you had to gather 40 people which just to start is already very daunting to organize, then you had all sorts of barriers like:
---
-Gearing said 40 people through content, when gear wasn't just showered onto everyone
---
-Getting everyone properly attuned for different raids.
---
-Farming for consumables
---
Once you had all that, yeah, mechanics weren't exactly super hard, even though I'd wager the average player of today would have a hard time on some bosses in classic Naxx, the difficulty was getting to the point where you could DO Naxx. Ya know, have 8 tanks for 4 horseman that are geared enough to do it? That shit was hard on itself.
---
Some people might say that, that system sucks. Better to give everyone equal opportunity to do it and just make mechanics hard. But I don't agree at all. There was a lot more companionship and meaning to your raid members back then. They were very important to you and you to them, especially as you progressed through content. You couldn't just ditch your buddy because of a fight, or because he didn't perform today. It felt like they were your real companions through a real adventure, it was incredibly difficult to replace them, they felt important.
---
Sure that create it's own issues, but I'd gladly take those over the pointlessness of the game in it's current state
---
Yeah that seems fair for the second/raid paragraph. In Classic, how possible is it to main Prot for dungeons and raid as Arms/Fury?
---
Aren't the other versions just recolors?
---
I find warrior leveling incredibly fun and it isnt very painful once you get rolling.
---
It's fun because it's challenging, and you'll need to leveling first aid and cooking along the way. You'll need to get creative when doing some quests. Many enemy debuffs/cc will have a large impact on how you fight them. You progress not only through skills, but also through weapons and armor (more so than many other classes). 
---
In retail wow, everything is the tanks fault (at least that's what your group will say). I find that in vanilla, players take more responsibility because they have more actions to take. And the content is "harder". Sap/poly is a must for some pulls. DPS must manage their own threat. Players are expected to bandage, pot, etc. I find this leads to the non-tank often calling a pull ("sheep left, focus ranged" etc) and certain players will have their little tricks for making a dungeon easier. It's not all up to you as the tank to lead the group like it is in bfa.
---
Agreed. Completing full T3 is going to be something not a lot of people are gonna be able to achieve.
---
Aren't talents not resettable? I was under the impression that if I took DPS talents, I could never go back and reset them to be a Prot/tank.
---
[imgur mirror](https://i.imgur.com/5vO34UE.jpg&gt;
---
You can tank dungeons as fury as long as you have the gear and know what you're doing. Your only other option is to spend a ridiculous amount of money on constant respeccing between raids and dungeons. Also just a warning that tanking more than one mob at a time is much more difficult in vanilla, you're going to need to tab target.
---
I started in July of 04', and never saw a world drop until my first raid. I was convinced I was jinxed! 
---
I also found one of these on my first char, a Warrior.
---
I was so terrible at making money back then so selling that sword for ~30g was a big deal and huge part of how I afforded my lvl 40 mount.
---
You can respec at the cost of gold. This cost increases every respec up to a max of 50g(? Someone please correct me here).
---
And the above poster is correct. You can tank 5 mans in dps spec. Just put on sword and board, switch to defensive stance. You can also off-tank raids in dps spec. You should not (and probably cannot) main tank raids in dps spec.
---
Summer is June-August, September would be Autumn.
---
Basically, mythic usually has some extra spikes 
---
Talents can be reset for a fee that increases every time you reset them, starting at something negligible (10s, IIRC?) and increasing up to 50g.
---
I was half joking, “you people” sounded funny.
---
I’m very much a no changes guy. Old *is* good because we’re not 100% sure what combination of features made it such a good and unique game.
---
And the more things we can keep as authentic as possible ensures that combination isn’t lost or degraded for as many people as possible, given that this subjectivity changes per person.
---
Ofcourse there are things like novelty or being new can’t be replicated, or others because of technical limitations. But you getthe point. Just saying, “no changes” should never be a dirty word around here.
---
I think you were just younger and have 10+ years of nostalgia about it.
---
People weren't less annoying or less shit than they are now, raiding with 40 people meant carrying 10-15 people who didn't deserve to be there for most guilds just to pad numbers, and the people on this thread might be the only people in the entire world who would prefer to play the game to gear for a raid than they would actually raiding.
---
Not that I think the class tier sets should have been taken away (which, according to Ion's recent Q&amp;A, is a BFA-only 'feature'), but this meme is a bit unfair - the racial armour, both heritage and obtainable through warfronts have been amazing, even at the cost of class sets.
---
If I’m honest the only sets of those classic ones I actually like are Druid, Warrior and Warlock, the rest are kinda dull and paladin looks especially ridiculous
---
Wow
---
Truly outstanding 
---
Powerful 
---
I’m speechless
---
They are high in demand from 1-56 or so. Then not. Raiding and tanking is impossible to do because all the guilds have their tanks established. It’s not like you need a bunch of tanks either. Expect to dps 100% of the time in raids
---
Yes, and actual Classic will *not8 be using the "authentic Vanilla client".  From what we've heard, it will be using a highly modified version of the 7.3.5 LEGION client.
---
Seems like he is a caster raid leader and not actually a priest, so he probably just assumed that desperate prayer was similar to a priest version of lay on hands.
---
 He obviously knows the game though, so you shouldn't discourage him from making guides when the alternative is having an idiot who has obviously never played the game talk about how "absolutely insane" everything in.
---
They are not just recolored, they do different have differences, but they are not huge.  In mists they were just recolored I think, but they move away from that
---
The result of Warcraft's story being such a patchwork. WC 1 and 2 were literally "the peaceful and harmonious Alliance is being attacked by evil orcs!" Warcraft 3 brought more nuance to the orcs, but the Alliance barely got any fleshing out, not least because it's hostile in 6 out of 9 campaigns. And the core of the Alliance in vanilla WoW - Stormwind and Ironforge - were largely absent from the events of WC3.
---
I see what you mean, but it furthermore gimps the variety by bringing it to the armor class level over the class level.
---
As an adult who is single with no children I too will sink a lot of time into classic
---
I remember getting exalted with ad and getting attuned for free. I Joined a raid group with s friend and stepped inside. Marveled at the look of it pulled an abomination and promptly died.  Was quite fun. 
---
&gt; And I don't mean farming. 
---
Of course you don't. 
---
😂😂😂😭😭😭👌👌👌
---
Him being a plot device is probably the most important point. Trying to read anything out of a throwaway character like that is like trying to read tea leaves.
---
No you can respec, that would be horrible if you could not. Respec fees go up to I think 50g though, and since prot is so bad for leveling, I've heard of main tanks taking a respec, farming, then spec'ing back for raids; which means you need to farm 100g *just to break even*. OFC that's a pretty extreme subsection of warriors, and that's why people do things like have farming alts, get guilds to help with consumables and repair costs, buy gold, or charge tanking fees.
---
Your Honor
---
Mind-quickening gem mby
---
sure but like i said there are more sources now  
---
they are working on heritage sets, warfront sets, pvp sets no longer just recolors etc  
---
I really enjoy the jungle with all the lushness and birds singing you know, peaceful, but the goddamn Alliance scum ruins all the questing and fishing you know Vietnam all over again I will never be able to wash away all the blood from my boots stomping gnome heads to pudding, napalm death and stupid elf ears dangling from every corner...
---
Tokens are different story. They are literally reward from higher ups for your feat. They can come from anywhere.  
---
So no, nowhere near the same thing. Completely different in fact.  
---
AQ btw
---
But yeah let's keep circlejerking, why not
---
The Crossroads is the best leveling zone in the game, your buddy is a LOSER!

Clearly failed to read my comments or even understand why they are like that.

Try again then come back to me.

Damn this is pretty good, I never knew the amount of misalignment the belfs had with alliance I guess that helps explain them going with the horde?
---
Field Marshal is rank 13.
---
I mean, most raiding guilds are probably not normal or LFR guilds right? Of course it will be a bit easier for them. I would be genuinely curious to know how many actual normal/lfr raiders have gotten past blockade this week - my group of cutting edge 390ish ilvl players has a hard time with it even on normal.
---
If you want to play a game with quality resource management &amp; logistic requirements, go play roller-coaster tycoon. WoW is about raiding, not planning to raid. 
---
I also fully agree that some wouldn't kill it, just that they would be killed by the vast majority of even casual guilds if they were released today in todays wow. Naxx is just mechanically not a hard raid, and mechanics are the only area where you hit walls on things like normal tier. If you have CE from legion on then you know that mythic fights now are about a thousand times harder than anything ever released in vanilla. Mechanically, numerically, whatever. Raiders enjoy hard fights, they don't enjoy grinding 700 IEs or whatever obnoxious farming had to be done in vanilla before even entering the raid.  I honestly can't even remember, I just know it sucked. 
---
I also don't like a lot of modern wow systems, and I wasn't calling you a jerk off, I was noting the particular classicwow circlejerking sentiment in your post. The nostalgia is thick for most. Too thick to breathe in. 
---
hopefully not in Gnomeregan, on that infamous wall
---
Feralas 
---
&gt; The first day of launch is actually one of the moments i remember the best.
---
&gt; I made an NElf Hunter and one of the first quests was to kill some sabers. There were literally 20 or more people waiting on every spawning position
---
haha, sounds like you had sharding.
---
Imagine it being 10 times more this time.
---
I kind of doubt they'll spin up any new servers post-launch tbh, but I could be wrong!
---
Where exactly did I say that? You appear to be shouting at clouds.
---
Not ubrs.
---
or wait, is that grey beard?
---
:þ
---
I had a similar experience with **Whelpling Pets**, got *two* of them from different color whelps!
---
Sold both, really helped me get going. It wasn't quite like lottery though since I was farming them back in the day.
---
and you want 15000+ server queues, and waiting for more than 24 hours, just to be afkkicked 15 minutes after
---
You think you do, but...
---
Do you need a horse to go with your cart?
---
I think they will purely based on how Ion spoke at the panel, about having a content release schedule they can repeat indefinitely.

**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers. 
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community. 
---
**What we expect of members:** 
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids. 
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes. 
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1. 
---
**Guides:** A thorough introductory guide to structured World-PvP to show you how we get things done. 
---

I'd say there is a link between the level this item was meant for, and item level. Whites usually have the same item level and required level, if I remember correctly.
---
&gt; So your assuming 10k pop on Classic servers
---
no, 10k+ in login queues. On the biggest servers, probably.
---
Most likely whenever they launch some new content (like TBC) they will let people filter in and out of where they want to stay (some will stay on their vanilla servers, some will move to new-content servers) then just do merges as necessary. 
---
Name conflicts won't be a problem, they will just handle those the same way they handle them in retail. If you have 2 guilds named "Epic Guild" on 2 servers Arthas and Illidan, then after the merge each guild will have the names "Epic Guild - Arthas" and "Epic Guild - Illidan" or offer them a name change. 
---
I could have sworn I solo'd that dragon on my hunter in BC at level 40 (I remember being at least a couple of levels lower than the dragon). But seeing this video I'm beginning to doubt it. I know I solo'd him, but I could have sworn I was under level'd, but I think I might be misremembering things. 
---
Feralas is pretty
---
Hinterlands is pretty
---
Arathi/Hillsbrad has lots of "alliance" themed stuff
---
Really any of the "neutral site" zones have a lot of stuff to offer as well.  Winterspring is kind of cool, but Tanaris is boring.  Ungoro is pretty lit.  
---
After the Barrens, you should hit up Ashenvale and Hillsbrad.  That'll get his alliance-loving boner up to around 50% at least
---
You made a definition for what would make a particular class bad. In order to make this definition work, you also made a up the definition of necessary above. You argue that priests are "good" because more are taken to raids than are "necessary". You also argue that tanks are "necessary".  So essentially you are saying that priests and paladins are "good" healers because more are taken than are necessary. So you are then saying that the priests in a typical raid group are not necessary and the warrior tanks and hunters are necessary ( "necessary to perform the critical functions like tranq shot or tanking without getting crushed ") . This is the argument you presented, cloud boi.
---
While building the tank gear as fury, I recommend bringing along 2 cc and a healer you know. 
---
If Blizzard ever decides to add to classic (not meaning progressing to BC) I hope they flesh out the world with the unused zones, Hyjal, north of Winterspring, east of Stonetalon, south of Silithus, Gilneas, south of Eastern Plaguelands, North of Western Plaguelands, east of Wetlands and Loch Modan, north and south of Dun Morogh, east of Burning Steppes, and south of the Blasted Lands. I know some of these zones have already been fleshed out in retail, but I'd like to see them redone from the ground up with the classic design philosophy.
---
The sheer number of mountain ranges in Azeroth is truly astounding, what a volatile land. 
---
I'm sorry you weren't good enough to raid Naxx in vanilla, no need to be so angry at discussions about the future.
---
transmog had a part in this
---
Green tower. I used it for tanking stuff.
---
I entered that hell almost 14 years ago but we did not master it. I wait for classic but I know I will never ever enter it because I will not have the time for that effort. I am not sad because vanilla wow is not about raiding. It is about socializing with people.
---
First off, yes, you're probably right I do have a lot of nostalgia over it, and much of that feeling will not be attained again.
---
Now that we have that out of the way, I don't think I explained my point to you well enough. Of course there were assholes, of course it was a freaking pain. I've commented somewhere else equating raiding as a second job. A job you pay to do.
---
Most people didn't bother, but those of us that did it, did it to achieve something. Because we played through the world and we wanted to see what was on the other side, to experience high end content. That meant something.
---
Everything that means something, that you hold some sort of value to, is going to be a pain. That's what gives it meaning! The pain of going through it and having the odds against you makes it look like and actual adventure, instead of a theme park.
---
Yeah you dealt with a couple of assholes and their drama, maybe even had to switch guilds, but you managed to be there. You got X item and it felt fucking awesome. You worked past the bullshit to achieve epicness, and probably made some good friends along the way.
---
Those kinds of hurdles make content mean something. Without them you won't put in the effort, why would you?? Because it looks cool? Just watch it on youtube. Who cares.
---
I still have fond memories over T2(pally), and while Arathi Alliance warfront gear looks amazing, I doubt I will remember it in 10 years.
---
Private servers have done fine for a decade.
---
Realistically I think we're going to get a pretty-accurate release at launch, then after about a year people will realize changes are good and we will start to see minor changes here and there. This is pretty much how private servers operate, and they're pretty stable population-wise. 
---
Well doing it for 7 days straight is nearly impossible
---
Cant wait to see Progress in Classic. Those guys are insane
---
Well with nude mods and stuff you can have whatever one that takes your fancy. 
---
I needed more VanCleef like storylines. Although I could have done without rehashing the entire thing with his daughter in Cataclysm lol. But elaborating on the nobles who refused to pay the Stonemasons, bringing back more former Alliance kings and lords vying for control of land (like the Syndicate). Making that stuff more prominent, instead of just zone local stuff would have helped I think. 
---
Honestly I’d love to see that too, but the odds of them doing that is slim. I think they recognize that a very vocal part of the classic community is dead set against any changes to the vanilla experience. Sadly that would include “new content” even in the form of just expanding upon older content.
---
Unless you have rested up. But yes that would definitely be the case for dual leveling
---
Items were so much more meaningful, when you saw someone from the opposite faction in the open world with T2 u were like "oh shit" :D 
---
I'm salty about them joining the Horde because it still doesn't make sense for them to side with Orcs and Trolls imo, but it's hard to not recognize that they haven't been *the most* loyal to the Alliance overall. 
---
I'm still a fan of the idea of a third faction, with Belves and Undead as the basis and calling *that* faction the Forsaken with a common theme of being victims of the Scourge attacks and permanently transformed by that event. At least from a lore and story angle, not a gameplay angle. 
---
That’ll only get people to google it but it doesn’t matter either way, you’ll only get memes about the meme anyway. The original is incredible hard to track down accidentally. 
---
YES NO TO TRANSMOG!

One change I would support is auto casting of the correct down ranked version of the spell so we could easily buff lowbies

I can neither confirm nor deny any involvement in said activity.

The first epic dungeon drop I saw was in a pug - I can't even recall what it was, except it was some BOE that wasn't any good for a healer.  Our healer hit need and dropped party immediately after winning.  Fucker...
---
What I am taking from this is he doesn't like deserts. I am kind of the same honestly. Try and do northern Eastern Kingdoms zones, UD starting zones. Stick to jungles in Kalimdor. Avoid tanaris, crossroads, durotar, and thousand needles 
---
World drops do have a level range they drop from, while the ilvl may be correlated to what drops them it wasnt how they decided where they fell on the loot table
---
On top of the stuff you mention, the tuning was also extremely unforgiving. 
---
Look at the mushroom boss. That fight as PUNSIHING. Other fights weren't much better.
---
Random abilities or debuff ticks that nail people for 3/4 of their health stacked with raid wide aoe damage that will east 1/2 their health a second later. 
---
Yea the mechanics were exceedingly simple in comparison to today's tightly choreographed dances, but the fights themselves were no joke. You weren't just dealing with mechanics...
---
You were dealing with massive balance issues, tight tuning, game engine flaws, latency problems (especially problematic back then), GCD weirdness, ability clipping, debuff caps, buff caps.... People forget all the other shit that came with it, mostly I think because they weren't there and just assume today's fluid game is the same. It's not even close. 
---
That's one reason I'm sad they're doing classic the way they are. Just having bumped the debuff slots along with 1.12 talent/ability design is going to trivialize at least the first tier and a half.
---
Taking a week off work and getting a new chair because my current one is probably as old as vanilla and hurts my back. Told my girlfriend about this months ago but even with the warning I think she still doesn't know how much she will be ignored during the first few weeks after launch.
---
&gt; So essentially you are saying that priests and paladins are "good" healers because more are taken than are necessary.
---
You get it so far.
---
&gt; So you are then saying that the priests in a typical raid group are not necessary
---
This is where you go off the rails into the land of wilful stupidity.
---
Having a certain number of *healers* in the raid is necessary. They do not have to be any particular *class* though, once you have enough of a given class to put up all the relevant buffs. You get that, right? The last healer you add to the raid could be a paladin or a priest or a shaman and any of them would be fine. It is not necessary to baseline functions everyone takes for granted that the last healer be any particular class.
---
This is not a difficult idea. Even the most idiotic and incompetent raid leader gets this.
---
In the same way if you have a balanced 39 toon raid and just want one more DPS, that last DPS could be any kind of mainspec DPS. It is not necessary that it be any particular class.
---
&gt; and the warrior tanks and hunters are necessary
---
Last time I checked no other class can tranq shot or push crushing blows off the table. Is this news to you? If so you probably should lurk more before you start posting.
---
&gt; This is the argument you presented, cloud boi.
---
No it is not. It is something of truly staggering stupidity that you made up all by yourself and tried to attribute to me.
---
The best thing to happen to WoW was transmog, since I hated the fact that every single warrior set was all fire and skulls and spikes. I wanted to play a knight that actually had buttons to press (so, not a Paladin), not an edgy middle schooler's wet dream.
---
So that's why I'm going to suck it up and roll a Paladin on Classic WoW, since transmog would ruin too much of the social aspect that we all loved about the game.
---
I've tried frost during the tbc times but I can't get I to ut. I've played arcane during wotk and it was alright, but in vanilla, most of tbc, and every other expansion I've always been fire spec. So much fun, reliable,  and great damage 
---
This so much. Please don't heal me or attack. Victory or death
---
Pizza flavored combo master race.
---
Ashenvale&gt;Hils&gt;Ashenvale&gt;Hils&gt;STV/Arathi after that most zones are actually the same zones on alliance, so nothing to complain about. However if u do this you will miss out a lot in Thousands needles/Stonetalon mountains, so exspect to farm a little bit more :)
---
Also silverpine looks better then the barrens in terms of "aesthetics" in my opnion, so you can consider questing a bit there too.
---
That guide seems really bad. He didn't talk about downranking at all which is very very important for priests. Also desperate prayer is self cast. His comment about shielding casters so they don't get pushback seems either missing a massive amount of context (like they are going for speed run kill) or in reality just a clueless comment.
---
... Tell them why :)
---
Thank you very much for this information. You see how hard it is to find accurate vanilla information?! So many sources are polluted with TBC or Cata information even when labeled as "vanilla".
---
Yes, this I agree with. 
---
I also got my first epic in Searing Gorge, Kang the Decapitator. The elite cave of like 47 - 50 undead and humanoids near the FP was the closest thing to farm waiting for raids to start. After farming absentmindedly over numerous raids, I noticed sometimes a mob would have a different melee weapon model than their standard staff or sword. And after more time I noticed the model always matched a corresponding weapon they inwveitably would drop. Then i began to farm here after raid times, sometimes spending hours and only finding one or two, only to drop greys. One day though my heart skipped because I saw a very intricate 2h Axe in one of their hands. I rushed over to tag it and sure enough it was Kang. 
---
Not sure if other mobs had this behavior but I didn't notice it.
---
Wasnt he mind controlled by the Dreadlords? I havent played the Wc3 campaign in over a decade so my memory is a bit lacking. 
---
Mage has the best CC for dungeons.  Groups will always want mages.
---
Priests  are healers and have a better time looking for groups than dps.
---
Priest leveling is medium paced but you can essentially grind forever at that pace.
---
Mages can aoe grind.
---
Both classes are in high demand and both classes perform at their role extremely well. You honestly wont go wrong with either. If you roll priest your going to have to heal at some point though

&gt; Othmar Garithos was the only son of a [baron](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Baron_Garithos) who ruled the lands bordering [Quel'Thalas](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Quel%27Thalas). After growing up in the town of [Blackwood](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blackwood), Garithos joined Lordaeron's army as a [knight](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Knight) during the [Second War](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Second_War). While he was fighting to defend Quel'Thalas, a small band of [orcs](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Orc) broke off from the main invading force and put Blackwood [to the torch](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Razing_of_Blackwood),  killing all of its inhabitants. Othmar's family perished trying to  defend the lives and homes of their subjects. Garithos blamed the [elves](https://wow.gamepedia.com/High_elf) for the loss of his home and family, believing that they had diverted troops that could have been used to defend [humanity](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Human). After the war, Garithos inherited his father's title and continued his service in Lordaeron's military. 
---
It's pretty official why he hated the elves. That's not touching on the elves being fairly racial supremacist themselves, part of the reason I think lore nerds get bent out of shape.
---
There are macros/addons that do this, though they'll need to be reinvented due to the new client of course. But yeah it would be nice for it to be a built in features.
---
Eh, we'll see. I'm hoping that Classic is popular enough that they start investing into new content while leaving preserved Classic only servers for the player base that doesn't want play new content. 
---
Yes and no, truthfully it's because they wanted the Horde to have a pretty race to balance population numbers. Or so we're told.
---
&gt;Only 30% of the time
---
Which is a shitload... lol. Especially when a lot of classes are using upwards of 5-7 stuns in a single fight.
---
&gt; Because they're tryhards, simple as that. They have no confidence in  their skills or ability but they still want to fit in a place by  imitating others. 
---
What? Making choices that give you an advantage doesnt translate to being intimidated or lacking confidence? You have such a weird perspective on making an effort... Its so creepy.
---
&gt; some advantages are more significant than others ...  If First Aid only healed you 30% of the time, I don't think I'd bother telling people they NEED to have it. 
---
Thats where youre wrong. Its a silly comparison, but ill bite. Even if first aid only worked 30% of the time, it would be better than not taking it and having it 0% of the time.
---
&gt; It might be, but it is not "FAR BETTER, UBER BETTER, MASSIVE ADVANTAGE" the way you prescribe it. 
---
The way I described it\*. Yes it is. It is FAR better in comparison to the alternatives. It is game breaking.
---
&gt; It wins them sometimes. (in regards to RNG winning fights)
---
Then we are in agreeance. Orc is advantageous and is the top tier pick. Thank you, and good day. =)
---
Also how would they get paladins really? Still hard for me to justify the Holy Cows
---
why cant anyone ever just give a direct answer?

Why not just add monks and pandas while you're at it. Go back to BFA. You might as well add being able to see spell damage in the character panel you retail baby. #nOcHaNgEs
---
All I said is that your definition of what is necessary in a raid is very unclear.   People take a second druid all the time. Is a second druid more than "necessary" under your definition, since you only need one for Mark of The Wild? Is this then an indication that druids are good, since we are willing to take more than necessary?
---
Look, I am basically trolling at this point. But as it stands your criteria for what makes a class good or bad is awful, doesn't withstand even cursory criticism and you haven't succeeded in convincing me of anything. 
---
I just keep playing with talent trees.  Paladin and priest are my favorite 
---
It isn't really stupidity though. You are saying druids are bad because when given the choice of what healers to put in the "extra" spots, people will always take a priest, paladin, or shaman over a druid. But that isn't the case.  Raid groups often take extra druids.  And even if it was, it wouldn't be indicative that druids are bad. It could just be that there aren't many people playing druids. 
---
Thanks brother
---
First talent reset is 1 gold.
---
The second one is 5 gold.
---
It goes up from there to 50 gold.
---
Then you have to wait a month for it to go back to 1 gold again.
---
**DO NOT LEVEL AS PROT.**
---
Human Paladin or Human Warlock, I cannot decide. 
---
casting power word shield on casters allows more casts to go off increasing overall dps due to less pushback on your spells
---
Honestly, I wouldn't know I don't think it's my place to say it was Metzen's setting and he can do what he likes. I think it would have been more sensible to have undead.. shadow paladins? Change the colour of holy light spells to dark shades. They already have priests.
---
This seems more in line with what I remember, though I did not grind rep much in Vanilla, it was a bit mind numbing to be honest.
---
Meh... the way I see it, you have to wait half as long. If you can pump out 2 rank 14’s a week compared to only 1 by being organized and compromise with each other.
---
I remember watching the original on YouTube of all places back in the day. Shame it's such a PC hugbox these days.
---
dude is good at warlock
---
buuuut not healing
---
Meh... the way I see it, you have to wait half as long. If you can pump out 2 rank 14’s a week compared to only 1 by being organized and compromise with each other. And there is no cap. Just an agreed upon amount to not exceed in order to get 2 rank 14’s. anyone can still “ninja” this rank but then they usually would get blacklisted by the main pvp crowd. 
---
&gt;I agree with you on the first point, Orc's are definitely better positioned in PvP due to their racials than any other race. 
---
Finally... UGGGGGHHHH... I worked SO hard for that! Haha.
---
&gt; Yet still, this isn't so game-braking to warrant a massive influx of Orcs (in my opinion). 
---
There WONT be a massive influx of orcs. Look at this thread. I have to pull out peoples teeth so that they will acknowledge Orcs are insanely dominant... The fewer orcs there are, the stronger the racial is. The more undeads there are, the weaker WoTF becomes. Orcs are game breaking but that WONT result in them being overpicked due to the misinformation within the community. And... This is the HARDCORE community. Imagine when we are the minority???
---
&gt; My mistake on fire mages, was pretty tired and glossed over Impact. 
---
There are a ton of stuns. My list wasnt even complete and I probably missed a bunch too, dont sweat it. I wasnt trying to question your credibility, there are too many stuns for anyone to keep track of.
---
&gt;  I don't think we need to worry about concussion blow in regards to pvp,  as prot warriors are entirely feeble vs 95% of every enemy. 
---
Youre right. Infact I wouldnt 'worry' about ANY single spec or class. Thats what makes hardiness great, it pretty well counters everything.
---
&gt; Also, a good rogue isn't jumping players without their cooldowns unless it's a free kill 
---
This isnt true. Rogues in BG's react to opportunity. They WONT always have full consumes and cooldowns when they are forced to react to an enemy team. Youre right in wPVP but in premades and high level BG's rogues are reactive.
---
&gt; resisting a cheapshot doesn't matter 
---
Resisting a cheapshot wins you the fight. Whether youre an orc warrior, or warlock or hunter... I mean. The rogue stunts their energy, loses 2 combo points and finds themselves in combat. They likely will be dotted immediately by the warrior or warlock and will be CC'd by the hunt. If they cant reset the fight, they lose. If they CAN by chance, they need to waste a major CD to do it. If they have to commit to the fight, they have less energy and no stun and now need to build towards their Kidney. BUT they are 2 points behind FOR the kidney, so do they use a 3 point, to lesser effect OR do they wait out the full 5 points taking 2-3 times the damage they are used to during their initial opener phase? There is no good answer for a rogue. That doesnt even acknowledge the fact that their kidney, when it finally DOES become available, has a 30% chance of being resisted.
---
&gt; We both agree, Orcs have the best racial abilities out of the 8. 
---
Why did you make me work so hard for that? Im currently taking on about 10 challengers on this topic and I committed SO much time and energy to convince you!!! But I appreciate the acknowledgement.
---
&gt; However, do you concede that as far as Alliance races go, it's all very  negligible in terms of pvp? If you can't even concede that... I just  don't know who I'm talking to anymore heheh. 
---
Hmmm... I dont think of things in terms of PvP per say. I look at things in relationship to their purpose. That is to say, alliance have some great racials for PVE like human swords and dwarf priest. For PVP, Alliance have some situationally strong racials, but nothing overwhelming (class dependent - points of interest being gnome warrior and dwarf rogue). If im being honest, I think dwarf rogue is ridiculous for high level pvp, especially as most rogues will find themselves countering other rogues or druids and dwarf sort of gives rogues a checkmate in PvP as it removes bleeds AND blind. Dwarf rogues can do everything wrong and STILL win a fight with a horde rogue. But, back to your question, no single alliance racial (or any racial for that matter) is as overwhelmingly overpowered in PVP as hardiness AND counters as many other players, no.

&gt; 2 long replies to 1 post. \]
---
Text based forum, despite our differing opinions, I appreciate ANYONE who is willing to spend so much time on their posts, especially when they are as well written and thoughtful as yours.
---
&gt; I'll just address the Warlock vs Warrior... your spec is going to be a  much more determining factor than anything else as lock vs war. 
---
Agreed 100%. I would say Gear - spec - proffesions - consumes - racials
---
Good gear, especially if it is dramatically better than your opponents, can simply carry you. That isnt to say that you cant beat someone in better gear, but depending on the disparity of gear, it will simply get to the point that you overwhelm your opponent with stats. Ex. fresh 60 vs someone in tier 3.
---
Spec is incredibly important and determines everything from your throughput to your survivability and playstyle.
---
Proffessions and consumes can win fights... They are sort of equal in my opinion. This could be rated higher than spec IF you were full consumed with a flask etc, but that wont be the case for most players.
---
Racials are the very lowest determining factor in a fight with all things considered.
---
Im not sure where competence/skill would fit into this chart and I wouldnt be so bold as to give it a ranking because I think it is important but also know how much lenience players can net with proper gearing and consumes.
---
&gt; It's a joke really, and even them proccing some lucky stuns isn't going  to change that outcome when lock's have 2, 2k shields to rage-deprive a  warrior... 
---
Youre right. And that matters for duels and wPVP. But in a premade, no warrior will over extend like that. As a lock you wont have a 1v1 unless the other team is making mistakes, and thats sort of where Hardiness thrives... Not for a 1v1 fight (its still INSANE in 1v1s) but in 1vX fights where you may have several opponents attempting to contain you.
---
&gt;isn't going  to change that outcome
---
Wanted to specifically focus on this point. The 'outcome'. I dont look at the outcome as a win/loss. I view the outcome in terms of value. The warlock WILL win the fight against the warrior/rogue. But if he does it without wasting a healthstone, or without them busting his bubble, he now has more value to spill towards the next fight. The outcome isnt merely concerned with a win/loss rather the net expenditure vs the return.
---
&gt; I'll be silly and say the power of SL warlock is so much higher than most 
---
The single most broken pvp class ingame. Arguments could be made that the hunter has the single highest value pvp ability in viper etc etc etc... There are many honorable mentions, but you wouldnt be off to suggest SL locks are possibly the most dominant pvp class considering all scenarios.
---
&gt; It's cool, it's minmax, but it's still kind of a joke in terms of just how strong SL is 
---
That could be entirely true for you, and I would never expect your values to align with my own. But most people who are concerned with min/maxing, dont bother to min/max to 85% of their potential. Either do it right, or dont bother. Its one extra consideration, its one extra way to get value out of your character AND its probably the EASIEST part of min/maxing... You dont need to work for your race, you just choose it. Bam, free value.
---
It's a museum piece. Jump in play until you are bored and leave it for future generations to play untouched. Which might even be you 5 years down the line after a break.
---
This was one of my biggest gripes with WoW at the time. How lazy of a designer do you have to be to simply reuse old set pieces with only a slight color change. They reused so many of the sets in later expansions.
---
Blizz add more in the smaller stories and the RP.
---
In Breath of the wild there is small tidbits of lore on what certain plants you collect do and how some creatures live.
---
It's silly but I'd love to know what caused hthe alliance to use a lion. Did lions go extinct in Stormwinds region?
