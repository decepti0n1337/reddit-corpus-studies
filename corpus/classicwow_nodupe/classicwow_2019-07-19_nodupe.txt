Hey guys, Im a pvper and I can tell you this is all wrong:

---
what you actually want to do is FACE your TARGET and hold S
---
that should help thanks!
---
Probably not the first time... especially if it's find all the squares with a bike? Does the edge of the handlebar that kind of crosses into this square count? I still don't know.
---
I remember going against local d
---
Probably because he has a film crew or some shit in his room watching him and talking to him so he has to have his headphones off to listen to their shit but also still have to talk into the mic.
---
I have done it twice on stress test. It works fine I had both wands by ten. You just have to grind huminoids. The essence wasn't an issue either time but it's always a risk of not getting one
---
Your premise was: 
---
&gt;So a Seal Fate Rogue might only have Phase 1 daggers available to him even after he gets to 30% crit.
---
But you intentionally ignore daggers that are upgrades over Phase 1. That's disingenuous.
---
Weird all I’m getting are The Gap and Williams Sonoma ads
---
Thanks for your help. Behold, the final updated build!

You buying gold gives you an unfair advantage over players not participating.  Unless you can provide a source where blizzard expresses that buying gold is fine.  You're wrong.
---
Only in a video game can someone consider 20+ hours a week casual
---
The fast lane isn't congested if no one is in front of you.  If you aren't leading the pack you arent getting world first.
---
See if you were a human, that would be obvious.
---
No, we have two raid nights a week and that clears all content. So at most you're looking at 500g per night, sometimes as little as 300g.
---
That's ~$40 per night.
---
And Blizzard has never once banned a player for purchasing gold nor is it forbidden in the EULA.
---
I would give you Reddit silver but I'm a broke ass. Just know that you are my hero
---
Honestly if bugs exist hey likely won’t impact the first few weeks for most
---
My friend burnination the shaman was in sardaukar.
---
not correct they removed the function to target with custom frames with the 2.0 Api changes that's what broke the original bots like decursive and emergency and the auto-it farmbots
---
How rude of me to only read the title and not the context. I sincerely apologise.
---
Your best resource would be https://www.joanasworld.com/ I'm sure you've heard it before, but Joana kind of rules the Vanilla Speed Leveling universe.
---
Okay man, I get it.
---
Blizzard sells gold in their own game silly. And all games are governed by the same EULA. Classic will be no different.
---
Maybe I should join the speciest movement now. :/
---
is lionheart helm in phase 1? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also are "High Councillor's items" in phase 1?  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10139/high-councillors-circlet](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10139/high-councillors-circlet)
---
Does PA count as "surrounding"? I mean, the tips don't touch but it's pretty close right?
---
No it isn't. You'll reach 30% crit before you can obtain AQ40 daggers which are the only daggers that are upgrades to Perdition's Blade and Core Hound Tooth.
---
300-500 g per night or week? Did you mistype? 500 g per night twice a week is 1000 g a week, 80$ per week. Alot more than a dinner once a month like you originally said.
---
Again, you could still get banned. You gonna buy the first 10k gold a company farms and think youre gonna get away with it?
---
This has gone from "Why Rogues should never use Poisons in Raids" to "Why rogues should spend 1000s of dollars on consumes" loool
---
The primary disadvantage the alliance has in random BGs is younger players.  They don't tend to be naturally cohesive with the group which results in poor perfomance.  This however can be overcome by queuing up in small groups with your friends.   
---
I ran leveling group in late Vanilla alliance side with 2 friends and after a bit of practice and us 3 on voice coms, we could turn most shitty alliance groups into winners in most BGs.
---
Yeah, I've been reading through it, I just saw on this sub someone talking about how so and so has joanas time beat by a lot, but couldn't find the post. Thought maybe there would be people on the sub with knowledge of some of the more prolific runners, but it turns out while they definitely exist and there are tons of them, nobody can name any and I'm not gonna come anywhere close.
---
Honestly, thanks, don't worry about it, I should have known what I was in for when I posted to classicwow.
---
I’m on cloud 9 baby.  Fantastic day.
---
Where are you seeing raid buffs and consumables?
---
You just have a big list of everyone in the guild randomly generated. If loot drops, the highest person on the list gets first dibs, highest person on the list who wants it, gets it. If you take an item, you drop to the bottom. You can also create special rules that allow priority, such as ensuring main specs having priority for rolls over secondary and so on. It works decently well.
---
This argument seems pretty strange. Exploration and mystery are pretty much gone, or at least running out fast, by the time you get to max level, which is also when you get flying mounts.   
---
  
---
I mean if you want to argue that *the game* became all about the end game and that levelling became a small side blip - then say that. Flying mounts do diminish the scale and danger of the world, but really 'the world' is a non issue once you hit max level anyway. The world simply becomes a means to enter different portals for content, and to mindlessly farm items for that portal content. Now I'm not saying that's great design, but it really has nothing to do with flying mounts.  
---
You have the exact same issue in Vanilla. Once you hit 60, the world doesn't really mean that much anymore. You go through portals for content where you can get better gear. You complete trivially easy/boring tasks in the world like killing hundreds of super easy mobs or picking herbs to help you with the content in instances.  
---
If you want to envision a game where the meat of the content is in the world, then ok - but the idea of that MMORPG died as soon as BWL was released and the raid tier treadmill started. It existed in vanilla for 2 full years before it was transplanted to outlands and flying mounts came in.
---
AEnigma - Burning Legion. They were the sickest guild. Envy was a close second.
---
&lt;Rage&gt;
---
On skullcrusher horde side from a pvp perspective they were the best of the best. I got to run with a conglomeration of the best pvpers on the server in bc but I always wished i could have rolled with rage in vanilla. Hoping to track them down in classic.
---
You shouldn't worry about it tbh. Nobody knew anything back in 2005, but we still learned and downed every boss they put out. (even if some took longer than others).
---
So if you wanna try raiding eventually, but scared of your performance I wouldn't worry about it!
---
&gt; You gonna buy the first 10k gold a company farms and think youre gonna get away with it?
---
Yes.
---
Most of the group's I dealt with, if it was BOE it was a free-for-all roll unless someone is specifically farming for that item with the group, then it would be "reserved".
---
"there are chatrooms on the internet dedicated to addicts."
---
well shit
---
Damnation came from the Opeth album of the same name.
---
Yea  I guess if it siphons to you over a long period of time it could work out....
---
I leveled a Paly to 60 then a Priest to 60 in vanilla (both still my mains today) and I’ll probably do exactly the same on Classic. I am changing the races and names though.
---
You shit spammers are getting smarter, using google redirect links before sending folks to your scam page.
---
Ich kenne auch deinen besten freund.
---
I mean if he doesn't have admin on his machine he's not going to be able to even begin to install anything on it right?
---
This is the part where you back up your claim with actual facts. Like u/Hilroy69 did.
---
Provide the data you claim to have that confirms the opposite. Or accept that what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.
---
I'm not. Just look at the damage parses for Rogues. You'll either see Shadow Bolt and Dragonbreath Chili or you'll see Instant Poison VI.
---
There are plenty of runners, but Joana has the most documented &amp; refined routes. Also, 1-40 time doesn't matter. All that matters is your time at 60. Private server times don't matter either because the leveling experience is much different than Classic.
---
Yeah if you want to be a caster go mage or lock
---
He can't install the Battle.Net client because it requires Administrator privileges (this is where Warden resides). His installations of various games are failing at their checks *for* the Battle.Net client.
---
Thats not how reddit ads work. You target the user, based on the subs they are subscribed too and a few other things. 
---
That ad is targeted at you, and can show up on any subreddit you visit. 
---
Source: work in digital advertising.
---
I remember playing on BC pservers consisting of only myself and other dozen players long time ago. Neither of us talked or anything. Leveld 5 characters back then, maxed professions as well. No regrets.
---
After I got older, I PvP'ed pretty seriously on blizz for years tho, so I'm not a solo player anymore, but I know how fun it is. It's just that I know so much of the game rn that I have no incentive to solo stuff as of now.
---
I was getting dog poop bag and sock ads for a while. :/
---
Blizzard wishes this still existed in retail.
---
Yeah for sure 60%+ of Undead and Orc.
---
Good point. The class fantasy is important for me too. Do you happen to know the average cost of these patterns when training? I can't find any information
---
They also have downvote bots to try and bury anyone who calls them out. The comment you responded to by me has already been hit by 5 downvotes since I posted it.
---
They're estimating 2 to 3 weeks for delivery with the first transfer no later than 3 days after launch.
---
Nature resist in AQ would say otherwise
---
Yes, and there is a difference between blizzard selling gold and a third party (unauthorized by blizzard) selling gold.
---
Even if you level """efficiently""", you still run into situations where the quest levels get too high for you and you have to switch zones. Unless you're a masochist and love grinding mobs for hours on end.
---
Yes, and that distinction is made in the EULA.
---
The distinction that is NOT made in the EULA is *buying* gold from Blizzard versus buying gold from a 3rd party.
---
If you want to be a good warrior then get used to tanking. A good dps warrior will quickly equip a shield and taunt the mob/boss that is running rampant through the raid for whatever reason. A bad warrior will just continue to dps while the raid is wiping.
---
Still... Source?
---
Maybe the doctor should rethink why he decided to take up a job as a taxi driver even though he went to school to be a doctor?
---
You should usually be fine if the mage hits a frostbolt before you start stabbing
---
Huh, I just tried it and I thought the shift key would be out of reach, but lo and behold it extends perfectly to accommodate that hand position! However my F key has the home row bump and that would definitely take some getting used to!
---
Mind sharing the data please? I'd love to parse it exploring other areas of the market.
---
Ah the age old question. It really all depends on what level you get that first wand at. 
---
On the stress test I got my first wand at lvl 8 and second at lvl 13 so it was definitely worth it going for imp wand first, but that might be a biased sample incomparable to release due to the level cap.
---
Alliance had a lot of raiding guilds, I was in &lt;Arcanum&gt; during Vanilla but &lt;Eminence&gt;, &lt;Fortis&gt;, &lt;Arcanum&gt;, and &lt;Aeternus&gt; were the only ones to clear AQ40 and had Naxx progression.
---
Before each of the guilds disbanded, there was &lt;Sword of Fate&gt;, &lt;Dissidence&gt;, &lt;Awakened Empire&gt;, and &lt;Sparklebunnies of Doom&gt; that were all pretty far in raiding.
---
The OP said he didn’t want to raid hence any raid gear is not catch up/relevant for this thread.
---
I know tier 0.5 came in with the AQ patch but I’m fairly certain tier 0 like Magisters Set was in the game very early on certainly pre-ZG (1.6)
---
You're seriously telling people that the way they enjoy the game is wrong because you don't like it? What the fuck kind of an argument is that?
---
OP said he isn’t raiding hence not relevant
---
Well you'll have to really grind hard to get your 40 mount. That is really the only downside to making your first character an an enchanter.
---
You can purge DMT and SF, which are both quite huge.
---
Anyone want to talk about PUGs? Here's my take
---
**Loot systems**
---
**GDKP:** Items are bid on and gold is split among the entire raid. Some variations exclude buyers from receiving gold, or give better cuts to the leadership.
---
**Soft res:** You pick an item you want. If it drops you will only roll against people who also selected it. Some variations have you select multiple items in order, or allow offspec items to be reserved. Probably going to want to use +1 for non-reserved items due to loot trading ninjas.
---
**+1 MS&gt;OS:** Normal MS&gt;OS /rolls. You are +0 until you win an item, then you are +1 (+2, etc). The person with the lowest +number has priority. This usually means you will win at most 1 item per raid, unless everyone else wants to pass to keep their +1 for later. It's common to reset the +1 at some point, like major domo in MC or Jin'do in ZG.
---
**All pugs**
---
* Will ask you to at least join the Discord voice channel.
---
* Will likely have spoken or unspoken class priorities for certain items.
---
* Might have priority for people completing an item set. Usually listed.
---
* Free rolls aren't really going to work. I'm not getting on my soapbox because that ship has sailed, but you will want +1 to prevent loot trading ninjas.
---
* Will likely have at least 1 item reserved or Gbid (auctioned off with the gold going to the ML's pocket) for the trouble or organizing and leading.
---
You're just taking enchanting to DE quest rewards you won't use while leveling. Just DE the ones that don't have high vendor prices (such as weapons and heavy armor) and only DE items that still give you materials needed to get to 265 Enchanting skill. The pain to your wallet from not vendoring everything is not that great. Druids don't benefit from a mount right at 40 as much as everyone else.
---
I'll be rooting for you.
---
Just chiming in to say you’re a legend, and you helped teach me how to rogue many years ago. Have a good one.

It's hard to say how significant this will be. If Phase 1 only lasts 2 months the vast majority of people will have the first added items in when they hit MC. So this really only effects the hardcore 5% that plan on raiding in those first 2 months. The people gunning for 1-2 week clears are the 0.1%. Even most hardcore guilds will only get 3-4 clears in with the original loot tables.  
---
The later phase 3 additions aren't hugely important, they mostly just fill in some gaps - they aren't massive ones like Benediction/Rhok/Perdition's that dramatically change a class. They are just nice bonuses to keep MC feeling a bit fresh once BWL is out.
---
I'm pretty torn between regretting how much time I wasted playing WOW and knowing I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. Basically I just wish I got out more on top of playing it back in the day.
---
Don’t remember a guild but there was a guy named headhunter or something that had our AH on frostwolf licked down.
---
That guild was massive. They did a lot of fun stuff. 
---
They were an online community that just happened to have a guild in wow. It would be like /r/classicwow having an official guild.
---
I like to respond to discussions about what-ifs and etc but I dont actually care about efficiency or whatever happens to this game as long as i get to play in August and the game doesnt die.
---
When did they auto lvl you to x lvl if you re-subbed? Or bought the expansion? That's when any sort of classic resemblance died. TBC imo was still classicy enough. Cataclysm ruined WoW 4 me.
---
You use terms like "we have confirmed the opposite" but provide zero evidence of your proclaimed confirmation. That has zero credibility.
---
At least you accept that what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.
---
Oh god we’re gonna have a laughing coffin knock offs everywhere I bet.
---
I do mind, sorry. I've had some offers to buy a copy of it and still not budged. Besides using it for a few anecdotes on Reddit, I'm keeping the data and its analysis close to my chest.
---
Sure, the fun removed is spending the time. But there's no fun removed if you just spend the money.
---
Is he (still) single?
---
Seabeck, I was a resto druid during late wrath progression but life took me away from the game.  So I wasn't in the guild to long.
---
And even with the sheer amount of tests and confirmations you claim to have performed, you have zero evidence to show.
---
You're right, I always used to say that. I just didn't recognize the diminishing returns of playing wow as much at the time and how much I could have enjoyed other activities.
---
We are talking about bugs here not temporary features you disagree with
---
Hmm awesome thanks for sharing that. MoT and MotC it is then! I woulda been pissed if I leveled up enchanting all the way to 265 before discovering that. You saved my butt.
---
/thread
---
Probably rogue or another hunter lol. Hunter+ rogue in world pvp would be unstoppable. Rogue DPS is welcome in raids and they're fun to play. Only downside is theirs a lot of rogues running around. 2 hunters is just fun because you help each other kite
---
In BC I made a mage called Eressea and in Wrath they made a boss also called Eressea, so I got a name change for choosing a name that would be reserved in the future.. pretty fucking dumb.
---
Counterpoint: Could also bring back players already jaded by Retail to come back to a game they loved. 
---
My co workers, until i brought it up last week, didn't even know Classic was coming. Its free advertisement. And i would have never resubbed for anything Blizzard related without Classic coming back.
---
When? They're jump cutting quickly while he's swearing. He appears to be in Arathi Basin, probably got killed.
---
prior to the haste normalization during BC both attack speed and ranged attack speed mods stack multiplicative
---
final = base / (boost1 x boost 2 x boost3 ...)
---
This was tested on beta with quiver, rapid fire and quick shots. There is no reason to assume that the troll racials or kiss of the spider would work differently
---
even my own stress test testing got the same results with just quiver + quick shots (and god damn it was a pain to get that 1% chance to trigger -..- )
---
a 2.1 bow turns into 1,91 with a 10 % quiver
---
1,91 = 2,1 /1,1
---
and into a 1,47 when quick shots proc
---
1,47 = 2,1/(1,1\*1,3)
---
Berserking just always gives you 1,1 and additional 1-1,3 (which ends at 1,43 on the lowest health scenario if those 2 are the only sources)
---
so with RF a 15 % quiver, quick shots and a low health berserking you could put Ashjrethul from 3,4 down to  1,14 weapon
---
1,14 = 3,4 / (1,15(quiv)\*1,3(quick)\*1,4(RF)\*1,1(base berserk)\*1,3(low health berserk)
---
and since we are at it. the animation time of multishots and the mini cast bar of auto shot are also affected by ranged attack speed.
---
advanced combat log logging gave us 0,454 sec on auto casts with a 10% quiver and 0,350 with quick shots up
---
so to go with the stacked ranged attack speed example. your troll would fire auto shots at 0,167 speed. meaning you would be firing a shot every 1,3 sec (+ potential client-to-server communication delay)
---
So someone gets home from work and is looking forward to getting a level and you camp them for 3 hours and they get frustrated and upset, their fault for not turning the game off. Someone insults you in a sexual manner, your fault for not blocking them, it's you who needs a life, learn to block people, it is actually legal in the real world to call someone a cum dumpster, ganking them in real life isn't legal. Who is living in the fantasy my dude. My point isn't to outlaw ganking or make it illegal in Texas, it's to point out that doing it too much can actually just show you want to get an emotional response, drop the fucking lie that you enjoy pleasure from spam killing a grey level player, that isn't how the human brain gets rewarded, we know that because you don't see rogues camping non-human players. The only difference between grinding grey lvl 1 starter boars and real people is the people, it's the attention. It's one thing to try to spark a pvp war, it's another to follow some potentially 12 year old kid around and grief him. I am open to ideas here tell me if I am wrong, I just call a spade a spade is all I see it as, I've come home from work and logged onto my 29 twink rogue and ganked some lvlers, shit happens, but I can barely bring myself to kill the same guy twice unless it was a good fight or I got dog piled.
---
Again, #nochanges and all, and it should be corrected within the community, and maybe they decide griefing is good, but don't try to pass that NOBODY ever griefed with the goal of tilting or upsetting someone else, maybe it's you who hasn't had sunlight hit him in a few weeks, maybe lacking some eye to eye contact with a fellow human.
---
Short of a video or screenshot, which we had neither the need nor the demand for, would you be satisfied.
---
Arthas Horde, &lt;Proven&gt;/&lt;Pyre&gt;
---
The dudes were the epitome of pve to pvp. They actually fell apart late AQ due to no one wanting to put in the work to progress past twin emps—allegedly cause to many guys were spending too much time in bgs and not enough time farming.
---
I played with the pvpers as a 15th man for the AB premade. Despite apping, I never could get the trial. 
---
I suppose for most, &lt;Aurora&gt; and &lt;TG&gt; were the elite pve horde guilds.
---
I'm solo.  Been guilded off and on, usually off.
---
In Vanilla I didn't even know guilds were a thing.  I had no idea what I was doing and just ran around The Barrens fishing and selling my Deviate Delight on the AH or giving them to lowbies.
---
I had no idea there were other dungeons.  I didn't know what a princess run was until Wrath.  I didn't know raiding existed until half way through TBC when I made an in-game friend who asked me what raiding I had done.
---
I miss those days.  I just had fun not min/maxing.
---
Yeah, that happened with a guild merger. Every mergin guild was supposed to have equal officership, but it didn't go that way. Weird raid times with low turn out showed up on the calendar, and "bonus" DKP would be generously given out to those who attended. Everyone from one original guild had 300-400 DKP while everyone else had 100.
---
As others have said, every spec is viable in 5-mans. Most of the mana and DPS issues that hybrid DPS run into in raids isn't present in a 5-man environment, notably longer fights, lack of scaling with high-end gear and raid buffs, the debuff limit etc.
---
If anything, I personally prefer to have 1-2 hybrid DPS in my 5-man over a pure DPS due to the buffs and utility they bring, often times they have the same/similar DPS as a pure class and add other substantive benefits.
---
While you'll do well in 5-mans as a Shadow Priest you will have to be mindful of your threat, otherwise you're good to go!
---
You are fantastic! Thank you so much!
---
Then the fun removed is that you have to work more IRL or have less money to enjoy other hobbies.
---
In premades I’d much rather be an Alliance priest than Horde. 
---
1v1/world pvp is a different story because of WoTF.
---
Yep, say goodbye to roots, fear, polymorph, blind - your friendly neighbourhood Paladin has just cleansed them from that warrior that was putting mace to face.
---
My brother had a friend that we essentially adopted into our family, he lived with us for a couple of years and, before I got my own copy of WoW, he let me make my own character on his account so I could play if he ever went out for a night on the lash. He helped me make my first character and helped me think up her name.
---
When I finally got my own copy of the game and created my own account, he deleted the character and I recreated her. It's probably my most important character, at least in terms of memories, so it's nice that it's always there for me.
---
I don't really remember ever getting ganked much on a PvP server. I think it was pretty easy to avoid. The fact that you could be was what made it interesting. Resing behind trees, rocks, and whatever and making a run for it was fun.
---
Not if money is no object to you.
---
You can never have enough dps warriors. Top guilds will have 20-25 fury warriors when going for world record speed runs.
---
Public information about how to server first is both subjective and likely misleading you intentionally. Anyone who will get a server first to 60 is not likely to share that information/route to the public.   
---
Which means the only information you have is content/information from beta, joana's original route and making your own mangos server to practice on.  
---
To put it into perspective: Joana's original route took  4 days 20  hours and 49  minutes. Based on how fast he went on beta, he would do that run now 5% faster than before. 4 days 14 hours and 52 minutes would be his projection. His routes are public to everyone. So you will be competing against people who also have easy access to his routes.
---
Then you have people who are able to 1-40 in 35 hours on beta, which is 8.5 hours faster than Joana's route(20% faster). Based on that projection, those people will reach 60 in about 3 days 17 hours 16 minutes. While it may be harder to decipher from past streams, that information is technically public as well.   
---
Which means You will have to be faster than a 3 day 17 hour level 60.  But that's not all. Jokerd, a mage on a private server, did 1-60 in  3 days 9 hours. In a twitch interview, he states that it would be impossible for him to reenact that time on Classic wow.   
---
So public information can lead you to potentially do 3d17h16m to level 60. Which means if you want to be server first, you'll have to come up with a route that is faster than that.   
---
 Best of fucking luck.
---
How did guilds deal with AQ20/40 loot?
---
TOTOT achieves the same, and many raid interfaces come with aggro highlights.
---
Why not just get an enemy swing timer addon and quickly jump backwards when they're about to hit?
---
I think it's in the best interest to not draw unneeded shareholder attention to Classic. All Activision cares about is Numbers of 'World of Warcraft' as a whole. As soon as you separate them into two separate categories, that is when people want to get their grubby hands on some of the pie. Enter Micro-transactions.  
---
The way it is currently set up, Classic is just a different server within the same game. And I honestly think that this was the plan all along. Blizzard fighting the power.
---
It’s weird none of you possess the ability to answer such a simple question
---
LOL
---
Kiddyfiddler the human priest, based off current events.
---
Blizzard banned it, so I renamed to Dontouchkids. 
---
Banned as well. 
---
I’m interested to see what level I can get to with “Childtoucher” on classic.
---
I think you should try to play a competitive game like a FPS or RTS over an RPG if the thing you enjoy most is competition.

One of my earliest characters was an undead priest named Nagrash, a reference to the undead sorcerer Nagash from Warhammer Fantasy. This eventually morphed into Nacrash and then Necrash. 
---
I've also used Yarvaxea which means bloodstained in Elvish. It's actually said by Cristopher Lee in FotR when he casts the lightning bolt spell on the Caradras mountains. 
---
My shaman was named Cemenyë which is also Elvish for earth-something, I can't quite remember. After a server transfer she became Cojayeonjeog which is Korean for something, I have no idea.
---
Do I look like a search engine guy? 
---
Google it, it will come up real quick. Madseason show even did an episode on it I thought was pretty entertaining. Long story short, Scholomance is actually a bakery in china, who knew?
---
Would be a good name for a level 19 think Druid, tbh.
---
Im not saying I'll get anywhere close. I am saying, if I can hit 40 in 35 hours, I want you to give me a thumbs up emoji on this comment chain. Thanks mate, I've come to assume the info I have is the info I'll get, and work to iterate.

[Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccu57o/classic_changelog/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
„Rogue
---
- Energy refund values when using abilities on an invulnerable target have been corrected.
---
- Stealth animation now properly matches the 1.12 version.
---
- Using any mouse-over condition with abilities and items now causes you to lose your combo points if the mouse-over target is not the target with the current combo points.“
---
No, it was a ghost dwarf of some sort. You had to kill yourself and ghost walk outside the dungeon to talk to the dude in spirit form. Couldn't see him when you were alive.
---
Thousand Needles elevator, too
---
No I'm actually not playing (well, 49 twink) Priest, but that's another great spot esp as Nelf
---
&gt; The OP said he didn’t want to raid hence any raid gear is not catch up/relevant for this thread.
---
It is a tangent. It is responding to the claim, not made by OP, that there is no catch-up gear (not true) and no soloable BiS gear (Truefaith Vestments say hi, among others). Heck, I forgot to mention Dire Maul which was very much catch-up gear for US players who didn't raid before 1.3.
---
&gt; I know tier 0.5 came in with the AQ patch but I’m fairly certain tier 0 like Magisters Set was in the game very early on certainly pre-ZG (1.6)
---
I am fuzzy on the details too, I think it got revamped at some point to suck less? But my memory was that there was never a point where Tier 0 or Tier 0.5 were both good and useful for current progression. They either sucked, or did not suck but were catch-up gear for people behind the raiding curve.
---
I stood in-line for WotlK midnight release, was awesome. Got home around 1am, installed, went to bed, then at 7am the grind started.
---
No thanks.
---
Shovelly Joe!
---
Sapped girls cant say no
---
I wasn't speaking of LFR content, but Mythic content.
---
Lmao the best hunter ranged weapon is a gun wtf are you taking about?
---
You’re doing God’s work, Freddy.
---
Smoking heart is better for mitigation than mark of the chosen.  Mark of the chosen may be better for health and threat, but I'll be using Smoking Heat and Mark of Tyranny.  Druids already have good threat and health, and with the beta we learned that thick hide applies multiplicatively with bear form and not addatively as most private servers had it coded, making Smoking Heart even better than PServers.
---
Even more fun are the boats.  But you have to wait until they leave the dock.  Then the enemy has to swim all the way back.
---
Why are these paint memes so bad.  At least make your meme good in paint.
---
No, I'm stating "I've seen the evidence, trust me or not".
---
Lmfao the best ranged hunter weapon in the whole game is a gun from Naxx. Also the best weapon you can have in tier 2.5 is a gun from AQ. Don’t just say shit for no reason. They’re plenty of other good guns too.
---
Can't put a price on BiS mitigation gear.
---
Shadow Oil procs scale at 80%, not 56%, because they have no downranking penalty.

Who says im not trying to upset anyone?  Grief is right in the name.

hey it's me your uncle. buy my shirt.
---
I’m not making anything up, it’s fact. Yes, you can link many shiny purples, ooooh good job. Doesn’t make them good items, though. Almost every gun is below 3.0 attack speed, which is too fast to properly thread your auto-attacks in your Aimed Shot/Arcane Shot rotation. Not to mention that since your rotation relies on the top damage of the weapon, the faster the weapon the lower the top end damage.
---
tldr; don’t pretend you know Hunter rotations and BiS gear when you don’t
---
Didn't Mythic 5-mans come in in 6.0 or something?
---
I was in FoW during Nef/AQ/early Naxx. Lots of fun. 🙂
---
Gypsy Cab Company, partially because they were significantly ahead of us on content, but also because their name was cool. (Uther, Alliance)
---
I think it’s because he had reporters in his room talking to him tbh
---
&lt;Ropetown&gt;
---
16 hours per day and hes only in lightforge?  Scrub.
---
I also see that you said Ranger, not hunter.  All of the hunter specs would almost require the use of a pet in classic wow.
---
6.2, but even Heroic raids in WotLK were more challenging than anything Classic has to offer.
---
I should have been more specific, Mark of Tyranny from Ony "attunement" quest line.
---
It doesn’t consume charges, and it scales at 56%
---
Evidence you can't show isn't evidence.
---
Gatekeeping a 15 year old game.

You're a dipshit if you think that data holds any relevancy, and you're also a bad liar.

In a court of law maybe. Again, I don't have to convince you that I'm correct to actually *be* correct.
---
They were legit though! I remember them so well and played with lots of them often, lots of very nice and chill people considering their skill at the time. Kold their Main Tank had a crappy PC and the guild banded together and bought him a new one around the start of BWL which was one of the coolest things I've ever heard a guild do.
---
But if MotC is nearly as good, it makes all the effort put in to obtain SHotM less appealing.

Pservers are the ones selling the gold.... Do you not know this?

I named my dwarf hunter Draythar because it was one of the pre-made character sheets from D&amp;D

Not all of them. Some generated gold, gave it to gold sellers, and then banned anyone those gold sellers dealt with. Do you not know this?

I was &lt;TG&gt;!   Good times.  What guild were you in.

Remember Pat and the rogues take zero skill guy?
---
Envious of someone holding onto irrelevant information that helps nobody, definitely not.

Lol I've never seen a longer post but thanks for the tldr!
---
Classic will for sure be populated for the next 5+years
---
It will die out for a lot of people that are overhyped right now sub 3-6 months but oh well, I'm not putting any expectations of myself when it comes to classic - I anticipate having a ton of fun for launch week and the first month, beyond that I have no clue if I'll still be playing.
---
&gt; Almost every gun is below 3.0 attack speed, which is too fast 
---
This is the dumbest fucking thing I've heard today.  There are **zero** bows that are 3.0 or greater attack speed.  But you say:

&gt; handicapping yourself by not taking bows

Noice. They were first responders for sure

I mean, if you have unlimited time and resources then sure. Most people don't and it's a huge amount of savings that you can spend farming other, more significant gear.
---
Back on Darkspear, there was this rank 13 Tauren hunter that keyboard turned. Being a backstabby rogue let me get some of that easy honor
---
You must be new to Pservers. Adorable mindset you have, really. Pservers generated gold and characters, sold them, banned people who purchased such things, the accepted money to get them unbanned.
---
I plan on doing a pet build! Don't know the difference between ranger and hunter.
---
I remembering being 15 and trying to explain to my parents..."no, like these really ARE my friends"
---
What dou you mean ?
---
2H Fury is a better solo PvP spec than Arms (Improved Sprint and Death Wish are excellent PvP talents), but for organized PvP you'll need to spec Arms for the healing debuff.
---
Haha, ok, just checking.
---
You can't speak for all pservers, certainly not K or K3.
---
Nice dude. I think this is the dumbest comment I’ve read on reddit in a couple months. Got any more?
---
Pretty much every single raid mob is stun immune to prevent stacking up on stun on hit effects like the unstoppable force, seal of reckoning and proc based stun talents. Imp. Kidney Shot is mostly wasted other than on regular dungeon trash.
---
Cry More on Balnazzar was the top guild, full of elitist assholes but were the jocks of the server. I believe at one point they held the record for shortest time from server launch to BWL clear.
---
Too bad the leader and main tank jumped the server to join Death and Taxes and it killed the guild.
---
If you think the market data will stay exactly the same as 15 years ago, with layering, the vast amount of knowledge everyone has about raid consumes, especially black lotus and its value. I guarantee you, your data will be nothing but a glimpse into how the market once was, not what it's  going to be. But sure, hold onto your 15 years old AH data like it's going to change your life or something.
---
My experience with DKP was that it rewards people who don't spend and who hoard points for the rare, end boss drops. It also punishes you for bidding on gear during progression, the very gear that will help you progress. You get the set pieces earlier but everyone ends up with them anyway.
---
No, there are more raid mobs that are not immune to Kidney Shot than there are raid mobs that are immune.
---
Holy shit it's sinner files? Probably why I was confused on why Josh liked dogs so much.
---
The data doesn't need to stay exactly the same for the data to be valuable you moron.
---
Anyone got a link to the map showing zones with level ranges?
---
[removed]
---
yeah, otherwise it was extremely broken. You could not do that kind of thing in vanilla. But you could slice and dice after an npc died for a tiny bit of time, I wish they'd patch that back in
---
I think you have emphasized community too much.  While community is important, don't sell vanilla mechanics (class design, combat system, etc..) and the vanilla world design short.
---
If Blizzard somehow released a Wow version with gameplay that forces a vanilla-like community but with the BFA world and combat I, and I think many others, would not be interested.
---
definitely more rare on alliance because of the better horde racial
---
Ah yeah, fair point. Like I said, I actually didn't know and I was genuinely curious. I just vaguely remember some hunters in our guild (back in the day) talking about.
---
Tier 1 and 2 armors are all nearly on par... and so are a lot of the items found in bwl and mc, Tier 3 items are far bigger difference and won't be till phase 6.  Just because bwl gets released doesn't mean you just stop raiding mc.  As far as I'm concerned it might be interesting just to release everything before naxx.  BWL stops players with a raw dps check boss... Which is why gearing in mc is greatly helpful, but then offers only a small power level boost in item stats.
---
The best they could do is stop you from gearing by holding back DM and ZG.  This alone will hopefully make MC more challenging to how it was back then... But even then... Knowledge about the game is wide spread now, and it's highly likely things will be conquered quite easily.
---
The biggest change from vanilla is really because the game is now well known and will be conquered faster than ever by todays average gamers.  When they drop, bwl, zg, naxx, it's quite possible they will be dominated right away by experienced players that raided them at Vanilla and knew exactly how to prepare for the fights.  When they originally dropped those dungeons, nobody knew a darn thing about them.
---
Pre knowledge alone is a bigger taint to classic than any of the items you mention in this video.
---
I bet OP found all this super useful. Play whatever and however you like.  You’ll be fine.
---
Well that was depressing to listen to
---
I don’t mind when people ask questions or offer ideas/opinions, as long as they’re kind about it and willing to learn. But this guy tried to tell me I was wrong without offering anything other than “hurr durr here’s a list of epics”, and took a snarky attitude while doing it. So I called him out and this guy thinks that that’s gatekeeping... RIP brain cells
---
Recently got a mouse? You were playing without a mouse?
---
&gt; Because the bow from the MC Hunter quest off Majordomo is the exception to the rule.
---
To what rule?  The rule "use bows and crossbows and not guns"?  The rule you made up?
---
Just keep changing your story.  First guns were all too slow, now there is a *single* bow that makes it worth using.  You're all over the place here.  
---
He'll be fine, but keep pretending he won't.
---
I'm curious. What was your name / class / race ?
---
nah I mean you're right, that other kid is an idiot, I just hate the term gatekeeping
---
For sure! If you have any other questions let me know ^.^ I mained Hunter in vanilla and every vanilla private server since haha, I’m fairly well versed in their intricacies
---
Definitely not the case for me. I have always loved Westfall. Not for the quests but more just love the asthetic of it. I feel like a lot of newer zones are too much of a cluster/maze.
---
Don’t hate on the class designed for people who only have one available hand,
---
Layering, extreme melee leeway, large delay/lag with any in-game activity (non-respnsive gameplay) are currently the issues at the forefront for me. I could live with layering and I guess melee leeway but the delay might be a deal breaker for me. I really really want to play and have been an advocate since like 2012 but I'm currently on the fence. Debating if it's gonna be worth the investment and if it's going to give me good feels when I log in or if the lag is going to keep nagging on me everyday.
---
Blizzard has no authority on how Twitch decides to categorize their streams.
---
If your goal is some kind of speed run then ignore this advice:
---
You can easily go into the SM Graveyard and seek out the rarespawns for a rare neck that drops. One of the rares also drops a one handed mace and another drops leather gloves. These rares are soloable as a combat rogue. There's also two chests there that you can lock pick.
---
Just leave the guild if the loot council is corrupt?
---
He literally told us what he wants:
---
&gt; From a flavor perspective, **I like the idea of using rifles as my primary weapon.**
---
Then he asks how he'll fair:
---
&gt;  How viable is that in classic wow? Would I be severely underpowered by not taking bows or crossbows? What about if I only used crossbows and guns?
---
I mean, it's right there.
---
&gt;I see all these different guides out there and all the hype about leveling efficiency, and it got me wondering... what happened to the folks who wanted the vanilla experience so they wouldn't out-level a zone before they finished ALL the quests and all the exploration?
---
&gt;Are you guys still around? Silently brooding about the hype? Disappeared about a year ago and moved on to other games?
---
You're in an extremely hardcore subreddit. People like me who just want to take their time leveling with friends, doing dungeons, meeting people, enjoying world PvP, etc - we don't have a lot to talk about before the game is out because we aren't making extensive plans and optimizations.

I wanted to pay homage to a musician from Detroit who got murdered over a stupid bar room argument.
---
He was in this spot where he wasn't incredibly well known in the mainstream and never really got the recognition that he deserved while he was alive.
---
Pretty much the only people who recognized who my name referred to were pretty deep into hip hop and rap. It wouldn't be very hard to find out who it is based on what I said here though.
---
10 layers of the same place. You are layer 5 and your friend 7. Cant see eachother.
---
Oh shit. And this is even in the same server?

---
The point of the video is to tell people some items they may be used to seeing on the loot table will not be available in the beginning. It's an informative piece I'm not trying to compare clear speeds or difficulty or any of that.
---
Basically, it turns the game into more of a single player game as you're only going to see a small portion of the player base in the world.  It also affects npcs and mobs, even while in combat.  See video.

So you mean it's illegal to sell gold but not buy it? Like the prostitution laws in many countries? 
---
Btw I definitely remember being suspended for buying gold back in Wrath, are you saying the rules around this has been changed since then?
---
Do you like pressing frost bolt or do you like pressing flash of light?
---
Raiding or PvP or both?
---
&gt; I'm not going to bother sifting through old vanilla footage trying to find Armor Shatter on the bosses, since it's clear that is the only evidence which is good enough for you.
---
The only evidence good enough... lol.   As if the nonsense you've written constitutes evidence of any degree, lol.
---
What are the best pet type for hunters for each role?
---
I wish I could find the 15th anniversary box, but it’s sold out everywhere, that would be the closest thing this year I think.
---
I always played on a pvp server, you can stop the angst adhoms dude, it's cringey. Have you never played call of duty, you are trying to put insults of a sexual nature on a pedestal (white knighting is beta), people can tell you to kill yourself in WoW and it isn't suicide harassment, but make a sexual comment and this guy pretends you are mentally unstable. People will say all kinds of nasty things dude, I think this is you slowly realizing you just got caught in my trap and you just keep trying to wiggle out with "you need to get a life because telling a chick she's fat and plays games to get attention is like super ultra meta gigga bad, but spending 6 hours of my day killing one grey player is literally the spirit of the game, Brah."
---
I am honestly curious how you defend what looks like a bias here, I am open to the differences. I've played dota, league, cs, wow, pubg, all toxic. People would Mind control you in classic and call you every racist term in the book, ask if you like being raped like they were doing in the moment, then gank you. So you act like I am unhinged for bringing it up but to me it's all shit I've seen people do and they just have different severity levels, and I would rather have all that shit thrown at me, a gank to pour salt in the wound, then a walk back to my body where I can go back to leveling. 30 minutes of some stupid rogue ganking seems worse to me than all that, and that's just 30 minutes, maybe a thick skin thing.
---
Do you think calling a guy virgin or incel isn't sexual harassment?
---
And this is the issue right? You won't be able to actually see your friends without a lot of hassle?
---
Unyielding Maul and Warden Staff are next to identical in terms of mitigation. For a tanking spec that is forced to use a level 29 weapon half the time, Warden Staff might not be worth the investment.
---
Warden Staff is undeniably bis, but it's a very tiny margin. I forget the exact armor value WS offers over UM but it's in the range of 30-50 additional armor. In most cases that translates to less than 1 point of damage mitigation. On average the difference between UM and WS is indiscernible.
---
It’s not an advantage if it is dispelled and therefore has no effect
---
I loved BC, but in retrospect some of the changes started even then.
---
Both
---
111111111 in plate 
---
111111111 in cloth 
---
😂
---
Unyielding Maul is much less of a downgrade from Warden's Staff than Mark of the Chosen is from Smoking Heart.
---
So if you're choosing between having Unyielding Maul, MotC, and Smoking Heart available to you versus Warden's Staff, Unyielding Maul, and MotC, well that's a no brainer.
---
Look, play the way you want, but if you're heart is set on playing a less than optimal spec for a given role (I know mine is) then double dipping on handicaps by also cutting corners probably isn't going to add up to a happy ending
---
Layering wasnt a thing in classic. Theyre basically splitting people up go save server stress but it sucks having to deal with layers to play with friends.
---
&gt; No, the rule that says Hunters should not use a weapon that’s faster than 3.0 because it ruins their DPS significantly. 
---
There are zero bows that are greater than 2.9 speed.  You say use bows.  You just contradicted yourself.  He says he's OK with crossbows.  Pro Tip, kiddo:  Only Crossbows and Guns (*both of the things he said he was OK with using*) are 3.0 or greater.
---
&gt; I said that if he wants to do raiding he should get the weapon that has the highest effective DPS. Are you willing to embarrass yourself on this front, too?
---
No you didn't, you liar.  Stop changing your story.  You said, I mean, it's right here, I can quote it for you:
---
&gt; &gt;  But if you’re trying to raid (especially higher tier), you’d be handicapping yourself by not taking bows/crossbows. There are almost no good guns past level 50, and ranged weapons are hard to find while leveling, but anything can be done!
---
You say if he wants to be a high tier raider he'll be handicapping himself by using only guns.  You then say there are "almost no good guns past level 50", which is flat out wrong.  Then you say there's some bow that is "the exception to the rule", that somehow the bow is so awesome that you don't need to "**properly thread your auto-attacks in your Aimed Shot/Multishot rotation**".
---
Oh, but it's even better than that:
---
&gt; Not to mention that since your rotation relies on the top damage of the weapon, the faster the weapon the lower the top end damage.
---
Right, so again, bows, which you say are somehow way better than guns, all have lower top end damage than the guns and crossbows of similar ilvl.
---
Go on, pretend you're a master hunter and keep educating us.
---
You can raid heal as else shaman once you get some gear without losing too much throughput.
---
More pve focused tho

I double checked it, and I must have mixed it up with another's tab color

I knew what you were referencing ;)

&gt; his first thought is “it’s the same guy on a different account”. That’s a yikes from me
---
Only you think that.
---
As someone who has played rogue in true vanilla and on pservers, I'd suggest warlock. Easier to find raid/dungeon groups, become absolutely stupid with gear, and despite rogues being good gankers, there is a ton of rogue hate mechanics in vanilla that people will be smart enough to actually use this time around.
---
So you're planning on dumping big gold on the bis mitigation weapon, but also skipping the only mitigation talent in your tree.
---
I'm struggling to see the logic here.
---
Easy, do you want to be a dps or a healer?
---
I got Vanilla a week after orginal release and played all the way through to BC. I’ve wanted classic servers for a decade. I was in the beta and it was the fantastic game I had remembered it being. I had a big stupid grin on my face every time the login screen popped up with the music and even said out loud a few times “what a great fucking game”. So for some people it will live up to the hype.
---
Mage, probably. You’ll be stuck playing Frost until Naxx (Arcane is a meme spec, bosses in MC/BWL are resistant/immune to fire, and you need Frost DPS in AQ for Vic) and your rotation is just spam Frostbolt (PvP is a bit more fun). Pally isn’t viable in PvE unless you’re Holy (Ret and Prot are meme specs, Prot is only useful in Naxx for a single boss) but Ret is insane in PvP if you get Sulfuras
---
Definitely man. That would be fun.
---
It doesn't matter what he intends to do in the game.  Using only a rifle isn't going to significantly gimp him.  If he never wants to step foot in an instance, he can still buy the blue AQ BOE bug gun and be fine for whatever non-instance stuff he wants.
---
If he wants to raid, guess what?  Guns are available in raids.  It doesn't matter what he wants.  He'll be fine.
---
Interesting. Do we have confirmation that it will be included in the new classic? Or it's unknown and this is the concern amongst the community?
---
Youtuber "madseasonshow" did a bunch of great videos on classes, races, and professions just a few month's ago.  I'd personally say to check them out.
---
How is this a hard choice. You want to heal or not?
---
Ew
---
No offense, but weren’t rogues kinda trash tier in TBC?
---
Neither
---
Want to play Warlock. Orc or Gnome.
---
Horde has lots of other Warlocks
---
Alliance has less competition but has to play against WotF.
---
I had Warden Staff on (opposite of south)dale, it dropped in BRD for me, so I am attached to that weapon. I never take thick hide for leveling or tanking five mans, but if I ever did find myself raid tanking I would probably respec into it.
---
As someone once said,

&gt;Farming downvotes are we?
---
OP, what are your thoughts on MH sword with OH dagger?  Does the poison applicaton on a faster offhand make much difference?
---
Side question: do you skip poisons altogether if your goal is to level as fast as possible?
---

Care to point out any recently posted false information?
---
I realize downvotes do nothing, but that facts often make people upset.
---
Absolutely, let me just pull up every guide that has been posted in the last 2 months.
---
Not sure I know what that stands for.
---
.... Those players are 15 years older now lmol
---
As SP said, rep decreases in Classic for grey quests. 
---
Also, pserver rep gain is roughly twice what it was in Vanilla, so don’t expect to be Exalted in time to get 40 mount without a plan.
---
So what is he getting you for your birthday tomorrow?...
---
Are you making fun of yourself? because you're clearly upset...
---
You want to not heal and also not not heal?

It wasn't possible to hide the large box on our doorstep or else I would have got it tomorrow!
---
&gt; 1) I also said that the Hunter quest bow from MC was the exception to the 3.0 attack speed rule.
---
Right, the rule is "don't use anything faster than 3.0 because it's bad with this rotation gimmick you need to do", which you advocate using bows, knowing full well that there are *zero* bows that meet this rule, and that there is **ONE SINGLE BOW IN THE WHOLE GAME** that is worth using, but you tell him he'll have problems if he wants to use "guns and crossbows".

That makes sense.  I must have not been online when the firsts hit originally.  You on Twitch?

probably sinking time into everything but BWL..
---
Maybe then next time you come across incorrect information, post something in that thread.
---
&gt;Thoughts?
---
I mean they have already made significant changes to layering a la the cooldown so it's not really a big leap to assume they are iterating on it still.
---
This is a good idea
---
I played the beta until 40 and felt everything you said youre worried about not experiencing.
---
Thats not how it works. You dont NEED it. You WANT it to sell. So they have have a roll for people that want to sell it and a roll for people that want to use it. People that can use it for a upgrade roll need. You roll greed.
---
If no one needs it you are all suppose to hit greed and see who can have it to sell. This is common etiquette.
---
Abusing the system you are deemed a ninja. Most of the time it doesnt matter but you do it enough guilds will avoid you and it will be a painn
---
You can do the same as horde just throwing all the alliance looking to do RFK/RFD off the great lift as its your territory and you can initiate PvP on anyone coming from that flight path off of feralas.
---
I read the manuals while I was installing in my old pc.
---
It was great.

No, you're just dumb.

---
Source? For a rumor?? Lol if you mean where did I heard the rumor I saw it in Esfands Discord
---
i hope so, it needs to be looked over. Its a bit "broken" atm, i mean if i can swap layering somehow and end up on a spot where there are less people or more "gathering". Im doing this always on every location.

HAHA

I heard they were planning on giving crusader strike to paladins.

You're ridiculous.  Guilds don't stop hunters from using guns.

I have an idea for the future 4DC's. Don't sticky-post them! :)
---
Are you trying to brag that you can tell what information is true or not? I’m just confused as to what the point of this thread is.
---
BRD my dudes, clear my schedule.
---
Ahhhh good old KJ. I raided with a few guilds , the best being Sardaukar. I had to step away for family stuff but let former guildies use my priest while I was away. When I came back they had kinda fallen apart as main leaders had to quit. But hey we formed a new guild called Fraternitus Adamantius for BC. Good memories. Those pink tabards.....freaking Cracki lol
---
What about a 60 page long guide
---
Yes im trying to brag, yep you got it.
---
I would rather be in his than yours.
---
How does the weekly decay work? People who don't show up slowly decay in rank?
---
I’ve been in 4 loot council guilds in my life, I’ve never been in the loot council myself, and I’ve had zero complaints. 
---
All these horror stories of the council “giving fear to their friends” sounds like misrepresented situations where “their friends” are actually valuable raid members who show up all the time. 
---
I’ve seen very few documented cases of loot council abuse, or at least ones where that’s occurred and the guild hasn’t immediately collapsed.
---
Can't decide between nelf or human for my warrior. Humans are just so derpy. But the weapon skill and rep gains sound really good.
---
Had to be either that or you’re trolling with how dumb this post is lmao
---
There was alliance on that server? 
---
The balance was so bad there, I could only imagine
---
Now you're just makin' me hot and sweaty
---
No.
---
Yeah I used to play on Hyjal up until a few weeks in WotLK and even after FoH left people would always attribute Ony and Nef buffs in Org to FoH as a running joke. We'd all shout "Thanks FoH" at every turn in.
---
My first character was an orc.  I named him Hamfist after a mercenary you can hire in the SNES Shadowrun game.
---
If you can't understand something, that doesn't automatically make it trolling, or dumb. Maybe you just aren't smart enough to figure it out?
---
LBRS dies off pretty damn quickly.
---
Your argument has now devolved into speaking for guild leaders/raid leaders/class leaders and assuming they’re all gonna be fine with someone doing significantly lower DPS because they don’t like a certain aesthetic... OK. Sure, some people will be fine with it, which is why I said using guns is doable, but it’s not ideal and STILL WILL SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER YOUR DAMAGE. Are you done being stupid now?
---
You: Guns are impossible to use!
---
Me: lol gunz are teh best
---
You: Wrong! PEW PEW LAZERBOW!
---
Guy: Gatekeeping!
---
You: You don't understand the term gatekeeping.
---
OtherGuy:  Gatekeeping is...
---
You: I don’t mind when people ask questions or offer ideas/opinions, as long as they’re kind about it and willing to learn. But this guy tried to tell me I was wrong without 
---
Do you follow now?  Some guy accuses you of gatekeeping, you think it's me because I gave you a list of stuff.
---
&gt; Though I did just discover the Stress Test IS actually being delayed, so there’s that
---
Wow. Crazy. Did you hear that when they [announced it a day ago?](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-date/227573)
---
Ok in that case, DP shadow guard and all those spells aren’t advantages either because they will be instantly dispelled as well.  Also shamans aren’t an advantage either because they will be instantly cc’d and stun by every mage and rogue around you.  
---
Your scenarios are more than unrealistic.  Also, if you were smart you would use fear reactively.  
---
When you make a post like this try not to sound so biased where one side will be playing perfectly and the other side won’t be.  It’s just dumb

This whole conversation is you getting butthurt because I showed you a list of items saying "You'll be fine if you use guns, see here are guns that are on par with crossbows and bows."
---
I got you
---
What are you trying to get people understand? That sometimes information that people post on here may be incorrect? Thanks buddy, I’m sure myself and everybody else that stumbles upon this will be very enlightened by your insight!
---
Honestly there are too many variables for a good answer. How big of a headstart does the mage have? Who had the more recent Frostbolt skill up vs Backstab skill up? Are one of you more over geared than the other? How are your stats allocated? Is the mage moving as part of his kiting(not always casting)? Etc
---
My advice is go backstab and play with threat management. Its a skill that will always be useful and likely lead to better duo kill speed if optimized. Will you never pull aggro off the mage? Doubtful.
---
Combo: Clicked the wrong flight path, now too broke to take the right one.

Not that I've ever done that or anything...

I think it will be equally rare on both sides tbh

Might be a little more difficult in your case, but i'm sure you'll figure it out eventually.
---
Legit, HoH was full of great guys that were pretty much up for anything, they caused a lot of chaos on Earthen Ring and everyone was always entertained by it.
---
Convince one of them to play shaman = problem solved
---
That is some sound logic right there \^.\^
---
maybe your not killin enough boars
---
That's a pretty good point. There's always room for alts and stuff. Like I said, different strokes for different folks.
---
ya i'm not going to miss that
---
&gt; How are you connecting these dots?
---
You mentioned me in direct reply to the person explaining to you what gatekeeping was.

Alliance &gt; horde

As a priest mind controlling people off moving boats is a great way to pass time

I couldn’t give a flying fuck about petty faction rivalries. Grow up
---
&gt; the 100% protection warrior they can trust
---
Considering Fury Warriors hold aggro much better than Prot Warriors while leveling—and that most of the Prot talent tree is made for end-game raiding and not 5-mans or leveling—I don't think you'll be inspiring much trust.
---
No. I read it today when someone was kind enough to link me that same post.
---
Invite him to a party. it will put you both on the same layer.
---
Alliance = Republicans
---
Ah so you're an Undead Rogue I can see
---
Fear Ward is strong, most raids in Eastern Kingdom, and Pally&gt;Shaman. BUT I’m also a day 1 alliance player, so I’m biased. That being said, play what you enjoy
---
By nightsaber he means the NE mount, in which you need rep with Darnassus. The winterspring frostsaber is unfortunately the repeatable quests which can be tedious.

but Frostmourne wasn’t in Classic....

---
Gotta clear naxx to get it... but it’s there
---
&gt;  leveling up to get to those recipes is going to cost you a lot, and arguably at the worst possible time.
---
For leather it comes pretty soon and they're taught by the trainer I think, but you're right. Every minute spend crafting the things for a measly 50copper profit each, is a minute you could have been grinding at 60.   
---
 
---
Maybe the crafting makes 5 silver a minute, being generous and not taking into account the downtime, going for more thread etc 
---
At 60 I believe you can make more than 5 silver a minute.   
---
Might feel cool for some players though, with plenty of people willing to offload entire packfuls of leather to them out in the field for vendor price, or a little extra. A crafters dream!
---
Haha troll priest actually
---
If the rest of the post is anything like the TLDR - I have no idea what the hell you’re talking about.
---
Horde is more of a brotherhood alliance is more of a get the job done and never speak to each other again kind of thing
---
Yeah it sucks, gotta hearth or try to escape on foot.
---
Goes infinitely. Adding and removing players. New players get placed at the bottom. Others have mentioned the possibility of having new players roll for position, but the guild I was in just stuck you at the bottom.

I have a feeling that OP thinks he can raid as Ret.

Resto druids are great in 1v1 but they don't deal alot of damage. They are like the spoon killers of wow
---
Tiny towns I drive through in ultra-rural areas.  Some make good character names.

My man!
---
Back when I leveled, I used to do both of these quest chains. I'd finish one and then regrind the other back to neutral and do that chain too. It took for fucking ever and was completely stupid but I thought I was being cool.
---
Rouge stealthing and messing with people using /e.

or catch up to lowbies for a gank while in stealth:

---
/e asks for you to wait    
---
/e tries frantically to get your attention

/e is begging you to wait    
---
if you get a bite they will stop/slow down long enough for you to stealth up to them and gank, it's just more satisfying that way then /laugh    
---
    
---
Also, especially for Taurens on mounts, try to run over an NPC in a Neutral goblin city if someone looks like they're about to click it and if you're lucky let the guards to thier work
---
Barrens, 1kN, Desolace, Stonetalon, Durotar, Arathi, Badlands, Ashenvale Azshara and Felwood

That is a particularly persuasive argument...

Your friends are choosing Alliance because they don't think Horde are as viable in PVE? Try reminding them that Horde got world first clears of 4 out of 5 Vanilla raids and that nearly all the recognized Pserver speedrun records are Horde.
---
I was going to go to bed. Now I’m going to play WoW.
---
I don’t have any resources for you, but wanted to wish you luck. Speed running is a great personal challenge for gaming. There is so much in WoW you can do/prepare for to improve your time, you should have a blast getting ready. You will want to make sure your UI and key binds are squared away so you can go hard asap. Grab a questing addon (probably questie). You will want to make a plan for server launch. We don’t know for sure how layering will change things up. It’s possible you can quest, but might have to grind/leave the noob areas ASAP. If people are willing to help you in the very beginning it could mean a big boost for you. 
---
If you can get clear of the pack, try to get on the most efficient questing route you can. Joana is a known commodity at this point, so it’s a reasonable starting place. 
---
Seems like you are going hunter, so make some notes about early ranged weapon progression. In addition, figure out what you are taking as your first pet and where they spawn in your starter zone.
---
I always level up a resto druid second and make a point to farm the greater protection potion recipes as a solid gold maker.
---
Clearly
---
Mute/Kishkumen was the rtzk guy.
---
Back in early days Cancer, Crooklyn Clan, and Gimped (turned into TG) were the best guilds on the server besides Aurora. Pyre was always up there, too.
---
I mean... when classic launches every pserver is going to be a ghost town. I feel like they’re doing a lot of work for nothing.
---
There was quite a few on my server,  alot of guilds were doing naxx.  
---
I was a pvper so I didn't want to join one but had I wanted to. Perhaps lighting strike on lightnings blade.
---
I completely forgot about the shockadin spec.  I was horde and most pvp focused I assume it wasn't considered a raid viable spec?
---
I level solo because i can generally do it faster by myself. I’m all for group content though. My main focus is hardcore raiding.
---
you can interpret it how you want, but there is clearly a pattern with this, and for me those results do confirm the common consensus that alliance is easier
---
Don't remember because they were a hardcore guild, Alliance side on Scarlet Crusade. I remember seeing an amazing Paladin by the name of Sigon in Ironforge, just sitting there, alone. I could tell he was frustrated, because the guild didn't allow anyone else in and more people were reaching the point where they were ready to raid. 
---
So I took it upon myself to begin pulling many friends and aquaintences of small guilds together. Meeting with all the guild masters and forming the guild Eternal with them. I didn't stay long and lead for long, as I was always a lone wolf type. The guild persisted for many years after that and was successful, was proud to have brought everyone together and started them on the journey.
---
Something something proc per minute. Just look for a fast oh sword. Remember the offhand sword will proc a main hand swing with sword spec.
---
brb re-reading foundation series
---
Yeah just realized I fucked up the title. I play d&amp;d, and the equivalent class is called tht ranger, so I kinda auto typed it.
---
easier =/= better. It's easier to ride a bike than it is to fly an airplane, but one is clearly an inferior method of travel.

---
On my vanilla druid I know I've had all of skinning, leatherworking, herbalism, mining, enchanting, tailoring (lol), and blacksmith (for fear trinket). I never did engineering because I had that on my first alt, a hunter.
---
This go around I'm starting skinning/enchanting, and I'm not going to necessarily rush enchanting, but consider some other advantages:
---
Druid can day 1 at level 60 solo mother smolderweb for blues. That's some easy shards, wildheart spaulders, etc.
---
Probably with a rogue's help until you're geared a bit you can kill the tauren firecaster in BRD for fiery enchant. You might be able to sell those for a decent pickup until people are grabbing crusader.
---
Smoking heart is a one time gold sink at worst. At best you might be the first person that can actually sell some decent enchants early.
---
Personally professions for my main I already know are going to take a while. I intend to go through all the steps and get the BS trinket and full engineering eventually as well.
---
It was pretty nice grinding BGs with instant queues
---
Shout out to RET, Sold Out, Security on Ally side.
---
This brings a tear to my eye.
---
This is at least 30% of the reason I'm playing a lock again.
---
I played with a small group of friends from Vanilla &gt; WoTLK then pretty much solo from there on out. I am trying to convince one of my friends to play again, but not sure how it pans out. I plan on jumping in anyways, but will try to find a guild to make some new memories.
---
In loot council it can be a factor. It’s usually a small one though. Usually a tie breaker if one is needed. Why would you reward a mage who does crap dps instead of the one who has the right spec and consumables?
---
Exactly, I've been playing throughout all of WoD, Legion, and BFA (and before but that's not relevant) and enjoying them. I can't wait for Classic, but it's just DIFFERENT. I'll abandon Retail for Classic only to give myself the investment I want for Classic, I'll be back, I'll always be back.
---
I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm mildly addicted to his channel. His experience with Classic WoW pretty closely mirrors mine.
---
Thank you, have a great day!
---
Nobodies raided in vanilla recently dumbass, the game isnt even out yet
---
It’s hard to raid lead as a tank when all you can see are. The bosses legs.
---
So suicide kings in terms of "there's a batting order" but otherwise closer to epgp?
---
The one ring vs. Frostmourne: which will corrupt Bilbo first?
---
Just remind them that vanilla is so easy that it's kind of like comparing the difficulty of punching through a wet paper towel vs punching through a wet piece of toilet paper.
---
I hope he bring that same energy August 27th
---
During the real vanilla era you saw a lot of begging for new servers all the time because those people wanted to be the first capped players on a PVP server so they could shit on everybody else.
---
your points are your currency and you pay the raid with them. any suicide costs all your points and everyone gets a share.
---
Fusion - Turalyon
---
And?  Spellbinder was a thing from the beginning of time.  The game is back, warts and all.  That's what people wanted.  We were dealing with all this same stuff back in vanilla.
---
The evidence is right there on progression, every single first end bosses happened ~3months of time after raid released, comparing to the rest of the raid that usually get down during the first week of release. that means that those bosses needed dedication, organization and for some of them nerfing. Needing 3 month of tries to kil la boss has nothing to do with raid composition, what you needed was preparation and people doing good execution. To go further i really think that if you swapped all the guilds horde&lt;-&gt;alliance you would see nihilium most of first down including end bosses
---
Shit healer.
---
Took OSRS like 3 or 4 years for their game to get a separate category so maybe
---
This sounds like fed a bulimic terms from zero sum systems and used whatever didn't fit down the drain.
---
I guess I don't really know enough to say what I want to do in the game yet. Most likely I'll follow my friends' leads to start with and figure it out from there. 
---
I read somewhere that guns in the game aren't as good as bows, but I don't know enough to directly compare the weapon stats, so I wanted to see if they were significantly worse or just suboptimal for hardcore min maxers.
---
Seems like I'll be fine focusing on guns as I level up, then when I get to higher level play, I'll need to think about swapping into whatever I have that's more optimized.
---
Good old tabloid Australian "Journalism". This was the same show that got done multiple times reporting 100% fake stories because they didn't fact check anything.
---
In my opinion mages are one of the most usefull dungeons dps classes out there. Their AOE slows and freezes can REALLY help out in bad dungeon situations. And in dungeons you mainly use frostbolt but there are lots of opportunity for aoe
---
i heard they will be on some of the services like Spotify soon, presumably for their new upcoming album release.
---
Good luck and have fun doing it. Even if most posts on this are negative, I believe in you!
---
Thanks!
---
It will most likely be pretty equal. why do you want it to be so rare though? Or do you?
---
Bad hunters maybe?
---
belt of ten storms is listed as phase 1
---
RemindMe! 3 days
---
Sure leave out sunken temple, the best in slot piece of loot for each class prior to 60 is shit anyway who needs it? (the feathers quest).
---
You also left out RFD, which is very good for 2 pieces of plate at 40, and quests like sword of serenity that each rogue and fury warrior will need.
---
This person hasn’t played the game 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
late game crossbows are the best for hunters but this is probably a lot further on than you need to worry about
---
it's just suboptimal, but hunter is already the lowest dps of any of the pure classes so being suboptimal is not fantastic, but it isn't going to exclude you from doing anything besides the literal last content in the game
---
We don't know for certain what the MC and Onyxia loot tables will be in Phase 1.

#  &lt;Hope Rises&gt; - casual-friendly/“mediumcore” - 1 raid/week
---
Greetings, travelers!
---
Do you love Classic WoW as much as the “hardcore” and “semi-hardcore” crowd, but want or need to enjoy the game with more freedom to play how and when you like? If so, then we may be a great fit for you!
---
&lt; Hope Rises &gt; is a guild I founded back in 2014 on the principles of positivity, loyalty, and freedom. Though our Mythic team eventually transferred for greener servers in Legion, the guild will be getting a rez for Classic and we plan to keep those same guiding principles intact! As such, we already have a stable core of players confirmed to return who are highly loyal and dedicated to the guild’s long-term success. In conjunction with our founding principles, these are our guild’s disctinctives:

* Though some of us will be putting hardcore hours into Classic, we will ***“officially” raid just once per week on Tuesdays (+50 wife points)!*** **Raid time: 8 or 9 pm Central start time (we'll decide as a guild, but so far it's looking more like 8 than 9), raids will last 3-4 hours as needed.** ***UPDATE: See the postscript for more details, but*** [we currently have 53 players signed up for the Tuesday night raids](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_7zCyD74nEueXlbdWDsF3tvoJM0vEUAMB-15rmF9dt0/edit?usp=sharing)***. We made this list to protect our values of leveling more slowly so that players don't feel like they have to level and gear ASAP or risk losing their raid slot. What this means practically for you is one of three things:***
---
1. You are willing to gamble on a spot opening up on Tuesdays and don't mind not being "guaranteed" a spot.
---
2. You don't really want to raid a lot anyway.
---
3. If you miss a Tuesday spot, you don't mind raiding on Saturday in our semi-guild, semi-PUG group (see below). This group will essentially always have raid spots available, and it is designed to give players greater flexibility in their schedules.
---
* We will also have optional raids on Saturdays at roughly the same times as the official Tuesday raids (again, we will choose as a guild)
---
* It is a priority for us that we all have the freedom to show up to raids (particularly early on) with a suboptimal or PvP spec so long as everyone is also willing to change to a more meta role if the raid becomes stonewalled or profoundly inefficient because of it (this will likely only be necessary way down the line — like AQ-40 to Naxx).
---
* We will select a well-populated PvP server that does not have any major streamers on it.
---
* Many (but not all!) of us want to savor Classic at a calm but steady pace (though pure speculation, I envision most of us being raid-ready approximately 3-4 months after launch, which averages out to about 2-2.5 hours /played per day). A few of us will still no-life it. :)
---
* We will also have numerous casual members whose primary interests will be leveling alts, playing the AH, farming gold, etc., so there should always be guildies to level with at your own pace.
---
Many of us have raided for years at a competitive Mythic level in retail WoW. Though we are a competent group looking forward to crushing PvP and raiding through Naxx, enjoyment of each other’s company and the mostly laid-back nature of Vanilla endgame is our top priority. If you are impatient, easily frustrated, or are seeking a “world-first” (lol), cutting-edge, every-world-buff-is-mandatory hardcore raiding experience, then our guild is not for you. If, however, you jive with our vision of Classic and would like to join the family, or would simply like more information, feel free to comment here or **DM me on Discord (Oleon#2355).**
---
Thanks, everybody! Hope to see y’all in Azeroth!
---
\~ Oleon
---
P.S.:
---
Since we have grown very quickly in recent weeks, we have created a Raid Census Form whereby aspiring raiders can fill out their desired roles and hold a soft “reservation” on a Tuesday raid slot when we begin officially raiding 3-4 months after launch (this is a moderate tempo of about 2-2.5 hours per day, 9 days total /played to 60). This reservation list serves two purposes: it protects current guildies from the pressure of competition as the guild grows (which allows us to achieve our stated goals of enjoying the game in a friendly and active community, while leveling at a steady but unpressured pace), and it gives newcomers into the guild clear and upfront information as to where they stand in the raid roster. That said, if a player hasn’t reached 60 by the 3-4 month mark, then their raid slot will be vacated. Many guilds will be intentionally overrecruiting for Classic knowing that not all of their raiders will make it to 60. A player might join a guild that lacks our same transparency and still ultimately find themselves on the outside looking in. We feel that this system allows us to achieve our goals, protect our players, and also be as upfront and clear as possible with any newcomers. We are not min/maxing the roster, but a general estimate would be 4-5 tanks, 11-13 healers, and 22-25 DPS. The roster will adapt within these ranges as needed based on the players who sign up first.
---
Here's a link to a [live-updating spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_7zCyD74nEueXlbdWDsF3tvoJM0vEUAMB-15rmF9dt0/edit?usp=sharing) with the current roster list for your convenience.

\&gt; Now: legendary twitch stream "Lonely Virgin" streams 16 hours a day, is number one WoW player and earns six figures a year on twitch. 
---
Still a virgin though.
---
Why is it a warrior grind spot? Low armor mobs right?
---
Lower unless there are good proc-based weps out there that also benefit from +spell dam to the extent that you'd prefer wearing a set of cloth caster gear, at which point your Shadow Oil procs are slamming for like 300 damage a pop.
---
Sure we do, Ion specifically mentioned it in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641).
---
Thank you so much. I had forgotten about the soulbound gear. I’ve passed all this info along to my brother. I’m really excited about playing classic. :)
---
Still here and waiting for launch. I don't care about server first or how efficient my levelling is. I just want to level slowly and enjoy the zones and stop to smell the peacebloom.
---
I feel like back then by the time the guilds got to AQ40 they were using really specific and structured loot systems where everything was essentially determined on a case by case basis depending on attendance / performance / how it would help the guild as a whole progress. 
---
Vanilla was so rife with drama and shenanigans that a guild who successfully got to aq40 already had it so put together that most of them had moved on from shit like DKP which had a lot of issues. Definitely if they got past huhuran. Aq20 was mostly casual.
---
Haven't seen them in years with uBlock Origin running.
---
My experience in Vanilla WoW was much different than yours.
---
The only real grief I got from anyone were those players that would corpse camp me in wPvP.  I did my fair share of camping those that deserved it too, like those who grieved others, so I guess it all balanced out.
---
Every now and then there would be some d'bag in a dungeon who would run their mouth off if you or someone else made a mistake.  They usually had no patience and would eventually leave the group/instance after several wipes; after which the group happily found a replacement.  I would also put the toxic player on ignore, even if their drivel wasn't directed towards me.  People like that were far and few between instances.
---
When I was raiding with the guild, I never saw the guild become toxic at any one point in time.  People would make mistakes, the raid would wipe, and it wasn't a huge issue.  There was one player in the guild who didn't speak or understand English very well.  During a raid this person would sometimes make a mistake as a result, and sometimes the same mistake was made repeatedly.  Some would get frustrated about it every once in a great while, but it never became a problem to the point where people were hating on this player.  We all understood the situation.
---
The only animosity I ever really felt was towards the opposite faction.  Gotta love wPvP! I can't wait! :)
---
Yeah, if you're a soloer then pick a PvE server. World PvP in WoW always was a complete fucking joke anyways given how heavily gear reliant the game is. It's a ganker/griefer heaven.
---
Do you allow yourself trading with other players? If so then at least you can grind gold and buy stuff from the AH. If you're going solo "untwinked", that's where things get really tricky because of the stupid 2 professions limit.
---
ya ya sure, dwarf priests are great in PvE ooooOoo, and undead/trolls are great in pvp WoooW. But you know what's really OP.
---
People make fun of night elf priests. They don't realize their true potential of just sitting there at the BRM entrance waiting to purge shadowmelded, with their dark, beady eyes. a single purge, then back into the shadows. this man's day is ruined.
---
I started WoW in TBC so I know next to nothing about vanilla/classic.
---
Want to play Heal but can't decide which class.
---
Either Female Dwarf Paladin, since it was my main back in the day (even though B-Elf) for a new experience with levelling Alliance and because I think they look kinda cute.
---
Undead Priest, because that is my favourite combo in terms of looks
---
 or 
---
Orc shaman, as a class that I have never healed on (played enhancement mostly).
---
After reading a little bit I know that leveling as a Paladin can turn out to be a slog. But I enjoy the challenge, but because of their Buffs are relatively sought after.
---
Priests as the main healer in vanilla gives me a spot in 5 man and Raids, and I remember healing in 5 man while leveling as a shadow Priest ( were you able to do it in vanilla or I'd it something that was introduced with TBC?)
---
And shaman has totems which I think would make leveling an running dungeons a breeze? Sorry don't know anything about shamans.
---
I'm basically turn between those three, as I can't see that dungeons and Raids would be a problem for either class, at least when it comes to getting a spot.
---
Oh one more thing, I don't care about PvP I'm playing PvE exclusively.
---
Don’t they have a new album coming out in August?
---
That's not confirmation, that's him giving his expectations and not really being sure.
---
Sheeping npc’s people are attacking

Hold up there- you've significantly changed the scope of your original statement:  Programs are an entirely different can of worms.  Programs are programs; they can do anything.  Moving on:
---
It is incredibly, epic-ally inefficient to distribute cryptographic mining over javascript via a web browser to the point that nobody is going to be doing it: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/42294/javascript-bitcoin-miner-is-it-even-worth-it
---
It's possible.  It can be done.  However, it is neither malicious nor effective.  Nobody is doing it.  It's basically a tech demo that received a bunch of press from clickbait websites that are sensationalizing the practice (like cnet).  
---
If someone is using your machine to mine bitcoins- wait, hold on: If someone is using your browser to mine bitcoins, then, even if they magically found a way that was at all worth it, then you're also going to be able to fry an egg on your heat sink because it's going to be absolute blasphemous bitmangling on par with the arcane insanity of the old gods.
---
Agreed.
---
Right? I'm so curious what he actually wants to do.
---
I love starting solo and just meeting who you meet along the way. Then whatever guild you end up in. I think its how it was meant to be played
---
Interesting, wonder when they added that. Any videos of it being tested? Just curious because we've all seen the mining node, log out, log in one from earlier in the beta.
---
What do you take instead of thick hide? Imp. motw?
---
I don't think there is anything else to get.
---
there's nothing wrong with it. just like there is nothing wrong stopping at level 10 and RPing for a year. if thats what you wanna do, go for it
---
Already fixed.
---
probably rogue because of wotf, but i wouldnt let it deter me
---
also warlock pets , warlock DOTing the CC target . its something about them hating mage " Dont DOT the SHEEP ".
---
I've been on the lookout but haven't seen one. If you start it let me know lol.
---
Ahhh.. that familiar Vent PTT.... I miss it.
---
Was just after stress test 2 I think, Tipsout talked about it in some of his videos.
---
We still exist (though back to our original name, The Squirrel Mafia) on Stormrage!
---
Sentinel hill always made sense to me when you think about the larger storyline of Westfall and how the whole area is falling apart.
---
Goldshire should probably be bigger though.
---
You have to get a smoothie to eat and drink at the same time.
---
Fantastic, thanks for the heads up :)
---
Shockadin isn't really a 'spec' - it's just someone that has 31pt holy. So really any healing pally is shockadin spec. The thing that made it a thing was 5pc 2.5 + shard of the fallen star + spell power trinket. This gave you enough spellpower and 2 do high burst damage one every three minutes, which was just really funny as a paladin.    
---
It's essentially a gimick in the same line as reckbomb. Just something to do to surprise people in pvp and make a clip of. It doesn't have any use in PvE.
---
Did they make a blue post about this? or are you just guessing?
---
My group is a spellcleave ranged aoe group which isn't really gear dependent compared to a melee group.  If your group has some useful pieces to grab from RFD or even if you just want to do it then you should.  These are my notes for my group and I'm sharing them so that other people might be able to draw something from it for their own groups.  Thanks for the info though and I hope other groups will take it into consideration.
---
I'm in the same situation as you u/cfults1, let me know if you find anything! My friend and I are both looking to raid on Chinese servers in english (the game and client is completely in english, but finding guilds etc is difficult). I've heard there are players on retail on Arygos (亚雷戈斯）in a guild called TCW, but i haven't logged on recently to check. I'm thinking about asking them.
---
No shit? I think I tried to get into a pug run once with your guild by pretending to be a girl,didn’t go well when you asked me to join ventrilo.
---
They don't make blue posts or release patch notes for the beta. One day the bug was there and the next day it wasn't.
---
Silverpine was okay, Azshara was dumb.
---
If you weren't prepared to read then why did you bother commenting?
---
Referencing something no-one has heard of does not make a good meme.
---
Someone listened to Countdown to Classic this week....
---
Thats uh... from WOTLK - The Vanilla equivalent is a Crossbow ( [https://www.wowhead.com/item=22812/nerubian-slavemaker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=22812/nerubian-slavemaker) )
---
You won't get anywhere near enough materials to get your Enchanting up to 265 on a normal leveling route,. You might end up with \~100-150 Enchanting before you out-level it (i.e. your quest rewards/drops will disenchant into mats that you can't use yet) unless you REALLY slow yourself down and go out of your way to grind out more mats.
---
Here's the efficient (but painful) way to farm everything yourself:
---
1. Pick a gathering profession.
---
2. Level to 60. Gather along the way.
---
3. Drop gathering profession. Pick up Enchanting.
---
4. Solo low level dungeons. Disenchant everything.
---
5. Use the mats to reach 265 Enchanting and craft your trinket. 
---
Druids are pretty good at soloing things so you can do this as soon as you hit 60. No need to wait for better gear.
---
The other option is to just buy the skill. You might have \~200 gold when you reach 60. I'm not sure what prices will look like on your server but I imagine that will buy you most, if not all of what you need. You can earn back that 200 gold more quickly than it takes you to farm all of the mats yourself.
---
In Live, you're able to add the "overrideArchive" cvar to  your config.wtf to use the Chinese models on other clients. I believe you might need the WoW Chinese language pack installed by going into the b.net settings for WoW, setting it to Chinese and letting it download, and then switch back, but it's possible and I use it myself.
---
It's $15/mo. You could easily get that collecting cans for recycling (not sure if the UK has the can deposit though). 
---
Otherwise, mow like.. a single lawn once a month. Maybe two back then, depending on how modest you were with prices and the size of the yard.
---
I did this starting at starting at like 12 with a cell phone to talk to my GF.
---
It was an extremely popular meme, what are you talking about? Just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean everyone else hasn't either.
---
&gt;not using adblock
---
lmao this guy
---
I mean... Technically it was.... You just couldn't get to Northrend where Arthas was chillin'.... Pun intended....
---
That's ok, just one would do.
---
Hey fair enough if you were in the beta to check that's good someone did, because I couldn't and just wanted to make sure it wasn't going to make it to launch day
---
Being an ignorant casual is not something to be proud of FYI
---
If you know you want to switch to DPS and remain silent while the guild provides you with a Thunderfury you are kind of an asshole.
---
DH in classic confirmed!
---
This is the proper terminology.
---
What happened to the first 6 layers ?
---
I hope so. Hopefully more receptive than they are during the BFA beta lmao
---
salvation
---
Smooth brain take
---
as already stated but has to be stressed - healer or dpser, you won't get anywhere as ret pala or tank pala raidwise forget about it unless you already have guild that will let you meme spec from time to time (mind respec cost) so your choices are:
---
1) pvp + dungeons pala
---
2) raid healer pala wholesome for pvp too
---
3) mage dps raid/pvp
---
There will not be cross server dungeons or raids in classic...no lfg or lfr either
---
It will be much better
---
Is not a damage increase. It just makes things easier, but does not increase potential.
---
&gt; Hold up there- you've significantly changed the scope of your original statement: Programs are an entirely different can of worms. Programs are programs; they can do anything.

How? I gave another example of people using you to mine without your consent.

&gt; It is incredibly, epic-ally inefficient to distribute cryptographic mining over javascript via a web browser to the point that nobody is going to be doing it: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/42294/javascript-bitcoin-miner-is-it-even-worth-it

Your own source even states that it could be worth it. Lul. That source is also 1 year behind before browser mining news 'broke'. 
---
&gt; It's possible. It can be done. However, it is neither malicious nor effective. Nobody is doing it. It's basically a tech demo that received a bunch of press from clickbait websites that are sensationalizing the practice (like cnet).

Nah, again, you are wrong. People **are** doing it.

So what sources are okey according to you?

Orc shaman or tauren shaman ?
---
Hey whos aug is this
---
The other thing with healing as shadow is that once you respec to holy, healing will fell a lot easier in comparison
---
Frostmourne is WotlK
---
I would agree, if u didnt make arguments or pose questions. But the feller above u did quite well in making an argument and explaining himself.
---
the limiting factor of damage output in vanilla was tank threat (there is a reason that fury war spec exists). so less threat mean more damage therefor increased potential
---
Thank you for the link. It was definitely a description I don't think many people that have experienced the changes first hand would disagree with. I also appreciate the comment on it about the change from nobody doing heroic things to a hero doing nothing. I'll definitely dive into more of those comments when I have more time.
---
even in dkp guilds they usually say you cant spend points for gear you can't equip, or gear you can equip *badly.* A hunter taking thunderfury is as bad as a mage rolling on flat + healing gear.
---
I still have my physical copies up to Pandaria, as a trophy
---
/r/outside
---
Your website has pop ups &amp; adds and shit  all fucking over it.
---
The publisher's summary is very descriptive.
---
**Publisher's Summary**
---
What if you and your friends got to live the game for real? What if you and your friends were assholes?
---
No, you can remove threat as the threshold for damage output by using a feral or fury tank, which requires more from your healers but allows for all the DPS increases of the Horde without caring about salvation. That you think threat was the limiting factor of damage output in Vanilla shows you have no fucking clue what you're talking about.
---
Basically: Blizzard gave us tools that many of us felt changed the game but blaming only Blizzard isn't conducive to recreating the experience as we decided how to use them.
---
Troll shadow priest or mage?
---
A shitload of people know about this meme... guess you’re just out of the loop.
---
I say frostmourne.
---
Thelsamar was a Shire ripoff
---
you're exactly proving my point...
---
both are good. Troll shadow priest is more niche for raiding though. That may be a bonus or not
---
IMO orc, but tauren shaman will be more rare, plus warstomp is cool
---
You don’t have to do any of that even as a raider for like 80% of the raids m8. It is all about the guild you find, if it is hardcore or casual, and the casual ones are more numerous. Don’t let elitist stuff cloud your perception of what the game has to offer like that
---
Yeah, because YouTube is where people track speedruns. /s
---
I'm done arguing in circles with you. Alliance don't have the same maximum PVE potential as Horde.
---
I wouldn't change a thing. I loved and hated so much about it. It all equaled out.
---
I don't change a thing.
---
Honestly think with the duel tournaments hosted by various big name Twitch streamers and them showing how to abuse Layering and the Leeway mechanic a lot of people are just turned off already and lost interest.
---
I want to see Classic succeed but from the streamers showing the beta like they have... it is pretty obvious that it is not ready for release and Aug 27th is not enough time.
---
rep gain is better for mage do nozdormu grind for ring. i dont think theres any bis or near bis gear for warriors from rep. weapon skill is deffinetly a big bonus to consider. you can get edgeguards to +7weap skill but thtose can be espensive. Id say if you want to get the most out of your warrior go human if you want to raid alot and go Nelf for the stealth warrior lulz if you prefer pvp. Personally intend to have a stealthed warrior in the flagroom myself.
---
Pacifists and banana syndicate on kel thuzad
---
Rukys because I'm a huge Wu Tang fan, and the idea of a fury warrior screaming "Bring tha mothafuckin Rukys" tickles me pink.
---
If you make a pure tank build, then you get Thick Hide for sure. 
---
If you make a hybrid build that grabs cat talents + Omen of Clarity or healing talents (IMO the more effective way to play) then Thick Hide is the first thing you drop. It's not a great return for 5 talent points. You still have more armor than Warriors by a mile even without it.
---
AHAHA , so at the end you're just full of bull, not a single piece of evidence, not valuable arguing, just angry angry. Kudos to you
---
Don't think it is is just layering they are working on getting right....
---
They can make twitch use battle net auth to chat on the overwatch stream, but not make them 
---
have retail and classic in the same category?
---
No flying ever.
---
No lfr tool.
---
No paid transfers/name changes.
---
Keep making more "bad" items in raid environments and less standardized itemization like mandatory sets.
---
No, you've had multiple opportunities to see the folly in your argument and refuse. Your answer to Windfury is Salvation. ROFL.

As someone who always just enjoyed the lvling process i hate heirlooms and the power creep that has worked into lvling there is nothing dangerous anymore the days of accidentally pulling to much and dying was part of the game i miss.
---
Invictus and Myst on Alexstrasza for alliance.  Onyx for horde.
---
Invictus and Myst were always competing to be the best PvE guild and Onyx was just really into PvP.  Saw a lot of them on my warrior in the BGs.  
---
I eventually got into Invictus as a tank but I didn’t like how they treated you like they were doing me a HUGE favour by letting me in.  They tried charging me the gold for the disenchanted items I would get in the raid and after that I was like see ya later.  Everyone’s there to help and contribute and at the time they needed an offtank and I had a lot of MT experience through MC/BWL so I didn’t appreciate being treated like dead weight.
---
Not worth it to me.
---
Maybe its more how people react and then talk, than actual server lag. Like someone "standing in fire", its useless to try to warn them. They are either dead or figured it out themselves.
---
I just dont like the price that you need to spend on server boosts to actually get better voice quality. And you are STILL dependent on their shit to actually work.
---
I was in Boralus and saw a crowd of characters just fade out all at once. Layering is garbage and detracts from the MMO experience.
---
Add a better tool to ban bots/gold sellers. Add fresh servers over time.
---
Nice dodge on his point about flying out the private server devs
---
sámè.
---
It doesn't matter what weapon you use for leveling. Hunter is the least gear dependent class for leveling, you spec into Beastmaster and you'll be fine regardless.
---
When it comes to endgame raiding there basically are 4 good weapons for Hunters to get. 1 bow and after that 3 crossbows.
---
*balls balls balls balls balls balls balls*
---
Shadow priests are incredibly
---
Overrated in the current meta.
---
They oom
---
In 12 casts, have 3 damaging spells , two of which are incredibly interruptible.
---
Stop scaling with locks/mages after t1 both literally ( because you’re not getting t2+) and mathematically ( mages/licks have far higher spellpower coefficients).
---
They also need to drink for 60 seconds every fight, and get countered by mages and locks as gear and servers progress.
---
Source : r12 shadowpriests on a favorite PS and r11 in classic.
---
I literally answered all your questions you pretentious buffoon. It's a recreation of vanilla, a thought of you asking what extra races classes will be never even occurred to me. They are all just overall simple/dumb questions you can find the answer to in 5 minutes of googling yet I wasted my time to give them to you on a platter.
---
Either twitch, some type of horror movie/found footage movie or a spotify!
---
Cool, but this thread is for classic related wow content.
---
Imo they're even more likely to fail because a guild like that will usually have a community lynchpin who is responsible for a shitton of organizational tasks the others just have no clue are going on. The second that guy leaves and the 39 remaining ones are just left to wonder why there's no raid on the calendar for this week and it quickly disintegrates from there.
---
Just because 3 of you have heard of it doesn't mean everyone else has.
---
No it's warcraft 3.
---
The quality of streamers we have is a real bummer : / from simple plain efamous idiot, to guy who wants to run classic wow using his own personal black lists, to the literal million dollar fraud criminal. We’re a hive of scum and villainy, and not in the cool way.
---
We do have some good ones too, don’t get me wrong, but oh boi our bad is bad.
---
It's a 2% chance to proc per hit and lasts one minute. Bosses swing every 2.5 seconds, or 24 times per minute. That's pretty significant downtime against a single target.
---
Uptime is much better against more than 1 target, but IMO that's irrelevant. Stamina is only good when you can rely on it 100% of the time. You can't average it out over time like you can with dodge or threat.
---
I still dont understand why they did that in the first place.
---
It was in warcraft 3 which classic is based off of.
---
Melee attacks carry a lot more threat than ranged so unless he has a huge headstart then the mob will switch to you likely after one backstab. You can mitigate most of the damage by opening with cheap shot.
---
Hoobastank, System of a down, Soil, Dope
---
FM wasn't in classic, your dead to me. :)
---
Are you trolling my jk-troll post?
---
Exactly where it went.
---
Would you suggest this as a money making strategy for rogues come classic? I was planning on going herb/alch but this sounds interesting too.
---
If there anywhere the feature is documented, or did you just make it up to make it seem like the is not a overwatch/blizzard unique feature?
---
That is correct. They want the stupid people so they don't waste time those smart enough to see through their scam.
---
Very easy to get in one AV weekend on 1.12.
---
Tanks are often raid leaders due to them beeing very active, the guild benefits a lot from having a main tank that never misses a raid and it's beneficial to always have the same raid leader.

arms is better on classic because you can't abuse the on-crit buffs and sweeping strikes + imp overpower alone are amazing skills.
---
Hunter kiting is loads of fun.  I didn't really become very good at until my guild did razorgore.  After about 50 wipes on him, I was an expert kiter.
---
I think WoW will be a lot like the real world. Plenty of assholes who brag and act better than you and shit on you for anything possible, BUT, an even greater number of nice people who generally want to have an amazing time with other lovely people and will come together to adventure and share some laughs. I think just like in life, you want to gravitate towards people with understanding and those who have a good time no matter the situation.
---
Wouldn't say it was me back in 2006 till 2009, but I think I might have come close :') I was playing it with my brothers and 2 best friends
---
Damn didn’t know a new Harry Potter book came out today
---
My main concern is PvP play since they're very similar for PvE.
---
Conflag build with decent gear looks fun as fuck to me.
---
green quests give the same experience as yellow/orange/red. its not until they turn grey that their worth begins to drop
---
I'd immediately command the creation of LFD, LFG, Transmog, and the WoW Token. I would then have an unannounced patch that leads to Deathwing destroying Azeroth overnight, with no additional zones to visit after this event.  
---
At the same time, I would redesign each class so that everyone has a heal, a stun, a ranged silence, and spammable AOE. This would all be delivered by a new talent system that removes talent trees and replaces them with three simple columns with just a couple abilities to choose in each.  
---
After this, I would outsource the model and animation design of each class to Disney's 3D animation department to install new, happier character models.  
---
A new option would appear in each player's micro bar that opens a cash shop. In this shop you can purchase up to 400 new mounts and follower pets (who, by the way, can now be pitted against each other in battle!)  
---
To combat player boredom, I would host a new technology that teleports players from different servers into zones together seemlessly. Everyone would love to see more people around them so this change would be one of the best.  
---
To combat a feeling that players are not being rewarded for their time spent on encounters, I'd create a system where each player can loot a boss they participated in and gain six items for their own personal inventory, for every boss.  
---
My final act would be the reversion of all server types to a single server type which is PVE. PVP servers would be gone.  
---
I think this would honestly result in the world's most popular MMO.
---
ironforged flightpath stinks compared to UC and Org, I hate running around those tunnels and getting to the deeprun tram feels worse than zeppelin towers, yuck.
---
You literally ask the question is it good or bad.
---
exactly, the name of the server doesn't matter shit. It's not an... "internal alpha server" just because it's named alpha :)
---
Ein fan-gemachtes Hörspiel über wow. Wenn du es nicht kennst guck dir die erste Folge auf youtube an und entscheid, ob du das weitergucken willst.
---
Für mich hängt da eine ganze Menge nostalgie dran, aber du magst das anders empfinden.
---
&lt;Method&gt; on Sylvanas-EU for sure! Their members were so decked out and they were the #1 guild on the server at the time. I clearly remember a hunter called Splinky from there who'd stand on the mailbox in IF, fully decked out in T3 and with the Scarab Lord title.
---
good feet too, dont forget about her toes.
---
Hey, I'm fine with ads. But I'm on mobile and a popup literally covers the bottom half of my screen. It moves when I scroll and there is no way to close it. I will not use this site in it's current state.
---
Im stuck between NE druid, hunter or gnome mage. I like to blow people up and kite.
---
Druids are my favorite lore wise next to shamans.  I would be a shaman if my buddies weren't all going ally.
---
I also would be a NE mage if I could be. Humans are boring and gnomes dont really show off their gear.
---
I find melee pretty boring so Paladins/warriors/Rogues are out. Maybe rogue since they habe a unique playstyle thats fun. Paladins just dont die like mofos. And warriors cut dicks off.  Shadow priests/warlocks have no mobility but they do melt faces.
---
Nothing wrong with that. I’ve done both myself - taken years off for wow/gaming, and for travelling the irl world (lacking south and Central America, Africa and irl northrend ofc). Both have given me invaluable tools that have been of great use. WoW gave me English skills and friends from all over, many of whom I’ve visited, and travelling gave me maturity and - I like to think - the wisdom to know what I want to do. We can’t all go from study year to study year 20 years in a row
---
IMO, the best loot system by far is loot council. But the reality is that if the guild leads dont keep it fair, you MUST be willing to say, fuck this and just walk away. No point in staying in corrupt guild, constantly complaining about the loot and being toxic.
---
But before even toying with the idea of leaving or if wonder wtf, why did that guy get that loot, talk to your CL or any officer. There might be a larger strategy behind the distribution that doesnt show by judging few single drops. Ive done LC as CL/Officer and as for healers, its usually pretty easy since healing is more of a group effort and people arent whoring meters as much.
---
Only times it might get bit more annoying is, when a VERY high value item doesnt drop at all and basically you got like 8 guys that deserve it. Lets say Rejuv gem for healers. For most classes BIS through out the whole content. What we used to do, is between all healing CL's we hard coded certain drops based on their value PER class, gave priorities based on that. So it could be like Priest, druid, priest, paladin, priest, druid, paladin, priest, paladin. After that the CL made a call from his own class who to give it to, based on attendance, performance and high value items given. I always felt that it worked pretty well. Because we actually had a excel sheet for every non-tier healing item example for BWL, before even setting foot inside the instance.
---
And when someone asked "why did that guy got it", you had data to give out. "we divided all loot based on class, our class gets the 2nd and 4th drop. Atm, you are getting the first of our classes item, so next that drops". So you can explain WHY it was given to the other guy and say that WHEN hes getting it. Ofc sometimes its not great news, like "you are on the 5th rejuv gem. But i have you first on Lok'Amir". People do understand it much better, when it doesnt seem arbitrary, you have reasons that you can explain and you give them information about other items.
---
Actually it was quite common to roll greed on everything unless you needed it for your main spec. You would also need to equip the item on the spot or be labeled a ninja looter.
---
not sure if someone else already jumped on it but beta showed that dungeon grinding is probably the most efficient way to level for time. As a warr your very gear dependent and the dungeon will give you plenty of gear. Take a few points in prot tree maybe get that extra charge on shield block and thatll be plenty in prot  then go straight down fury for crit/damage /threat. 
---
Anyhow if you convince your friends to run the dungeons an couple extra time or do it with other groups after running your friends through you'll compensate your otherwise slower leveling. Just know if you completely use only dungeon leveling youll fall behind on rep and professions(if you choose to level with them).
---
&gt;  So I suppose there is use in having leaders designated even if it feels kinda ornamental most of the time.
---
Imo this is part of it, and the other big part is the number of micro-decisions for raids. You were the mage CL so perhaps you'd know that it's often a good idea to coordinate specs so you're sure to have at least one WC mage. Also a great idea to know how many priests are holy and how many are PI. For pretty much all classes you have these tiny things that, if you want to most out of your time, someone will need to address. Imo the real strength of the class leaders is that you can delegate all those micro-decisions so you first of all cut down on the work required by the actual raid leader (if it would otherwise fall to him), having shit problems like 7 Ar/Fr mages but 0 WC, and IMO you get slightly improved raider performance because people just like to be useful. I would argue that at least half the time you point at someone and make 'em class lead, they step their game up just a bit and start getting more involved with the raid planning and overall guild maintenance.
---
I'll stick couples of cool pronunciations together, then try to spell it. English is not my native language so it's hard.
---
Specials only account if they're also melee attacks. If we assume 1 special melee attack every 2.5 seconds (which is a huge overestimate but let's go with it) you would still only take 48 hits per minute. Proc is a 2% chance per hit. 
---
Someone who actually passed statistics can probably do the math better than I can here. Regardless, there is downtime and it's significant enough to matter.
---
My personal biggest: control inflation and gold inflow/outflow like crazy
---
100g should be a large amount of money. 1000 should be a fortune
---
The biggest issue is botters and overseas farmers that would historically come in and go absolutely nuts in WoW circa 2007.
---
Machine learning to identify botters or gold sellers? Maybe.
---
I loved it because it was marginally more bearable than Everquest :P
---
That's so great, I bet they just thought you were a really good dude to want to carry you so hard :)
---
Nor is being an elitist jerk.
---
I kinda like that about the system, that you can "bank" earned items but due to the nature of the system your bank is always exactly equal to 1 piece of loot. Not like with DKP where one guy comes back from hiatus and everyone has to drop to their knees to worship the reinstated God-King of DKP or he'll just grab all the items they want.
---
8am here.
---
9/10, had me till the end
---
A fear ward being purged is also dependent on someone who may or may not be there. That's the point. It's incredibly clear in the language and tone of the post that what you're considering here is incredibly biased.
---
Of course there's a vast difference between an offensive dispel and a defensive one. They're both coming from a third party in regards to removing CC from you, or removing a beneficial spell though. Heck even if the third party is there, in both examples that doesn't mean they will dispel or purge. I've witnessed several hundred times elemental shamans refuse to purge a flag carrier with freedom because the idea of spending a single global cool down for something other than direct damage is something they can't comprehend. Likewise I've seen priests sitting in a sheep adjacent to a Ret Paladin who is being kited and not even doing any damage. 
---
For the record too, defensive dispels are the superior of the two.
---
You also mentioned in your post that Paladins don't always heal. You're right, they don't always. The ratio of Paladins healing to not healing is massive though, because Ret is total ass. It means not only do you have access to better dispels as Alliance, but you're more likely to have a better PuG composition in regards to heals.
---
Also, Shamans may "delete you" (slight exaggeration) but their mana efficiency is shit. They can't sustain themselves in big team fights. If you're positioned well the likihood of shamans being able to even reach you to get to this point of deletion is significantly mitigated. I could go on but the main point here is this, everything you said is heavily tilted. Unless you can get out of the mindset that everything on one side can go wrong and that there's barely any benefit on the other side, then there's no discussion to be had because you've already made up your mind.
---
Cool man, I bookmarked it.
---
Good to know
---
I'm really trying not to let myself get to that point, but it's admittedly been difficult lately. Leeway looks like it's going to completely change how the game plays. I know they say it's accurate according to their internal reference client, but the more time passes and the more we see how wonky the game looks the less I'm willing to trust that metric.
---
Frankly, I don't particularly care whether the numbers line up; I care whether playing the game feels more or less the same as it did back in the day. And all the crap I saw coming out of the beta *really* doesn't look like it'll feel the same, or even mostly similar.
---
To be fair, "how it feels" is an inherently subjective metric which can be difficult (though not, I believe, altogether impossible) to quantify. And how it looks in the beta could be deceiving. We'll see.
---
As for layering... it fundamentally undermines the very foundation of the MMORPG experience and completely invalidates the whole bloody *point* of Classic. Perhaps most disappointing of all, it exposes Blizzard's true colors. They say they want to recreate an authentic Vanilla experience then sacrifice that very experience on the altar of expediency - which is precisely how WoW got to the state it's in today.
---
I don't know. I'm doing my best to suspend judgment until the 26th when I can play it for myself and see how big a problem these things will prove to be.  Here's hoping. Otherwise it's back to trying (and probably failing) to find something to scratch that itch while I wait for Pantheon to finally wrap development and release.
---
uBlock Origin is your friend, I didn't even notice.

---
do a lock first, since they're easier to level. You can get your foot in the door for endgame content (and gold) sooner than with a mage. Once you have that, if you still have the interest, make a mage. It'll be easier to do so with the main's finances behind it. You can even consider twinking at 19 as a mage!
---
95% of the time i just skip that questline completely and focus on the western side of the map quests, maraudon stuff and ofc SM questline for alliance.
---
Compromise, be a warrior
---
The Sarkoth trick is hilarious. Makes me want to troll a NE hunter too.
---
I don't get what makes Stonetalon Mountains particularly appealing however. Care to explain? Any significance in using a white bear there?
---
Just form a loot council and take all the loot. Why bother with all the fucking around? If you want to screw your raid out of proportional rewards, do it for real instead of just dipping your toe.

Adblock was invented more than 15 years ago, maybe it's time for some of you to start using it....
---
Sigon? Sounds like the first GM on SC, and he was followed by Jalem and Reina. 
---
Maybe it was a different guy you're talking about though, since we were a PvP guild called "The Assault"...I think? It's been so long.  
---
I was a gnome warlock called Darkgnome, though. 
---
Definitely remember Eternal...super successful guild; can't remember if that's where my friend Valdren (gnome mage) was. Or was he in "New Haven"? "The Haven"? I can't remember! Geh....
---
Sorry, kinda just talking to myself at this point.
---
I think this analysis relies on threat profile from pservers, which is probably not accurate, and it ignores the massive advantage that sword/hammer expertise is over axe expertise.  
---
Plus wasn't it unclear whether WF procs were resetting the swing timer or not?
---
Nm?
---
&gt;There's no reason to rush this.
---
No reason ? Well thats a load of crap. What if you have done the levelup 20-30 times already, had 5+ L60s in past few years in private servers ? Your focus is HC raiding as fast as possible.
---
No reason ? Rly ?
---
I’m not actually sure. He’s always wanted to tank but I’m not sure if he still wants to do that. For me, I’ve always been at my best as a healer. It’s just been what I enjoy doing the most. But I’ll check with him in the morning to see what he really wants to do. The fact that he’s interest in being a rogue makes me wonder if that’s what he really wants to do. My gut tells me he will be happiest as a warrior, but I guess we’ll see.
---
And a legendary shirt it is
---
That's idiotic. I have every bit of faith the person I helped vote into a presidential office isn't going to steal, cheat or commit crimes but god damn if I'd ever let you take away the checks and balances. Faith is stupid, naive and subjective, I don't need the checks and balances for someone who's so obviously bad that I don't trust them, I need checks and balances because some people are wolves in sheep's clothing. I need the checks and balances for when someone is actually really, really good at being bad.
---
There are loads of stuff you better of skipping after 30 too. And tbh, how the quest level ranges inside a map area changes, its REALLY not worth going to the other side of the world to complete those last 1-2 quests you couldnt do when you played there.
---
Unless theres some amazing item linked to it or you need it as pre-q to something great.
---
Interesting. So it would actually be worth it
---
by BoA you mean Band of Accuria?
---
Hes monotone AF, but I think that actually makes his videos easier to sit through.
---
For 5-man and PVP shadow priest is a great choice. Your main issues with low damage in raids are due to mana sustain and not being allowed to fully utilise your debuffs due to slot limit - both of those are less relevant in 5-mans. 
---
Spirit tap will be a bonus, as you can sometimes finish off mobs - but other classes have to drink too, so don't worry. 
---
The healer of the group will be happy with the small heals coming off your damage, your shields, and especially druids will love having a reason in the group. 
---
If you're interested in raiding, I'd check out Ooze priest on YouTube, he's got some cool content on how to be the shadow priest in your raid, how to be successful in raids with limited time, items, etc. 
---
Have fun!
---
Sort it but lvl 20/25+ and by Beta PvP or Beta PvE.
---
Beta PvP is 61% Ally / 39% Horde (25+)
---
Beta PvE is 62% Ally / 28% Horde (25+)
---
I don't like playing alliance, but they have a lot more pve advantages: 
---
1) Fear Ward &gt; Tremor Totem and anything Horde Priests get  
---
2) Paladin buffs are far easier to manage than totem buffs, and the whole raid gets them rather than only groups with shamans.  
---
3) Salvation is better than tranquil air, and having to put shamans in all the dps groups kind of kills the value of mana tide totem etc.  e.g. I've still never seen a group give a warlock group Tranquil Air totem.  
---
4) Human Sword Expertise is probably the best PvE/Tank racial in existence.  Let alone dps racial.  Axe expertise is worth mentioning but there are like 6 axes in the game from raids.  The best tanking weapons = swords.  The best dps 1h weapons = swords.  With the news about how strong weapon skill is coming down (25% reduced glancing penalty + 3% hit + other benefits from the 1 talent alone), Alliance has a big advantage. 
---
Horde's one big advantage in pve is WF totem.  Which is good but can't make up for everything.
---
So you are saying that pugs in 5 man dungeons are using loot council too, because a hunter won't need on tank sword or if he does he gets kicked?
---
&gt;I also feel t0.5 release in p5 is too late. It was mostly implemented to help new players get gear from 5-mans, which was reasonable considering how much WoW grew at the time. But does this apply to classic as well? I doubt it.
---
There will be people who will need it
---
For me everything is now classic related.
---
Kite and blow people up at the same time is "Aimed Shot" territory.
---
Im curious to why you have ruled out NE og Humans?
---
I played a lot of pvp in vanilla on priest and Shadowmeld might not be an active componemt like other racial skills but damn if it wasnt useful anyway. 
---
Being able to stealth defending a capture point or just drink up mana in peace was so great.
---
And humans perception, although a somewhat long cd, short duration enables you do clear said capture point of rogues and druids waiting for you.
---
Or maybe he has whitelisted sites that he visits often so the people who run them can actually make money
---
If you dont get from that explanation what i mean and you think the way you play is working for you, then keep doing what you do. Id say its not OPTIMAL, but nothing really is, so no worries.
---
Shadow Guard and Blackout is nice when you are a Troll, but I mainly used it for a PvP healing spec with only 5 points in Shadow and not as a full Shadow priest. If you want to go all out on Shadow then for sure, go for Undead.
---
Keep your eyes open for players you would enjoy playing/raiding with (efficient, experienced, calm - or whatever suits you), stay in contact, and see where they end up. Ask them if their guild is working. If they are happy, apply with their recommendation. 
---
This works really well for solo players. As GM, I would be somewhat wary of large groups of IRL friends, but groups of 2-5 should be fine.
---
You're just an imbecile, arrogant self absorbed toxic human being. Don't be coming on peoples posts to abuse them for something you're not being forced to do. bag o' dicks
---
Require clearing Naxxramas before entering the Dark Portal. Adjust post-60 accordingly. 
---
Force content to stay in the path of players.
---
Might be commercial suicide, but sounds like a fun experiment.
---
Just in case you were wondering:
---
The city with the creature of light in the middle is Shattrath, which has a Naaru in the middle, making the last expansion you played The Burning Crusade (first expansion).
---
Other than that I have nothing to add that wasn't already stated by other commenters: just have fun. If you have more fun by playing solo, then go for it.
---
Find a way to implement horizontal progression in stead of vertical progression to make old stuff still relevant for many years.
---
To sum up what has already been said in the previous post on this subject, Troll &gt; UD.
---
Seeing a playlist in 2019 without EDM (though i like EdM), is super rare! Wauw all this music. But this guy was clearly not a PvP'er, missing some of the metal PvP songs from soilwork and In flames, otherwise 9/10 list :) !
---
Any reason why you believe that?
---
Very interesting
---
&gt;I want TBC servers, but they should be STANDALONE. No xfers or anything from Classic. Make everyone level from level 1 if they want to play TBC.
---
How many people do you think leveled from level 1 the first time they played TBC? TBC was built on the assumption it would be served to a population of mostly level 60s.
---
Yup. If you want to play on a pvp server you have to level on a pvp server!
---
And your rumor sauce is 4chan? Is it summer already? Welcome newfriend here is your....
---
Something tells me that for Classic is going to take FAR less time. Like 3 months tops.
---
You’d be surprised. I encountered a LOT of kb turners in pservers over the years.
---
\*You're :)
---
your right, ty
---
if by modifying you mean not using it all then yeah
---
I seem to remember hunters being a beneficiary of the prepatch changes.  You could drop traps in combat, auto attack when you left melee range, gained atk power scaling on arcane shot and silencing shot and scattershot got some crazy weapon damage.  I recall killing people with all instant casts, which was crazy at the time.
---
Orc pvp, troll pve.
---
No his is from 4chan you sperg
---
unless you are a layer 10 or a above don't talk to me
---
I disagree in principle. 
---
You're not sending 100% of upgrades to your MT. In my own experience (limited, for sure!) there was probably a 60:40 split.  
---
During progression 85%+ of BiS gear went immediately to MT / Main Offtank, because they're the one doing the thing -- or the one stepping in as the MT when an OT. 10-15% went if it was a major upgrade vs a minor upgrade to a 3rd/4th position tank, since it reduced reliance on the former 2 to be available. 
---
Once farm status was reached it was much more about bringing everyone up to par, while also focusing on hitting bonuses / improving progression. It really depends on the guild's goals. 
---
idk this got into a ramble quick
---
funny how absolutely EVERYONE here who speaks out for loot council talks about trusting the guild and its leadership.
---
but they will NOT let the very same argument be a valid point for DKP loot system.
---
i absolutely trust our hunters to NOT hoard all their DKP, raid in blue items through phase 1-3, and then take the bindings instead of letting the tank take them.
---
that person would be shunned and everyone knows it. most guys in my guild are 30++ years old now and old buddies from back in the days.
---
100% DKP system with NO RULES will work just fine for us. it did back in the days with the occasional "lol" after someone places their bid, and it will work in the future.
---
doesnt mean that i think loot council or DKP systems with rules attached are shit. they will also work out just fine. but i personally would never join a loot council guild.
---
&gt; The only thing they were testing in the Stress Test is layering
---
They are testing literally EVERYTHING linked to launch. Like on what kind of rate they can let people login, how many ppl can there be per layer in each zone, how fast people are moving around the map. What quest are bottlenecks, so if they need to change spawn times. Hows the server handling load on looting. You name it, they are collecting data on it.
---
&gt; to try to shut someone down
---
What ? From your raise to internet fame ? Jeesus fucking christ. Its quite a difference to speculate whats the reason why the stress test was moved compared to make a claim "its rumored to be this reason".
---
Because you dont really make any valid poins why this would even be true. Other than "stress test has layering". It must be it.
---
Yeah good tip, most people advise f1-4 it seems on this sub, personally I like those so I don't have to move my hand and it flows quicker but definitely part of being a good tank as it speeds things up so much.
---
The real problem with that is the long-ass fuckin' wait for it. If you had 2 days of BC dungeon replays every 2 weeks instead, it probably wouldn't feel as shitty. I never for the life of me could figure out why it was ever limited to events, but that's a whole other can of worms.
---
And whats the point ?
---
Any modifications will tuin the guide and you definitely wont make your leveling faster unless you are better at this stuff than Joana..
---

Lol when did you last play Diablo 2? It has been updated fairly regularly over the years, with all that new crap with the torches and stuff they added like 5 years ago. It unfortunately hasn't been frozen at all.
---
Fair point. Thanks
---
See this is what I thought. People advocating for RP-PVP act like there is a demand but I don't see that demand. People need to keep the pressure on Blizz for RP-PVP servers or we are not going to get them.

Extra attacks gained from Windfury and other extra attack mechanics, like Sword specialization and Hand of Justice are not normalized. They are considered normal auto attacks that just happen with a 0 second swing timer.

Joana is really good as a general guide, but his times are absolutely demolished by many speedrunners these days. The catch is none of these guys have official guides at least to the degree Joana does. So I want to watch twitch vods of these fast levelers and incorporate some dungeons for fun.

Dido - White Flag. The STV anthem.

According to almost every OG pvp video, none of those songs existed.

I agree. An optimized route might be the road less traveled even if it's less efficient in theorycraft.
---
&gt;Isn't Dwarven Hand Cannon widely considered BIS until Rhok'Delar?
---
well yes,  but actually no
---
They do sort of have a deadlock though, they too have #nochangers that are strongly opposed to adding new stuff or changing existing core stuff. It becomes a race to see which side has the most quitters so the vote will finally swing one way because people get so fucking entrenched these days.

I'd be willing to bet he means Asmongold, Soda, Tips.

I love how there's always people speaking for the "silent majority", no matter the subject. If they're silent, you don't know what they're thinking.

?
---
I quoted the source of the percentage below. It's not out of the ether. 
---
But yes, when you assume that a question is asked in bad faith and refuse rational assurances to the contrary, there really is no discussion to be had.
---
Honestly RP servers is what will keep the game long alive after every PVE and PVP gets tired of content stagnation.
---
A few reasons:   
---
1) Joana is great for people who don't follow speedrunning too closely and has a really user friendly guide, but his times are demolished by more serious speedrunners.  
---
2) If a lot of people are using the guide, it might be more beneficial to do quests in a different order / skip quests if we get bottlenecked following the same route.   
---
3) I want to level fast, but I also want to have fun. I want to include dungeons in my route which will alter the order in some level ranges.
---
What does this basic, obvious, well known and utilised advice even have to do with streamers?
---
I reckon I could do it effortlessly.
---
Knew I remembered them. So you played on frost wolf alliance? 
---
I was a human rogue, Luckystrike, raided with the Vagrants.
---
I'm not even the only one who has brought up your bias. It's not an **assumption** that you're asking it in bad faith. You demonstrated it. Youre continuing to demonstrate it what's more when you refuse to admit your bias despite having it explained clearly by multiple people.
---
Sure, so while I prefer UD model over Troll, the racial speak for themselves.
---
UD got WoF which is good but since alliance know that a big part of horde are UD and have it, warlock players tend to play horde to avoid that racial so you don't face that much enemy in pvp where you're in need of an anti-fear + your pvp trinket break fear.
---
UD also got DP which is quite a good spell but very mana costy and it can be dispelled so while it give you the possibility to "burst" an enemy every 3min, it's a double edged blade since you'll go oom very fast using it and sometimes for nothing.
---
On the other hand, Troll have Shadow Guard, which is an amazing spell, no cooldown, low mana cost, scale with 100% of your SP (33% per charge) and can proc blackout. That shit is amazing and the damage output is crazy.
---
Troll also have the haste racial which is, for me, not that good. You can cast faster but in raid environment you're supposed to be at 100%hp so the bonus will only be 10% and in pvp you rarely have the time to stop and chain cast mind flay or other spell so very situational.
---
Last and not least, Troll have Hex of Weakness.  the damage reduction is great against rogue but the reduction of healing is what make this spell so great. The is only another class that can reduce healing received and it's warrior with mortal strike. 20% healing reduction is huge and again, low mana cost, no CD.
---
His mom looks like a meth addict. To be fair, if you have an addictive personality, gaming isn't the worst thing to get hooked on.
---
Nice catch, also some classes aren't optimal for dungeon farming and thus will have to quest.
---
You are forced to wear cloth as a healer because most gear that’s best in slot/available IS cloth. You can wear mail/plate while soloing or pvp but when it comes time to raid, you’re probably gonna have a weird looking set.

Well, it's 2019. It's time for WoWII: Back to STVietnam.

Tips.
---
Any guild that is smart enough, will have the MT, and the 2 OT's Protection Warriors, or the MT and 1st OT Prot Warriors and 2nd OT Feral Druid, simply because of LOOT distribution.
---
Raiding guilds will run with roughly 6 Fury Warriors as DPS. Adding one more Fury Warrior as 2nd OT is pretty dumb. He would need BOTH tanking gear and DPS gear, because, well, he is actually not a Tank in the guild, but a DPS with tanking gear, that is used from time to time.
---
He will have the 3rd prio for tank gear, and probably 3rd or 4th prio on DPS gear. If you have him as HIGHER prio, either for tanking or DPS gear, you will have to deal with the 1st OT, which is basically your MT reserve, and you don't want to upset him, ever, or, you will have to deal with your top DPS Fury Warriors, which, again, is not something you want to do.
---
Having 3 Prot Warriors or 2 Prot and 1 Feral Druid as tanks in the guild, makes things easier for loot distribution, and let's be honest here : a Prot Warrior in pre-BiS is a better tank than a Fury Warrior in pre-BiS.
---
Funneling tank gear to a Fury Warrior that, first, doesn't WANT to tank, and secondly, will have crap DPS (if you give him prio on tanking gear, you can't, for the love of God, to give him prio on DPS gear in the same time) compared to other Fury Warriors.
---
A guild will much faster gear up 3 PROPER tanks, instead 2 and one DPS wanna-be tank, and once this is done, than you can give tanking gear to the Fury Warriors, for their tanking set, which will come in handy for split runs later, ZG and AQ20.
---
Point by point, for MC and BWL, having a guild with 3 Prot Warriors or 2 Prot Warriors and 1 Feral Druid is much better than having the third tank as a Fury Warrior.
---
&gt;Serenity Now
---
*Where Eagles Dare intensifies*
---
In the beginning it was hard to find a dedicated (keyword) mt/ot who accepted they will be prot and basically just do dungeons and raids.
---
nowadays it is equialy hard to find a dedicated AND trustworthy (keyword) mt/ot who are not lootwhores and bitch at every minor setback.
---
since the tank/dps warrior ratio in raids is about 2:6 you have a more realistic change at being dps. there will be enough warriors fighting over who is mt/ot
---
in dungeons on the other hand the tank to dps is basically 1:0 so you better strap on a shield and tank for yourself.
---
if you are lucky and want to tank you can but nobody forces you to it. exception might be the occasional garr first add tank
---
Yeah but they'd stop their incessant fucking 'whats next' posts when they're not out of MC
---
You didn't explain.
---
Listen carefully.
---
If you claim fear ward will be **instantly dispelled**
---
Then on the other hand claim that Paladins only help "in theory"
---
That's bias.
---
It's no different to what the other guy said. If you say, well I want to choose between a dog and a cat. Dogs give (insert exaggerated benefit) and cats give (insert hypoethrical possibly maybe something) then you're biased.
---
It's why you also said shamans delete you and several people had to correct you on that too. It's got nothing to do with you not listing everything, it's to do with you purposely chose to exaggerate the benefits of one side, and either not mention or underplay the benefits of the other.
---
And yes, seriously bias. Fiction doesn't change that. I can be biased in favour of Marvel over DC and ignore quality content from DC because of that bias. What's your point here exactly?

---
Apex was in TBC. I think it was a merge of the the guilds Kalevlased and another one that I dont recall. Kalevlased was considered among the top guilds in vanilla though but I dont recall if they cleared Naxx.
---
your bis for pve is robes for a pretty much every phase. http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
DP is a great 1v1 spell but you're 1v1ing a class with a dispell and it's like you threw your mana to the trashcan.
---
A mage with half a brain will ice block it, a war can use shield wall to absorb the majority of the damage, a hunter will run away and reset, same go for rogue.
---
I'm not saying that DP is bad, it's a great spell and I love it but in my experience it's not worth to use it except if you use IF before casting it.
---
I would 100% of the time prefer to have SG over DP in a 1v1 counter, instant cast, damage when you get hit and can stun the target. It can break a rogue opener, help you create space against warrior,...
---
Rule number 1: The loot rules are never ever changed during the raid.
---
Where i was 2ic in Vanilla/bc/wrath/cat we had a loot policy with zero sum dkp
---
Loot councils work fine as long as all they do is set the guild policy as to what class/job is allowed to bid on which items but have nothing to do with the actual distribution.
---
we then used a zero sum dkp with fixed loot prices. it put peer pressure on hoarders as 39 other people would miss dkp if they didn't take an upgrades. Guild took all boe and sold to pay for tank and healer flasks
---
I am outlining this with Illustrator right now using shit sources, then ill probably put some texture in PS to add that worn out look. Doing this solely in photoshop isn't gonna work out so well, because having everything done with raster graphic is gonna worsen the quality of the outlines, but we will see.  
---
I'll try to do my best.
---
Ah yeah that might be right, I remember apex as being end of vanilla, but you might well be right, the great Danes was also in tbc I think on the alliance side
---
warriors are the staple tank. ferals are meme tank which are useful when you can blitz past old content and use them as an off-tank that does more dps on trash than off tank warriors.
---
I really don't understand why people are taking this as fact. This is overall very very unlikely. They only removed certain dungeon items that drop near the naxx patch such as spellweaver turban (and ect..). We know there is no tier 2 dropping in MC. There is no reason to believe any of those items won't be dropping at launch.
---
While moving, your attack range increases to compensate lag between client and server (in vanilla days, internet was much slower, so the added something that essentially should FEEL the same). So mobs hit you from bit further away, but thenagain you hit them (melee AND spells) the same way.
---
Something that becomes non issue, when you get used to it.
---
disappointed no one linked war pigs by black sabbath yet
---
Yeah but female trolls are memeably ugly
---
Dont think they will, they dont want BFA to look like trash while classic is out
---
Interesting read.
---
I kinda agree with pretty much everything.
---
&gt; It took me so long that I had random players giving me advice to help out.
---
This is better than addons and guides haha, more like a real-life rp. rip old internet childhood
---
Nice Video, but what you didn't mention is, that T2 Hand, feet, waist, bracers dropt in MC prior Patch 1.4.
---
I don't think that's how it works kid. It's you who are probably searching Google for layering and then it's spamming you with ads.
---
It's a good way to keep the entire guild happy, and it helps prevents corruption.
---
When AQ40 came out, no I did not replace my full netherwind set as the set bonus enabled me to fire instant  pyros. There would have been no dps increase. 
---
When tbc came, the work I put into my items from over two years of raiding was rendered obsolete within two months. On top of that casual players closed the gap in a way, that I just felt cheated. I felt that my effort was devalued. And that is by no means comparable to the AQ patch, since that gear was still only achievable through raiding and not through quest lines and 5mans.
---
Tier 1 and Tier 2 are actually not on par for all classes. Warrior T2 is way above T1
---
Warlock. 
---
Best spell in the game? [Check]  
---
Equally-Cheapest Mounts in the game? [Check]  
---
Only self-rez other than Shaman Ankh? [Check]   
---
Able to summon anyone from anywhere to a dungeon run? [Check]  
---
Easiest-outside-of-hunter leveling experience? [Check]   
---
Great scaling as phases roll out? [Check]  
---
I could do the same for other classes but I'm biased as fuck and think Warlock (and Warrior, fwiw) are the two best classes at 1.12
---
Paladin probably gets an honorable mention. I just never really played Alliance.
---
Heroic leap for warriors
---
Would be so much fun.
---
Soil - Breaking me down was there quite many times in OG vids. I'm not one big metal fanboy, but that's the old wow's music for me and that playlist i'd expect.
---
Ok so i can level to 60 in plate?
---
BRE is actually not that OP because Armor values are much lower then on pservers
---
The quest can give a great shield reward as well. IIRC it’s 2nd bis for the 29 bracket. It’s *amazing* if you get it at 19+. You’ll want a high dps wand to last hit a marked elite for spirit tap while the rest of group heads down to cleave town.
---
It's an mmorpg. All players provide value to the community. Whether hardcore raiders,solo players, dad gamers, griefers and gankers. Everyone has their place in weaving the tapestry that is the community.
---
Let people be misinformed, the better dedicated players will do their own research, the uninformed will remain shit like they always have been, that only further benefits the informed in many ways.
---
Groups are harder to coordinate and they must be set up. People go afk, risk of fail is about 5 times higher, and some classes are significantly worse than the others. Even those who suck in solo leveling will risk facing all these issues in a group.

It's short (4 minutes) and shows what it does and how to do it really well.
---
My parents at my birth
---
- No flying mounts or, at the very least, no flying mounts on PvP servers.
---
- Failing that, the next expansion of zones would include WPvP objectives, but not 24h ones. Instead the WPvP objectives would go live at set times (staggered) in order to give players a time to concentrate on. The rewards for winning the WPvP objective at the end of the window (which might be holding a certain flag, killing the most enemy, whatever) would be good, which could be tweaked to ensure interest. Lower level zones can have +% xp, higher level zones +rep for the endgame faction of that zone, or a refreshing buff to pick up before going into a raid, or whatever. 
---
- Instead of adding more levels on top, flesh out dungeon tiers. Add another MC-level dungeon, another BWL-level dungeon, a few more 20-man dungeons. Add new 55-60 zones that come with these dungeons.
---
- Add more world events of a scale similar to the AQ war effort, but make them more confrontational (optional on PvE servers by just not flagging yourself). For example: add a new item that needs farmed and is only dropped in a few places. Add items that you need to get from Stockades or Ragefire Chasm. Hell, add 4 items for each faction, 1 each dropped by the other faction's leaders.
---
- Change Honor ranks from a comparative system (which encouraged either 18-20 hour days or account sharing for R14) to an objectives-based system: require a certain honor level to reach a rank and a certain minimum honor required to keep it each week for lower ranks (say up to R10, which you can grind to in the current system just fine without nolifing), and for the highest ranks (say R11-14) require meeting other criteria, like a K:D ratio in BGs, or a W:L ratio in BGs (different BG for 11, 12, 13?), and for R14 require an item turn-in dropped by a secondary faction leader (Magni for Horde, Cairn for Alliance), which only drops once per week. Maybe make the R11-14 objectives harder than the ones I thought of but I can't think of any others. Should be hard enough to avoid rank inflation but designed such that it's not exclusive to nolifers or account sharers: it should be a test of ability rather than just a timesink.
---
As for loot systems, it will depend on guild ambitions and mentality and maturity of its players. So there is no best raid loot system in general, just best for a certain guild.
---
In general with Loot council you want to have same like minded people, probably oriented towards progression. I think it works best in super hardcore raiding guilds, where people are mostly around equal skill level and can understand that an upgrade is bigger for someone else else even though that someone might already have gotten more items. Basically if they can put guild before them selves which is harder than it sounds.
---
DKP in my opinion is best for guilds that are semi hardcore or casual. With DKP each individual can sort of plan his own items and understand much clearer why someone got the item. Any flaws DKP can have you can fix with some predefined rules. It is just important to have those defined before hand and not have them change around a lot. It offers most stability and drama free environment where players have different mentality and approach and thoughts on how much and how they should play the game.
---
As for guild structure, you basically from jobs have guild banker, guild leader, raid leader and class leaders. How you distribute those jobs will again depend on guilds.
---
Some will have for example just 3 officers doing all above. I think it works best to have class leaders and to have a raid leader as his only job. Banker and guild leader could be on of the class leaders as well, I think its just important raid leader is free of additional work.
---
Will be an interesting and good change. And stop annihilator spam too.
---
I know a lot of Lights Hope players are used to this, but it is not true in Classic WoW.
---
Blizzard is going with 1.12 Itemization and it is also stated that the locations of the loot drops are in their 1.12 state. ["there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations."](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/34465)

Seconding druid. 
---
Leveling you'll literally never stop (probably the same for any healer class, but worth mentioning). 
---
WSG you two as a pair are good/great/amazing, depending on the levels/comps. 
---
That said, I'll second Charliefromlost saying a second hunter / a rogue are both also great for wPvP / orgPvP / leveling. None of these choices are bad, they will all streamline leveling and also be great/fantastic in org-PvP
---
Because gnomes are smaller but all races have a set run speed. Makes gnomea seem faster. Downside gnomes need to swim where other races could just walk through the water because they're short
---
UC is an autistic version of IF.
---
Indeed, i tend to do full buffs in raids if few people die, just to keep the fucking timers in sync. Because they cost next to nothing and the mana usage is minimal at best. But without pallypower, holy fucking shit it would suck.
---
Pallys are monster healers, period. In our raid logs the top 8 healers are usually 1 priest, 1 druid and 6 paladins. And not in that order.
---
Yeah I asked in other post someone with shirt to make good photo of that so it might help. Having Ion on that classic panel is great help, becasue all other graphics are heavily jpg'd and looks like shit.  
---
Its great font tho, most of the angles are 50 and 25 so its easy to reproduce really. Back is gonna be more tricky with that tribal in the background.
---
My first char on vanilla was a druid, his name was Wogouu, it came from Ougadougou.
---
My second char was a hunter named Tchukytchuck in reference to the comic Lucky Luck and more specifically when an old deaf man misunderstand the name and thinks it's Mukymuck.
---
I'll go with a hunter named Tchukytchuck for classic.
---
This is the funniest shit I've heard all week. Thank you for being you.
---
If you hate tunnel mazes you must really hate UC. In IF you havr to go through the tram once in your toons lifetime then you can just use the flightpath.
---
In UC you have to navigate tunnels and take awkward elevators every single time you take the zeppelin.
---
You won't do BRD in one go. There are EMP runs, Jailbreak runs and Arena runs. Of course there are People going in there for the Quests, but these Groupe are going to be around lvl 55 and won't have a good time killing emp, so shouldnt even try it
---
I watched the series roswell and they were talking about a shapeshifting species.. they were called skinwalker. So i named my troll mage Skinwalker (a name i like to this day!)  
---
My second name was from the movie  Le grand restaurant with louis de Funès. The scene were the shadow makes him look like Hitler. And in the german version he yells "MUSKATNUSS Herr Mülle" (Nutmeg Mr. Müller).  
---
So i called my Druid Muskatnuss... and every now and then when joining a raid or ts, someone (old enough) would yell the sentence! :D
---
The Night Evles were spoiled. My first toon in Vanilla was a NE and Darnassus is the coolest looking zone in the game.
---
Ya sorry I should have said - will you aim to rush poison quest or wait until later down the track
---
If you’re playing on a PvP server, you roll Horde because endgame PvE is already a joke, so why choose a faction to min/max based on that? 
---
Meanwhile, Horde is far and away the more PvP-centric faction. Especially world PvP. Lakeshire is so much more fun to gank than Stonetalon. There’s a reason it’s called Red Ridge and not Blue Ridge. So yeah, if your friends enjoy getting hunted like animals in the wilderness, then feel free to play Alliance. If you prefer to be part of a group that sticks up for each other and tends to dominate the open world, make the sensible choice.
---
Exactly, I've kept in touch with some of my guildmates from Vanilla for nearly 15 years now. Several of them were there for me to talk to when my wife and I were in the process of splitting up and were a huge help in getting through it. Just because they're not physically present in your life does not mean they can't be as close if not closer than anyone who lives near you. I've spent as much time with some of them than I have with a lot of my "real" friends. 
---
And yes, if anyone was wondering, about 10 of us have already started making plans for a reunion in Classic. :)
---
If you don't plan to raid to much you should aim for :  
---
1) A class who don't need weapon to deal damage or  
---
2) A class who can obtain easily a good weapon  
---
Being limitied to blue is really punishing for physical classes.
---
Yeah if a hunter tried to spend DKP on a binding they'd be laughed out of / kicked out of a guild (or simply ignored).
---
Well if you actually watched the video, you'd know my point was that it's **not** 100% set in stone, but [I used Ion Hazzikostas' statement on twitter as the Classic WoW structure.](
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641)
---
If that ends up being wrong I'll update the video, like I said.
---
We don't have any confirmation at all regarding what is going to drop in MC from phase 1 or not and Ion's tweet is very vague... Bit of a stretch to make an 11 minutes video about something purely speculative, but okay.
---
This post made me giggle a little but now I am sad ;(
---
Do you know any other? Casual friendly...
---
...huh?
---
&gt; I got 4 pieces of Cenarion gear that run.
---
&gt; So I said thanks for the bracers
---
These sound contradictory.
---
paladins buffed a lot prior to greater blessings being added, since he had to rebuff the whole raid at least twice during your typical progression fight (or more for something like Nefarian).
---
Greater Blessings had a 15 minute duration, and allowed you to buff the whole raid in about 8 casts, so buffing was no longer really an issue as they'd last the entire fight, usually.
---
Also judgements were changed to refresh on melee hit, so as long as you occassionally bopped the enemy with a weapon, your judgement would stay up without having to recast it.
---
Very early on, they were indeed buff bots that gradually moved into pure healing as the buffing aspect was gradually simplified.
---
Good points on all- The only exception is that many times, a person will have a "caveat" to joining the group.
---
In this case, the warlock (or spriest) might not want competition on gear. Provided that one of them doesn't need any gear, it's a good synergy.
---
That's pretty much my point in favor of LC, when the optimal strategy for a DKP system is to form that cabal might just go all out. Not to say, forming that cabal can be satisfying, getting the players to work together instead of competing against each other. Which is one of the main points I really dislike about DKP as an idea.
---
He remembers right. paladin was kind of a buffbot, but that was changed later on.
---
We are playing the latest patch which for example has 15 minute buffs instead of 5, and no out of combat rez trick etc.
---
Paladin is the best (at least defensive) healer in pvp and the most efficient solo target healer in the game.
---
You sure? [Other websites list it as being added in 1.4](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Choker_of_the_Fire_Lord)
---
I like to do it in the high 20's. It's soloable at 28 and you also get instant poison 2 at this level. I didn't get beta access so I'm unsure if phase 1 has the lockboxes around the world to level lockpicking. If not, I'll use this to lockpick the chest to 150+. 
---
I did a run where I did just that, and had to use first aid to remove the poison to be able to stealth opener the boss goblin on respawn. 
---
If I had friends I'd probably just do it asap to make the 20-24 grind easier.
---
I could have sworn I saw a 4man with a shaman do it as well. Maybe I'm misremembering.
---
There's information on the internet about the situation but honestly I'm not comfortable fuelling potential fire on here.
---
Search google, you'll find your answers.
---
Make your own conclusion.
---
Give them a try, honestly you will have an amazing time. 
---
Find a decent group that doesn't just want to blaze through everything and there ought to be plenty of those around - I could find enough of those on p-servers for instance. Most boss fights in dungeons are tank and spank, meaning - nothing extraordinary or any convoluted tactics to know about. 
---
Don't stand in things that hurt (I mean, you wouldn't do that as a solo player either). It is often better to wait one to three seconds to attack after the tank has attacked, than to attack too soon. If you have CC and you see that there's a mob running towards the healer - CC it (gouge works wonders for those scenarios for instance), I wouldn't say that's a requirement to do so though so feel free to ignore it, but it helps. If you get aggro - move to the tank instead of running away. Don't break other people's CC (I mean, shit can happen it's not the end of the world... usually). If someone asks you to do something and you don't know what they mean, ask - most will be happy to explain or someone else will be "happy" to do it. I mean, there's the boss in Gnomeregan for instance where someone "has to" push a button once in a while it's not the most obvious thing in the world if you haven't done it before. If someone places Skulls and stars and moons and what not over mobs, the skull is generally the first mob that should die and if you're unsure... wait a few seconds before attacking and see what mobs the other dps are attacking. That's really about it. 
---
...and when you wipe (and it's almost inevitble sometimes), just put on:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXH7uJIVXZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXH7uJIVXZw) (and if it is a group wipe, corpse run like everyone else - no one likes lazy people)
---
Upvoted cause TBDM and BTBAM are god-tier.
---
This leads to raiders being encouraged or almost forced to spend their dkp on very minor upgrades or items they dont even really need or want, just because otherwise their dkp will decay anyway and they dont even know if during the rest of that raid or an entire raid-week anything for them might drop. Which also ends in a really bad system.
---
What does your comment mean?
---
Thank you!
---
There is a reason every tournament was entirely dominated by retail players, the game has moved on, and the people have been playing retail this entire time will walk over everyone in both pve and pvp fairly quickly.
---
I doubt they will launch Classic with MC only dropping a third of the items and no Majordomo chest. If anything should fall under the "exceptions" he's talking about, I think MC is a pretty compelling case.
---
* The thing is a large amount of those items needed to be added because a large amount of items were removed from molten core by patch 1.4. Like what? 64 itemish were removed. Caster system completely changed with the removal of negative spell penetration. Not to mention the realization that tier 1 was horrendously designed stat wise for the majority of classes along with very little loot diversity.
---
I love how they are suggesting that WoW was the cause of a suicide. The more likely scenario would be that he was mentally unwell prior to the game and that he used WoW as an escape mechanism.
---
he is talking about a relevant demand
---
So my initial assumption was correct after all?
---
Also it’s not about rewarding loyalty, it’s about rewarding work and providing a mechanism for reducing rng. It allows you to save up for the upgrade you want most or the last thing you need.
---
Your math argument makes sense, but again i feel like I need to point out that dkp isn’t a currency. I’m sure if you looked at their dkp roster you’d find many of them had even less than you. It doesn’t really matter. You never need to “pay back” anything.
---
You can make 8 wow accounts per bnet account.
---
Each wow account with active subscription can be used to play classic wow.
---
I use legacy talent calculator for andriod, dunno if it exists for ios..
---
You could fill the new dungeons with alt-sets to encourage clearing them. A warrior DPS set, priest/shaman/paladin/druid DPS sets, things like that. People would prioritise MC/BWL/AQ40 for the "progression sets" but for example BWL guilds would probably run MC2 for their alts or so their mains could get offspec sets.
---
It is now you bfakid.
---
I would guess it's because there are a load of mobs all spaced out so they can be easily killed singly.
---
You know how Warlocks excel against casters but struggle against physical DPS? You know how Alliance Warlocks have access to Blessing of Protection?
---
I think this spell alone, literally Blessing of Protection alone and by itself, overcomes and exceeds any benefit gained by WotF
---
Only care bears play easy mode. And it still not a thing lol.
---
HE WAS PLAYING A PALA IN CLASSIC!!! Of course he is violent and moody! Good thing he didn’t kill himself
---
I have, can't find anything, his name makes it awkward to search tbh.
---
Only bfa kids make fun of people who play differently to them. Its so a thing.

Using the centaur key to unlock the centaur chest in the barrens only to find a snapvine watermelon.

I'm still mad.

Nah, its not, pve = care bear since vanilla, so you can't be right. Still not a thing. Care bear.
---
I heard a rumor on my discord server (someone said it, dunno who) that layering is not being significantly tweaked to address none of the feedback.

Just remember, sap breaks stealth in Classic unless you talent for it which is mid way into subtlety.

okay so this a terrible idea but I'm prob gonna do it, thanks for sharing this lmao
---
I'm telling you to take the 'guides' with a grain of salt, because they contain misinformation. You can try to refute that but they are still inaccurate.
---
&gt; Anyone who's levelled like this before please weigh in.  
---
its not worth it. go combat.  
---
the combat talents are way enough for low level pvp. you still win, but you also don't gimp yourself for PvE.  
---
take imp sprint and call it a day.

i took that combo and it was great last time i played.  people talk a lot of shit just play teh damn game how you want to
---
undead is not better for pvp, troll is flat out better in both
---
Pals for Life (of Leeroy Jenkins fame) made some hilarious YouTube videos back in the day. Always seemed like a very fun guild to be a part is.
---
So is it a fact that they are inaccurate, just because you claim them to be?
---
Yeah, that's not how tier sets worked in Vanilla. If you were a healer, you were trying to farm your tier set, which was healing-oriented.
---
[Here's the Vanilla dev, Kevin Jordan, explaining why tier sets had to be role-specific.](https://clips.twitch.tv/NastyAnimatedHabaneroBleedPurple)
---
&gt; BfA Shaman has so little in common with vanilla that they can barely even be considered the same class. So I fail to see how that's relevant.
---
Okay you are right, cdew did walk over everyone on a brand new class he just learned then.
---
Hey, so I'm going to talk about mage and lock gameplay in pvp only here-
---
If you are solo you'll rely on succubus as a warlock wich can be quite boring, unless you try hard with consumables and do 1v2 or 1v3 at the same time (cus ppl saying 1vX but ennemies are coming one by one thats not 1vX but different 1v1). If you play sl you don't need consumables for 1v3 but the gameplay looks more like a chess game than anything else, or like a druid vs druid duel.
---
If you are solo as a mage,  you don't need to try hard with consumables and can do 1v3 more efficiently and have a lot of fun, if you like mage's gameplay
---
Now if you are not playing alone but as a team, mage is basically a peel machine that sheeps, cone of cold, nova, cs and then deal damage
---
Locks definitly have to spam curse of tongue but depending on your spec you mainly have to burst down the target your team focuses with soulfire/conflag or rely on your nightfall procs if you do enough curses even on the pet at the cost of losing gcds (you need to adapt and see if cursing a lot of ppl is viable depending on your comp and the ennemy comp, can they dispel, can your team burst or rely mainly on long time damage etc).
---
I feel like lock is way more interesting than mage in group environment overall because of that bursting potential and cursing gameplay, whereas mage  can have too but mostly if they go pom pyro wich is a totally viable spec but makes solo pvp less interesting.
---
If you like to cc multiple target and annoy the shit out of ppl go mage, if you like a more sneaky gameplay and huge bursting potential go lock.
---
Hope it helps,
---
Name a nerf that rogues got after that video came out.
---
Best place is to sit beside the horde flight point in felwood.  Mindcontrol afk people as they land, throw them off the cliff edge.  Assuming they don't slowfall they will die half way down on some cliffs that is only accessible via felwood, but their ghost will release in darkshore.
---
Venruki would get schooled by the better mage duelists I know.
---
In fact the level of play on that tournament was shoddy, a few players brought their a-game like Drakova but damn these guys like staysafe don't even hold position on their pet so they get caught in grenades. Venruki's grenadeplay was weak as hell too come to think of it.
---
Cdew largely ownef because the counters haven't come online at that level. Ele shaman is ridic easy to play at that point.
---
Mark of Tyranny is BiS forever but smoking heart is 2nd best for a good while.
---
But I need that food for reasons
---
There are Vultures in the Tauren starting zone called "Swoop".
---
Little rogue ofc.
---
I'm well aware the tier sets were spec specific, I don't see what your point is. People would do runs of on-farm dungeons for other items that had DPS stats. For example in I think MC there was a ring that usually went to Hunters or Rogues that Druids wanted for DPS, so once MC was on farm people would raid it every so often on off nights to try to scoop up things like that.
---
Facts don't need anyone's approval, and exist without your consent.
---
Because if you rely on one skill/passive to win you’re not good?? It’ll help you every once in a while for sure, but never as consistent as skill
---
people always get scared when Germans get organised about something
---
I have grind routes that put me about 19 hours slower than Johana but that if I really balls to the wall no life it. I come out with more gold though and I can't stand questing so it works for me. I can just zone out and watch anime while mashing sinister strike on mobs faces.
---
Are you for real? Is that what a fact mean to you?
---
TL;DR your assumptions are seemingly not based on game design philosophy at all and your entire wall of text is therefor meaningless. Sorry.
---
First of all: You are making way **too many assumptions**. Your entire thesis of "the spirit of vanilla" was community and the various reasons for why Blizzard did anything are **just assumptions.** Seriously just watch the Classiccast youtube videos with Kevin Jordan or watch his stream.
---
The only real valid point you make is that the retail version of today and the vanilla of old are different and can't be compared to one another from a game design point of view.
---
The whole idea behind vanilla was to let the players be the content by giving them the opportunity to engage with each other through the world. This was emphasized more than anything else, even loot (while loot being one of the few ways for character progression, at a certain point players were forced to cooperate to get better loot). It was an RPG and many of the RPG elements they wanted to add they simply didn't have the time to do in a way that they deemed appropriate **(very saddened by this as I personally would have loved to see more character progression options and further character customization that made every player more unique)**. 
---
With the launch of TBC many of the core mechanics of the game were changed which essentially means the old spirit died and a new spirit was born. Token grinds, daily quest grinds, flying mounts, loot changes, ilvl changes, leveling changes, world changes, player interaction changes, there are so many things that it was already a different game. Again, just watch or even chat with Kevin Jordan.
---
Probably yes. The way I see it RP is a way to be able to keep playing the game even when you have your full T3 set, you are a warlord/grand marshal, maxed your professions and grinded so much gold you wish you could sell it for real money and retire.
---
So even of blizz does not implement TBC and WoTLK servers and you have done everything possible in classic, RP will still give you new stories and adventures to embark upon.
---
I guess the worry stems from there not currenrly being a drop-down selector for classic?
---
&gt; Venruki would get schooled by the better mage duelists I know.
---
Hahaha, okay yeah. My dad can beat up your dad.
---
Joana himself is updating it. 
---
He says he has a guy working on a addon for classic with his updated guide
---
if all you do is solo, pvp and 5 mans, Sub is a perfectly fine spec to play.
---
Play what you want.

Makes very little sense that one of the centaur clans would just forgive you killing off their leaders, stealing food and attacking them just because you betrayed the other clan you chose to side with. 
---
But that’s WoW classic for you
---
Laughs in druid
---
In my memory: all specs are very strong. Shamans are generally strong vs casters. Good rogues, warriors and hunters can be hard, but very doable.
---
Some 1v1s should be played in a bursty way, but many matchups require a slow approach, so it's quite varied.
---
Keep in mind that it's been some time ago for me :)
---
Bfa kid.
---
&gt; that should be a simple task.
---
I mean, he did win one and come in second or third in the other behind Snutz and Venruki.
---
So I guess the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
---
Man the longest he's even played for is 12 hours. That's a causal hobby not an addiction. Try 24 hours plus then we'll talk.
---
Lol
---
Oh all righty :)
---
that wasn't just condescending but borderline dehumanizing. like they weren't even real people.
---
I speak french and I want to play on a RP-PvP server, and although I am perfectly okay with speaking english, this is not what I'm looking for in Classic. I wish there would be a RP-PvP realm in my language like there was back in the days, but I have lost hope. So I will go on a PvP server and RP there along with my Rp-PvP guild.
---
He played gnome during beta, he had a command in his twitch stream, he said it many times. Any warrior or rogue on alliance should be going gnome, (for pvp that is)
---
My father is a 60 year old bloke. He started gaming casually in the PS1 era. He's never been into computing though so online gaming was new to him when he picked up a PS3.
---
Fast forward like 15 years to now. In 3 weeks, we have a 30 year mechanic from Portugal, a 32 year old waitress form Germany, two 2x year old Swedish students, a 40 year old female coder from Seattle, a 50 year old bloke from Florida who makes concrete posts and his 50 year old wife, all coming over to some shit hole of a poor town in the UK that nobody would ever go to, just to meet a 60 year old welder (and each other) who have all met online.
---
Me and my dad have met friends online and have travelled to different countries to go their weddings - one lad even asked my dad to be the best man (he declined because he couldn't speak the language and didn't want to do a speech in English).
---
I know that not many people say 'online friends aren't real friends' any more but man - with stories like this and when you're chilling on mic on a friday night drinking beers and laughing with these guys - what else is a friendship?
---
I sometimes go full boomer and can get frustrated about the morons that were brought online through mass internet connectivity, but man whenever you hear stories of older folk getting into the technology and making lasting friendships...well it's super fucking cool.
---
you apply to guild, raid with them, discord with them, so on so on and can't tell if there are some shady asses in guild management or normal decent guys? Majority of top guilds  made of good people used and will use loot councils class councils etc to have to explain that lol
---
I downvoted you because you complained about the downvotes. 
---
Which I do myself sometimes but I am a hypocrite so that's okay.
---
Its a good demonstration but does not show how its used really well.   
---
In the video, you are faking leeway by doing character movement in a stationary position. When do you ever see that in a pvp situation?
---
Lots off classes actually used it

&lt;HATE&gt; Ragnaros EU in vanilla
---
This means that MC2's difficulty would have to match a raid that is “on farm.” It's essentially catch-up gear at that point. You wouldn't be able to tune it to be progression-difficulty, since it's for off-specs to gear up after-the-fact.
---
That seems problematic.
---
For anyone coming into the game after MC2 has been “released,” it completely negates having to do MC proper. Furthermore, what does this mean for the later tiers, like BWL and Naxx? 
---
Won't this new Ret/Balance/Elemental gear completely throw progression out of whack since those raids weren't designed with those specs in mind?
---
Weapons permit for an oversized kitchen knife lol
---
I think it's one of their songs?
---
Are we talking about retail or vanilla-wotlk?
---
Dude..... I hadn’t heard Tool since I was a kid and had completely forgotten. I’ve just played The Pot and wow Thankyou what a blast from the past!
---
There’s a few out there, a lot of people have made there own guides. I’d just google a few and tweak them to your preferences.
---
Do you like chain heal? I mean really like it? 
---
Then shaman could be the class for you!
---
What fights? Sure in casual content like MC.
---
Razorgore vael chromaggus and Nef when relevant will tax your mana.
---
As will twin emps, viscidous,ouro and cthun in aq40.
---
And nearly all of naxx (other than faerlina both and hieigan - if you avoid mana burn) has longer fights.
---
This post is shit
---
Apologies I am not up to date on things - did Blizz say layering would be in place until phase 2?
---
Berserking doesn't work with channeled spells.
---
Why would it throw progression out of whack? You'd still need healers and tanks for future raids, so you'd still need T1 geared healers to tackle BWL.
---
It means MC2's difficulty would match MC's difficulty. They'd be on the same level. 
---
I don't see why it means MC becomes obsolete. If you want to do BWL or BWL2 you'd need MC-geared healers and tanks.
---
I think maintaining multiple lists is a necessity with this system. Otherwise people are going to ignore upgrades to save their spot for that one highly desired item, e.g. Nelth's Tear.
---

I level shaman to max level in Wrath and it was my first max level character in any expansion. I started as enhancement and switched to ele/resto once I reached grizzly hills I think. I loved healing so much! I loved it so much that I eventually started tanking so I could be a better healer. Then I fell in love with tanking. Making the healers life easier, trying to please all the dps and ultimately leading new players in content they've yet to experience. I plan on healing as a shaman in classic because I love the windfury totem and chain heal and reincarnation. My only concern at this point is having too many alts to play them all completely before the phase expires and we move on to the next one. I am very anxious to join a guild and make friends and progress through the content exactly like I did in Wrath but without the fear of the game changing too drastically and then I lose interest... like I did in the expansions post-Wrath.
---
Wrong, wrong, right about actvision only thinking in numbers, wrong, wrong, awfully wrong. Fucking NEET. Dont pretend, it just looks super cringe.

Warstomp combos seem awesome. Stun resist is always good. Seeing if there is anything to sway me over the edge.

Slipknot isn't metal, it's pop.
---
Following your original logic it would be a mix of need/greed and loot council.
---
I want to play Hunter (horde), but i never played horde in classic (Got exp from dwarf Hpriest and gnome mage).  But hunters looks incredibly Nice to play and I would like to have a fairly easy run to 60.
---
Will hunter stay relevant for both PvE and PvP (mere semi-hardcore) and what race / professions should i be choosing?
---
Foo Fighters?? bleugh
---
Skill gaps don't disappear by the bad players getting better, because the good players just get even better. It's always a meta game type of thing anyway, where the good players will just know exactly what to do to destroy worse players. Even if the bad players play slightly better, if the good player knows exactly what they're going to do you can just stay 1 step ahead.
---
The only way that the skill gap goes away is if you just scare off all the bad players, but that wasn't at all the case even in private servers. With the appeal of an official release that'll be even less the case in Classic.
---
You may think it went away over the course of expansions, as it has indeed gotten rare to see such things in retail over the years, but that's mostly because of stat changes, primarily survivability changes. You can't just burst someone that quickly or CC for long/multiple people. That was the real block to the 1v3's etc., as it still occurs all the time on private servers.
---
World of Roguecraft is a trap, because it was on a different patch than what Classic is going to be.
---
I think most of those people would still be decent nowadays, they'd just have to catch up with the meta of how the game has evolved in the last decade and a bit. 
---
The overall average aptitude of players will be higher than it used to be when the game was completely new. Tthanks to it all being drawn out for you on various websites on the internet, you can improve drastically in a short amount of time, if you're interested in it as well. That said,  there will always be players who don't really care about that aspect of the game and they'll likely be the ones you see at the butt end of good people's PVP encounters in videos.
---
Ele stomps warriors though. Not even fair given equal skill.
---
you just know some midwestern suburban mom saw that part and said to herself "that settles it, I'm definitely bringing this up at the next PTA meeting" while she popped a xanny and took another swig of red wine.
---
PVE or PVP? If PVP you'll be strong as a spriest in WPVP and random BGs until other classes start getting AQ/Naxx gear, at which point you'll start to struggle a bit unless you also raid. You'll be pretty poor in premade BGs and unlikely to get an invite.
---
As a warlock you start to dominate once you get serious raid gear and you'll be more useful in premade BGs.
---
For PVE I doubt you'll get a raid spot as a spriest unless you want to join a casual guild while warlocks will be in more demand.

I just played around your tool and had the following criteria: shaman, dps caster, phase 1, minimum level 55. I am not 100% sure on how the phases go, but I saw a lot of T2 items that drop from BWL on the list, but isn't BWL not added until a later phase?

I had Mark of tyranny and Mark of the chosen. That way you don't have a lot of pressure leveling Enchanting for the trinket. Both of them are really top tier trinkets.

I've been adding songs to this for 10 years soon but it has some newer stuff as well but every song is from a pvp movie from warcraftmovies I've seen at one point or another. Somehow it already has 200+ followers even though I never shared the link before too.
---
I completely agree with your overall statement - the best loot system is the one that is discussed and agreed on by everyone involved. 
---
I'd just like to discuss a couple of points of the DKP system though which I somewhat disagree with.
---
Regarding hoarding/decay - this can be resolved (fairly) by tinkering with the numbers and testing out various scenarios in a spreadsheet to find what works best.
---
For the Guild I'm running, 6 hours of raiding over 2 nights works for our system. 100 max points to be gained per week. 10% decay under 200 points and a further 20% decay on all points over 200.
---
The decay allows you to miss 4 weeks of raiding and only miss the equivalent value of one item. On the other end the system starts to punish hoarders at about 6 weeks worth of no DKP spent.
---
That said our system is slightly different as 30 DKP is the max that can be spent to bid on an item, with a further 30 DKP deducted for winning the item. 
---
As for the problem of player &gt; guild loot system. I've devised a "priority sheet" which basically gives an order that certain classes can roll/bid on items. This should make it so loot goes to suitable candidates. It's still ofc possible that a more geared mage can win an upgrade which would benefit a less geared mage more, so it's not perfect, however regular raiding should provide for the active.
---
If you can find a fun guild full of friends don’t be afraid of loot council. I raided with Nocturnal into Naxx with loot council and had tons of fun because we were happy for each other.
---
Guessing it's email.
---
Well if you compare it to Atreyu or Mudvayne, it sure as hell is heavier than those lmao. Look man, I don't like Slipknot either but you can't deny what they are: metal.
---
It did not help at all. Here is my perspective:  
---
Mage solo: Incredible hard in 1vX situations, unless you are fighting 2 warriors. Many classes can shut down mages, and many classes cant be bursted down that easily. Very good in 1v1 situations, but good hunters, warlocks and shadowpriests will kill you. Rogues might have a chance too with the right items.   
---
Mage team: Incredible fun in 1vX. You have the freedom to do cc, do some dmg, and a good counterspell can change the battlefield. Mage are REALLY good in teamfights and really fun too !  
---
Warlock solo: Warlocks are insane in 1vX. You have the HP pool, you have deathcoil. You have consistent dmg from dots + semi good bursts aswell. You have healthstone, spellstone, soulstone. You are not easily locked down by any classes like mages are (Beside rogues) 1vX are really fun as warlocks and in many situations you can win a 1v2.  
---
Warlock team: Incredible boring. Your main job is tongue, and do some dmg, but thats pretty much it. You dont feel like doing anything special, or making any gamechanging plays. 1 Warlock in group pvp or premade is good, but you never go with 2.
---
Fuck are you talking about. I can’t decide how you should play, but you missed the fukin mark when it comes to all those things that makes this game amazing. Maybe try BFA for that singleplayer experience?
---
&gt; The point being: If Blizz does not offer RP-PVP and then later reverses their opinion, I will not have the willpower to start over.  
---
If you are a true RP-PVPer, you WILL start over, because that is the GAME STYLE you love, no matter if Blizzard adds RP-PVP realms in Summer of 2020.
---
Don't need it, can just tune in to Asmongold's stream for shitty boomer music.
---
Havent been checking news since weeks, so they dont plan Rp-PvP at launch?
---
I think the speed record now is about three days to level 60. I think the hype on private servers last easily 2 weeks the fact that this has more stability I imagine it's going to remain popular for at least a month
---
Almost nobody cared about RPPvP servers until Blizz said we wouldn't get them
---
Since most of the BiS spreadsheets floating around are way wrong for elemental shaman, I posted a realistic gearing guide for the MC/BWL stage. It still gets referenced in the class discord so I figured I'd repost it.

This is the mundane type of story I came to this thread for.

I had a great time in a loot council guild on a private server, I was a fresh 60 that my class leader picked up and tossed me in for some reason. After a trial week in which they helped me get a lot of my preraid bis I never once felt passed over, made great friends with my fellow rogues and was always happy to see them get loot as well.
---
TL;DR loot council is great if you make friends in your guild and have the goal of making progress.
---
He can pull it off for maybe 1 nova in 20. What about the rest of the 19?
---
Think before you try to justify stuff kid.
---
Yeah i'm not speaking about speed records, but about the average time it will take for the average player :)
---
I'm not sure if I can play and pay attention to an audiobook at the same time. I did it during the Wrath with a few Harry Potter books but I didn't get everything. I usually just catch up on Netflix shows and animes and movies
---
Until you get stuck with a stupid demon name :'(
---
I’m expecting to hit 60 between 1-2 months simply because I don’t have as much time to play as much as I used to, but still will dedicate majority of my free gaming time to this

So with 2 hours playtime every day, so 14 hours a week, this would mean the average player reaches 60 after around 16- 17 weeks, so around 4 months.
---
can you add the ally side pls?
---
Yes! Me, my GF and all of our friends will play on RP-PvP (RP-PvE if Blizzard for some odd reason don't add RP-PvP).
---
RBGs are a totally different thing. Strategy there is dictated by different speed values and a lot more utility. In classic strategy is more about placement and movement like on a chessboard. In retail the utility you have to account for unpredicted situations is a lot more. RBGs are the most complicated form of PVP, you can't compare it to duels or arenas.
---
Hunter benefits from berserking the least. If you pop it at full health you gain 10% increased attack speed to your autoshots. And autoshots is not the most of your dps anyway in late game. Even withax haster at 40%health the bonus is minimal.
---
If you want min maxing for pvp orc is best for both  because of total of 30% stun resist. And if you are not taking damage bloodrage(dont remember if correct name) will be more of a benefit.
---
The difference is in the amount of alone time. I need 3-6 hours per day to function optimally. That had everything to do with being introverted
---
Dispel magic is your bread-and-butter for priest utility. Find a good warrior and spam dispel him, he will absolutely destroy enemy casters. 
---
I don't think disc offers that much more offensive ability compared to holy. You will still oom quickly in pvp. So more efficient heals is better imo, considering the above comment about dispel. Up to you though.
---
just jump before hitting shift lol, it's an OP keybind mate
---
Reading the list gives me shivers, because there are SO MANY songs I binge listened during these days  
---
Thank you for doing this man!
---
Thats the way i did it last night, hoping i could import sets.
---
I take it proper support is on the way?
---
I have this very vague memory that Vurtne had like 2.4k rating in arena much later, which makes him very good but not one of the greats. 
---
But today's pvp isn't as exciting to follow as old pom pyro madness,l.
---
Who says he's ignorant? You? Your word means nothing. But even if he's ignorant, it is something to be proud of. Because when one is ignorant, they can learn more and enjoy the process of learning more.

Joanas Route is fine, the times are results of other factors
---
I only play horde. Had bad experiences with alliance players back in the day and refuse to go back.
---
Been toying with the idea of how to do talents in 100% enhance, instance levelup build. Going with bit mixed group, i think it was warrior, shaman, hunter, warlock and priest. 
---
Is it worth going resto for -25% totem mana cost, increased range and extra hit at start. You are delaying flurry and +5% crit for 14 levels and other than that, the real downside is not having 2h axe skill when you might get corpsemaker at L29-30ish. But you potentially could do totem mastery then rush 2h axes for L31, then take the 3% hit.
---
Something like this: [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?c=shaman&amp;t=xzx3x4x5x6xtxZx0x1x2xDBoBpBqBrBsycyCyDyEyFykxxxGxHyfyxyeywydypyqyrysyjyiJkJlJwJmJnJoJpJqBnJxw4w\~w-xaxb](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?c=shaman&amp;t=xzx3x4x5x6xtxZx0x1x2xDBoBpBqBrBsycyCyDyEyFykxxxGxHyfyxyeywydypyqyrysyjyiJkJlJwJmJnJoJpJqBnJxw4w~w-xaxb)
---
Or even leave it at 4/5 totem mastery to get axe at L29 if you have it.
---

Or just plain go nuts on enhance and conserve your mana for totem casts and move movement.

---
Any ideas / comments ?
---
AAP Classic already exists tho
---
A racial is just another tool like any engi tool. That would mean good racials are almost mandatory. :o
---
What if the mage is good and jukes your juking? Anyone saying that stuff like EA isnt good for PvP just has no clue about the game.
---
Haha apparently I was listening to all the wrong music! I was 14 when I was big into WoW and I just listened to my little red alarm clock radio for music while I played. I didn’t have a fancy computer or speakers but I had a great time.
---
I wouldn't pick LW as it is highly likely that devilsaur is farmed by guilds, this is especially a problem if you are on a pvp server. 
---
Pick pick herb and another prof (ench will be expensive on first char so maybe alch or tailor instead), save money on pots, spent saved money on gear.
---
I prefer human do to the spirit. 
---
Fear ward is overrated imo. A competent MT will know how to stance dance to avoid fears. The fights for fear ward are Magmadar (can be dispelled, and can be outranged), Nefarian (fear is on a timer, has casting animation), Onyxia phase 3 (same as Nef).
---
There was though.
---
Mages and Warlocks stacked int for maximum mana, warriors always move forward, retribution paladins existed, Night Elf Hunters shouldnt use guns, warriors were blacksmiths etc.
---
Cowardly moving out of sight is for Rogues, Damage Meters are useless.
---
All that stupid shit existed back then and many many peopled adhered to these principles for way to long, some might to this day :P but way fewer
---
Druid bear alt, tanking dungeons and stealth to avoid the bored level 60s in the first wave.
---
In the original game, not doing what I was doing, took 5 months: April 2005.
---
that includes spending two weeks in Elwynn Forest because I thought Elwynn Forest was the entire world:
---
- you push **M** and there's the map
---
- ok, I guess that's the game
---
There was that river to the south; but we could see level skull creatures there. That was probably the game designers way of hiding the bounding box of the universe.
---
When I discovered you can right click to zoom out, I could not believe how much there was. And then when I tried to right click again: I could not fathom the vastness.
---
Tauren is an anagram for nature?! Mind blown.
---
Aye. It's worth having 1 point just so you never see Resists from it. I THINK there is a base 5% chance to resist. That one point should take care of that. Resists absolutely suck and it's very easy to avoid. 2 doesn't seem to be worth it unless it's PvE - Where creatures can be higher level and such.
---
Same, well, except I care a lot about layering but Blizz are implementing it really well I think (having it at the start, removing it later). I just wanna play!!
---
Still a beter storyline than BFA
---
There wasn't though.
---
See I can do that too.
---
Some stupid people existed, but that doesn't mean it was a preconceived notion.
---
Don't know him, may also be that perp considers the guy a good mage because he's a solid premade player or good in the mage vs rogue matchup. Could also be that dueling at 40 throws off the established 60-duelist since the standard algorithm might get thrown over its head.
---
I don't mean to say that Snutz or Cdew are bad players, they aren't. WoW dueling at least isn't that hard and something even a mediocre gamer like myself can master.
---
But yes, I know a few mages I'd put serious money on against players like Venruki. Especially considering that all they've done now for months on end is duel on private servers with instant-refresh cooldowns. I.e. they spam duels for hours and hours on end.
---
😀
---
If you're confused, loot everything then ditch the food is what he's saying. Then the chest will respawn with full items.
---
Dropped ur pants
---
This is great. One minor suggestion: the weapon select button would probably be better placed near the weapon progression list, for easier change.
---
Maybe they had some special code in place like all those others that prevented bosses to lose all their armor. But even if not then I wouldn't think it'll make much of a difference. From what it looks you'll be much more threat capped in classic than on private servers. So that melee could do more damage in theory won't help you much if they already pull aggro without that extra dps.
---
Berserking mana burn would be disgustingly good against paladins...
---
...just saying.
---
My idea is to make 2 characters and a bank alt on the 13th of august; A rogue main and a mage alt, and try to stick with them as long as possible. I might lvl a lock or hunter as well, not quite sure yet, every class seems fun atm tbh. One of my friends is an altoholic, and if I know him right he'll never ding 60. I don't wanna fall in the same trap.
---

So much Slipknot and SOAD at the time for me!

Watch a few videos of high end raiding in vanilla and look at the debuffs on the boss.
---
If you dont believe me after that i cant help you
---
Totally agree, don’t forget hibernate and scare beast ;)
---
It was so brief I couldn't recall.  My most vivid memory from that application and my departure was my warlock friend failing to kill his inner demon on Leotheras, becoming mind controlled, death coiling the main tank, and wiping the raid.  His application was not accepted lol.
---
What in all fuck does vanilla debuffs on a boss have to do with a PvP related claim that a warrior "must always move forward" in vanilla?
---
🎵With a honey in the middle there's some leeway🎵
---
Ty, good to know.
---
From memory I think I hit 60 in 11 days in Vanilla on a rogue. 30 days seems crazily high. I did it in 14 days recently and that was with farming honor to rank 6 + exalted with AV. I also levelled engineering+tailoring to 300 and generally enjoyed myself taking my time, I didn't use a levelling guide. 
---
I only ran 4 dungeons though, perhaps I saved a lot of time there.
---
Warlock main, Priest alt
---
It’s so neat to associate songs to memories, for me listening to any foo fighters just puts me back in Un’Goro Crater.
---
Best of luck getting the staff this next go around!
---
That there were people at all levels of play doing stupid shit because thats what youre supposed to do instead of what actually makes sense.
---
You really only need to be not retarded to be able to play and enjoy some 5mans if the opportunity arises. Just keep an eye out on chat if people are looking for one more for their group if it's something at your level! 
---
It's often a fun experience, and the rewards can be huge compared to most solo play!
---
Latency will never be bigger than spell batch window
---
I think you're reading too much into it. In general, warrior is a class that fights toe-to-toe, hence "supposed to go forward."
---
Yes. I don't disagree that there were stupid people. I do disagree that it was because you were "supposed to" and I **definitely** disagree that "always move forward" was ever one of these supposed things.
---
People associate such behavior with toxic animosity, when really it was just busting balls.  Which is why I said by today's standards it would be a "toxic" environment.  And how today's gaming climate will absolutely shape the Classic experience.  It's not going to be quaint chats, well wishes, and grats on leveling when anyone shouts "ding" in the zone.
---
Yeah, this is also a very possible scenario. However a good geared spriest can dish out good enough dmg. He will always have oom issues in long fights though but if you're willing to farm enough consumables for progression raiding then you'll be fine. 
---
Again, it's a lot of work and needs quite some time investment and that's why I said you'd probably be better of with some other dps classes.
---
In general the warrior does. So either I'm not reading too much into it or it's a redundant way to word it.
---
Mage main. Warrior/Rogue and Priest alt eventually. Not rushing the alts though.
---
Or roll Night Elf and shadowmeld:D

---
&gt; Answer: those players are free to leave to a different, better guild if they feel that they vastly outclass their guildies 
---
Yes, this is my point, lol. This is the reason DKP is so bad. Well on of them. In Communist countries the Docotrrs leave and the Taxi drivers stay and the Taxi drivers will forever struggle in MC/Ony while the Doctors farm the cool raids.
---
On the other hand if they suspect there may be purgers in BRM they might pop every consume/buff in their bags so you are likely to purgs something insignificant. Good luck purging a world buff or a flask from someone with 32 buffs.
---
You're no one.
---
I might plug this here:
---
To play classic, I simply can buy a sub for my bnet account (on which I've never played WoW befor) and then log into classic without the need to buy a base version or something right?
---
It's the biggest red flag when joining a guild.
---
Can't wait for classic!
---
As a healer all I ask of rogues is to heal poisons in dungeons so I don't get blamed for it!
---
I was combat throughout most of vanilla because I was a progression raider.  Most non-raiding rogues that I knew were usually sub for PvP.  Even now when I play with talent calculator, not matter how much I try to deviate and experiment I always keep coming back to 15/31/5 combat, I just can't help it.
---
If I get the time then 100% a fury warrior. I know I won't have the time to be a hunter in aq40 but fury warriors are easy enough to be relevant with if you know what you're doing and have uncapped potential. 
---
Also execute spamming bosses is a really cathartic experience. Good fun.
---
I believe YOU are being targeted for the ADs, not the Subreddit itself.
---
The game is designed around teaming up with other players in order to complete objectives. If you only stick with solo content, then you are missing out on half of the game.
---
be a healbot in premades til rank 14

Nobody knows but this is a good point. It´s still 39 days so what should we do beside speculating :D

You heal and get your of set when your guild has raids on farm.

I used to listen a lot to Dirty Vegas while playing, so much so have regathered it all for 27/Aug :D

&gt;, for example Monkeynews systematic kiting of casters as a warrior had me kind of baffled; people would have laughed back in the days as you were a hard warrior, you are supposed to go forward at all times. 
---
I don't think this is necessarily true. There were warriors who understood swing timer kiting. Watch laintime bob in and out of range, and make a beeline away when a paladin bubbles. I don't think he ever stepped away from a casters max range, but that would have been the next step if BC hadn't come out before people figured the game out to that extent.
---
So godamn true :D
---
Warlock is for intellectuals.
---
Fury does OK in PvP, and you have an extra way to prevent Fear which can be useful if you're not Undead, and it both boosts damage served and taken. You get some more heals, and more attack speed easily with Flurry. You can even do 2H Fury, which is honestly probably a lot better than 2x1H. The really nice part is the Improved Intercept, which can be combined with a PvP Gear piece from BGs that brings it down to a whopping 15 second cooldown total. Arms(31/20) is still better though, as you get most of Fury(up through Enrage), Improved Hamstring(btw it's worth spamming once you can reduce it's cost by 5 with I think two specific gear pieces), Sword Spec, 2H damage, and Mortal Strike(it just hits the hardest out of all good abilities). I mean technically Bloodthirst hits harder, but you won't be walking around in PvP with 1300 AP at all times let alone possibly ever haha. Mortal Strike will just simply be stronger almost always as long as you upgrade your weapons, which you will.
---
For PvE, either is fine but 2H Fury is probably better. You'll definitely want a 20/31 build. 1H Fury is probably the best for Raids, at least IMO. Windfury Shaman are your best friend at all times throughout the entire games, along with Paladins and anything that provides heals and/or free movement. 
---
Orcs for the major fucking win btw. The perfect warrior.
---
Sure, assess a classes levelling speed by the times of the fastest levellers of each class. That seems reliable. It's ont like more factors than the classes levelling capability play into this like online time, account sharing, aoe farming possibilities, group composition or just getting ahead of the pack etc. etc.
---

---
don't bet on it.  
---
players dump an unholy amount of time into preparation these days.
---
There is one exception:  
---
If you are completely out of money and all of your gear is broken, then you need money, at least if you are a melee class.
---
The average player these days is alot closer to the skill 'ceiling' than before, which is to be expected with a 15+ year old game. 
---
Vurtne was probably the highest skilled player back in the day, but people generally have come a long way mechanically at this game. The top pvpers today are certainly better now than he was in his day, but I think you could make the argument that the gap between the average player and Vurtne in 2005/2006 is waaaaay larger than the gap between average player and today's top players. 
---
People today still watch his videos not because of his incredible skill. That level of skill is average or even below average for todays top players. We still watch because it's incredible to see just how far ahead of his time he was.
---
That´s not true. It was never intended to head to Darnassus. The underwater section has been implemented because the tunnnel was so dark an broing. John Staats (original WoW Leveldesigner) confirmed this in countdown2classic.
---
Then can you explain why a lot of private server pvpers are able to get retail glad easily?
---
Maybe it's called Eagle eye then. In any case, it was basically the same spell: Click on a spot on screen anywhere and move your viewpoint to it.
---
He’s not a Human Rogue though. He’s mostly played Dwarf and Orc.
---
RP-PVP &gt; RP &gt; PVE &gt; PVP in my honest opinion. I felt that people on RP-PvP actually cared a lot more about actually playing the game over just plainly RPing in cities and goldshire. Having great World PvP events etc.
---
I didn't play on Argent Dawn EU for a long time though, mostly on Steamwheedle Cartel before going to Defias Brotherhood. So it might have been better on AD =)
---
*sip*
---
Would you mind elaborating what happened to your hardcore rp guild and why are you done with rp-servers?
---
I still Rp on retail. As someone else said, it's an excellent way to entertain yourself between content - because Rp is essentially cooperative improv, following an evolving story. It isn't dependent on the game world's story, though it can be enriched by it. After all, the world is the backdrop, the set dressing, if you will. So no, I have no fears about Rp dying. It'll be there, and if you find a good group of people, it'll be enjoyable.
---
This is what I’m planning aswell. The times I’m not running dungeons with mates at the launch lan party I plan to mostly grind. 
---
Mind sharing your grind route?
---
Because they are already retail players?
---
"Explain how people who are playing both private servers and live wow, can be good at live wow!"
---
&gt;but you can't deny what they are: metal.
---
The folks over at r/metal would call slipknot nu-metal, and mudvayne isn't far off either.
---
From what I've gathered I this subredit, Leeway means a Tauren can stand in Booty Bay and as long as he's moving, he can pick off lowbies in Darnassus. Therefore; Blizz should remove layering.
---
When I'm crossing the road nowadays I check 4 times instead of 2 just to be sure and not die before wow classic is released.
---
&gt; I cant do 20 hour audiobooks 3 times xD
---
Sure you can. At least if you're farming Brood reputation for a few hundred hours :)
---
/r/unethicalprolifetips

I mean thats typical counter but then you are litterally burning there gold? Wait correct me if im wrong but iirc you can purge class buffs but i dont think you cant purge consumes can you?

'Kharanos Glass Wares' -The original Yeti Cooler
---
Warlock main, Rogue and/or Shaman alt. Depending on how much time I have in 2020.
---
Well.... lets nitpick that a bit, shall we ? :)
---
In private servers, vanilla raids were... 40man. And pretty much nobody ran shadowpriests (especially because of 8 debuff slots and high armor values). Certain playerbase can actually just sustain X number of guilds. Guilds die ALL the time. Guilds recruit, usually trying to get already geared good players from lower tier guilds. Higher up you go, more they will they demand from you.
---
So if you arent like friends that raid together, friends of the officer its not going to happen a lot. But for PUG raids, well that could happen. Those are sometimes desperate to get anyone there. And they dont want a 11th mage.
---
Berserking speeds up aimed shot, and bloodrage is only melee ap.
---
You only need to be able to hit 2.4k for glad
---

Most people's experience with perceived 'corrupt' loot council is merely their own bias. Loot council is fair much more often than it's not.

It's supposed to be gone by the time there's world bosses.

That means that it should be gone by phase 2 at least.

Dude ugh. I have health issues, and whenever I feel the pain of them I think extra hard about doing another checkup at the doc. Am so terrified I’ll be in the hospital for the release. Messed up I know - not like I don’t feel all the usual stuff 2, sad for my parents and gf, not wanting to die and what not, but having dealt with this shit a while, if I’m about to be over then let me at least get to experience this fkin thing I’ve wanted for a decade.
---
Live to Win is in there!
---
&gt; which may cause them to need 20 days /played or even more
---
Eh, wasn't it already proven on numerous occasions that *on average* a player needed around 300-320 hours back in the day to reach level 60? I think you're exaggerating a lot with the 20 days /played.
---
Rogues killing naked was easier early when other classes were a bit worse and rogues weren't very balanced. It can be done in 1.12 but a lot harder.
---
Yeeeeeeah..... no.
---
 Seeing World of Roguecraft own R14s with naked starting daggers &amp; watching undergeared talent dominate 4 people in T2.5 was what made vanilla so special, nowadays the average player will be too good for such stuff to happen?   
---
This is not skill in any shape or form. Rogues were just busted. IN 1.12 is a bit better
---
Naah.. it's like hammer smashed face, once you've heard the Disney version of it, it ruins the original, can't listen to without hearing the disney tunes . Same with Slipknot, everyone that I know who listened to it, also listened to modern pop, so it kind of fused in my brain, the only "heavier" things they listened to was slipknot, and disturbed to an extent, otherwise it was all pop, so I've drawn the conclusion that they go hand in hand :p. I'm just not a big fan of nu Metal, it ruins the genre, people like Justin bieber could claim being a metalhead, cause he likes slipknot. I don't think that's fair.
---
I believe August 30th.
---
Actually, AoE leeway was not occurring in the beta.
---
Additionally, ranged classes arent always spamming instant cast skill?? They often want to get out of melee range before casting spells. With the current system you have to guess "I know I'm currently getting meleed but I bet if I stop moving now I'm in the leeway zone and can cast without being hit for a moment". It completely changes the feel of pvp for ranged classes.
---
Finally, it is my understanding that this "leeway" mechanic isnt actually leeway. Leeway is when I start a melee attack and you exit my range the melee attack still finishes. This was classic. What is happening in the beta is what I just mentioned AND extra distance on melee range when we are both moving targets. This second mechanic was introduced in cata. This is not classic. This is what leads to some of the more absurd videos that we have seen from beta.
---
We can both agree that a mechanic that fundamentally changes how melee works and *wasn't* in classic, shouldn't be in classic. Right?
---
Seems difficult because no warrior or hunter wants to compete with you for gear.
---
It can ofc be done but it's quite harder now. But a rogue can without a doubt stunlock someone to death using evisc. Especially clothies.
---
They have a higher crit chance and higher mana pool. The amazing thing about it is that it stacks with gear. The better gear the more mana and more crit. So it gets better as you level. Escape artist is also very good. Humans in comparison don’t really stack up caster wise. They are a melee buffed race.
---
Oh well then fuck retail!!!

The Blade Itself books are excellent. You don't really appreciate their brilliance the first time you listen to them. The author is a psychologist, and it really shows. The "critical failure" books are also brilliant, but in a very different way...
---
Also excellent: Orconomics. Aside from everything else, these books have the most touching, most BIZARRE love story I've ever read.  
---
And I don't like love stories. But this one is really good.
---
It isn't harder now. It is actually easier because eviscerate will scale with your gear. It is also easier because garrote does more damage, vanish doesn't bug and delete your combo points, and other changes. It is only harder if you're naked.
---
Lol trust me you need broken tooth.
---
You know it's 30 days /played we're talking about, right? You think the first time you were playing you've hit level 60 after over 700 hours of gameplay? I don't think that's even possible unless you're literally afking half the time doing something else outside WoW.
---
One is for Alliance and one is for horde
---
Haha no, you're way off. Leeway is that a Tauren can stand in Booty bay and cleave lowbies in Darnassus, the cleave then attacks and kills everyone in AV. Therefore; Blizz should use 1.8 AV.
---
It's way better but ... eh. Dosn't matter that comment is still funny
---
I’m making a Druid and a dwarf priest, every day changing my mind which will be the main

All a matter of who you talk to. It's easy to hate on BfA. Some of us are still having fun with it. 8.2 has been great so far in my opinion.
---
It's the result of leeway, internet latency and the global 400 millisecond batch window. This is what normal gameplay looked like back then.
---
Don't worry the rogues will eat you
---
It's still a really nice wep...
---
Manure
---
This.
---
It's also important to note it's only there when **both** you and the target are moving - if you're casting Frostbolt, for example, there's no leeway mechanic in effect because you're standing still.
---
His point is that classic and pserver experience will be very different in that many more guilds will exist on servers and not be able to nitpick their roster so much.
---
This is not actually true. The final episode was recorded in 1.10-1.11.

Dude I can relate to this alot and the last few months I had a major health scare had to have a lot of tests done and an operation and a part of me thought wow I wonder if I will get to see wow classic come out (As well as dealing with all the family stuff which is super hard) My operation went well and they gave me a mostly all clear but I have to take medication from now on and change my habits a lot but I am super thankful. If I was you I would bite the bullet and get checked out and then im sure with it all off your mind you would enjoy classic more as well. But I totally know where you are coming from dude

---
Otherwise, drop the class and play something else if it's that concerning. Do what's FUN and comfortable for you. You should also stop comparing to Private Servers, as they all probably only have 98% original coding. Classic will basically be a private server, in a way, just run by Blizz. Still different from all the others though since it's running on a newer engine but with older code. FYI they're fixing a lot of what you mentioned and you'll simply have to become a better hunter to make it work. Becoming a better hunter won't fix our poor gear scaling post-BWL though. It also won't fix our absolutely shitty Arcane Shot ability lol. At least we have that sexy Viper Sting...
---
If at [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cd1oqr/how_most_of_the_sub_feels_d_me_included_lol/) you don't succeed, [try](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cd8lrg/i_made_this_meme_can_anyone_else_relate/) try again. Third time's the charm I suppose.
---
You can make \~near perfect autorotation in addons like razer synapse. But obviously the melee isnt getting +agi for 1.5 after dropping wf, because of global CD. Other than that its up all the time.
---
And you can chain heal 2 times between the totem changes without clipping the macros. If you have global when the automacro tries the twist, it will fuck it up obviously. So what you want to do is have macro that just does the twist part and then you press it every 8.5 seconds for full WF uptime.

---
Well obviously both retail and private servers have good players and that skill obviously translates to other version as well. I'm not personally that opinionated on the subject, but I just wanted to point out that retail glad atm isn't that impressive. (Relatively)
---
I mean, yes, if the next expansion is based on what happens in 8.2 will be a lot interesting. The problem is, that THIS expansion is flat, you can't run an MMO by going "ehy, the NEXT expansion is going to be cool! Just don't mind this one!".
---
Eventually on youtube. Maybe in 2-3 weeks.
---
Little tip. Try be a nice guy and loot all the shit even just to reset and chest don't dick others over We all hate it!
---
I'll wager that a couple months after launch we'll all be singing a different song. 
---
The reports of the death of hunters are greatly exaggerated.
---
Haha similar for me starting out in Dun Morough when I discovered Loch Modan I was like wait there’s more. First time in stormwind was a trip too I found the tram and was blown away a whole new city
---
It spawns with what's in it, and a new one doesn't spawn until the first one is emptied and despawns.
---
rofl more than anything im posting it so people will see it and enjoy it even if the mods remove it for no reason at all. They clearly got a grudge as they removed that image for low effort when leaving others that are just the same old memes with basic text over the top. Its a personal grudge by them. But I have like 10 accounts so I can post it a few more times before they ban me on all of them anyway. I hope the community gets a smile out if it that is the only reason I made it :D
---
Nightfall/Conflag spec is a joy to play if you ask me. Whichever class you choose I think the odds are good that you'd enjoy either of them. Both are fun to play, both are high skill cap classes and have mostly good matchups in PvP.
---
They're very different classes but to paint with a broad brush Warlocks are usually stronger against casters while Mages are better against melee.
---
:D Officially recognised sir. I shall include your name on the next one in tiny text on the bottom right corner. 
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Lol so many freaking times. Especially worse when your in a group and all roll on it and the guy who loots it gets a fucking grey item
---
I have noticed before that if you don't have tracking cookies with the service you are using that they sometimes use your IP address (i.e. your modem address, so really anyone on your home network would share this 'tracker') as a tracker of sorts. I have gotten ads for stuff that fits my roommate's browsing habits after clearing cookies. But it would be strange if this is happening and you aren't getting rid of your cookies.
---
I have no idea. It’s the route I’m probably going to take, but I have no clue how effective or sustainable it will be.
---
Makes sense. Thematic, rather than normalised armour levels is much better.
---
It'll be easier for sure. But then bosses parry more than DPS will be slightly threat capped.
---
Having cleared all raids on a pserver I'm really looking forward to subtle but authentic differences. I won't play DPS anyway but it'll be cool to see regardless. Can't fucking wait lads.
---
Oh, I didn't even think of that. Thanks and happy cake-day.
---
So one holds nightfall, another holds annihilator, what does the third one do?
---
You betcha
---
Nor do I call myself a metalhead, however that's an opinion. But if you want to "belong to a group" you better be a part of that group, not someone in disguise, just like a lot of those who deemed slipknot to be "the shit". A way for them to be rebellious and "edgy" I guess, instead of actually appreciating the music, metal in this case. You're not a hunter if you've killed a rat in your yard. Being a part of a group in my eyes, actually require being like that group, this whole thing remind me of the recent metoo bullshit, started as something where actual rape victims and people who've been severely abused came out and told their story, seeking help. It ended with 35 year old hags, who happened to be touched on the shoulder, 25 years ago, by their uncles fiance, and called it for sexual assault.
---
Even more worthless then
---
Rogue with 4 piece darkmantle armor if I had to guess. Energy gan proc on hit. Meaning you could get more abilities out. Not to mention proccing poison more often.
---
Common practice on Argent Dawn, you don't see people speaking out of character in /say. Problem with RPPVP is griefers trying to ruin RP events, you don't get that on straight RP realms.
---
Chests don't respawn loot unless they're cleared entirely I think, so leaving anything in there of little value is making it so the chest only has trash in it for the next person. I always loot it all unless it's in a dungeon, and destroy any junk afterwards.
---
This is a pre-setup in ahardcore raid/pvp guild and its all guild members. We will be running instances exclusively (well getting some instance pre-q's). So everyone will get every possible drop anyways. And things like corpsemaker can be grinded after you completed all quests run.
---
Based on classicdb corpsemaker even is at 50% droprate, getting 2-3 of those is trivial.
---
Just because a guild isn't the absolute most hardcore bleeding edge doesn't automatically mean it's a gear funneling system riddled with favoritism.
---
More often than not the loot council is fair even in semi-hardcore guilds. 95% of stories of 'corrupt' loot councils come from people who don't know how to set aside their own bias and just throw up their hands and call corruption when they don't get the piece they really wanted first. 
---
Generally speaking the people running these things realize that good players are going to realize the shitfest they are perpetuating if the council is corrupt. They will be left with shitters in their shit guild the and nobody is getting any loot when that happens. It's a big incentive to be fair.
---
I've been in many guilds and the ones with loot council were always the best. I am good at setting aside personal bias and viewing the raid as a team effort, and viewing it through that scope made it easy to see that most of the people that came and went in my guilds were more concerned with their personal progression than the team progression. Everytime they called 'corruption' on the loot council and left it was pretty clear they were just salty because they didn't get the trinket/weapon/whatever that go around.
---

I can see how your statement theoretical could apply to any PVP video. But that isn't the case with Mute. I played on Arthas from day 1 of vanilla. In episode 1 (the final episode) he literally just hunts and records his fights with every rank 14, 13, 12, 11 and some tens ON THE SERVER. The other videos were so popular, and every single Ally knew he was out to farm them. That is why Maydie, another famous pvp video guy, had a FAP ready when those were rarely used in vanilla. They all knew he was using Castorius' account as well. Castorius has a rank 14 pvp vid of his own. You can see the clearly different playstyle by comparing the two videos. 
---
Mute literally farmed the Ally side's best known players with the best gear while naked in patch 1.11. They all knew about it because the videos were already extremely famous.
---
Duality. Absolutely the song I played wow to back then!
---
Melee and spell leeway are increased cast and attack range based on movement. 
---
This doesnt affect aoe spells because they dont have a cast range. You would think their effective range would increase, but it is not. 
---
Just because blizzard didn't notice something doesn't mean it is correct. That's the entire purpose of this open beta.
---
It definitely will be at the start.  Only way to get a pvp trinket until they launch the honor system.
---
It took me about 5 months IIRC, but I was playing a lot more than 4 hours per day.  
---
I'm pretty sure I spent at least 100 or 200 hours in battlegrounds. I remember calculating one time that I had blown at least 50g on exploding rocket boots in WSG.
---
And there were many, many quests were I died 10+ times. I was a complete noob.
---
Great list man
---
Shield wall and switch to 2H?

protip. double click and hold on the check box. you can skip the picture bullshit.
---
Hey Shirt, I'm Dad.
---
But don't you think we actually need a high sensitivity for WoW? 
---
Because we don't need a low sensitivity to help with flicks or aiming for small zones (headshots, etc)... to do a 180 on FPS games, I need to move my hand quite a lot or raise the mouse once. I think that for WoW, doing a 360 should be a bit easier to make.
---
As someone who didn’t pick up a shaman until wrath...thank you!
---
can i put my shitty items in it ?
---
Well now it's going to get removed because it's clearly a repost ;)
---
No time to individually loot items, have to shift loot and get back to grinding to keep my xp/hour goals.
---
Broken Tooth will not have 1.00 attack speed on classic
---
You're right - it seems that the sheet protection by Google disables the options... will look it up and hopefully fix it.
---
Yes you're allowed to play this game as dumb as you want. That's why it's so great.
---
Also, Mute's YouTube account has extended versions and extra fight videos. So you can see his failed attempts against Maydie and others. Also, a few other fights that didn't make the cut.
---
&gt;he'll never ding 60
---
That's the disease I'm working with.  I have this specific problem:  I roll a toon and love it, then I see someone else's toon doing something, and boom, I want what they have.  Other day, I saw a player being ganged up on by 3 Horde in Hillsbrad.  I ran over to help, but before I could get a frostbolt off, all 3 of them were laying there dead.  I didn't catch what level the assailants were, but the Alliance player was a level 42 Spriest - I was instantly in love.  I immediately rolled a Priest.
---
Moving forward, I think I can see myself maining a Priest.  I'm a caster at heart, and it's far different than Lock and Mage(played both).  I'm not sure  how I'm going to feel end game where I'll either need to choose to be Holy or not progress, as I have little to offer a progression guild as Shadow since I don't know any of the fights and are new to the class.
---
On the topic of alts, supposing I main a Priest, I think my next two will be Druid and Shaman(not particularly in that order).
---
Guilds will take one Shadowpriest usually, they're especially good AQ40-Naxx (super late game). 
---
Their gear is only decent AQ40 onwards though. You obviously won't be rocking T1/T2 any time soon as a Shadow. I'm sure there's plenty of pre-raid BIS lists for them though, going into MC.
---
Players MUCH better than you and I would disagree on the feel of the current leeway vs how it should be.
---
I suggest you listen to countdown to classic episode #110. Just the beginning interview starting at around 4 minutes. They break down what is going on (with evidence and testing) much better than I can.
---
*leeway* is working as intended. The additional cataclysm era mechanic that increases attack range while moving is not.
---
For the most part only shitter guilds are going to be using dkp.
---
War stomp allows you to get off a quick heal or chain lightning which can be enough to swing a fight, useful for peels as well
---
This.  Back when I first started Vanilla I really didn't realize the full potential of engineering.  After playing private servers, and especially as a Paladin I could not imagine ever not having it.
---
The guild I used to raid with back in the day used to have a dkp system without bidding, i.e. the person with the highest dkp that wanted an item got it, and the items cost a fixed amount of dkp based on how good they were (which was usually a decision of the officers, with some input of the other guild members). 
---
Out of the 3 rogues we had in total, there was one who wasn't a good player, especially when compared to the other two, but he was practically always there, so he would get full dkp. When Black Temple was released, me and the other good rogue would take upgrades whenever we could, so that we could progress faster, while the third (not so good) rogue would only take items as long as he was ahead of us in dkp. When it came to decide who would get the Warglaives from Illidan, basically the whole guild didn't want to give him the glaives because it would be a giant waste, but instead give it either to one of the other rogues or to the one single fury warrior we had, but the officers didn't have it in them to single out that one player and break the rules, even if it would have benefited the guild as a whole. After much discussion (and actually one off-hand dropping on the rare occasion when he wasn't there, which I got), he got the second off-hand that dropped. Within less than an hour after the raid, he had left the guild, said that he didn't want to be criticized for taking an item, and afaik stopped playing altogether. 
---
Thinking back about it, while I do feel bad for him, he *was* playing a lot worse, to the point where not only was his dps sub-par even for his gear, he couldn't be relied on when it came to certain mechanics (ghosts with gorefiend, interrupts with reliquary), and him getting the most powerful item in the game at that time despite his bad performance rubbed many people the wrong way. The fact that he was completely unapologetic made it so much worse. The raid lead was in a really bad spot, too, because just giving the item to someone else would be like saying: "we can just change the rules however we want to". 
---
Since then, I am really not a fan of dkp-systems anymore, and while rolling for loot worked for our 10 man in wotlk and cataclysm (with discussion on specific loot like legendaries), I feel like a loot council would always be the best system for a large group of players, i.e. 40 man raiding, which is why my guild will definitely use loot council for the vast majority of raid loot, especially at the beginning of a tier.
---
I saw leeway testing done, where the TARGET didnt move. But the attacker did. It would still hit it futher away when moving, compared to standing still. So if you are getting attacked, stopping wont cut down the range.
---
I was almost exclusively playing a priest in vanilla, so melee range feel is something i cannot say i have a feel for... nor would i remember what it felt like anyways.
---
The dosimeter reads 3.6 cringe per hour but that's as high as the meter-
---
Whirlwind is pretty much an aoe spell and does not get the benefit of leeway, so lets just agree that there is something called Melee leeway and spell leeway. Aoe leeway has never existed in wow.   
---
I dont even know how to take your last sentence? What do you mean?   
---
Do you mean blizzard didnt notice leeway? Or that its not correct? Ok  
---
 From Blizzard:   
---
I’ve updated the original post in this thread with:
---
* “Melee leeway” is working as intended.
---
After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.
---
There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as expected.
---
Because Blessing of Salvation is for the weak
---
Is it possible to put items into the chest? Would be hillarious to leave a note inside one
---
I was lucky when my ping was around 300!
---
Unfortunately when it comes to the internet Germany was and to an extent still is a 3rd world country 🙁
---
Shaman main being made first. 
---
Once the Shaman has excess gold, its going to funnel gear to a warrior alt which will level exclusively on rested exp after level 35. Also a rogue which will likely cap at 35. Then a mage once most people have hit 60 and I can aoe farm in relative peace.
---
There were a fair amount of players back then that were on or close to his skill level for sure. The vast majority of players didn't make montages either. Vurtne stood out especially by using engineering gadgets and the rare trinkets we consider to be meta today.
---
Drakedog was also way ahead of his time skillwise in my opinion. 
---
I mean just compare these guys to backpeddlers like Unbreakable that were considered good at the game.
---
The players weren't retarded back in the day, we just had far worse hardware and latency, a LOT less information about the game and we certainly didn't have 15 years of experience playing it.
---
Not to mention when the average skill level was lower, so was the ceiling. 
---
You can only be so much better than the competition you get to practice against.
---
Wait a sec, we're getting proper dedicated language servers?!
---
If rumors of boss armor are true, i dont think you will use annihilator anymore.
---
lol @ 1-2 weeks.
---
Most hardcore players will be 60 in days.
---
Anyway, I'd say on average 4 months for most of the server to hit 60 (those that haven't quit by then). Which means there will be a fair share of people @ 60 by 1 month in, by 2-3 months in, and quite a lot of people still leveling after 5,6, or 7 months. Not including alts ofc.
---
The sad thing is how many times I did this, only to loot it later and realize I had already done this.
---
At least you don’t have to worry about your pets losing all their abilities every time you relog
---
Sorry u got upset kiddo, thx for the reply x
---
Not really. He didn't advocate buying the enchanting materials, he said to go solo dungeons and farm them yourself.
---
you look tired, let me carry that for you....
---
Another fun thing about hex of weakness is the fact that you still get the full 20%healing effect at rank 1. So you can spam that thing on literally everyone if you want for barely any mana.
---
I just pointed that out in a different hunter post. He lost his attack speed in the 1.9.0 pet normalization.
---
For its level it has a huge amount of Agility on it.
---
I've heard talks of totem targeting/killing macros, do you think this will affect shaman pvp in a big way?
---
&gt;Swedes trying to educate anyone on pizza
---
Shove some more banana on it, my guy.
---
it is not that bad, the next one with fresh loot will spawn anyway.  it is only shitty if another player comes along shortly after
---
Countdown to classic episode 110 starting at about 4 minutes.

This tldr gave me nothing..
---
&gt;you have to work harder to be a good player than other classes
---
that's like, ur opinion but sure bud
---
now hit me with an A5 please sir
---
In pve sure, I was under the assumption we were talking pvp :)
---
Just take off your gear and re-equip it again before combat starts.
---
I have no knowledge of his server, but there's literally a r14 mage who keyboard turns... [I mean...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=16m51s) if those people were the cream of the crop back then on that server, then that might not have been the most competitive server there was?
---
Since you mentioned Maydie, he just randomly popped that FAP with the rogue in stealth. Watched some of the other videos you pointed out and it's him ganking Maydie, while he shops on the AH or rides through IF? I am honestly confused what the point you were trying to make with those was.
---
&gt; Can you please provide any proof/video of this? Because that is not how leeway is working.

[Attack speeds were not normalised.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9spju6/hunter_pet_attack_speed_normalization/)
---
Cactaur.
---
&gt; Most dkp systems are highly discouraging for new players or those which cant attend every single raid, especially those systems where you can hoard. 
---
We could hoard points with our system, but we typically did that to save up for loot from the end bosses. We earned those points by  slaving through countless of raids, and so when we bought our loot it wasn't because some arbitrary decision made by GMs. Plus we couldn't just go on a spending spree each raid just because we had lots of DKP. It was more of a bidding spree for sought after items between those of us with most DKP. I probably spent like 70-100% of my DKP on a single piece of Nefarian/C'thun loot.
---
 Wasn't much of a problem for our casuals or new members either, as they could get stuff at a low cost since most people already had it.
---
ugh Paul Stanley creeped the shit out of me
---
Literally impossible lmao. 15 days played IF YOU'RE FUCKING AROUND INCREDIBLY MUCH.
---
It will - pet speed normalization was done in 2.0.1. 1.9 normalized run speed and damage type.
---
Tbh that guild sounds toxic as all fuck if their only response to a dedicated guildie getting a legendary item is to bully him out of the game.
---
Skipping eagle eye is a huge mistake
---
Its good for:
---
-Finding quest items/mobs
---
-Not getting ganked
---
-Finding herbs/mining ores
---
-Fishing
---
At least you know your place
---
No, but they also don’t work the same way as they do on private servers.
---
Ye barrens charm got completely ruined too :(
---
Honestly any pet does this just as well and if you are hardcasting as a caster with a pet on you then you're fucked no matter what.
---
Oh... nvm me. I hoped I could fetch up some knowledge to help me decide between troll and tauren for pve. Orc is not an option.
---
Case closed.
---
It just means they all pretty much do the same DPS I believe. He still has a 1.0 attack speed.
---
Ill mail you my vyvanse prescription, that's your only chance lol.
---
Inject it straight into your veins
---
Won't layering make this less common?
---
I'm making a big assumption here, but it doesn't sound like you're interested in healing. If this is the case, I wouldn't recommend playing on a priest. spriests are very strong in 1v1s and in world pvp. It will be very hard to get gear as a spriest without raiding (rank 13/faction rep), and will be hard to find a raidspot as a spriest (you can def find a spot healing in your pvp spec and just keeping up shadow weaving). It also isn't great for premade BGs.
---
That being said, if you're more casual and never care about getting gear better than dungeon blues and doing more hardcore premades for pvp, then you'll have no problem and shadow priest will be awesome.
---
Just depends on if Joe McGuildMaster has a childhood friend in the raid who wants your upgrade
---
Both characters are moving in that clip = leeway activated. You state that " I saw leeway testing done, where the TARGET didnt move. But the attacker did. It would still hit it futher away when moving, compared to standing still. " Im yet to see evidence of that
---
What’s the consensus on berserking and feign death. Can you use berserking while feigning death to get the full 30%, cancel FD, and go on attacking?
---
Haha nice
---
Which faction did you and your friends enjoy playing more? 
---
I've always been a Horde at heart, but I've definitely level'd Alliance toons in the past, both on modern Retail and Vanilla psvers. I feel like playing only one faction for 10+ years is a waste, like you're only experiencing 50% of what this amazing game has to offer. 
---
That said, my main's have always been Horde, and I enjoyed my Horde on Vanilla pservers much more than Alliance. Definitely rolling Horde come Classic.
---
If you like playing solo then that’s fine my man, but if you’re interested in playing with me and my real life mates you’re more than welcome bud
---
Don’t worry, we’re not the min/max neckbeards that scream if someone does something wrong, we understand it’s a game and it should be fun and enjoyable :)
---
Is that from vanilla or a pserver though?
---
So if two Rogues with exactly the same gear/damage output both apply Garrotte at the same time, your exact damage output is doubled over a single one?
---
Wait what, thats a podcast. How am i to see video evidence?
---
This makes zero sense. To combat layering which will limit your contact with others for the first few weeks it exists, you’re going to join a server dead enough that layering doesn’t matter. In effect you’re self imposing a limit in your self. To boot it won’t have English speaking. 
---
How does this “combat” the issue? How does this make it more fun for you? How does this action cause blizzard to take notice and change their policy?
---
So you playing warrior?
---
1. There is a maximum of 16 debuffs
---
2. DoTs can be stacked on a target
---
If 3 Rogues open on the same player with Garrote, that player receives 3 separate instances of Garrote.
---
If 16 Warlocks cast Corruption on the same target, 16 instances of Corruption are applied to the target. If a 17th Warlock casts Corruption on the target, one of the old instances of Corruption is replaced with the 17th instance of Corruption.
---
Presumably there is some kind of logic to how debuffs are replaced and it's not just random but Blizzard never revealed the exact workings of the debuff system.
---
It’s two separate garrotes, it’ll be twice the damage of one garrote, not one garrote doing 2x damage.
---
The only way I'd ever roll Paladin is to be a AOE Prot snowflake while leveling. I'd definitely tank everything 1-59 too. At 60 I'd give in and go Holy.
---
So basically it comes down to this;
---
Which do you like more. RDPS or Healing.
---
If you reapply yourself:
---
* duration is refreshed
---
* if you try to use a lower rank, you'll get a "a more powerful spell is already active" message
---
If other apply a debuff, it depends on the type.
---
* dots can stack, so if two priests cast shadow word pain on someone, they'll have two swp debuffs ticking on them.
---
* debuffs refresh duration or you get a "a more powerful spell is already active" message, if you use a lower rank (or even an untalented ability)
---
*furious Uther noises*
---
correct, private servers have them available more often
---
Podcast with video evidence? hmm
---
Warcraft 3?

And if you want to get technical he existed, he was just in Northrend which had always been there. Just not accessible yet.
---
&gt;Both characters are moving in that clip = leeway activated
---
This is not leeway. Leeway is when a melee attack swing begins, the target moves out of melee distance, and the attack still hits. This is leeway.
---
What you are describing is an increased attack range when 2 targets are moving. This is not leeway. This was introduced in cata. This does not belong in classic.
---
Like the idea but can't follow some of the logic behind it. F.ex Shadowcraft gloves in LBRS only show in the list up as Rogue, and not as Druid, where they would be usefull for both.
---
Following as I'm considering the same.
---
Yeah and even that example is bad. Allow me to copy paste myself here:   
---
 Have you ever been at a LAN party, where you are running side by side on a mount with your friend? Did you ever notice that you cannot sync it on both screens? One of you are always infront of the other. That is character position desync and is the exact reason leeway was implemented. If you still lack the imagination as to why this scenario is a bad case, where you have stationary character positions with leeway activated, ill be happy to explain it to you further.
---
Could you link an example of two of such vids where we see warriors doing that to mages?
---
For example the monkeynews vid, any idea which vid shows that?
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Yes
---
As a warrior I would take a good holy paladin over a priest for my 5 group. For raids they're top in the healing meters, especially after aq40.
---
RL “friends” all want to play alliance... Had I known this years ago I’d have different friends.
---
It isn't impressive for decent PvP players, but the vaste majority of the player base won't ever get close to 2.4
---
Imo saying "people on retail are better" is as stupid as saying "horde or alliance players are better"
---
Yeah, and i say that in the post. Because i first searched the vid and then looked it at for a second and noticed it. I just remembered target being still, didnt remember it was autorunning against the rock.
---
yeah this is what normalisation meant generally i think - though most pets are already pretty similar anyway
---
If you plan on DPSing then you'll want to go Mage 100%
---
Either be one of the best dps classes in-game with tons of utility and demand along the way,
---
Or a meme that will hardly find a decent guild. N2M Ret dps "rotation" is basically just AA for 5 min until the boss dies, throwing out buffs every now and then.
---
If you don't plan on healing, go Mage.
---
yeah for sure, my question was mainly just out of interest cos i like trying to figure these sort of things out
---
I like the idea of gating them behind phases... like, no world buffs permitted in the current phase of content.  Other then that I prefer people be clean coming into the instance because that seems more in tune with the content.
---
What's the point of going holy for the first 22 levels? Benediction will help a lot more than the tiny amount of strength you get from divine strength this early and imp sor is a really bad talent, which at this point will amount to 1-2 increased dmg per swing.
---
&gt;"hey, the NEXT expansion is going to be cool! Just don't mind this one!"
---
Why not, they've been doing it since WoTLK???
---
WotLK: Amazing  
---
Cata: Shit  
---
Mists: Great (in hindsight even though was shit on @ release)    
---
Warlords: Shit (aside from raiding which was still top-notch)  
---
Legion: Great  
---
BFA: Mega Shit
---
By this metric we can be sure the next expansion will be great since apparently they have an A and a B team which alternate between expansion releases.
---
That'd be hilarious, but I'm pretty sure casting Berserking takes you out of FD
---
If it's Rp-PvP I will probably give it shot. There was a post a whole ago about them and I was worries I wouldn't be able to fit in but the consensus seemed that it wasn't as hardcore as some players thought (probably different on strictly RP servers.)
---
It was used on occasion in the world and stuff but even in guild chats and especially during raids there is no RP.
---
If you are really in a hurry you can just turn auto loot on, then you don’t even need to press shift to loot it all!
---
yes they reverted their decision
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn :(
---
There is no limit on spell pushback in Classic. If you're casting a 2.0s spell while being attacked by 5 mobs, that spell cast will take like 10 seconds to complete.
---
It's why Broken Tooth is such a popular pet.
---
WTG Blizzard!
---
See this is the problem with you types. You latch on to one thing and dismiss all other possibilities. 
---
Try considering the entire picture rather than only just that one guy in the loot council and how he is friends with that one guy who got that upgrade that you totally deserved way more than him. 
---
Start by setting aside your personal bias and accept that your ideal outcome could be wrong. Come into it with an open mind. 
---
Don't only backwards engineer the outcome from the perspective of corruption. Backwards engineer it from the perspective that it was the correct call as well and see what makes more sense in the end.
---
Additional range when both are moving was NOT introduced in cata, it was introduced client-side in 1.10, as [seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8eg81/to_all_of_those_who_claim_melee_leeway_wasnt_in/)
---
Was it confirmed if the bug that flurry doesnt always proc on extra attack crits is still going to be in classic? I dont think it was fixed till pre tbc patch.
---
Are staves a loophole to spending a talent point on 2h axes and maces?  There's certainly some good ones leveling up, do any ehancement shaman save and talent point and just use a staff in the endgame?
---
Valid point. For only 12s I guess it's worth it. Will add a note about it being situational in the next update.
---
You can take it up with Joana :) I'm just quoting them. I think it's worth noting that there was a different playstyle in 2005.
---
So why would vanilla private servers implement a cata feature?   
---
Can you please provide any proofs to your claims?
---
It probably doesn't matter that much, but I don't see a reason to not get them for PvP either. I definitely plan on getting Broken Tooth, Humar the Pridelord(nostalgia reasons), a good Scorpion and a good Boar. I can't recall how many stable slots there were though.
---
not sure what to play, but i think it will be a Mage, rogue or shaman
---
I see. This Subreddit is filled with anti-Blizzard Sympathisers
---
My experience doesn’t match yours, which doesn’t mean you are wrong. I think a lot of it has to do (or it did back then) with the disposition of the server community. I was a gm for a small but active guild from mid to late bc and we never dropped or benched anyone due to their choice of spec. The server had a decent community and other guilds I went through had a similar attitude. 
---
My knee jerk reaction to your comment is that it seems like it comes from a p.server background or in vanilla your meme speced players weren’t playing well enough or your guilds weren’t familiar with what a well played meme toon can contribute. It’s my hope that attitude won’t come in with classic because it’s bad for everyone, but I realize that’s naive.
---
What level did you play at on retail?
---
What was your average parse, what rating where you in arena?
---
The one thing I'd add to the argument that Blizzard "fixed" the exploit.  While Skarm points out the DM buff stacking, that's one thing.
---
The real reason for it, was that guilds were still going back to kill Onyxia, ZG, etc to get pre-raid buffs since the value added of those buffs still scaled to level 70.
---
There were a whole lot of things that got wonky with the vanilla -&gt; TBC transition.  Mainly how vanilla was easily approaching items being insane for crit, hit, dodge, parry, etc and why they went to a rating system.
---
I still wouldn't call them an "exploit" but I still don't think Blizzard every intended everyone to stack up every single buff under the sun to go do raids.
---
But Skarm makes some good points.  More so on the "you can't play your character because you're logged out" but if you're really that min/max in a guild, you probably have several alts to play during that down time.
---
Horizontal progression is actually my preference. Too bad thats the least likely option :(
---
I'm not sure about competitive...
---
I want to clear all content but if it takes a while that's okay with me.
---
Like perplexity and trigz did?
---
Most of this subreddit bear in mind is made of boomer stereotypes, literally all of their responses are related to their children and wives when they start talking about classic. I don't think you can expect them to come back to RP full time HOWEVER there is definitely a very active younger generation/RP community (EU side at least) that's taken an interest in classic just because they either prefer the setting, or want to be there for the atmosphere the community provides while playing classic. Classic isn't about to die off, it'll hit it's peak and then probably sit at a comfortable middling number. The RP community aEU side almost died with Cataclysm, it was that loathed, bear in mind. 
---
Providing layering is gone before phase 2, Blizzard don't do anything retarded, then I wouldn't worry about the RP community. There's many posts explaining why, whether it's the actual races (less is more), preferring the old lore despite it being bastardized but to a lesser extent, the fact they don't like the modern features, items and mounts that break (I know its a buzzword) immersion, most of them have a mindset that's completely contrary to the modern and see the likes of transmog as both a blessing and a curse. From my own experience they would prefer to be lowkey mercenaries in a grognard setting than a high fantasy hero with 9gag memes/RGB armour.
---
I plan to main a warlock and will probably pause to level a warrior using rested xp now and again along the way and, if I stick with the plan to go horde, I'll probably level a shaman down the road too.  
---
I've got good names for the warrior and shaman picked out that I'm quite sure won't be taken before I can save them, now I just need a name for my main and my bank alt and I'll be set!
---
If they ever announce an official TBC I'll probably drop whatever I'm doing to level a druid to become a main for TBC.  Loved flight form, tree form, and trying to get that rare ass bird mount.
---
If it's any consolation, I thought it would be all nostalgia too, but after playing on a private server, I've genuinely had more fun in wow than I have in years of retail. It feels like much more of a community, and while you'll lose some of the mystique of playing it for the first time, you'll discover new things and have a blast.
---
You could have made a new character and left your 60 beast at 60?
---
Why especially rogues?  Surely this means fury will do even more dps now and be even more broken?
---
But did you at least loot it?!
---
With an hybrid tank/dps spec you change your gear depending on what role you have on every specific fight.
---
I went back to watch Nightbird who is the Marks/SV hunter I learned Scatter Trapping and basic kiting from and used to think was a god when I was 12.  
---
         
---
My guy backpedals and clicks and the people he kills are worse, if playing that way today he couldn't hang on a modern Pserver. But in his time he was extremely capable of messing people up 1v1 or 1v2.

Not sure if this is the proper space for "rate my spec" comments, but would something like this run into mana and/or threat issues in raids?

Thank you for your thoughts. I wouldn't do PvP at all without MS imo, so I think that PvP is definetly out of Scope for me.
---
Levelling as holy is a bad idea. 
---
You’re much better off going ret. 
---
Like another comment said, keep the odd blue piece of healing gear during levelling and just switch gear for 5 mans.
---
true that
---
 tough decission i think it will me more spontaneous when i create the character

You'll be fine, you just might have to do some homework.

Everything but priest druid and hunter. Just didnt like those classes in vanilla.

---
His first video talks about attack power being normalized which happened in 1.8. So if his FIRST video is 1.8 I highly highly doubt his third is 1.6.
---
In tanking, different item will be better than other depending on the situation. If you want to be a good tank you will need multiple different situational item on most slots.
---
I've tried. Too many RP ass burger whispering to critique your backstory and general snobbishness. I like the idea, but hate the execution. It's mostly people slow walking around the park with, standing by a guild banner to recruit, or cliques doing their own thing that aren't open to newcomers.
---
System of a Down?
---
While that’s fair and all - it’s the system the guild set up. You/they should have establish that DKP hoarding for legendaries isn’t allowed. I can’t blame the guy for following your rules, but I can blame your guild for bullying him when he did.
---
Ya, I have to agree with all that you said.
---
Doesn't matter since what they did to the story and lore remains/is permanent. The story is now told, in the way it was told. The way it was told happened to be _truly god awful_.
---
&gt; Should I stop to agonize over 5-Mans and stick to 20/31/0 and tank that way?
---
Probably. 
---
You can tank any content up to 40 man raids perfectly fine with any spec you want.
---
Horde side warlock offers more variety in playstyle choice if that's your thing.
---
Prot warrior main. Get black smithing and axe specialists. Make nightfall
---
Enhancement shaman alt with engineering. Mainly for pvp but get that nightfall and do some raids too
---
Shadowgaurd &gt;&gt; DP 
---
Those extra blackout procs will save you more than that infrequent extra damage and healing ever will.
---
Main tanking is much more about time investment and reliability than skill or anything else. Tanking in general is actually very easy in raids - but usually that means they raid lead as well (not always but usually). 
---
If you want to main tank there’s very few encounters that would take more than 1 pull or two to master if you’ve tanked in more recent expansions. The big thing is being 100% attendance and reliable as you will be funneled gear first.
---
Only correct playlist on here.

" I created this rogue and leveled him to 60 for the sole purpose of making this series of movies. This is the third episode of "World of Roguecraft". This movie was created and released in patch 1.6.."
---
On the creator's channel over at [Warcraftmovies](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=6140)
---
"the only downside is that it's proc based"
---
So in most situation it's worse.  When you are tanking you need reliability, not the "best average"
---
Every guild will need one shadow priest, or a shadow weaving healing priest, so that warlocks can get an extra 15% damage. Advertise yourself as someone who can keep the important debuffs up and be a team player.  The more people like you the more likely you’ll be invited to a raid.
---
If green +shadow damage gear is available then you’ll definitely be going for that gear to start.  With 5/5 shadow focus you’ll only need 6% more hit to never miss a boss with shadow spells, so pick up some hit caster gear and you’ll be hit capped.  After that just find blue +spell damage gear.  Some will recommend MP5 gear because shadow is prone to going oom, but if you’re in a guild that kills bosses quickly then mana problems will be non existent.  Just remember that crit is almost useless as a shadow priest since your dots and mindflay can’t crit.

I am going to host an Alliance Mercenary company in the most populated rp-pvp server I can find.

---
I saw this thread right next to this other thread on my front page: https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/cf24yl/as_an_ex_wow_player_of_14_years_i_have_no_idea
---
Honestly the best advice I can give you dl and create about 100 hunters on the big nostish p-server right now and practice everything 1-60.
---
TBH, unless you're very familiar with leveling/questing in Vanilla (i.e you have multiple 60s on the pservers, or were server first 60 on them), then you're not going to have a chance getting server first in Classic. People that have 10+ 60's and know the optimal routes/quests/etc from psver experience will fly by everyone else.
---
So if you're serious about getting server first 60, you're going to have to play on the pservers a LOT right now. 40 days until launch you should have easily 6+ lvl 60's by then. Also practice 1-10 and 1-20 a LOT. 
---
Oh and also, it will only happen if you pick either a Hunter or Druid (pref hunter).
---
That's my advice.
---

Really for this scheme, the multibutton mouse makes the difference. You're gonna want like at least 6 hotkeys right on the mouse to jam other stuff too.

No, you leave it to fuck with the next person. Pass it on.

are pet-stomp macros possible with the classic macro api though? I know they removed them in wrath I believe. I know you can self /target totems in classic but I haven't been able to find an example of pet target macros being tested.
---
Yes they are amazing at flash of light. Make sure you roll a female so you look good in your pretty BiS teal-colored dress!
---
Here’s a pretty comprehensive look in to this.

---
Irks pretty clear that a lot of comments are from people that have no clue and are just parroting something that sounds authentic. I’m no exception, to be clear, my priest stuck it out at lvl 39 in vanilla. However, that video is from someone that seems to have a full grip on the class and it’s outlook at 60. Explore his channel a bit.
---
I would hardly call those two players experts over Blizzard.
---
With no knowledge: no it’s absolutely impossible. The mechanics aren’t crazy or anything but they’ll still kill you if you have no idea what they are.
---
With no experience: you’ll be fine as long as you do some research. If you’re planning on MTing you’ll get a ton of experience while leveling, and the phase 1 raids are Onyxia and MC. Don’t fret.
---
The thing is you want max push back while you’re cc’d or out of LoS. Stops healing etc. 
---
Broken tooth is just absolutely insane. There is no justification to not have him as priority #1 for PvP.
---
Played to 2.6 on retail, highest I got on pserv was 2650. I wasn't r1 on my pserv so on both retail and pserv I still had things to learn therefore it didn't make a big difference for me
---
Fuck I haven’t played since WotLK and I forgot how vital bags are.
---
I used this strat in the Stress Tests, the only difference from Private Servers is the much lower drop rate for cloth.

Isn't this a Torbjorn reference from Overwatch? (Which itself is a WoW reference).

He won't share the data because he doesn't have it.  Just like he doesn't have any real parses to back up his outlandish claims in this post.  But he's seen it! We just gotta believe!!
---
It's sad and ironic really isn't it. The harder we strive to achieve what society tells us are desirable things, the less happy we become. In trying to match what is expected of us, we lose sight of what really matters.
---
May classic serve as a catalyst to reignite some of the magic of your youthful years, and may you find fantastic new friends who last for life.
---
I'm EU with no classic guild so you're welcome to roll a toon with me, but I'll be going alliance.
---
There is no auto loot feature in Vanilla. However, being that it runs on the new client I wonder if that's in? Can anyone who played beta confirm? I forgot to check that when I did stress test!
---
Imagine this pve carebears thinking I care about their downvotes.   
---
Classi in PVE server is not classic is just a stupid game
---
To which guides are you referring?
---
Wow is fun ( played on provate to see). i didnt play wow for 10y? its not about nostalgy for me. Gl man in your classic jorney, hope you will find people to play with and maybe even friends!
---
Do you need vanish to farm DI in BRD? Considering doing this as a druid.
---
might as well go conflag/nightfall at that point
---
i think it's known that pvp servers attract certain people you want to avoid if you're not one of them
---
Wow! There couldn’t be two classes that have less in common. How do you want to spend your time in game?
---
Nobody wants to play wow with a 40 year old depressed loser, it's weird.   It's like hanging out at the playground when you don't have kids.  Go join a support group or get a gym membership and leave wow classic for everyone &lt;40 so you don't spoil it with your lonely depressed bullshit attitude.  You never even made it to Naxx so it sounds like you were a dog shit player then. Doubt you'll be any better now that you're old and your body and mind is withering away.  Just do me a favor and stay the fuck off wow. 
---
P.S.  Fuck you
---
You can't rewind the "new server" experience on Classic WoW either!
---
Not sure but I bet if you asked nicely, someone with proper resources could invite you to their private server to join his upcoming tank training with his guild's MT which includes walking through each raid with GM commands to view each encounter.
---
Warriors damage is controlled by tank threat. They can only do so much before pulling it off of the boss. 
---
Rogues can basically max their DPS every fight because of threat reduction abilities.
---
Yeah, but its all the times that you do get to rock an axe or a mace that make it worth it. Any staff you get that works probably will be pretty short lived.
---
That said, I was just levelling up an enhance on a pserver, and sticking to 1h/shield is actually a very good idea. Flametongue with a quick dagger does a LOT of damage, and you save a lot of mana with the shield because you don't heal as much. 
---
So.. viable to skip the talent? Absolutely, but if your looking for big glorious windfuries (which is definitely the best reason ever to be playing a shaman anyways) you're gonna want an axe
---
You shouldn’t play classic
---
This is what I have noticed about the sub, it is not that people are crazy downvoting, based on the % Upvoted in many cases, but that so little poeple here actually upvote posts. I had a post with 300+ comments, 97% upvote, and only about 60 upvotes on the post. People here are just are not prone to upvoting a post unless its a meme/art.
---
Agreed. Nevetheless Furrys will benefit more as long as they are not aggro capped because they not only get more dmg, but also more rage which leads to even more dmg. Especially in the first raids, when your tank is equiped badly and swimming in rage, I guess noone will be aggro caped
---
T2 hunter, Dragon Stalker would be cool.
---
Go Gnome or Go Home
---
How did you never go to Westfall by accident?  If I spent 2 weeks exploring the edges of the "map", I would have found the Tram, thus Ironforge, thus Dun Morough and then realized that there were more zones.  Also, wouldn't you have seen higher level players in Stormwind?

Paladins are the strongest single-target healers, but have no options in their arsenal to heal while moving (besides weak holy shock) or to AOE heal.

Ok this is both very nostalgia and hilarious
---
like others say don't pay any attention to those polls. many will start but few will reach the end. play whatever you enjoy, and if you make it to 60 and get gear you will have NO problem getting invites to groups trust me. (just know if you want to take it seriously you will be chain healing in dungeons and playing ele/resto hybrid in pvp, which you can do without respeccing if you are on a budget and you will be using ten storms for both so it's not too bad to gear)
---
Its more likely to be a mixed language server
---
I run something similar to solo content in BRD. I recommend getting Bladeflurry for an extra CD. It’ll help make up for the loss in DPS talents and you’re already at 20+ in Combat. I’d probably remove Sleight of Hand, the 2% reduced chance of an incoming crit isn’t really worth it IMO.
---
Can also log out and back in for a second chance of a new chest due to layering, the cooldown only kicks in if you try it for a third time.
---
Panda Brewmaster/Chen were in Warcraft 3, so they weren't exactly unprecedented. Besides, I don't really care what their motivations were as long as the expansion was good (which it was).
---
Personally I find world buffs unappealing and an annoyance, but an exploit? English is not my native language so I could understand the word wrong here, but to me world buffs are not exploit. Not even close.
---
Remember when in groups aways leave grey items in skinnable creatures to “help” skinners.
---
I'm really trying to be objective here and give some advice to someone who asked for it. No idea what an A5 is, unless you want me to run you over with an Audi.
---
Look at the classes that u/Clear_VituS listed. 
---
If we're talking about pve, then paladin, mage, and warlock are all very straightforward. All three basically just spam their main ability on the priority target. Druid can have a bit more depth in pve, but most raiding druids will be resto, just keeping HoTs up on the warlocks and casting healing touch. The gaps between the worst and best of these classes are generally narrower, but hunters are another story. The difference between the worst hunters and the best hunters is huge. You can really easily gimp your DPS just by misunderstanding how shot timers work or which weapons are good for you (there are very few bows or guns that are actually good for hunters, i.e., slow attack speed + AP/Agi.) On top of that, hunters are usually tasked with pulling and kiting, which is a skill set that no other class really needs to develop. 
---
If we're talking about pvp, then Druid and warlock are probably the most difficult to play well because of the sheer number of things that they have to keep track of and switch between. Mage has a lot of nuance, for sure. Paladins are damn near indestructible. Hunters in pvp are probably somewhere in the middle, but if you plan to play pve and pvp, then you're probably pvp'ing as marksmanship, so you're basically a turret. Survival has most of the really nice PvP talents, but if you go Survival, your pve DPS plummets (and good luck getting into a raid without Trueshot Aura.)
---
I love hunters, but they have a long learning curve, and the fact that they are so "noob friendly" means you don't have a lot of meaningful challenges as you level up that push you to get better. I've seen plenty of people fall into the trap of "hunters are easy lul". **I'd say, if you want an all-around easy and fulfilling class that sets you up for success, play mage.**
---
Added some LP. Hammerfall sounds pretty epic lol
---
Seriously? There's a big blue annotation saying "PROMOTED" and they tricked you?
---
Do you think I could get away with hearing like this and playing ele resto to heal raids and PvP? Only going to raid so I can PvP
---
Obviously Ret
---
One idea was flying could only be initiated from a flightmaster, and that there was a max duration so you couldn't afk in the air.
---
I would lot everything so I can hopefully run into the new chest spawn. If it was garbage I still loot
---
it was introduced as an april 1st joke later on impletemented as an one-off tavern hero  
---
making an expansion based on a joke and china = lot of money premise served them good
---
Joanas speed runs were \~5 days /played (fastest 4d 20h), so I really doubt the average player had only twice that. Hardcore players will hit 60 within a week of launch, for sure, but the average player will likely need a few month. Partly because they only play a few hours per day and partly because their /played will be way more than 10 days from 1-60.
---
They’re good. 
---
PvE does get a little stale after a while, since you only have 2 spells. Healing as a priest is more engaging, for example. 
---
PvP is great as a paladin and does not get stale. they’re such good support. 
---
Leveling a pally is pretty odious regardless of spec. But you’ll get through it.
---
How hard to you want to raid?
---
On Terenas I remember &lt;Gamblers&gt;, &lt;FragFest&gt; were the hot/to be in PvE guilds and on the Horde &lt;The Short Bus&gt;  was a horde PvP guild that dominated the BG scene.
---
But I was in middle school then so maybe my memory is clouded.

I'm not sure I would consider remembering a conversation I had a month ago as "holding" a grudge, I didn't even remember the usernames that were involved. You know it's easy to search comment histories, right?
---
What is more embarrassing was your willingness to present your own personal opinion as fact while making no attempt to research the topic yourself, and instead spread misinformation. This isn't necessarily a gripe I have with you personally, but with Reddit and comment voting systems in general.
---
I will mention though that you never corrected yourself back then even after I provided you with the quote from Ion Hazzikostas.
---
good on you, more druids are always welcome :)
---
Pretty sure most mobs dont melee you every second

Who's at fault? L7 or Reddit? Seems like a waste off money on L7s part.

Don't you automatically know the FP in org so you can just mail your bank alt a few copper to fly to org later right?

Mage is a lot easier to pull off and be good with, lock is pretty rewarding too though. I’d probably just put it down to flavor and if you care about having mobility.

You let people's interest determine it, just like every other person's thread.

Looks like Onyxia Scale Cloak https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15138/onyxia-scale-cloak
---
lvl 10-15 -&gt; Spirit Tap in Shadow Tree
---
lvl 15-20 -&gt; Improved Wand in Disc tree
---
lvl 20 -40 -&gt; Put everything onwards into Shadow
---
lvl 40-58/59 -&gt; Respec full shadow. 
---
You will have absolutely no problem healing every dungeon in the game 1-58 as full Shadow, and there really is no  good alternative for leveling a Priest.

This one is nice and simple.

Yes the community part is what is most important, to me at least. I used to main warrior back in the day, but thinking about playing a healer class to keep it fresh. It's encouraging to hear everyone speak of private servers with such enthusiasm. So there's definitely more to it than nostalgia. Thanks!
---
Yep. I've been fond of the name ever since I wandered into Honnō-ji temple in Kyoto a few years prior.
---
rank 1 flash of light is the most efficient heal in the game at only 35 mana, a top geared holy paladin can heal 700-900hp with this spell. In addition any critical heals are mana cost free.
---
You always have the option to go for higher ranks to heal even more, your holy light can go up to around 2.8k healing.
---
However, a holy paladin isn't very versatile in pve, you have only those two healing spells (well and possibly holy shock, but it'S very mediocre) and can downrank between them. apart from that it's quite frequent buffing (8 every 15min) and cleansing people (paladins can dispel disease, poison and magic debuffs).
---
So, it can get quite monotone to heal as a paladin, but it's highly effective, they usually are the primary tank healers.
---
"If you don't like it, you should go back to where you came from"

Lame and nonsensical. He never said he's from retail, nor did he say anything that is very controversial.
---
Now the important question: does auto-loot apply to pick pocketing?
---
pvp:  Orc &gt; Tauren &gt; Troll
---
pve:  Troll &gt; Tauren &gt; Orc
---
Warstomp is quite useful for Shaman in pvp.
---
&gt; I'm making a big assumption here
---
And you'd be correct.  I'm not really interested in healing, well, maybe a little bit, but it doesn't really excite me too much.  That said, I'm willing to do it, and give it my best as a team player.  I am concerned about getting geared as a Spriest, and I know, going into it, that I will never be "my guild's Spriest".  I don't know the fights, and quite honestly, I'm not a great player.  I do want great gear, but I don't want to be locked into the meta, if that makes sense.  Having said that, I'm what I would consider "Hardcore Casual".  I play 7 days a week.  When I'm not playing, I'm watching videos, or reading guides - I'm pretty infatuated with WoW.  If I could find the right role and the right guild, I could definitely be described as a "Try Hard". Biggest problem for me, is that I gravitate toward the oddball stuff.  I like Hybrid builds better than meta builds.  Druids and Shaman are both very fascinating to me, but I don't want to gear a healing character! (unless I can also get DPS gear, which I hear is next to impossible since it's your off-spec).  Priest is interesting to me, because I can heal, but then there's the whole shadow spec dps thing.  If there's an assumption to be made, I'd say it's safe to assume that I'm really confused and having great difficulty finding contentment.
---
Don't underestimate the noobiness of players in 2005
---
I'm making a claim based on their explicit publicly stated design processes and patterns, and based on my own personal experience working in the game industry and as a software developer. You're making a claim based only on speculation based on the fact that the staff can open a portal to Kara, for which there are other obvious and more likely explanations, which I outlined earlier.
---
Plus there were tons of Easter eggs. The twilight hammer had books that talked about trying to locate the roaming island to convert the turtle into a vessel for the old gods. 
---
There were quests that had you loot gray items with flavor text implying cstrange craftsmanship never seen before, looks very ornate"
---
And even a quest talking specifically about pandaren. So the idea of mop was already in place for s while.

That I'm not sure of, but I don't see why it wouldn't

Yeah, seems like some projection going on there.

its a hypothetical.  players will certainly be causing pushback more than once per second (unless they're ret palas kek)
---
Dude, tyvm! What are your thoughts on 30/0/21? I'll be 60/40 pvp/pve, so trying to find a spec that'll work for both. The guild I'm in won't mind that I'm not deep resto.
---
&gt; I still don't think Blizzard every intended everyone to stack up every single buff under the sun to go do raids.

You're certainly entitled to your view. Personally I think worrying about whether they were trying to cater to the Asian market, and worrying about a business trying to make money is a bit silly. Businesses exist to make money, it's just a matter of if they try to do so at the expense of a good game. In the case of MoP it is generally agreed upon that it was a good game, so they did not do that. That said, nothing can cater to everyone so if you didn't like the content then fair enough. Didn't work for you.

Still need a credit card tho, I remember in high school wanting to play so bad but couldnt cause my parents wouldnt let me use their credit cards.

This, 100% agree with you. One of the first, if not the first to use nade + pet nova in TBC as a improvised deep freeze before the spell even existed in the game. And then the double deep freezes with cold snap in WOTLK to land the kills in arena, the guy was truly ahead of its time. Gameking 8 gotta be one of my fav. pvp movies as well.
---
Now im leveling with a warrior on either rp-pvp or pvp. We sat down and had a discussion, It may be heavily worthwhile to early on secure consectration, firstly for flushing rogues and secondly because by reducing your hral knock back you may suffer from being focused. Of cpurse then you almost certainly want to take part of the ret tree and possibly some of the prot tree for kings in later dungeons.
---
People want to rush kills but tbh i believe focusing on minimal down time is better.
---
https://willitclassic.com
---
I marked it only necessary for PvP against casters due to spell pushback. For PvE endgame you'd wanna grab a Wolf.
---
I’m still undecided between mage and warrior. I love tanking 5 mans, it’s just so much fun. Dunno how enjoyable it is in raids though. And I think warrior dps could be kinda fun, too.
---
Since I will be maining a rogue that would mean that I’ll have 2 melee classes, thus mage would be interesting to change it up a bit.
---
What's the point of demonic sacrifice? You'd be better off with siphon life, a pet in PvP is way too good to just sac for a buff.
---
not even ashbringer, how can you call that trashbag a "friend"?

---
People should be aware that you cant raid as ele since Bosses have to high nature ress and none of the warlock curses give reduced nature ress as for the other elements
---
Not really.  Some people will argue that enhancement can work with nightfall, but in the best case scenario you are really only doing about 80% of the dps of a rogue.  
---
The problem is that elem doesn't provide unique buffs, and the enhanced totems in the enhancement tree are garbage, so you add nothing that a Rshaman can't provide.
---
You realize "leeway" is literally identical to how Vanilla worked and is also exactly how most private servers work, right?
---
There was [this thread discussing it a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aemfas/taurenorc_shaman_for_pvp/).
---
Of Warlock/Warrior/Shaman I would guess that Shaman is the best candidate to be not Orc. Shammy benefits from Tauren with war stomp as they don't have a stun and you can't discount the 5% extra HP in PvP either. The way I'm looking at it is you have 100% chance to have that 5%HP, vs 25% chance to resist stuns which is going to be triggering when it doesn't proc for a whole encounter.
---
I respect private servers a lot, they are great. Played on them and private servers "feel" just like vanilla did back then. But there are many things that were done wrong or worked differently than in vanilla. There were plenty of hunters in vanilla and if everything works the same in classic as as it worked back then in vanilla, then #nochanges baby.
---
Things that are bugged will surely be fixed (at least over time). But if private servers did something to enhance hunters or change them in any other way, then that's too bad. We want the most authentic vanilla experience, not the most adapted modernized experience of old wow.
---
Understood. I was a lock main for most of vanilla. My gm experience came later when I rerolled to a new server to get a fresh start in bc.

My farming spec at 60. Planning on using Shaman as my main world mob farmer with skinning and herbalism. I'll also be doing some WPvP and dungeons.
---
&lt;Shadows of the Horde&gt; on Frostwolf
---
When mages use it against taurens
---
What was your bloodhoof char name?
---
Go tailoring+ some gathering prof(easiest skinning) during leveling. At 60 make your robe and then drop tailoring because it's literally useless after that. Skinning you can drop whenever you like really, I usually keep it until 60 as well though. 
---
&gt; Once 60 I would then drop both Professions and pick up Tailoring and  Engineering and use Dire Maul lashers to farm any needed gold. 
---
just fyi DM doesn't release until sometime during november, so unless you're planning on slowpoke leveling to 60 you're going to want to have a backup method for farming gold. Open world farming is fine, done it many times as a priest on pservers but with 10k servers instead of 3k layers and I never had any major issues.
---
Is the someone you?
---
Don’t offer to be MT if you aren’t ready for it.  Chances are it won’t even be an issue because MT is generally reserved by the guild way before you get there.  Set yourself up to be an off-tank, and make sure you bring your A-game every time.  If you’re the only one chugging consumables like a mad man and grabbing world buffs, your dedication will be noticed and you’ll move up.  
---
It’s not like MT gear funneling will even be that much of a thing during phase 1 since MC is so poorly itemized as I understand it.  To an extant you don’t even WANT one guy as MT 100% of the time because it’s good to have options if they need a night off and you want backups who know how to tank the fights.
---
Also saw venruki get dumpstered by a hunter that should easily lose to a frost mage at  that level.
---
When a caster is attacked whilst casting a spell, the first hit causes a 0.5 sec interruption, the second hit causes another 0.5 sec interruption, any additional hits have no effect. 
---
When a caster is attacked whilst channeling a spell, the first hit reduces the channeling time by 25%, the second hit reduces another 25%, any additional hits have no effect.
---
Additionally, if you can break line of sight, that will immediately cancel the spell casting. This normally doesn't occur for hunters against casters, but it happens a lot with melee against casters, as rogues can sprint, druids use their speed, in order to get behind a caster, which breaks line of sight.
---
sounds the same dont think so
---
&gt; The decay allows you to miss 4 weeks of raiding and only miss the equivalent value of one item. On the other end the system starts to punish hoarders at about 6 weeks worth of no DKP spent. 
---
I like this idea. Playing devil's advocate, I was just wondering, do you think this might be a deterrent for players who have to take breaks from the game? As in, if I worked for that DKP, but I had to take a break and now it's all gone, why should I log back in to raid?
---
I feel like it may be better if your focus on shadow damage, get ruin for 50% increased crit multi, and spend the rest in affliction for better dots.
---
The synergy between the dots giving you instant shadow bolts doing a fuckton of crit damage and chance from destruction sounds pretty hype.
---
Demonology IMO is only really worth it if you can use SL and the double void sac.
---
4 days 18 hours to get level 52 ish on another server (you know..). I think that translated into about 6 weeks of playing the game.
---
nothing beats SL tbh but if you wanna be creative and different then first of all 2/2 in master summoner for sure. demonic sacrafice is pretty useless in pvp so that's a no no. I'd take your 4 points on unholy power and put 2 of them on Surpression for the hit cap and 2 on life tap because life tap is amazing and it's a must. the rest looks ok though I wouldn't spend 5 points on drain life. grim reach is pretty fucking great for pvp. I love improved mana drain as well so you not only steal the enemy's mana and gain from it but you'll also do some damage in the meantime. then you have accesses to both siphon life and curse of exahustion. then the spec could be solid though not the best
---
if I were to create a different pvp spec then it would like something like that  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/2502203012221125-20503-50500001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/2502203012221125-20503-50500001)
---
Yes - you can copy the bindings-cache-files from your retail installation. Some keybinds might need adjustments after that, since there are a few functions not available in Classic.
---
If you wish to configure your addons before release and don't get a chance to participate in the next stresstest, you can follow this guide to make your own sandbox:

&gt; dae kung fu panda?
---
I don't care how they shoehorned it into the lore, Kung Fu pandas were stupid af.
---
I disapprove
---
Yeah I saw Joker's level 60 too.
---
It's certainly not a terrible idea.   Imp Healing wave will help make you a better off healer, until you get LHW at 20.
---
I don't know explicitly how it works in Classic, but historically, up until Midway through WotLK, you could push targets into negative armor and still deal increased damage to the target, so armor penetration that lowers the target below zero armor is actually more valuable than the armor pen that took them to zero.
---
I don't like u lol
---
Or what would happen in any reasonable length of time
---
That was damage, not attack speed
---
What was your bloodhoof char name? I remember FoW too
---
This is new to me. Can you provide a source?
---
Just like it was in Vanilla 🤔
---
Specifically saving charge/intercept in battlegrounds to rush and gib the low health people with execute was absolutey delightful. No one better at finishing low health players than a warrior!
---
As a Horde player, that looks like a legit paladin weapon to me.
---
But what does 5 mans have to do with anything? You're more then welcome to use DKP for Dungeons with your guild but it's stupid since you can run them more or less unlimited times.
---
Raids is different, once per week.
---
id say the biggest thing was being able to queue for damn near anything, and be teleported around to wherever you need to be.
---
obviously it makes the game easier, but i would of loved to of seen warlocks and mages get improved portal abilities instead or something
---
Ive played mug'thol forever snd dont remember them. I was looking for someone to say Void the best guild on mug'thol for a very long time
---
"Your bags are full"
---
Yes, it is possible.
---
You can learn the encounters (which are not difficult), but you can't manipulate time.
---
Being MT is first and foremost a HUGE time commitment, not only for raids, but also outside raids. You can easily lose your MT position to an equally time commitment tank that is also helping guildies run 5 men and quests, helping with mats, discussing guild matters with officers and other guild members, etc.
---
So, be ready to play, A LOT, if you want to be an MT and stay MT as long as possible.
---
dun dun.. Win!
---
Troll for pve.
---
&gt;Any ideas / comments ?
---
I don't imagine not having 2/2 improved ghostwolf at the earliest opportunity... but maybe I'm overvaluing it?
---
I play vanilla. Solo
---
100% hunter weapon
---
Well, WOTLK (with Naxx) was shit on release, at least in so far as most of the raiding content was concerned :)  
---
Questing was good. Instances were good. Heroics weren't hard enough though.
---
Depens on what you are going for. If you have mostly PvP on mind then yeah, Orc is the best. The additional stun resistance is just way too good to pass up.
---
As for PvE:
---
* Tauren does not give you, much aside from the stun maybe.
---
* Orc has the better racial with Blood Fury for melee (enhancement)
---
* The troll racial is better for casters, as they cannot benefit from blood fury, but from the (slightly) improved haste.
---
A whole bunch of Tailoring/Alchemy alts.
---
The problem is, unless you run a horizontal gear progression system... how else do you move forward and preserve old content at the same time? It's a tricky question that I don't think any MMO has truly figured out.
---
I was a priest in that guild! What guild were you in? TSW by chance?
---
\&gt;  ill be 60 by the end of the 1st week
---
you never told me if you played before
---
What are the materials for the tailoring cool down?
---
The one about logging out in naxx before wotlk is factually wrong. I did it and had a horrible experience. The game would instantly crash when logging into that character after the patch, and I had to get a gm to move the character to a suitable location. (it was outside of SW)
---
My Main will be Warlock and my first Alt will be a Pally, so I would be fine if a Pally gets this ahead of me.
---
95% of warriors charge into casters  &gt; CC'd  &gt; intercept and that was the end of it, if it did not work out it was due to casters countering the warrior class. There was no juking, abusing different spell ranges, running ooc and mounting etc. As you say there were stupid people, and they accounted for pretty much everyone at that time even if they were "good" in your eyes.   
---
Also everything is a hunter weapon.
---
[Well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw&amp;t=1m51s), I was just quoting Mute.
---
Damn, it's just impossible to get even a remotely sensible answer out of you isn't it..
---
None of what I wrote is semantic bullshit. In no way did I claim time didn't have value. 
---
I didn't make up anything, I simply extrapolated from facts. You said 4 items were worth 210 hours of raiding, which would mean one item was around 50 hours. Let's ignore the fact that most DKP systems have hours spent as a minor reward mechanic, not the primary one. Someone who has acquired 10+ items will be 500 hours in the negative. If they raid 4 times a week for 4 hours each time (16 hours per week!) and this player has been there for every single raid, it would take them 31 weeks to get back to zero. 
---
Obviously this isn't really realistic and you're probably just exaggerating or getting some things wrong. But if you aren't exaggerating and they were indeed only rewarding DKP for hours spent raiding then you'd almost certainly not be the only person with a negative DKP.
---
In regards to your last comment, ZG/AQ20 are 3 day resets and Onyxia is a 5 day reset.
---
Only clarifying stuff! :)
---
OK. 100% of your comment is wrong.
---
I can pull percentages out of my arse too.
---
I used to crank this while playing war song gluch on my rogue. I was terrible
---
Titanforging. Dungeon finder didn't bother me, despite it being pretty anti mmo. But man, getting an epic pre WoD was such a good feeling because you seemingly checked off a needs box. But Titanforging allowed that epic to have the opportunity to be a lesser version of itself, which I just flat out don't understand. To get an epic today means something, getting one a few expansions ago meant everything.
---
This is why I disagree with u/Sleepyhoo. Guild Leaders need to outline every task that is needed to run the guild, and then divide and delegate those tasks to trusted, respected, and responsible people. Guild members need to know who to turn to if they have concerns about loot, or the guild bank, or event scheduling, or recruiting, etc...
---
If all of those roles are left to one or two people, the chances of them getting fed up and leaving go up. Split the burden with explicitly defined officer roles.
---
I love the idea of a close community where all of the members get along and value each other's contributions, but if no one is given ownership of a task, most often no one will do it, or they will do it inconsistently or unreliably.
---
DAY BY DAY
---
I like MS/OS. It makes sense in pugs and in guild raids IMO. But yeah loot is always a free-for-all in my experience. I really like guilds that have active officers helping the less knowledgeable players though I've been in or seen one so I'm not sure such a dynamic could exist though i'm not sure it couldn't exist either. I don't think class leaders are necessary, if you have a question about any class and I'm not knowledgeable enough to answer it then I will do the research for you. I think the ideal number of officers depends on how organized the guild leader is. One guild leader, one raid leader, maybe 3 officers is my ideal. But most of the time the raid leader is the guild leader and he'll have either one officer or twenty but the number doesn't matter because the title becomes meaningless. An officer needs to have power or else they aren't an officer. I hope my potato can handle voice chat while running the game, I used to play on a PC and now I have a shitty laptop that can't even handle opening a spreadsheet lol. Can you use discord on a smartphone? I'm sure I'll figure it out. I just want to find someone with no life who likes to laugh and we can spam dungeons and pvp all day long. That's what I used to do and I loved it :D
---
Do you know of any guides or videos that discuss this further? I always assumed good gear was useful for improving levelling speed.
---
I mean, it's basically the only viable elemental spec. Can also go 31/0/20 instead but 21 is safer. So my thoughts are that if you're playing an elemental shaman, that's the only spec that makes sense at all.
---
If you happen to work around a state legislative season you'll probably have a lot more free time in the summer, might be true for other professions. Idk, still a really odd point.
---
Well great, my monthly budget for entertainment just doubled.
---
If Ion's correct then it would be consistent that Majordomo doesn't drop loot in Phase 1.
---
honestly my least favorite vid by skarm not because Ii agree/disagree just seems like a petty "controversy" topic in guilds that can't decide how hardcore they want to be.
---
World Buffs have nothing to do with being "needed". Sure, for some guilds, they'll help push you over a hurdle, but that's not really what the debate is over.
---
World Buffs kind of trivialize content more than it already will be. Guilds/Players stack and farm them and fly through the content on Private Servers. Without them you simply cannot compete and it encourages players to log offline to preserve their buff until raid night. That's my biggest gripe with them. Anything that encourages you NOT to play is a bad thing. 
---
Make the buffs tick in real time even if you're offline and the entire problem goes away.
---
Interesting. Thanks.
---
Wrong game, rogue aint no ninja in wow.
---
I'm not a fan of Druid DPS either. The reason you do it is for Leader of the Pack.
---
You're hardly gimping yourself though. You can take every DPS talent and every tanking talent (except Thick Hide) at the same time.
---
wtf is that talent build lol
---
In Vanilla it took a while for people to realize how powerful Warriors are when minmaxed. And early on most rogues thought that SnD was a waste of combo points. So no, Classic won’t be anything like Vanilla.
---
Hooray! I've been farming retail to buy tokens to build up some sub time. Plan on getting a second account to idle at the AH on my other screen while I'm leveling.
---
Dragon Kill Points. Yes, it literally commodifies time as currency for loot. Semantic. Bullshit.
---
&gt;I didn't make up anything, I simply extrapolated from facts.
---
&gt;...
---
&gt;Obviously
---
&gt;probably
---
[This is you making assumptions this whole time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WZLJpMOxS4)
---
Yeah, I've done it and it's fine; but unless you're willing to admit to your guild that you are raiding with a hybrid spec (which is viable enough but not ideal), you might want to get the Healing Wave talents so that you're not caught out if they ask you to be a tank healer some of the time. [That spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZZEczz0xo) can't get all 3 points in Nature's Guidance, so you may need to get 2% hit from gear.
---
So you might as well level a gathering profession while you level and earn that 100g so you can pony it up at level 60.
---
I'm not sure who else alliance would give Ashbringer to.
---
Nobody uses 2H weapons in PvE content except hunters.
---
I'm just happy were getting it. Back in 2014 me and a friend would talk about how good WoW used to be and how it would be amazing if they released vanilla again. It always ended up with us saying 'Probably won't ever happen though' yet here we are. 
---
I'm in my late 20's now and life seems to start travelling on 2x speed anyway also it's not that far away. Me and that same friend plus another will be taking a week off work and nolifing it like the good old days. Can't wait.
---
I also read that some pallys would wear non mail/plate gear when healing is this alright to do?
---
/spit/spit/spit/spit/spit/spit/spit/spit
---
You'd need to corrupt the shit out of a loot council to get your corrupted Ash as a ret.
---
Idk, make friends and make your goal clear. If the meme lasts through naxx grind, great.
---
While I agree with you that the 6 hour CD will make it almost impossible to coordinate/plan the Ony/Nef and Hakkar Buffs, the problem I DO see it causing is encouraging players to log off when they do get the buff, simply due to how powerful they are.
---
I'd only do tailoring if you wanted to be an elemental shaman in raids.  Skinning and LW will help you make gear while leveling, but that's about it.  
---
As a Rshaamn herb alchemy imo is best.
---
no
---
Are you saying in your experience this is how it's been? Ms&gt;os? Or you think guild raids should just be free roll?
---
Afaik, Hunters are viable for PvE throughout the whole content cycle.
---
As for PvE ... they really fall off in later raids. Their damage scales the worst compared to all other classes (except for paladin maybe). But there will always be some slots for hunters thanks to their utility. Raids often have one or two encounters where certain skills that only the hunter brings are demanded.
---
As for professions, you have a couple of choices:
---
* Leatherworking + Skinning to craft some gear while you level and also for pre-raid items. You can also craft some resistance gear, that will become necessary for raids.
---
* Engineering + Mining to craft some gadgets, that will be very strong in PvP and some also in PvE. And you can craft bullets that are really good and can be exchanged for arrows, if you are using a bow/crossbow
---
* Alchemy + Herbalism is good on any class. It allows you to make potions and elixirs that will give you temporary buffs. Also: Health and Mana Pots! And you can transmute Arcanite Bars, which will make you money reliably.
---
* All the secondary professions are also very good for you. Fishing and Cooking make it easier for you to find food for your pet. And first aid, well ... just take first aid.  :)
---
* The other professions are not as good for hunters imo
---
Are shaman able to farm for gold? Hows open world for them at 60?
---
Yeah, fair enough. I guess generic Rogue builds apply almost the same amount of CC/slipperiness, while having damage that doesn't make them as helpless as this build.
---
I'd suspect reddit. L7 just pays for adspace. Reddit decides where the ads go, based on their algorithm.
---
This is the system after 3.0.2, in vanilla spell pushback was unlimited.
---
Hehe just watch any warrior pvp video of your choice, if they are not playing like this or being bombed by heals I shall put the percentage back in my behind, unless you want to.
---
What don't you like about it?
---
I only chose 1 point in Improved Aspect of the Hawk because even at 5/5 the proc is too unreliable and may often proc just when your target is dead, making it a waste.
---
Improved Revive Pet is mandatory &lt; Level 40 imho.
---
1/2 in Improved Mend Pet because you don't want those 30 min. long debuffs to stay on your pet.
---
And I chose 2/2 in Spirit Bond because it adds up while leveling, reducing your downtime.
---
I prefer the look of tauren.  Orcs are all hunched over.
---
keep dreaming cuz it is not going to happen
---
Tornadus was just me trying to find a way to make the word “tornado” a name for my mage. This was before a Pokemon with the same name existed. At some time during TBC, a random player whispered at me “HAHAHAHAHAHAHA” and I was confused. I asked him, “What?” and he replied with “Tornanus.”
---
I don’t know if I’ll be re-using that name.
---
The true paladin weapon.

Arthas plays a part, but the sword is not wielded until after the events of Naxx
---
He was the first GM on SC. I was Tarok, originally an Orc Hunter, then made my character a NE Warrior and worked with Sigon to form Eternal. I only GM'ed for like a week or two, handed it off to him and left Eternal. Just can't handle tons of people, haha!
---
why lvl 10, is there something with rested XP?
---
Alright, so I'll leave enchanting then.
---
Would you think Tailor/Skinning or Herbalism/Skinning would be best while leveling?
---
I guess Tailor would give me some crafts for gear as I level but Herbalism would bring in more gold.
---
Well, there's not much reason to compare between different roles in PvE.
---
Through 5 mans people will still be in leveling specs.
---
Once you hit the big dungeons and raids you'll see very few people switching out of their raid spec unless it's for BGs or gold farming.
---
In vanilla I was resto almost the whole time, so farming for gold was quite hard.   That said, I was pretty hard to kill too. 
---
In classic, I'll probably switch to a 30/0/21 or 21/0/30 spec for raiding after the initial few clears.
---
You monster
---
I saw some people say it wouldn't be in the game, but Idk for sure what their source was.
---
cliques
---
This is to accommodate the fact private servers have absurdly high populations.
---
Evidently, Warchief's blessing for instance had a 24/h CD, where as in private you could spam that shit all day.
---
It sounds like he left because he received the legendary and everyone treated him like shit for it, I think.
---
if you roll HOTW spec you get to offtank AND heal if you want to. Getting to 60, if you want to gear up fast af you can just get your resto set done in a few raids honestly. That gear is just given to you. You also will have a bit of agil and stam gear too making yourself have a really nice hybrid set. you will be a world pvp beast if you raid early and efficiently with all the gear you're getting. Finding the right balance of gear is important too with the HOTW spec. I will also be maining a druid with HOTW spec deep into the first few phases.
---
Lol I’m glad you won’t be on Horde, Have fun constantly rebuffing your entire raid for months on end just for the sheer possibility of getting a meme-spec weap. I’ll take great pleasure in killing you from Horde side.
---
According to what? From my experience the most toxic players are the ones trying to be elite but aren’t good enough so they blame everything on other people, specs, items, rng, etc. the average player isn’t trying to be elite. It’s the guilds that think they’re Nihilium that are going to be intolerant. Average players in casual guilds and pugs will get by playing off meta because the people who will refuse them in a 40 man are the types that have been raiding pserver for 5 years.
---
Only way you are getting it is if you lead a guild yourself and you ninja it.
---
*shrug* roll on Dreadmist? My mage friend rolled on my devout... OTL

gotta love that 3 Doors Down, Papa Roach, Linkin Park etc. Gonna make my own list, but will probably be up to like 2009 2010 songs.
---
Herb if you're taking it normal to slow pace. Tailoring if you plan to move faster. I think outzoning herbalism is an issue. I'd try to grab a bit of linen/wool/silk while it's cheap if you don't go tailoring and plan to level it later.
---
Blood is a currency all war leaders accept.
---
Orly??? I’d be interested in that!
---
I've feel way more comfortable with the new one, primarily since I can keep having my character run where he needs to go and be able to see my surroundings since the new menu is compact and doesn't cover the whole screen. The old ones, you had to immediately stop whatever you were doing, try to find that one option amongst the dozens that were only organized by "Basic" and "Advanced", and I wouldn't be able to see anything around me so if a mob tagged me while I was browsing the options menu, well that's one ghost wall coming right up.
---
The name is vaguely familiar but I definitely didn't know him personally. I was still a low level newbie in Eternal's early days.
---
Huge mistake might be an exaggeration. I have never used it, and I have tens of thousands of hours in WoW overall, lul.

HPS is like the least important stat if your assigned target(s) are still alive at the end of the fight.
---
Faerie Fire
---
Yes, the warriors will get very upset if they don't get WF.  Kind of laughably so. Its a great way to troll them though.
---
A lot of people are planning to designate one of the PVP servers as RP-PvP if there isn’t an official one
---
I think people are just reviving the "less than a percent of a percent" type memes from when Naxx was glorified to hell and back.
---
Very strong 1v1 class with an extra life.  Can often escape with ghost wolf to mount up and continue the escape to safer areas.  They do have good farming and kill speed if you are not raid spec.  You just have to figure out what is good based on your server economy and go based on that.  Paying attention to the AH trends is the best way to farm gold and prioritize farming locations.
---
I don't.
---
I already took the PTO. I would be quite upset.
---
ahh and don''t forget to ignore people when you instantly tag quest mobs. this really gets people. Imagine if the quest mob have a 10 min respawn timer :D
---
could have a troll warrior for beast slaying which is amazing for leveling, berserking which is amazing for pve, or go tauren with extra health and extra reach due to the leeway mechanic.
---
Bet he was a feral with NS then. The HOTW spec. A full feral would be hard to get rank 14 haha.
---
I don't play any other Blizz game than WoW. I was last subbed about 6 weeks after BfA release. I did play that free weekend earlier in the year though.
---
this needs some math
---
But even so I don't think the difference between the two is that big
---
There were plenty of ways to pvp, so no idea what you're talking about. Typical pvp progression included both battlegrounds and arena, with more mandatory time spent in BGs.
---
Yeah no cheap-ass 16 slotters. I'm gonna be investing most of my gold before level 20 into bags
---
Hunter /Druid for the easy raid gears collecting ( since low popularity/hunter feel extra shitty)
---
Thanks, I guess it will be Tailor/Skinning then and buy wands when I can. Cheers for the info!
---
Blood Fury is better (not true if you want to be a tank) don't know exact numbers. Also Stun resist OP in PVP.
---
That's a little more than accommodating more players....
---
You can if you are playing on a PvE server.
---
8.2 is still garbage tho. I literally played for 2 hours and then unsubbed. Biggest waste of 13 euros ever.
---
Problem is, the biggest problem by far of BfA is class design. The raids and dungeons are actually pretty good. The leveling wasn't that bad either. But the class design is so horrendous that everyone gets bored so quickly.
---
For lore nerds like myself though 8.2 is as much garbage as every single patch this xpac. Next xpac they might as well remove lore because Blizz can't do anything right. Except for the art!
---
According to 15 years of raiding experience on my end.
---
Go on retail and watch PuGs form for groups. They follow the meta blindly with no reason as to why. They were told X, Y, and Z about the classes/raids and that's all they need to know.
---
The problem with off-meta classes/specs is more than just, "Their DPS is lower, don't bring them!" It's a huge series of cascading events. Imagine you're trying to down a boss but struggle due to lack of DPS. What do you do? Do you sit the meme specs and bring in better players? Do you keep trying to gear up for a few more weeks? Do you decide to give the gear to pure DPS Classes? Doing this pisses off your meme specs raiders. Not doing it pisses off your Pure DPS raiders. How much time passes before your better players get poached by a guild further along in progression? Now your guild is forced to recruit new players in to a group that's already struggling.
---
Everything builds on top of itself. Will there be guilds full of casual/meme spec raiders? Of course. Will they clear anything other than MC/Ony? Probably not. If that's what they want and expect, fantastic! Their happiness and fun is all that matters. But it's not toxic to try and avoid drama that *will* occur in a guild trying to seriously progress and bringing along meme specs.
---
World first Ragnaros had Arms Warriors and Rogues not using SnD. World first Nefarian had a Ret with Thunderfury. I doubt that your people knew more. They knew far less in fact.
---
I literally proved my "convenient assumption" mathematically, and if you wanna throw out big words about logical fallacies that right there is an appeal to the majority. You're also making a completely unfounded "convenient assumption" about me having daddy issues.
---
This isn't about me, it has never been about me. You are the one who's trying to distract from the matter at hand by attacking my person and making all kinds of assumptions about me. You're the one who can't maintain a civil conversation. You have yet to address a single point I've made. Now fuck off.
---
Well isnt the difference that pservers convert to tbc after some time or just die and they make new servers to start from scratch ?
---
I don't think that's what he was trying to say, and I generally like to go off of what people say rather than try to read to far into what they might be thinking. It just makes exchanging ideas alot simpler means I don't have to try to decifer peoples true intentions. I just get to take their words at face value.
---
He gave me a pretty lame example devoid of any context and it highlights what I think most peoples issue is with loot council. They only focus on how to draw the conclusion back to corruption rather than draw the conclusion back to how it makes sense with the full context of the situation.
---
It's really just the same symptom of the same problem that many gamers and just many people in general have. It's the same reason why when you get ganked on bot lane it's your jungle's or support's fault. It's the same reason why when you lose an overwatch game it's because X person on your team was bad. It's the same reason why when you get shot in the face in counterstrike that guy is obviously a smurf. 
---
Many people are incapable of objectively looking at themselves and saying maybe this didn't go my way because of someing **I** did. It's not **me**, it's everyone elses fault. 
---
The same thing is applied to loot council when somebody is super heated about a decision because they think they deserved it way more. Instead of realizing that maybe the other person deserved that piece more or even just accepting the fact that sometimes any of even 3 or 4 people is all a correct call for that piece of loot they call corruption because it's easier to shift blame to somebody else than look at yourself and say you could have done more to make yourself a better candidate for that upgrade. 
---
I do agree with you that there is a human element to the process, and due to that there is always room for bais to kick in and cause people to make poor decisions, but you kindof failed to address my main point: 
---
*Most people's experience with perceived 'corrupt' loot council is merely their own bias. Loot council is fair much more often than it's not.*
---
I don't blame him even a little bit haha
---
You could probably do the DM east thing.    I used to take imp fire totems for pvp, and that would probably come in handy.   I never did that though.  I primarily did gathering, and farming in silithus.   I could equip the clothes and solo the mini bosses as a Rshaman.
---
I guess it depends on your gear, since the Troll racial scales with your gear and the Orc racial does not. Last time I read something about the Troll racial only being better with Naxx like gear.
---
I always level ret and never even bother going holy before 58, just dps. Leveling holy is a lot slower and at scarlet monestary and beyond you won't be able to heal as ret, people might argue but it's true.
---
All good points. This build spreads your talents way too thin across 3 trees and misses out on all the best abilities in each. 
---
I'd also like to add that improved drain soul is a highly overrated talent and definitely useless in PvP.
---
These are the psyops that will bring us victory. We should probably also start a proxy war in Stranglethon.
---
I have a full roster of characters planned, some of serious play, others just leveling for crafting/mat harvesting purposes.
---
I don't know exactly but I assume Troll is better if you have extra attack procs, otherwise they're probably too close overall (based on different gear/situations) to matter enough to choose based entirely on that racial.
---
I may very well be wrong though.
---
Why even bother looting? It's always shit.
---
The vast majority will never hit 60.
---
In your defense, the 'suicide joke' belongs to the Simpson, you just translated it to another context, and I personally wouldn't consider this low effort.
---
The way reddit works will depreciate threads when they get older, even if everyone in the universe upvoted it.  Not exactly conducive to a 4 day discussion.
---
What exactly are you missing out by having this thread pinned btw?
---
Probably unpopular but....
---
I fully recommend leveling as Prot unless you are just trying to super speed through to end game.  It will teach you a lot about mechanics, interrupts, handling multiple monsters, etc.  
---
Switching from DPS to Prot can be a bit overwhelming at first in the end game for people who haven't done it.  It's not hard, it's just there is a definitive difference between a skilled and unskilled tank.
---
Be warned, it does level slower, but it provides fewer corpse runs as Prot tanks typically kill easier DPS wars, although much slower.  I personally enjoy leveling as a tank.
---
As you said for #1, I agree, I think that's a horrible system that actually makes the game boring. In Destiny 2 you never actually feel yourself getting stronger. It's a tad frustrating and ruins a bit of the immersion.
---
As for #2, if you use Naxx as a base an create new horizontal gear going out from that, you run the issue of.. why would specs who don't need or want that gear do the raid content? What do you gain spending weeks clearing new content only to have no change in your players strength? As selfish as it sounds, we play these games to get better/stronger.
---
It's a very tricky question that doesn't have a perfect solution. I do agree that option #2 is probably the best idea but even then... it has a lot to be worked on.
---
If we are talking about immediate changes, keeping with the spirit of where the game went. 
---
I'd make TBC into 3 mini expantions that were much cheaper. Start with just Hellfire, within it you have 2 world bosses, an Ony style stand alone raid boss, 3 dungeons (with heroic modes) and to it i would add a smaller 3-4 boss half raid that's an instanced version of the staircase before the dark portal. Level cap would go to 62 (but you don't need to buy the xpac to be able to hit 62. It would sell for $20 at launch. It would be called 2.0. It would be an optional expantion.
---
2.01 would come after and introduce Karazan just as it was as a 10 man raid for level 62.
---
2.02 would introduce a bunch of heroic modes to old world dungeons, some set to level 63 to tease the next xpac.
---
Some time after would be another $20 expantion that goes to 63, again no need to buy to raise level cap. In it would be Zangermarsh, Nagrand, Terrocar Forest and Shatrath. Between those you get 6 dungeons with heroic modes. The conflict between the Aldor and Scryer would be played up much more with the PvP areas in ZangarMarsh and Nagrand focused around that conflict instead of horde vs. alliance. 2.10 would be what it's called. It would be non-optional.
---
2.11 would introduce blades edge, shadowmoon and eye with all the content they have except the raids.
---
2.12 would give the first two TBC raids.
---
2.13 would be Magisteres Terrance and all the stuff including Kael.
---
2.14 would be black temple finally.
---
I'm sure if I reread this a lot will sound dumb but it was a good wait to pass time writing it up while waiting on a Doctor's appointment in the waiting room.
---
&gt; Holy for a bit? 40 hea
---
Yes, for Phase 1. Can be argued for 2 and possibly 3.
---
I think killing mobs and skinning will make you more gold than mining.  I'm just giving you my anecdotal experience.  But on launches the AH gets flooded with mats to the point that they are close to vendor price than you have to pay the AH cut and it ends up not being a good worth of you time.  I would go skinning and vendor your skins.  Use this to pay for you lvl 40 mount and your engineering.  The extra gold from skinning while leveling would be something like 30g which may be enough for engineering to 200 or something.
---
Got some Rogue tanking strats we don't know about?
---
&gt; You do the same then. People do it on both sides of the fence.
---
Not really sure what you mean here, maybe elaborate a little more for me.
---
&gt; If you add rules / regulations to it, its the only fair system there is.
---
Not really imo. You'd have to go into more detail on what rules or regulations you are implying, but generally speaking all DKP and point systems encourage hording of DKP which hurts new raiders and causes people to pass on significant upgrades because they want to save their DKP for a big ticket item. I could easily argue that it's more *fair* to the raid to make sure proper upgrades go out to the proper people because it encourages a team environment while boosting the raid progress as much as possible. 
---
&gt; Regardless of you saying "latch on to one thing" its most often the case
---
No, it's really not. I'm arguing exactly the opposite actually. Most of the time, in my experience, the ones who think like this are very good at completely ignoring all of the context of the situation in favor of assumed favoritism. They never take the time to go out of their way and try to frame their perspective in a way that puts that decision in a light where it can make sense. 
---
&gt; Loot council gears the core , friend group first (facts) and everyone else second. Thats the way its always been.
---
That's your *opinion* on the *result*, it is certainly not a fact. The purpose of loot council is to treat the raid as a team and hand out the most significant upgrades to the people that need it most.
---
My opinion is that the purpose of loot council is fulfilled and the result is properly met much more often than result is corrupted by favoritism.
---
I've heard rumors Vurtne plays on a pserver under the name Greatwizard, hes got videos up on YouTube.
---
Tested this in beta, new character did not know org FP.
---
Warrior main leveling first, primary alt will be a Druid, should ding 60 before end of phase 1. I am taking half a month off work to slay some dragons.
---
No it's not, people should be forced to get upgrades.  Loot going to waste is the worst.  Not advocating for a straight dkp + decay system though, just being the devil's advocate.
---
The two tanks should’t be an issue since every warrior should be having tank gear shoved in their direction once the MT/OT have them.  
---
I’d say the problem is if you’re still running the raid for gear, how fast are you really going to clear it?  Outside of rare stuff like bindings?
---
What?
---
Outlands
---
Berserking is too difficult in MOST situations for a rogue to maximize, since there aren’t easy ways to drop health to the most out of it. Some obvious exceptions are fights like Patchwerk where there’s poison to stand in and no ambient raid damage that you’ll risk killing yourself with by dropping to low health.
---
Without the ability to maximize the benefit from Berserking, go with Orc and enjoy the benefits of stun resist in PVP, as well.
---
UD. I dont think anyone will say troll
---
A viable ret paladin talent rework.  Nothing is sweeter in taste and sorrow, than nerd tears.
---
What in the world are you talking about? Ascent rogues knew to use Snd lol. SnD uptime being hugely important to DPS was very much well known long before Rag died.
---
Your guild sounds very similar to mine in terms of mindset, though fully plan to grow to 50-60 "core" members for full 40 man raids.
---
I'd encourage you all to be on the lookout for members while leveling. For your players in the lead, fresh 60's will be looking for guilds. Group with them, befriend them, and keep them around. Those fast level 60's are often your committed and experienced players; the more you can get, the better!
---
As for your players in the middle of the pack, this is where the bulk of the playerbase will still be. Tons of time to group up and make contacts/friends and round out your numbers by the time everyone is nearing 60.
---
If you want experience healing before 60, for you I'd personally level to about 35 as ret and then swap holy,  you can get away with healing deadmines and bfd or any other low dungeons as ret with some int for mana, but you can't efficiently pull it off like that all the way to 60. I'd never let a ret paladin heal my SM or uldaman groups and not a chance for maraudon unless you're over leveled by 5 or more. 
---
Just my opinion, I basically only play holy paladin and leveled to 60 in vanilla and played vanilla private servers for the last 8 years. 
---
But when it comes time  end up doing what you feel like, if you wanna stay ret to level or just level as holy.
---
&gt;vAnILLA wAS aBOuT sOCializiNG unLikE rETaIL  
---
yea no, you could always play the game solo perfectly fine, there were just less things to do as solo in vanilla (in general too, but yea)
---
Play Horde whatever they do; you can find new friends.
---
Do you think he’s human because of the deviate fish buff?
---
One thing? That’s nearly impossible; so here’s one list:
---
Pandas, LFG, class balance that creates redundancy ie time warp for mages, gimmicky shit like Mr T grenades, paid faction changes, level boosts, different difficulty of the same raid (Ulduar style hard modes were ok imo), gearscore, achievements (a little torn on this one, content achievements I don’t see a huge issue with until they are used as entrance requirements,  it I hate the weird collection and time sink ones), daily quests, legendaries for everyone.
---
It looks like a solid leveling build to me. The only thing I would change is I would max out Endurance Training and Frenzy as opposed to putting points into Improved Mend Pet and Spirit Bond but that's just me. Solid guide OP good job.
---
That's a very good point. I know for the start of a fight you can drop your gear to get the full effect of Berserking, but after that I was trying to figure out ways on various fights to get the full effect. It sounds risky and, like you said, very inconsistent.
---
The problem is that it doesn’t have a great way to reward anyone for going above and beyond. Additionally you get the opposite problem of people not taking stuff they do need so they can stay on top of the list for the best drops off final bosses and stuff. And since there isn’t a good reward system, you’ll get a lot of people skipping raids once they get the stuff they need from a phase which leaves everyone else scrambling to catch up.
---
It’s not bad, but not perfect.
---
Im probably gonna end up making it close to launch, if i remember il share it :D
---
Strictly pve...Beserking is better. WoTF is decent for 5 fights, Beserking is good for every fight.
---
So if you're min/maxing exclusively for pve and are going holy, you go troll, no contest.
---
How big is it?
---
Haha, he's joking because i specifically asked about the racials in regards to Rogues. Thanks though!
---
&gt; why would specs who don't need or want that gear do the raid content?
---
It's not like Warlocks skip MC.
---
At the very least level skinning while you're leveling and horde the leather on bank alts for later.
---
It's very rock/papers/scissors. It depends on who you're going up against, what class, etc. IE, Will of the Forsaken is a great pvp ability - but it only applies to classes that use Fear. Hardiness is a great ability, but only applies to Stuns. 
---
If I had to pick between Human and Gnome, I'd pick Orc.
---
I didn't actually raid till a couple of months before Burning Crusade launched because I was levelling so slow (I was in no hurry to hit 60, just wanted to enjoy the world). Joined Storm of Formosa and did a bunch of MC/AQ20/ZG clears, but they had it pretty much on farm by that point so my job was mainly to stand around and spam rank 4 healing touch.
---
I do remember being outside the bank in Ironforge the day Eternal was formed and there were a bunch of people talking about it on trade chat. My vague recollection was that there was a bit of drama involved with Archon (which I think was the top raid guild at the time?), or something like that. Maybe some people from Archon jumped ship to Eternal or were thinking of it? It's been too long, and I don't remember!
---
night elf druid sounds fun
---
50 is the max characters you can create on 1 wow account or a bnet account?
---
I’d just like to know why so many seem so dependent on them given this communities insistence that classic content is such a breeze.
---
1000+ damage arcane shots say yes. Plus you can put double wizard oil if you manage to find an offhand mageblade.
---
I found my speed increased incredibly when I get a wand at level 5.  I never found getting one difficult at all as a priest as soon as you're out of the starting area.
---
&gt;Is this on a new server, at launch, an hour or two after the servers went live? Because I heavily doubt it. 
---
Yes.  It was launch day.  It obviously wasn't the minute the server launched, but creating and DE'ing greens from Tailoring doesn't take long.  It only takes 30 minutes to get to level 6 if you keep up a half decent pace.

Generally speaking, reserve lists and warm bodies will be better than under staffing a raid.

You'll definitely gear faster by splitting up the core group to different resets, but no reason not to bring socials or PuGs in.

Was looking for this. Still, technically if you wanted to force spawn another chest in the zone it would be more efficient to loot everything right?
---
There are some few exceptions, for sure, but those are mostly due to bad itemization from Vanilla days.
---
If new content/gear was introduced, the itemization would be better and more in-line with specific specs/classes.

Ascent Rogue not using SnD once, because he doesn’t even have it on his bars lmao.
---
Always Skinning 1-59.
---
Drop it for whatever you want @ 60.
---
Flying, increased level cap, dailies, talent/class overhauls
---
I used to have one of these when they were released. Heavy as hell, but awesome and very well made. Unfortunately, new ones aren't made any longer as I believe they were only made as a WOTLK promotion type deal.
---
Erh? The arena players of today’s scene dominated the duel tournament and shat on all the private server heroes. BFA has made just about all of retail go to shit, but Legion actually has a design that made for the most fair and balanced pvp the game has yet seen (that said, I prefer wow being asymmetric and interesting, rather than every class so close to the same).
---
Clearly this is a rogues wet dream of a weapon look at that attack speed. It just need to be enchanted to have +15 agi to put it over the top.
---
Oh im blind lol. I would still say troll is better for pve, orc is def better for pvp
---
That's also when I started seriously playing Shaman! I much prefer that version of elemental though
---
Wotf still has it's uses since you can prepop it to avoid getting fear interruption. 
---
Tremor ticks every 2 seconds (If I recall correctly), so you will spend 1 second on average running around like headless chicken anyways. Unless your shaman is really MVP and can time the totem tick in the same spell batch with fear.
---
The minimum I found was acceptable was 29-31 depending on gear level. It’s hard with 30 green machines but easy when every one is Mc/bwl geared
---
You cannot mail items cross faction. You also can’t make characters of both factions on the same realm if it’s a PVP server.
---
&gt;Lok'amir
---
I completely agree - this is BiS until you can get Nef down (phase 3). But even then the  **Grand Marshal's Warhammer** is BiS. The question is who will make the grind for it.
---
Yes,
---
there are a lot less rogues on PvE servers as you said, because on PvE servers everything a rogue can do, a warrior does better.
---
And content that is geared towards rogues can just be bruteforced with enough warriors or one warrior with enough gear.
---
Leveling skinning is very easy compared to the other professions, because you only need a handful of mobs to get your skill up, and then you move to the next area.
---
I suspect everyone and his brother will be leveling skinning, so leather will be cheap as shit on the AH.    So, I would just buy the lower level leathers off the AH.
---
I think he probably does the over the mountain skip.  Basically, there is a mountain to the west of Ironforge and east of Gnomregan that you can walk up.  You get to the top, jump off the other side and your corpse is considered to be in the Wetlands.  You just spirit rez there and bam, you're at Menethil Harbor.
---
There's a similar skip to get back to IF as an NE.  You can swim south of Menthil and get to a small pocket of water that is considered to be in Dun Morogh.  You then drown and spirit rez outside IF.
---
yeah srsly lol idk get this guy. omg he grped up with friends now i have to get my friends and have a battle organically gahhhh its soooo annoying. lol sit back and relax and have fun and kill some foos
---
It doesn't decay that harshly. I played around with different values to take this into account, starting with a 40% decay and eventually coming down to 20% above 200.
---
You can go away for 4-6 weeks and only lose 1 items worth of DKP, which really isn't much.
---
Throw in a full reset at the start of each Phase and I think it's good to go
---
Yeah, and even with gear dropping, on pull threat is a whole different animal than it is/has been on retail for a long time with things like Misdirect and Tricks of the Trade. If you pop all cooldowns on pull to maximize berserking there’s a good chance the boss is going to turn your way and tanks/healers/other raid members are going to get tired of it.
---
Die in a fire.
---

Demon Hunter
---
Thanks man. Having the market cornered does sound enjoyable but I don't think I can be bothered with the grind of LW after choosing a specialisation. It's the low level benefits that interest me. Did you find that the gear LW provided at low levels had a significant impact on the time taken to kill mobs and overall survivability?
---
The videos were done in 1.6 and earlier.  Most classes got buffed after that.
---
This sounds like the best of both worlds to me. if I can get away with healing until about 35, then that is what I will do.  Thanks for the insight.
---
Share it
---
While true, if you know no AoE damage is going out, it's fairly safe to use.
---
Also, Berserking, to get the full benefit, requires you dropping your health to 40%. Mid-fight, that's also a risk.
---
Killing stuff faster &gt; more gear with much longer raids.  This is classic, no reason to rush progression.
---
So.... 8.2 and 8.3 are still part of THIS expansion the storylines that they've been building up are finally starting to come to a head in 8.2. Do you really think you can write a story that's just all excitement all the time? Well I guess you can, they're called Michael Bay movies.
---
I walked to the GameStop every 2 months to get a time card for WoW with cash.  You didn't need a credit card at all.
---
It's a bad build, but if you were really trying to optimize it you would want to take two points out of imp sinister Strike and sleight of hand to pick up hemo. Hemorrhage is WAY better at building combo points and will give you more control over targets.
---
I’ve been looking into the FC/IS balance build. What was your itemization like with this build?
---
Archon, yeah! I do think that was the name of the guild on the server!

This was the case of victim blaming.  The kid being the victim and the mother being a shit parent and causing the kid to have little checks in his life.
---
Imo there's no reason to think that the skillful players back then couldn't be proportionately better. It's possible that they've become maladaptive but there's no reason to assume that. Smart people generally get smarter as they get older. As long as they still had an interest in games, chances are they're even more capable than before. I don't really understand why we're comparing their abilities from 13 years ago to high level contemporary players.
---
Heirlooms.  Nothing made content worse than that stuff trying to rush you through levels where you didn’t care about rewards.  I’d be 100% ok with level boosts being sold for 58, 68, or whatever the launch level for a particular expansion was, because it IS bullshit that you have to re-level through old expansions because they didn’t want areas to be too crowded at launch.  Blood Elves/Draenei should have left their islands at 58, Death Knights should have finished their starting area at 68, and cataclysm should have retuned Azeroth to level you straight to 80 without having to run through BC and WotLK again.  
---
Honestly every expansion deserved its own adventuring primer to tell you what’s going on, not leaving you scratching your head because you weren’t around for the launch event and having no idea what’s going on because creating a new character is a temporal mess.
---
&gt; The arena players of today’s scene
---
Venruki/Cdew were the arena players of TBC, so... ?
---
I think you're misreading what I wrote. I'm saying that the best players haven't improvement immensely. Those two aren't even as good as they use to be but they do just fine compared to "the best" that private servers have to offer - and I'm not even sure that either of them were actually spectacular. A lot of arena junkies in 2008 weren't into the esports thing because there wasn't millions of dollars in sponsorship awaiting you
---
Berserking is better in lategame bloodfury better early but you should pick orc because why pass up on the amazing pvp racials
---
Now that's a census result I'd love to see.
---
RBGs are hardly that competitive. There’s a reason their not the competitive format, nor that competitively active.
---
We REALLY need convincing evidence of armors ability to go negative in 1.12 (or classic server testing when it becomes viable to test). If armor can’t go negative, BRE becomes pretty trash, especially when OEB has that perfect natural 8 sword skill baked right into it.
---
Just read about the encounter strategy and watch videos if you're worried.
---
Idk, this doesn't seem like it needed to be a question in a thread.
---
I feel like I applied to that guild once in my early days lol
---
You carry around demonic runes as a rogue of course
---
I play alliance and gnomes are still my least favorite race. I might punt them myself if I could
---
That exact same argument applies to Vanilla, yet somehow there are still no changes to the awul systems and content of Vanilla Classic.
---
I'm going straight back to what I listened to during Classic: nonstop Children of Bodom.
---
For some reason I specifically picture a gnome in T2.5 from that guild.
---
Oh yeah sorry I am blind
---
&gt; Can you play enhancement or elemental in raids and pull your own weight in DPS?
---
nope. not possible.  you play a healer and then you can do some DPS auto attacking while you try and regen some mana while other healers are taking over.
---
https://vanillafriends.com/
---
Feel like this has been their mentality since wod. _ooo we know wod wasn't really finished when we released it... But wait til net expansion!!_
---
There are a few holes where it is VERY scarce though.
---
I hear BFA will be good once its out of beta in a few hundred years
---
Do you think that mob and boss mechanics will matter again in classic? Not just lol, faceroll, overhear everything.
---
Tried a couple. Different game.
---
if you plan to keep tailoring leveling with it is fine, keep in mind however that Dire Maul wont be an option for 3-4 months depending on phase 2 release so it might be safer to keep one gathering profession since holy spec mobs grinding is pain and you already have moneysinks - robe mats and maybe recipe if it doesn't drop on runs and engi - major sink
---
It’s not the true classic experience unless everyone is 8-15 years old
---
Man, the biggest thing for me is that except for like one day a week, I rarely have the time to sit waiting to get a dungeon group together, *then* do the dungeon. So I have a feeling I'll get caught up doing stuff in the mean time and out-level the dungeon :( But I want to get back in the non-max level 5s, especially SM. I freaking loved SM even though I was only ever there for the 1H sword quest... I don't remember it having much for rogues, lol
---
I love how you completely leave out the fact that this also has the best +healing for paladins pre-Nef....
---
nice try though
---
Thanks for your response. Your plan sounds like a good one - I think I'll do the same to avoid weekly respecs.
---
To be fair, seeing a completely naked rogue may have had them laughing and thinking they wouldn’t die. They could also simply have been caught without a trinket equipped and no pet out. Like, to your point, there is a reason it was mostly wpvp and not duels, and if they had the tools and didn’t use them that would certainly be terrible play, but we don’t know the circumstances.
---
They've been building a storyline since legion, and a second one since the start of BFA and they've finished the exposition and are hitting the rising action. A lot of people are fans of Michael Bay and believe that rising action is all that matters. I wonder how they think you can have a meaningful story without the first bit but I guess it's not for everyone.
---
How some of these people that think it's just now getting good also think they will be fans of classic is also beyond me.
---
We’ve already had many grossly overtuned servers they’re called private servers.
---
Bored pal?
---
Auto loot is vanilla (shift + rightclick) and will be in classic ! Area loot isnt and therefore isnt in classic
---
And if you're the sucker, don't be the last one, let that ice cold milk get warm for the next dude.
---
For myself it's not a case of, oh pandas randomly showed up now. It's more of a, they have literally disappeared from the game since mop. Don't see anything relating to them or any form of importance since mop.
---
Would love to have a panda be like, wtf you guys doing, whilst sipping on his brew.
---
you dont look around much do you..
---
Me and a couple og my friends Will be playing
---
Was wind walker ever a thing in wow lore?
---
Mage blade comes out in phase 2. Phase 2 won't last hat long. Not long enough for every mage and warlock in your raid to get their item.
---
Brokentooth does the same dps as any other cat in the game in PVE. Wolves do less dps than Cats, Raptors or Wind Serpents endgame. All that Wolves do is buff your parties damage, not your own as the Hunter is rarely in the 10 yard range for the buff, personal preference but I will not be using one.
---
It's going to be much better in classic when gear just doesn't drop as much so there's nothing to get upset about.
---
Didn't Blizzard ban a shitload of people back in April because they were using the Arctium launcher for model editing? I really wanna set up my binds and addons, but I'm a paranoid chicken shit.
---
I was 17 in classic.
---
Iirc the only one that mattered: blind. The real hero of that whole thing
---
Skinning doesn't cost you money.   It nets you money from vendoring the skins.
---
Always try to kill rogues cause if you don’t they gunna pull up with that sap stun backstab when your not looking.
---
I'm not comparing them dick cheese, I'm saying that pvp and pve have done a fine job keeping vanilla "a real thing".
---
The wolfs in LBRS have the highest rank howl you'll want one of those.
---
I've been reading your replies here with  the voice of Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons in my head and it's very fitting
---
Yeah fair point.
---
Female dwarf rogues are an abomination, attack on sight
---
100% agreed. Seems a lot of them seem to have been caught with their pants down. I wouldn't even be surprised if the NE rogue standing on the tram was afk tbh lol
---
That´s so funny. Nowadays most guilds would kick him for not using buffs :D
---
I don't disagree with you, I was merely referring to the comment about making everything post-TBC irrelevant; unfortunately, if you run a Linear Progression System, that is what happens.
---
Would keeping the content on Azeroth have made Tiers 1-3 any less relevant? It'd definitely have kept the two continents more active, I fully agree though.
---
Yeah this is true. If OP has a preference of swords over daggers I would say troll. There are more swords with procs, viable procs I should say. Perdition’s blade’s proc shouldn’t be counted since it’ll see its use in MC and BWL and there is too much complete fire resistance on boss mobs.
---
I don’t remember how old I was, too lazy for math to figure it out.
---
Pretty sure chests are scripted to despawn 5-10 minutes after being opened for the first time. I think.
---
But how much of the haste benefit do those actually increase? Are you going to click off Fort and stuff, too, just to get a little more haste benefit? It doesn’t seem like a rune would push the benefit to its maximum.
---
Oh and neither of the people in your example have any issues I’m sure. Lol
---
My class has less moves and has a mundane 1-4 rotation that I am shockingly surprised people can't manage to do. 
---
I did some time walking, no one kicks, no one interrupts. Up to tbc and maybe even wrath, if your questing and don't interrupt.. you will die.. but luckily this is bfa now and I can just speed run everything cause nothing is difficult, don't even matter if people interrupt.
---
Is a new thing the tweeny boppers say now to those of us who are probably millennials. They think it's funny to call us baby boomers lol. The ironic thing is how much the actual boomers used to say how entitled/lazy we were as millennials. Now the tweeny boppers are upset that we think that about them, so they call us boomers.
---
Lets hope not.
---
Did you even watch the Beta tournaments? 3 out of 3 were won by pure retail players.
---
I don't have a horse in the race here, and I don't run extensive sims, but isn't AQ worm gun better than Rhok? Higher top-end, slower speed, better stats?
---
Yeah I was born in 1989 and am probs one of the older ones here
---
Odds always matter.  It’s just a question of whether whether you’re talking RNG or how much the loot council likes you that week.
---
Rogues and warlocks.
---
Sure I gank every leveling warrior I see, but I don't hate them. They just happen to be so easy to kill 😂
---
a qualified yes - if they want to get good data, they are more than capable of asking the right questions.
---
i have seen some surveys/questions with multiple choice answers from them that make clear they are targeting a particular outcome set for answers (in other words, avoiding certain types of responses by not making them options, or avoiding certain obvious questions).
---
Rogues can tank if the tank dies. We have the utility to do it. You just gotta pop evasion and have the dps to kill it in a dungeon. They can be your last ditch effort in a raid too provided what you’re killing is close to dead. I even tanked a core hound for 10 seconds as a rogue with evasion. I tanked Ony for 5 seconds long enough to move her back into position.
---
Then he is inconsistent because he talks about normalization which didn't happen till 1.8

I meant to do that after you got to 60.

Ah awesome, thanks!

Since I'm going gnome I'll probably just do dun morogh and then elwynn a bit before moving into westfall.

Just wait until phase 1 and 2 are on farm for everyone and all the mains have their bis, then start rolling on the dps gear.

I used to be a retail manager and a lot of people under 20 that worked there wanted to play it. Either cause they knew someone older that played it when they were kids or they never got a chance to play it due to strict parents.
---
I doubt they'll see the long haul but who knows?
---
If I was referencing a lvl 60 tournament you would find some other dumb reason to invalidate it.

I didn't even notice Imp DS. Totally useless in PvP.

I'm a long time Hunter player but rolling Warrior main as well due to this crap, not even going to get into how much of advantage melle gained over the leeway mechanic. If you can't beat em join em.

I’ll bet magic dust wasn’t intended to be used in bwl either but it is. What’s the point in world buffs if not to use them in raids?

Cheers, I think I'm going to settle on Tailor/Skinning and just try to farm the robes asap at 60 and then drop it for something else, which will be decided at 60 depending how things go i guess.
---
&gt;Expecting the most integral core and invested players of a guild to pass on loot is Dumb. LC Rules! \o/
---
I'm highly confused

Thank God. I hate how they don't on private servers. I clear through an entire cave, get to a chest at the end and...1 Alterac Swiss
---
To be honest, I don't want another IRL collectable card game I have to endlessly buy packs for to get cosmetics / mounts.

Perpetual Purple Firework is one I remember costing me around $80.
---
Night, blood, high, nightborne, void. Which one am I missing?
---
How does soft reserve work if say two hunters picked the xbow, then the boss for the xbow drops it.  One hunter wins it.  Does that winning hunter get to roll against the other hunter for the remaining "hunter items" that drop later on in the raid?
---
I believe he is; he posted his first video here last week. Either way, this just goes to show that he still has a lot of fans, haha.
---
Precisely this.
---
I should specify self-healing abilities. Rogues got a poison that heals them when they damage an infected target and a combo point finishing move that was a HoT. 
---
Warriors got a killing-blow activates heal that gave back a considerable amount of health.
---
Classic and Vanilla are exceptionally helpful communities by the way.
---
Ohh...
---
The replies...
---
I guess we're actually a big ol' bag of dicks without a handle.
---
Hunter main, bank alt and after MC&amp;Onyxia is on farm then another Hunter for PVP.
---
There is only 1 way men release their milk. And i yet have to see a female centaur ingame
---
Well that's probably true but guess what, most of the pvp done on classic is gonna be wsg.
---
Sure you can skip it, if you like. I figured that the way to Tirisfal might only take a 5-10 min. detour from Orgrimmar. Alternatively you can tame a "Dreadmaw Crocolisk" in Durotar for at least "Bite - Rank 1".
---
I think there was only one person under 16 in my entire guild during vanilla.  There were like three people that had "real jobs" and everyone else was late high school or in college
---
Holy shit.
---
I hope your choice isn’t PvP based. Warriors are the worst 1v1 class and struggle a lot in PvP, unless you got a pocket healer.
---
Because of course they are. Same as the language bs. I don’t know why blizzard are so asinine they need a face smack on these simple matters before they wake the fudge up.
---
i believe it was 6
---
I do remember an enhancement shaman with hand of rag completely face rolling priests which by any other class was very hard to take down a priest.
---
I’m 52 and I cant wait
---
Same  - your other points are valid though. My point to this (other than reading funny comments) was to point out that there are a ton of items like this that are beneficial for more than a single class. This should be a consideration for paladins for phase 1 because it helps keep the tank up.
---
The other side is this helps kill the boss faster. Both points are valid and should be considered.
---
Excellent post, but you can’t use both the MC and ZG trinkets together as using one puts the other on a 30 sec CD.
---
I really disliked both NE hunters and dorf priests as an undead mage in wsg and AB.
---
Would be more if Eu could post on us : [
---
Ya I’d like to hear individual opinions lol
---
I am not sure what gear level you would need to do it, but I am certain it could be done.
---
This is so beyond true, I don't think people understand just how many guilds and options there will be in comparison to a private server, especially once we have the option to transfer servers. You may not find yourself in the absolute top guild on your server because of the stigma towards hybrid classes but there are also plenty of top tier guilds that do want a shadow priest for their warlocks.
---
yes, they have.  vanilla servers have been around for years but they are not run by blizzard.
---
i been raiding vanilla for the past 3 years.  other have been for even longer
---
The fuck are you on about? The vast majority of players are still American and Brits
---
I´m not even dead set on a faction fml
---
There are some boss mechanics were you can take damage, but sometimes a demonic rune can help a bit. Yeah you could knock off some buffs if you don't think you gonna need them, maybe a bit of a bold move but why not
---
You got lucky. Every group I was in had tender hooves and short fangs. Get on teamspeak and everyone’s talking like a softpaw.
---
As guilds naturally gear up from raiding every week, they eventually get to the point they can then down more bosses from the stat boosts provided by said gear.
---
World buffs are just an extra boost they aren't really necessary except for the hardest of bosses such as twin emps, c'thun and the second half of naxx.
---
"Bite - Rank 8" aswell! :)
---
So at some point you need to tame one of them.
---
like you would make the cut ;)
---
RemindMe! August 26
---
Personally, troll rogue is my jam. I think that news just puts them on more equal footing, so I still think looking at other comparable aspects becomes more important. Super vague and unhelpful right?
---
Yeah I understood what you meant and I still find it ridiculous
---
there was already a poll
---
World buffs in general aren't used in progression. It makes no sense to use them for progression. Half your raid is probably going to die on your way to a progression boss. You use world buffs to do MC+BWL in 2 hours combined so you can start your harder stuff.
---
I don't think it's that tricky.  You can increase the power levels without having massive gear inflation.  3-5 ilvls wouldn't be much, but if there was a different spread of stats on gear it could go a long way toward being desirable or shaking up the meta.
---
Remember TBC invalidated Naxx epics with blues equippable at lvl 61 and greens equippable at like 63.
---
Resto shaman that totem twist have like, half their GCD taken up by actually casting the totems. 
---
Enh shaman keep autoattacking throughout the GCD caused by totem twisting, thus at least doing their relevant function.
---
I’m a rogue that’s more than willing to wait on brutality blade.
---
Try out osrs? Playing it while waiting for classic and it's actually sick
---
Anyway yeah you would definitely have a good time here. The community is really not that elitist and most of the people joining up on classic haven't played in 13 years it's not like they are gonna remember it all.
---
You and I shared an oddly similar taste in music in 2006. Lol
---
Yes you have. Vanilla WoW has female centaur models. They are usually caster-type mobs. [Example](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/b/bc/Centaur.png?version=0c248a80a1edf307907e3217aac6e36d)
---
Modern quasi science at its best
---
Ret prio
---
warlock all the way scrubs ;) yes yes i serve dinner on back of the raid mmkay
---
I actually already had shadow panther bookmarked and completely forgot about it. Thanks!
---
i always get a level 60 rogue with an epic mount for herb/mining...and ganking in redridge
---
Their death animation / vo sounds so satisfying.
---
You could also have content specific resistances. Mc needs fire res aq nature... would it not be possible then to have a horizontal gear progression. They would not have to increase stats, just adding interesting set bonuses that buff certain specs along with having "that dungeons resistance on items" should make each raid it's own contained progression. Leaving the progression you have made on other raids on that raids gear. No?
---
So on Pservers even with the armor that was higher there, we had no issues clearing Onyxia with 28 players in mostly pre-raid bis + good MC gear with some BWL gear sprinkled in. Those players need to be doing everything though. You can't really carry people at that point.
---
It is
---
I want all the loot, and I want to come back 45 minutes later and loot it again. I don’t want to be a asshole and it hurts me to be one sometimes in this case anyways.
---
What does min maxxing mean in Classic?
---
I’d imagine ions tweets are on par with blue posts. That doesn’t mean it’s not subject to change though. Also as always he clearly worded it in a way to make it not set in stone.
---
A normal Sub from what I can tell
---
Vurtne wouldnt stand a chance to someone like Venruki let's say.
---
Vurtne was a god for its time but its not comparable. That doesnt mean he's discredited in any way but players that are the best now just have years or experience behind them now, and the evolution of the internet made sharing knowledge about the game 10 times easier.
---
Now that the old macro system is out of the way.. making stance dance and start attack macros for literally everything warrior will be a bit easier!
---
Those bearded dudes?
---
Just the monthly sub, probably could have found this in the search bar.
---
Bullshit.  How did he post something to youtube from a patch that didn't exist when he posted it?  
---
You can go look at the original postings from 2005.  How did he post shit more than a year before the patch came out when you allege he recorded it.  
---
It does not say it was recorded in patch 1.10-1.11 of WoW...
---
orc female warrior. I know that in 99% of cases they will try to gank me so I usually try to get them first
---
Kiss fan that never knew this song from south park was Paul Stanley. Wow.
---
I plan on leveling a shadow priest to 60 first.  I raided as a hunter and disc/holy priest in vanilla so I'm not too interested in doing that again, so once everyone outgears me in pvp I'll probably switch to a mage that I'll be leveling in the background and join some casual raiding guild.  but i've done all the vanilla raid content apart from naxx past 4 horsemen so pvp on the shadow priest will be my focus in classic.
---
I also wouldn't mind trying a rouge, it's a class i never played past a lvl 19 twink.
---
bye bye Humar XD
---
Yeah not you
---
Makes sense.
---
Wowclassicbis.com has pve bis by phase.
---
Problem is that you can't see the cooldown.
---
&gt; If anyone, the community needs to work out such a document because it is our interests it's supposed to be defending,
---
I agree 100%
---
&gt; problem obviously being that we have a billion different opinions so we would never agree on a constitution unless it's so vague it also happens to be useless.
---
Not unanimously, but, I think if we had a "majority rule" mindset, say 80% (literally a random number) approval rating it's at least a step in the right direction.
---
I strongly dislike osrs. I played runescape since 2005 and while its nostalgic, I cant stand the graphics and the 1 dimensional combat. I'm aware wow classic graphics arent up to industry standards but from what I have seen on youtube they arent in the same realm as osrs. 
---
I loved rs3 up until about 2 years ago when the elite pvm community changed so much, you basically have to be bug abusing and have your entire screen covered in interfaces to keep up.
---
Yup. And those are mostly go into Razorfen dungeons and kill very specific mobs, possibly with the help of someone else.
---
Yeah, really bummed they cancelled it though, considering I got 3 days of free game time that I was saving for the 25th. Guess I'll use old retail gold that I apparently have to buy game time (if stress test is available for all subs), since it'll cover the name reservation as well.
---
But in case of a invitation-only event I'm considering using the sandbox. I'm really particular about my add-on setup, but I plan on beating the zerg - no time to spend hours setting up ElvUI!
---
Only if it gets brought up
---
Just a subscription I think, but who the hell knows for sure at this point.
---
I dont get why a paladin wouldnt want to roll on this or why a raidgroup would care if they did. What am I missing?
---
Elem devastation is relevant if you somehow get Enh gear from AQ40/Naxx.
---
I have an enh shaman on private server with basically BIS gear, I have about 12% spell crit unbuffed, about 25% melee crit if I remember correctly.  Doing r1 earth shock on cooldown will cause Devestation to pop pretty frequently, and if you want you can wear a few other +spell crit pieces.  I'd say it's definitely worth it once you get past 10% spell crit or so, since you get spell crit both from the obvious "+1% chance to crit with spells" and also from +int which tons of shaman gear has.
---
Choosing a specific race because you can squeeze out 2% more damage. Getting best in slot items pre raids, loading up on every buff and consumable listed on the wiki. 
---
Basically optimizing every aspect of the game.
---
\^This
---
Answering your summary; Yes, there will be a community there with you. Casual or not, you can have a lot of fun in this game. It just may take longer to get max level is all.
---
Well they got the memo about language servers... but that seems like a different case entirely. Most people on an RP-PvP server won’t have language barriers for content.
---
Some mage quit the guild I was in because a paladin tank got it.
---
It's not a beard, it's more of a veil of some kind that covers the lower half of their face. If you look closely you'll see that they have titties
---
I’m leveling with a warrior friend - should I still go Enhance and switch to Ele at 40? Or with a buddy is Ele gonna be the way to go?
---
I want to be supportive, but most of these macros don't work or are poorly constructed. Just on the face of it, you use no conditional statements and that really restricts what your macros can do. I'll go through them in order.
---
It's good that you addressed that it would take two button presses (weapon swaps incur a 1s GCD) for your Shield Block macro to work. However, you really need to point out that the "Emergency Shield Wall" has the same problem. 
---
Your Taunt/Mocking Blow macro won't work at all. It will always try to cast Mocking Blow, and will spam you with an error about being in the wrong stance if you're in Defensive Stance. You need to include the conditionals \[stance:1\] and \[stance:2\] respectively. Added to that, focus doesn't exist in Classic.
---
Your Bandage macro is interesting, however it is way more complicated than necessary and is specific to a single character. Instead of using /target &lt;name&gt;, you can simple include /use \[@player\] Bandage. This way, you can continuously keep your target, so you won't need /targetlasttarget, and you can use the same macro on multiple characters.
---
On the same note, you should encourage a more versatile bandage macro. Your advanced bandage could read /use \[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[help,nodead\]\[@player\] Bandage. This would try to bandage a friendly player being moused over first, a friendly target second, or yourself regardless of target third. You don't need to specify a character's name.
---
Your Pummel macro doesn't work because there's no focus, and you don't need a separate mouseover anyway. You also don't need \[nomod\] if you simply switch the order. Instead it should read /use \[mod:shift,@mouseover\]\[\]Pummel (and you really don't even need the mod:shift unless you're super concerned about accidentally mousing over an enemy).
---
It gets even worse man, azerite traits that obsorb stupid amounts of damage, can heal me on every kill... And these azerite traits stack too. As far as rogues they have a vial that heals for 42% of your health as a short HoT but it has a 30 second cool down. 
---
Oh and I have leeching from my racial, and from my poisons that also heal me.
---
Can't speak for /u/dwirthy, but my experience is that on top of normal guild drama, you add in RP drama which makes the average guild lifespan even shorter.
---
For example, an orc player quite active in the guild deleted his character and made a new one with the same name as an Undead, joined the guild, and said he was the same character who had mysteriously become an undead orc. Guild quickly splintered between people who thought this was a cool story idea and people who thought it was lame, lore-breaking and unimmersive.
---
We hopefully will eventually, but it’s the “eventually” bit that’s the issue.
---
I mean mostly yes but some of the old bosses are still good and playing pservers under different names.
---
I have legit raided with two montage mages and a rogue.. like WCM big hits montages. They are out there.. just dunno how well they want to be publicized under their alias'.
---
If it weren't for Warlocks, they would be the strongest class in the game at duels.
---
Warlocks shut you down hard. Curse of Tongues just ruins you. Rogues who use every single one of their cooldowns can do a number on you as well (though you can beat them when they don't).
---
Or it’s just you
---
Good thing most boss fights are just zergfests in Vanilla until AQ/Naxx.
---
I'm trying to imagine how you would need to twist your left hand weirdly, but I can't. My pinky naturally falls over Shift when keeping Ring - A, Middle - W, Index - D.
---
Whats the latest news on layering? Are stress tests and betas over now? Who played at the end and how was it?
---
I'm sure those kinds of guilds will advertise heavily in game, and will be on every server.  
---
Nah, go in blind.  Nothing worse than being swayed by mediocre YouTubers with below amatuer photoshop skills and clickbait titles.
---
Play, spec poorly, look up a quick guide and switch the spec to something workable before PUGing (pick up group, or a looking for group by hand) the higher level dungeons and raids.
---
The bandage macro can just be changed to. 
---
    #Showtooltip Heavy Runecloth Bandage

---
The first meaningful server choice is PvP vs PvE.
---
On a PvE server, all PvP is voluntary. You can always flag yourself, but you won't automatically be flagged unless you're in an enemy main city, which you don't really wander into by accident.
---
On a PvP server you are flagged in any neutral zone or enemy controlled zone, so expect a lot more combat with other players.
---
There's also RP servers, possibly PvP-RP, in which people might act "in character" to some degree or another. YMMV.
---
It's not any sort of hard rule, but historically most PvP servers have more horde players and most PvE servers have more alliance players. Also it should probably be noted only Horde have Shamans and only Alliance have Paladins.
---
Everything else is a gamble at this point. Will the server you pick have a high/medium/low population? Will it have good raiding guilds? Will it have popular streamers? No idea at this point.
---
You'll be fine.
---
No hole is scarce in my plan ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
This is the best one yet. Good job.
---
You're stressing out, don't it will be alright.
---
Why aren't you a little doomsayer, oh yes you are:)
---
Launching with hundreds of bugs is the classic experience though
---
I’m 22 and I feel like I’m probably one of the youngest who will be playing. Even friends I had growing up considered wow an “old game” in like 2009.
---
$15/month 
---
Welcome to wow papa, the game starts at 1 - not 60 - have fun!
---
+1 to this.  Rogues WRECK me as tauren enh shaman.
---
Actually preparation would be quite a balance factor.
---
It would be a direct buff to alliance, because shamans are dispelling offensively while the alliance is dispelling defensively.
---
Now alliance will throw every shitty buff they have on everybody respawning significantly weakening shaman purge.
---
As I'm playing horde and alliance with paladins are already strong enough: No!
---
To add onto this, being the MT is a role you will most likely naturally fall into. As many others have said, if you are able to make every single raid and be very committed then sure, you could become the MT for a guild. But yeah, if you're getting burnt out then you're better off not volunteering yourself into that role and being an offtank. If you end up loving classic and playing all the time then maybe eventually you'd take that MT role.
---
No my loot council has rules on how we hand out loot. Healers and tanks have priority. I’m on my guilds loot council. We gave the first mageblade to a holy paladin. We also have rules on how to increase your loot priority. ( tanks and healers always trump dps)
---
I can't remember that far back - I want to say it was a rework but that is based on nothing concrete. The dmg/healing is significantly higher than both the MC dagger and 1h mace
---
At level 60, you only need 20 points in Holy (Healing Light, Illumination) to heal 5-man dungeons. You can put the rest in Retribution to use 2H + SoC for leveling.
---
People say 20/0/31 is a meme spec but it's perfectly viable for healing battlegrounds and 5-man dungeons. It's also good for solo PvE and leveling. The last thing you want is solo PvE as deep Holy spec. It's slow and painful and makes you want to quit.
---
And to a point where you're getting like 10% the XP until you can jump to the next group.
---
4hrs/day is plenty, I wouldn't even call that casual. Drinking while playing is the culture in many semi-hardcore guilds (just don't actually get drunk so that you're annoying on disc or playing poorly).
---
Going in blind is fine because all roads lead to 60. Be up front with people in grouping and in your guild that you're new and know nothing; almost everyone *worth playing with* is happy to explain as long as you're up front so they don't mistakenly assume that you things you won't.
---
My advice: Just be chill with other people. It's a slower-paced game and sometimes things go poorly. Sometimes you have to wait around on others. Cultivate patience. Also stick in the role of the person who gets advice/suggestions/leadership rather than gives it until your second trip through the full server lifecycle.
---
I plan on doing an even mix of pvp and raiding. Ideally would like to do both as ELE, but realistically know I’ll probably have to go ELE pvp/Resto PVE
---
Oh! I'm EST, nice!
---
You guys under estimate the autism levels of vanilla wow players.
---
My money is on the autists over the streamer groupies
---
Pserver records don’t count.
---
it was highly hinted at with the EU announcement about no language specific servers. Thanks to community outcry it has been changed.
---
its usually not best to wait for something to be announced
---
First of all, I seriously envy you to be able to play this game from scratch. It is, imho, the greatest game I’ve ever played, and I’m ridiculously hyped to play something like it again. You’re in for a treat, and judging by your time put into OSRS, you seem to have the old-school grind-it-out mentality that every successful Classic player needs.
---
Secondly, I’m running a Horde PvP guild called &lt;Hope Rises&gt; (though we are in talks of changing it to “Hops Rises”, specifically because we love beer), and our approach is basically identical to yours: chill, fun, laidback, with an atmosphere of helping people learn the game free of e-peen. If you want to know more, message me on Disc @ Oleon#2355
---
Good luck, brother!
---
Should they be disabled? Yes. Will they be disabled? No, cause nochanges crew would never stop crying. End of discussion /s
---
Jokes aside, I can understand people that want them, and I can understand people that don't. What I hate is when people, like Skarm himself, saying that it should be done like in pservers and don't allow them for a period of time. They want the buffs to be disabled when they are making progression cause having them would take away part of THEIR fun, and when THEY are kinda equipped, they want the buffs to be able to farm the raids fast, cause otherwise they would again lose part of THEIR fun.

This isn't retail...
---
UD rogues/mages as the second you turn your back, they will jump you.
---
Not gona lie, on the beta I sometimes did this. Not maliciously or on purpose. But because I was always out of bag space I could only take the worth while stuff. Eventually you had nothing but worth while stuff that I had nothing to destroy to grab that piece of cheese :(
---
In a highly competitive speed running atmosphere, it goes to dps.
---
Healing is not an issue in MC not the upcoming raid, bwl. 
---
Dps will be the deciding factor (and not wiping) in who gets server first. 
---
Mage/Lock has fang, blade and staff of dom. Pala has hammer and blade. Priest gets bene. Druid on staff, hammer, fang. Sham on hammer/fang.
---
paul stanley lol...my vanilla name was starchild in his honor
---
I think that would be a good way to go.  Specifically the South Western Gnoll quests are probably the easiest and co-located to minimize travel time and you still get to do Hogger and get a green.
---
actually it looks like 3pm, my bad
---
What is layering? Could you write me a short explanation about it please?
---

Are they Adults of Bodom now?

Yer resilience was a terrible mechanic.
---
&gt; What form of raid loot distribution is the best?
---
I've only personally had experience with DKP, and I did not like it. The idea of loot council, if done right (which I'll get to) seems to be the best.
---
&gt; What form of raid loot distribution fails more often than not?
---
Need before greed. Too much chance for Ninja. 
---
&gt; What form of raid loot distribution will your guild use?
---
Loot council via democracy. Each class will be responsible for electing its officer. I.e., the mages will an officer for the mage class, warrior for warriors and so on. When loot drops, the elected officer will be responsible for distributing said loot to that class based on “need” or, really whatever that particular class wants. Non class specific items will be put to a vote by the elected officers to decide who will get it. 
---
Although, provided the rest of the guild agrees, the main and off tank will have priority for tanking gear/weapons. 
---
&gt; What form of raid loot distribution is ideal for pick-up groups (PUGs)?
---
Need before greed.
---
&gt; What guild structure is ideal; that is, are class leaders useful?
---
Democratic with some slight “authoritarianism” (someone has to crack the whip, might as well be someone most people agree with), and I do think that class leaders are useful for a variety of reasons. Making sure that all bases are covered for a raid so that a variety of spells are handy for each situation by talking to all their fellow class members about their spec and things of that nature. 
---
&gt; How many officers are ideal for a guild?
---
1 for each class, 1 for professions (to make that every profession and every “specialty” of each profession is covered) and a bank officer (to track who has given what and gotten what from the bank).  I think most other things can be handled by the guild leader. 
---
&gt; How will modern tools, like Discord, influence guild organization/structure?
---
Can’t comment. 
---
&gt; Did you use voice chat when raiding in retail Vanilla, and will you use it in Classic?
---
Yes and yes. 
---
&gt; Please share your own ideas, but feel free to use the above ideas as starting points of discussion
---
Democracy is the worst of all forms of government, but it’s still better than all the rest. I have hopes in starting my own guild and will run it democratically. I actually already have a “constitution” written up and will post it here on the guild recruitment post as we get closer to launch. As mentioned above, I’ve had bad experience with DKP in the past, but I absolutely understand the concerns many have with loot council based on their experiences too (and I’ve gathered that it’s mostly a core group of people hording the loot for themselves). So, my solution to that is have the people who will distribute the loot be elected officials who can be recalled at any time for any reason. This will (hopefully) force accountability onto the loot distributing officers to distribute loot fairly based on the needs of their fellow class members.
---
People can take that long and still want to be efficient, I'm not sure why you're having a hard time grasping that. I don't think anyone chooses to take forever on purpose, they are actually just, guess what, -having fun!- *gasps* playing the game! Doing every dungeon multiple times because they have fun doing it and like collecting the gear doesn't mean they are 'choosing to take forever on purpose' it means they prioritize enjoying their leisure time spent playing a video game over some arbitrary goal of maxing their character's level in the shortest amount of time possible. This same person can be interested in being efficient with their time spent out in the world while focusing on leveling, but still take time to do other things like max out all their professions. 
---
You're the one trying to correct peoples mindsets mate, not me. I'm not telling you to go slow, I myself will be speed leveling too. You're arguing that 240 hours is hugely off and anyone who takes that long is getting side tracked and intentionally going slow. I'm informing you of the fact that that will be average, if not faster than average.  
---
I'm sure the average person will have no problems joining the average guild, because that's the average.   
---
Also, MC will never be over, this isn't retail. Guilds who have had naxx on farm for 6 months will still be running multiple MCs per week.
---
&gt;I plan on mainly Pvping but I know Human is better at PVE for gearing up. I just want to hear people’s inputs. 
---
Eh's'doesn't make sense. 
---
If you plan on pvping why would obtaining gear through PvE matter?
---
Go gnome, get engineering, copy paste like everyone else, and rank to 10. 
---
Good luck!
---
Nah, he said don't level a gathering profession.  That implies that he wouldn't do mining.
---
Joining in on this bandwagon of love. I’m in Asia but I’ll be rolling EU. Stay in touch dudes, maybe we’ll meet on the same server in a month
---
You should give serious thought though as to what class you're going to play and think about the effect that it'll have on pvp. Once you decide a class, consider looking at their racials too to see if you prefer racials of Alliance or Horde.
---
Fun goes both ways, they use it to destroy content, a very chill casual guild can use to to make up for handicaps and actually enjoy beating content. I dont get why world buffs are viewd as a hardcore raider thing
---
...why?
---
&gt; Also, at the moment, I'm going in blind, I have no wow experience and I was kinda planning to just hop right in and see where it takes me. Will I regret doing this further down the road.
---
Mate, you will be going into the game like the majority of us did 15 years ago.  You will be literally living the experience that a lot of us will be trying to recapture.  
---
For the majority of us that initial sense of wonder is something we can never have again.  We will go into zones/dungeons and something will trigger a memory, but we can never get that initial reaction  like when you first leave Camp Narache and you round the bend and first see the rolling hills of Mulgore spread out before you, or leaving Northshire and wandering through Elwynn Forest and you see the ERP in your chat window....
---
I hope you have a blast experiencing the game for the first time.  Don't be in a rush and hopefully you can enjoy the game and all it has to offer.
---
wut
---
Did you just call it min-maxing to use consumables and getting pre-raid bis?
---
Robe of volatile power also
---
The bigger the server, the bigger chance of players being able to RP entirely freely. For example, on Argent Dawn EU, nobody can claim authority, because there are so many players that even if someone does so, hundreds of others will ignore it, so policing the RP becomes impossible.
---
On the other hand, in smaller communities, few people can end up controlling it all by having following of vast majority of players on the server. If there are let´s say 100 RPers, it´s possible for 95 of them to be part of some community, so if leaders say you are trash, nobody will RP with you.
---
It really depends on how popular will RP be in Classic (and by this I mean RP where you do story, not just RP where you play "in character", because that´s something you can do by yourself and I doubt that people who do some complicated event, fighting coven of warlocks in Westfall, will react to guy running all around the place, killing kobolds, asking them for help, because he got a job to kill kobolds from Gryan Stoutmantle). If big enough RP community forms, you may be free to do what you want.
---
Thank you for sharing x
---
So youre saying its a great way to make gold? /s
---
We dont know, cuz no max level classic
---
My game time for runescape is actually in runescape runescape (rs3). I dont like osrs at all, but yes it was very grindy. 
---
Sounds cool I'll message you, idk if I'm gonna play horde or alliance yet. Can you be in more than one guild at once? And do Pvp guilds like yours also do pve like raids and dungeons? I'll be mixing both.
---
my playlist will jusy be filled with trance music. ocean lab, above &amp; beyond, etc. sooo nostalgic
---
Heavy Leather is usually the first leather that becomes more profitable to sell on the AH.  That'll be dependent on server timeline, but after 2-3 weeks the AH usually settles down a lot and people that rushed to level 60 are buying up mats.
---
This is why serious / hardcore guilds require an alt asap... you split your progression group into two 20 man runs and gear those 20 mains.
---
I've seen people discussing it glee in rogue threads. Saying that since pick pocket isnt on GCD and with auto loot you can just macro PP to every stealth skill and you seemlessly pickpocket when you attack.
---
honestly nothing.  with a +100 lure and a +20 fishing rod you can fish anywhere at skill lvl 225.
---
It's an understandable mistake, I think they're the only NPC race in vanilla besides High Elves and Goblins to have both male and female models.
---
Haha also raided until mid AQ and wasnt even aware of consumables. I was a tryharder though behause I enchanted my gear :D
---
Don't discount Dwarves in a rogue vs rogue.  Basically, when a rogue blinds to heal up or you're cripple poisoned, you just wipe it and then their day.  Do the same for UD priest's Devouring Plague, but you're still screwed on other DoTs.
---
I played a Gnome rogue all through vanilla, from my experience. 
---
Ups:
---
* Small size makes you easy to overlook, smaller target to click on.  But you still have a giant name plate above your head.  Tab targeting negates the small clicking.  So it's very situational.
---
* You don't feel obligated to go swords/maces in PvE.  Daggers can pretty much be free reign for you.  Makes it nice for PvP as well since you can get plenty of PvE daggers
---
* Escape artist
---
* Pink or Green hair and beautiful mustaches
---
Downs:
---
* No sword/mace spec for raiding.  It's equal to 3% hit + small crit chance, increases damage of your glancing blows by 30% (which are 50%+ of your damage).  However, you can pretty much negate this by getting Aged Core Leather Gloves or Mugger's Belt and going dagger spec.  No real way to get +swords as a rogue outside of Maladath, and Maladath won't push you over the +5 breakpoint as well.
---
* Perception, but very situational on rogue vs rogue.  Arguably, you'd be better going night elf to get +1 stealth level over other rogues and more effective
---
* Lacking rep gain 10% - depends on how you value your time.  But if you're going to be grinding PvP, the rep grinds really don't matter.  Once you're exalted, there is no benefit
---
Did lootable corpses glow back in Vanilla, or did you just have to hover over each one to see if you got the loot icon?  I honestly don't remember anymore.
---
Tauren is fine. If the orc stun resist didn't apply to grenades, the two races would be basically equal.
---
Lich King
---
"A large majority of women"? If you honestly think that, it's not about me being naive, it's about you having a twisted view of the world.
---
Vanilla bosses have like 1 mechanic. Follow that or die or worse, wipe the raid.
---
Hahah yeah man, I remember that too. There's a Xmas vid of them delivering a world dragon to orgrimmar too, I'll have to dig that up when I get to a pc
---
Endurance Training is a waste because there's very few instances where your pet will go below 15% health. With Imp Hawk, you should be pulling the next mob as the one you're fighting is dying so I don't see how it's a waste? I agree with you on the rest of the points, it's just the first 5 points which seem bizarrely flat out wrong
---
&gt; Elem devastation is relevant if you somehow get Enh gear from AQ40/Naxx.
---
In what function?  Pvp?  Maybe?  Certainly no expert on enhance pvp.  But in raids, assuming you get in as an enhancement shaman, you probably won't really be casting spells unless your guild can nuke the shit out of bosses.   It cost a shitload of mana to just twist totems.  Also, you have to deal with 17% chance to miss.
---
Pyroclaysm is a daze, so yeah having the gnome ability to break out of that is decent i guess. But there are more stuns in the game then there are daze/roots/slows. So still Stun resist is better. I can tell you like gnomes and will do anything to defend them.
---
this whole thing started cuz people are trying to correct peoples mindsets, im saying the estimates are high. 
---
if someone wants to efficiently level i dont think they have done so if it takes them 240 hours.
---
I literally dont care if someone never leaves westfall if they have fun. But everyone should know that the options for play increase as you level. Obviously at 60 everything is available.
---
now we could just be arguing semantics here but i consider someone who wants to level efficiently as someone who doesnt get side tracked. Also dungeons grant more exp per hour
---
Based on the content of this sub, I assumed most people that are looking forward to classic are under 20.
---
Using the same account is no longer instant?
---
Let me check my crystal ball...
---
Huh, that's weird. It says here that each server type contains thousands of unique individuals with their own quirks and personalities and that trying to pigeonhole them into black and white categories is not only fundamentally flawed but also completely pointless and extremely stupid. It goes on to say that there are mature and immature people across all server types, and you should choose your server based on your own preferences rather than some nonsensical, misleading theory that X will be less toxic than Y because Z...
---
Huh.
---
Must be broken.
---
I've never played it, but thanks for the welcome \o/
---
Just combine Joana's with doing the group/elite quests and dungeons.  He doesn't actually skip all that many quests tbh.  Most are just those too difficult to solo quests.
---
Actually I recant my statement about seal fate since it's it's decent at best late AQ and will be worse on classic considering the world buff cooldowns and base \~4.8% less crit for melee.
---
Warcraft 3*
---
Yea it's almost like the point of the post is to discuss loot systems and guild structures, crazy right?

I feel like they did it with this in mind - yes they want the most people playing and paying for the game... but with more responsibilities - people are likely to fall off quicker... if they are actually betting on a massive player fall off after the first few weeks, the timing helps them a lot.
---
numbers always prevail, and there is a never ending supply of the groupies
---
Specifically getting All of the consumables, and All of the preraid bis would be minmaxing. 
---
Only getting “some” of them would not be minmaxing.
---
i like being the best

---
Did it last night with 30 in "fresh 60 greens" and quest-only blue gear.
---
Ah, sorry. I actually only played Runescape for a few hours as a middle-schooler, so I am to RS what you are to WoW :) And yeah, we will be raiding all of the content. In Vanilla, you need PvE gear if you want to be powerful in PvP. Ttyl!
---
**Layering**
---
Layering has evolved as a common means of vegetative propagation of numerous species in natural environments. Layering is also utilized by horticulturists to propagate desirable plants.
---
Natural layering typically occurs when a branch touches the ground, whereupon it produces adventitious roots. At a later stage the connection with the parent plant is severed and a new plant is produced as a result.

Don't take "Quiver of the Night Watch" from the "The Night Watch" quest. Like listed, you can get a better quiver at level 30 from a vendor. The 10 slot bag will serve you much better for much longer. Even tho the level req is 18 you're more likley to complete the quest around level 30.
---
Permanent phasing.
---
41 here. I'm also looking forward to meaningful social interactions. The fact that the game is great is just the cherry on top. The prospect of playing Classic has already brought together some people from my old crew back in the day, and that means a lot to me. Hopefully, we will be able to forge new friendships while exploring beautiful original Azeroth again!
---
Fucking yes.
---
Yep. Should be fine. Thanks for the concerns.
---
I was 31 at vanilla, with mental age 25. I am now 46 with a mental of 25.
---
sucks to be you, back to BfA I guess?
---
So its just a name thing? It's not mage'sblade its mageblade meaning magical. The hell do mages even do with +healing anyway? Looks like its designed for any caster that can hold a sword and especially considering pallys cant use staffs I cant see how there even is an argument they should not get a shot at this.
---
So the mistake here, is assuming that this sub is a complete representation of the community interested in classic wow.
---
2h fury may be viable, but I doubt it will be popular.
---
What always bothered me wasn't that Tiers 1-3 became less relevant, it's that EVERYTHING because less relevant. TBC was a separate game that required you to play part of the first game to participate.
---
They had loot sparkles but no glow
---
That's interesting.  Another thing to consider is bags drop like candy on the private servers, but almost never in vanilla.   People used to brag about getting a bag in gchat back in vanilla.   So, it might not even be worth picking up, because it just lowers your inventory that much more.
---
Trust, but verify. Trust your loot council to make good decisions for the guild and its members, and make every decision transparent so you can prevent abuse of the system.
---
I’m 12, going to own you all
---
Anyone complaining about the release being at the end of summer when people go back to school/work is either (1) a teacher or (2) under 20, especially the ones including work as they don't realize that's a year round commitment in the real world. And there were a lot of people complaining.
---
BF is better for bloodthirst, or  ambush / backstab where you want just a large burst of damage/AP.
---
Berserking is better if you have other sources of IAS to stack with, such as flurry, blade flurry, SnD, rapid fire, aspect of the hawk, etc.  for sustained attacks over its duration
---
Only do this in contested zones
---
Yup, they are all gnome or dwarf

Server first AQ and naxx
---
How as it a different game?
---
Let's compare Nostalrius with Classic. We are allowed to talk about Nostalrious. What made Nostalrius a different game than Classic?
---
&gt; in the best case scenario you are really only doing about 80% of the dps of a rogue.
---
It's a lot less than that, too. Enhancement shaman is *the* lowest DPS of all the DPS specs in the game (not counting elemental which is literally 0 DPS in a number of fights). Like not even half of a rogue's. Nightfall doesn't provide that much DPS, it was theorycrafted once to average about 5% more spell damage for the casters which ends up amounting to something like 200.
---
&gt;have your entire screen covered in interfaces to keep up.
---
Boy, would they love Eve
---
No doubt. Ppl that do this have 1 year subtracted from their irl life everytime they do it
---
It's gonna exist with layering 100%
---
Yeah I'm really interested to see how dm is handled, I would have to assume it's untouched since that's the way it was in classic.
---
Plus after so much gold, what's the point? It's not like having 10k gold is going to be needed.
---
I'm leaning to leveling a lock (again) as a main, and a druid alt. 
---
It seems that I get a different opinion about druids every time I ask. I had a hell of a time on one in TBC tanking 5 man, and easier raids, but just so much "Healer only, and sub-par at that) noise that I'm leery of ever getting a raid spot as my desired role.
---
Just two nips or like octa-nips like a cat or dog?
---
Lol nobodycares
---
Best way to do it is have alts and do for example two clears. 40 players, each player clearing twice with two characters. 20 mains and 20 alts to assist.
---
And 2hfury is more viable horde side thanks to WF, which isn't a problem for a pally.
---
They both have a 3 min CD iirc. but blood fury has its reduced healing component.
---
Ill just get priest to 60, respec to a disc holy mix and level a hunter or whatever looks fun.
---
Where do you think baby centaurs come from?
---
It's far easier now to gear up outside of raids than when I played my elemental shaman/lightning mage/Tesla Orc (accumulated quite few nicknames being a diehard ele shaman) in early vanilla.
---
I still remember the joy of just having my lightning bolts constantly hit over 500.
---
Then even more satisfaction when they started hitting for 1k constantly in 1.10ish.
---
The nice thing with shamans is that with 5 piece tier 5 and some good mp5/healing items you are all but set as far as healing goes until tier 3.
---
Sadly casters are a lot more knowledgeable today compared to 14 years ago and almost no one will use DKP.
---
The amount of bis cloth Spellcaster gear I snagged because people were cheap/waiting on tier items back in the day is mind-blowing, but highly doubt it would happen today.
---
Yeah but a human doesn't make it easier to get? They don't have increased drop chance.
---
You are probably right, but never stop dreaming. I know its really unlikly to happen, so im gonna Roll Rp or PvP, but im still being naive, thinking about a special snowflake server for us germans.
---
They only list 4 people
---
Really bad.  You lack dot damage without siphon or shadow mastery.  You lack survivability without SL or at least a void sac shield, and you lack burst without ruin.
---
Hard to announce a server when we don’t have a list of them.
---
You are not a good fit for MT per this post.
---
Does this mean better dps for hunters?
---
Pepelaugh he doesn't know.
---
I think what he means is that this build seems like it's trying to be built around NF since it stopped there in the Aff, so why not just go all in on the actually good NF build.
---
Yeah that's how it works. They didn't cap spell pushback until like the end of TBC or start of WotLK, years after vanilla.
---
Late to this thread, but I also have never played wow but I really want to play classic but am kinda intimidated by all the veterans if that makes sense cause I've read that it takes teamwork for classic!
---
im a druid
---
Get fucked idiot
---
Female trolls (ugliest thing on Azeroth), night elves (I hate how their ears bounce when they run) and hunters(greedy gear stealing a-holes).  :)
---
What was so bad about cata? Spells were still interesting.  PvP was not face roll.  Raids and new zones were cool.  Did your guild break up bro?
---
I raided Resto and pvp'd with something similar to 30/0/21. Sometimes I'd dip into Enh for Imp. Ghost Wolf. 
---
Anyways, I was a god tier duelist and I highly recommend. Could take anyone on 1v1. In world pvp could usually take on two if I'm not being stunlocked. 
---
Nature's Swiftness is essential. You're most often going to use it for an instant big heal but sometimes using it for an instant Chain Lightning will get the job done.
---
It's a valid paladin weapon that would see more use on a mage/warlock.
---
0.5 was designed for people who couldn't or didn't want to raid and non-raiding alts.
---
Running hunter, still planning on instance farming and a bit of devilsaur early on.
---
Herbs along the way, and eventually transmute alt(s) supplementing a bit.
---
*Prot* Pally weapon
---
About damn time.
---
I planned on having a warrior and a mage alt. I had considered leveling the mage first though (on a second account) so that he could help the warrior level (funnel gear/gold/come 1 shot the WW axe boss etc) but I'll probably just go warrior first at this point
---
Why are you in many different Hunter threads spreading this bullshit?
---
technically Naga I guess
---
Rank 10 as not a premade takes hours of farming honor every day.
---
Resto shamans provide worse totems, and if you are going deep enh for the better totems, then your healing is crippled. Also, resto shamans have to focus on healing, and are less likely to have 100% uptime on totem twisting. Furthermore, a resto shaman in a melee group does not benefit from battle shout, trueshot aura, or his own improved totems. That job is best for enhancement shaman.
---
Shamans can't escape from anything anyway.
---
How about some Tauren-Gnome beastiality?
---
Thanks I appreciate it! Good advice, I'll take it.  I played on Trollbane. The guild made a server transfer at some point and I don't recall if we were on Trollbane before or if we ended up there after. You're right about hard times. I guess we can come out of anything as long as we manage to process it. I really don't know what would have happened if I didn't get help. Take care mate!
---
You wouldn't want to level as holy. You can heal as Ret with some cloth gear.
---
Play all 3. That is the joy of this game.
---
Strange how some of us feel worse if we do shit like this, while there are inversely tons of douche bags that get gratification out of being a douche bag.
---
From what we've seen, Troll haste costs 10 energy and starts at 10% haste at full life, scaling linearly to 43% increased haste at 40% life or below for maximum effect.
---
Berserking's strength matters only when activated, doesn't update its buff effect in real time depending on your current health %.
---
So, we can figure every 1% of heath loss you gain ~.5% increased haste + 10%. So at 70% health, you have ~25% haste effect. at 50%, you have ~35%, and finally 43% (from the not a bug thread values Blizzard confirmed) at 40% health or lower.
---
Nightfall is better than that. 
---
10 casters each doing 1000 dps.
---
0.05 * 1000*10 = 500 dps
---
I wish I was you !!!!
---
Don't forget Mage.
---
“Vanilla” was not super mechanically challenging,  but there was a lot less to work with when vanilla cane out. Your talking from a private server mentality. Of course the first 2 raids are going to be ALOT easier with 1.12 talent and gear optimizations, but that’s not how vanilla was laid out. I’m sure all these people who keep saying classic won’t be challenging will have a rough wake up call come up end aq/naxx.
---
This guy gets it! Also, a resto shaman in a melee group does not benefit from battle shout, trueshot aura, or his own improved totems.
---
Nope it's 2 vs 3 mins
---
Sounds like League of Legends.
---
&gt;( tanks and healers always trump dps)
---
So basically you're weakening the overall performance of the raid group by giving healers gear which they have no need for to clear current content.
---
3 hours.   From 225 to 270 took me 1hr, 270 to 300 took 1hr 30min.
---
running around looking for pools will slow you down a lot. only worth it if you are targeting specific fish for raiding.
---
But why would they do less tps?I agree that a part of their threat is based in flat threat addition but they also do dmg. It´s also more like 8% additional parry. So that´s a total of 9% less hit. It may be 5% lower tps compared to pservers but tank will do way mor tps compared to vanilla. Because they know what they do now
---
Male Troll rogues have the best tea bagging tech.
---
10 casters all doing 1k DPS is the kind of thing that only happens in spreadsheets.
---
Average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day on average. 2-3 hours is very casual.
---
It will be very interesting to have fire resistance totems for everyone. Our raid dps will benefit greatly from not having to wear as much fire resistance gear. Thanks for your kind words :)
---
Yep re-rolled Warrior, can't go wrong with Rogue or Warrior pretty op and will be worse even with leeway lmao melle is going to rule Classic even worse than private servers.
---
Holy shit, thanks for sharing. I really appreciate it. You take care as well mate.
---
absolutely
---
Tauren enable sweet warstomp + x (grenade, chain lightning, lesser healing wave, nova totem, skilled ghost wolf) combos. It also is another interrupt besides earth shock and grounding totem. Also stuns multiple targets and is almost instant.
---
5% will be the difference between win or death/wipe in a couple of situations throughout your shamans life. 
---
Nature restistance is a bit less of a farm once aq comes out.
---
As an enhancer, your hidden hitbox racial will be really good for windfury rampage. 
---
You can technically be an orc if you use Free Action Potion. And technically get rid of your hitbox using deviate or noggenfogger when you want to be a caster. 
---
Also, bigger shoulders.
---
Nice, so easy enough to get fishing up to a usable level. Then after that time invested is simply time spent seeking specific fish, not just trying to grind fishing level.
---
Yeah, pretty much. Unless you don't plan on doing any sort of pvp, orc is superior.  For ONLY pve, they're about even.
---
Right! “Check our my full dreadnaught set!....on my cabbage patch kid avatar...”
---
Why does anyone post anything? Humm maybe to share thoughts and opinions?? Woah revolutionary thinking..
---
Ony head and DM buffs are easy enough to get that they often are used in progression. But stacking all of the world buffs to the nines is not.
---
Needs “Party Hard” by Andrew W K
---
So you were 6 years old?
---
This is BIS for all casters in phase 1, not just pallys.
---
Most of them are pvpers so they just rolled dwarf/gnome for pvp racials
---
Is it possible to run a repair shop if you have no knowledge of cars?
---
Sure, if PvP means dueling outside of Org in SL build with a bag full of shards.
---
"Have you lost your mind Arthas? How could you even consider that?"
---
Just enough to progress, I don't really see how it's possible for me to do the whole nolife schedule raiding but I'd love to go semi-hardcore.
---
Shadow Oil does scale with Spell Damage - it did all through Vanilla (unlike some other things that eventually had their scaling removed) and it's been confirmed to scale with Spell Damage in the Beta.
---
Unless your guild is aiming for having MC on farm within 1 month, having a few decent ret pallies won't hurt it. They're a middle of the pack dps if they put in the effort and I guarantee someone who cares enough to make a ret pally work will not be one of those who half ass the raids and ignore mechanics.
---
A more realistic statement would be "If you care about raiding, expect to put in more effort than anyone else to maintain your spot".
---
LPT from somebody with probably less life experience, but I guess it's irrelevant: even though your relationship with your family is not doing so well, making an effort to try and bring it back up is very rewarding. It was very rewarding to me.
---
Best of luck in life and in WoW, see you in a month (:
---
Even if a mafia isn't able to form, there will be constant competition for devilsaur spawns. 
---
As a rogue, you'll be better off pickpocket farming BRD or RFD, assuming they don't nerf it in Classic like they did on Nostalrius.

"Main Hand"

Phase 3, Lok'amir il Romathis will fly past this pretty easily with over double the +healing
---
50 here.  Can't wait to play it again.  For the HORDE
---
I found tool was a fantastic band for grinding back in vanilla. But now I get memories of grinding when ever I hear any song from sober.
---
"Episode 3" was his FIRST episode. "Episode 1" is the third one. This is usually what causes confusion. Episode 1 was recorded in 1.10-1.11.
---
I wouldn't say zero, but I'd agree it won't happen. But there's also a very low chance Blizzard is going to launch Molten Core where the second to last encounter gives zero loot.
---
They lack the attention span to get to 60...or even 10.
---
Now get off my MMO ya little whipper snappers!! 
---
Go!!  
---
GIT!!
---
:Huff
---
:WaveCane
---
I'd just go elem I think.  I think enhance is frankly overrated as a leveling spec.
---
Auto loot was definitely in vanilla.
---
Vurtne still the GOAT of all time
---
Episode 3 came before episode 1. They are in reverse order.
---
Honestly classic wow is so optimized it's bred a new tier of hardcore: poopsocker. 
---
I'll likely hit 60 at the middle of week 2 and I'll be playing pretty hardcore. Literally all of my free time apart from food, gym, 8 hours of sleep, maybe a part time job. 
---
Poopsockers, the cutting edge, will need 5-6 days. No job, very little sleep, shit nutrition, no exercise. They will poop in socks to save time.
---
Dunno.  Used them.mostly for arena in tbc
---
Yeah i was really young and didnt get anywhere close to max level until late bc
---
That is his third video. "episode 1" was released 3/3. Episode 3 was the first video he released.
---
They only get priority for that item. The rest are usually main spec prio.
---
Yeah having even 1 extra stack of a couple silver of vendor stuff pays for itself really quick
---
Should just roll horde.  More pve potential and better pvp racials
---
I tried playing on private server. Made like 20chars, max level around 25 and half of them hunters.
---
After double checking i realised its actually not that difficult for me either. I must have been thinking of some other key...
---
A quest mousetrap is a quest that has you go do something in relation to content that hasn't been released yet.
---
Like quests for the AQ Gates or Scourge Invasion or Zul'Gurub. The two first pieces of Thunderfury dropping in MC is one of those "quest mousetraps" because it requires Elementium to finish and you can't get that until BWL.
---
The fuck you going to channel in melee vs a rogue? So either way it further proves my orc point then. Every class has a stun.
---
It’s children of children of bodom now
---
Huh, I think it might be this way in retail but I can't recall when it was added into the game. Either way, his comment about getting a quick bank alt is still a great tip.
---
I like playing solo but having guild chat.
---
I don't think you're correct, the weapon slot stat wasn't variable. Late TBC made a lot of main-hand only weapons like Mageblade one handed but that's about it.
---
You could always equip a [Mindfang](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20214/mindfang) in the offhand.
---
Warriors take the longest to train and gear, and as MT you alone will be the determining factor on how much dps others are allowed to put out. You will need to have pre-raid BiS when you start. While you don't have to put in 16 hours a day to MT, you will be expected to make every single raid and to put in the effort for consumables/world buffs.
---
I would suggest OT or sticking to dps/heals if you aren't 100% confident and committed to your intended guild.
---
Completely agree for guilds that are farming nef and have healer rng.
---
No sir
---
No pet battles in classic, sorry
---
Oh pi + berserking was fucking mad. Not to mention improved manaburn.
---
Hahaha "straight gutter rat shit assers" has me fucking dying man.
---
This i doubt even Blizzard knows exactly what they will do with servers they will launch with what they think they need and if they see a massive rise in subs they will quickly bring more servers up. Its simple if classic makes them money they will cater to us.
---
Ohh.. shit
---
Hey man, First time Classic here too, gonna play holy too, I would actually advice you too lookup as many videos on yt (Kargoz guide is really good, but I pretty much saw every video holy out there, I think atleast.) And going too the Nost forums, they are really helpful too. I wish you best luck man, hope to see you sticking with palas, i tested one on a pserver, its so much fun. Do you know which professions you are gonna go, thats the point where Im at right know, prob mining engi/bs. Have fun!
---
Been playing on private servers for the last month and a half. I’ve got 8 toons at least level 22, none of them higher than 38
---
&gt; All my friends say that i should have the base game first
---
No you don't.
---
That was true until a few years ago but they changed it so you don't need to buy anything anymore and every time a new xpac comes out they give the previous one to every account for free, even if inactive.
---
You need to buy the current xpac (BFA right now) *only if you want to access its content* otherwise you don't even need to buy that (you can play up to Legion content with just a sub).
---
On top of that, when Classic comes out, the same sub will give you access to both Classic and retail (not that many people here are interested but it's good to know if someone wants to grind retail to pay their sub with ingame gold).
---
nice
---
&lt; Early 50s. 
---
My friends think I am mad. 
---
I think its cheaper than buying a sports car. :D
---
Aha! I knew from Countown to Classic that the mage blade shouldn't go to paladins, but I didn't know why. That makes a lot of sense.
---
Honestly, no they probably wont taunt it. They will just get 1 shot by the mob bc all their gear is like leather dps gear.
---
The idea is to get nature's guidance more than anything.   Spell hit isn't easy to get as a shaman.
---
Meh classic ain't necessarily slower, it has bigger bursts, less healing/defensives and everyone have more abilities to manage. One bad move or missed opportunity and the fight can be over. Max level classes are super easy to pickup in retail now, not so much in classic. If by slower they mean that people don't constantly run around beating each other up for 2-3mins with flashly animations then yeah.
---
Undead rogue, kos.
---
god damn early days of content were whacky. Yeah the other dude confirmed it was 1.6 but he still talked about normalization which didnt happen till 1.8. So, yeah. I cant remember if evisc was changed 1.8 or 1.10 but basically all of his fun naked stuff wouldnt be doable in 1.12 (Doable is a stretch since its technically doable just harder to do)
---
I'm gonna spend so much time leveling up Fishing and Cooking, can't wait.
---
Can you even fucking read? What are you talking about? You're the only one to talk about Pyroclasm and Gnomes.
---
Every class has a stun was *my* point when I said "Orc helps against all classes". 
---
And then someone said [Orc Hardiness] doesn't help against Warlocks.
---
So I said Pyrcoclasm and grenades.
---
And then you said Pyroclasm is a Daze and mention Gnomes...
---
I think, because of all the changes, you should play the class that makes you the happiest.
---
$11.17/month if you buy the Battle.NET Gift Cards from Amazon when they're on sale and subscribe for six months.
---
yes its just their high damage without gear . im not even saying to care about results of BGs or how they do . just core mechanics key binding etc to get a feel if you like the play style .
---
Ditto, still debating zergling or diablo.
---
Also I have been seeing people talking about avoiding streamer servers. They seem horrible but how am I supposed to know what server streamers have chosen? Am I supposed to go into every streamers twitch and find it? Or does blizzard actually label servers specifically for streamers community's?
---
Thanos for good laugh. :D
---
Because all spell damage is written as damage and healing in 1.12
---
Mel Gibson is mad, because of...
---
How useless?
---
Leveling ranged weapons as a BM hunter is relatively effortless because your pet does so much damage. Just slap on a vendor pouch, fill it with level 1 ammo (you should be doing this as a general rule since it will save you a lot of money in the long run while you're leveling), and spend 10 minutes getting it nearly to cap.
---
Since decent ranged weapons are few and far between at low levels, it's definitely worth switching to gun if, say, the blue gun drops in Uldaman. You shouldn't go out of your way to keep all of your weapon skills maxed at every level, but you certainly shouldn't avoid using an upgrade because you don't want to level a weapon skill.
---
Well, somehow I also end up playing hunter. So the mechanics are fine. Mostly rerolling for new character story ideas (not hardcore RP, but like the character to make sense). Like a Dwarf Hunter with a bear. But then jow cool it would be to be an Orc wirh a wolf. Or shadowmeld with a cat. But hey, why not troll?
---
I strongly feel like all the 1.4 loot will be in phase 1 and I base this purely of the Beta where a lvl 40 player in Winterspring manage to get an [The Eye of Shadow](https://itemization.info/item/18665) to drop. This item was in the beta and was introduced during 1.4 in vanilla. 
---
Other items that were introduced in much later patches like Scourge bosses from 1.10 were definitely not in the Beta, so I suppose Blizz drew the line somewhere between 1.4 and 1.10 for the beta. 
---
The Eye being in the beta does support the WoWhead 1.4 in phase 1 argument, but who knows if this is one of the exceptions that Ion mentioned in his tweet. I think it's more likely Ion is off by a phase, because it makes more sense to me that 1.4 is in Phase 1 and 1.5( things like Mana Igniting Cord) are in phase 2 because they were available before BWL in vanilla. If 1.5 items get pushed back to phase 3, it may make the content slightly more difficult than vanilla(gear availability wise, not player skill/knowledge).
---
It's interesting to see how it will all pan out. Even Take Azuregos for example, his loot was expanded in 1.5 to include the Cold Snap wand, but will that put that item on his loot table in phase 2 or push it back to phase 3? Because there was a point in Vanilla where Cold Snap was the only Epic wand available until 2 more were introduced in BWL. And if it get's pushed back, things may pan out differently.
---
Can't burn their mana if they're oom :roll_safe:

---
I would rather have sex with women
---
The fuck is wrong with you
---
Its bis for mages in phase 1-2 pair it with av exalted offhand and you Get a pretty huge dps increase, healers would replace this item quickly and you dont need the to stack +healing for mc and bwl
---
Play Male troll for there best racial the ability to look bad in anything. When you are a Male troll only the stats on items mathers.

'88 represent!

If you plan on joining a guild then wait with leveling fishing, it's the perfect activity while you try to get to know people.
---
Human warriors are KOS to me
---
Yes multiple accounts are allowed and multiboxing is also not against TOS.  Though it isn't strictly encouraged / supported by Blizz either.  So if you encounter some weird multibox bug or need to troubleshoot performance on your machine during multiboxing they won't help.
---
But I haven't heard of anyone having such issues as long as your PC isn't horrible.
---
The biggest issue is the RP-PvP crowd is very mute - There are only a few communities that are trying to actively make noise - most seem very muted and as per normal the majority don't want to put effort in.
---
According to them there were only 63 playing horde on Draenor EU. 
---
I suspect one or two people might have failed to register. :P
---
The goblin is the easiest of the 3. Gator is the hardest.
---
That wasn't innovative... That was just the design of the class.
---
Aye I get ya, just cautioning people to not base their class selection on bis gear because majority of people will not even be close to achieving that
---
I would revamp some of the raids (like MC) to have additional boss mechanics that still kept in line with the theme of each fight.  I'd add more, "hidden" (optional) encounters to raids and dungeons which were triggered by totally new content.  
---
I.e. if we are going to open up and flesh out Gilneas as a zone, a quest line can be added to Sliverpine that gives level 60 players a reason to go into the dunegon again.  We can upgrade certain enemies and add new bosses to show how our original actions change the dungeon, and new people are moving in to take their place.  Obviously, you leave it the same for people still leveling up, but I like reasons for high level characters to go back into instances.
---
The focus for me would be breathing life into the world for all players.  The problem is, it's super hard to remove things once you added them, because people complain.  So, Blizzard can just keep fleshing out existing things that haven't gotten a lot of attention.  Areas like Azshara can have leveling hubs added with level 62-63 enemies that stomp on fresh 60s, but can be done by people in T2 or T3.  Then, have that culminate in a raid or dungeon in that zone.
---
Balancing the game is hard, because the aim of the game is progression.
---
Lots of Breaking Benjamin on mine
---
Oh , thanks for that I didn’t know that
---
Fucking exactly this lol, that guy just went on some weird, pedantic rant for no reason at all.
---
I was just making a joke about his statement. LC is totally fine as a system so long as you trust the officers. My joke just focused on those situations where people play favorites, which definitely happened *all the fucking time* back in my TBC days (didn’t raid in vanilla).
---
Thanks! Although most builds I've found don't include Improved Lightning Shield I have already been experimenting with it because I use it so much.  Glad to hear you're recommending it.
---
Have heard your comment about improved weapons totems before so I'm steering away from that talent ;).
---
Hunters really aren’t as bad as people say, dude. If you play it properly (minimal auto clip) your dps will be just fine. Especially after Ashjre’Thul.
---
Welp fluff me then
---
Socials/Alts definitely. No to random peeps, except for trials. At least at the start. You will want to gear up your own people first.
---
Right. I'm quite aware that Troll is considered best for Shadow, and for PVP. But whenever I try to find a general consensus strictly talking Horde Holy PvE, it's always a mixed bag. Nearly all posts about this so far that I've seen either say Dwarf (irrelevant), or mention Shadow spec/PVP (also irrelevant). 
---
Can't seem to find a real consensus on what Horde race is best for raiding Holy.
---
I'm a mix of no. 9 and 10 - Which is why im rolling a tauren warrior tank. So i can do the pulls and blame the healers while i fish. Boom.
---
In vanilla all spell dmg includes healing.
---
Greatwizard is not Vurtne although at this point he is more impressive. Hes basicially mastered mage.
---
Have you talked to your doctor?
---
Pro-tip. Imp stoneskin is just as much damage (in/out) as two levels of imp lightning shield.  
---
Stoneskin + healing stream is super underrated for leveling.  
---
Wonderfully enough, there are almost no "trap" talent points for shaman except stormstrike for raiding and that's about it.   
---
Personally I am going a 28/28/0 build for leveling then resto at 60.
---
&gt; My opinion is that the purpose of loot council is fulfilled and the result is properly met much more often than result is corrupted by favoritism.
---
Okay, but that’s still just an opinion without hard data. Your pedantic rants are getting silly now.
---
He is kinda right though, many people do not know that they would actually enjoy figuring stuff out by themselves more. The path of least resistance is, unfortunately, very appealing and nowadays the information is very easily obtained. Thus, people read up on everything and spoil their own fun, without knowing it.
---
I would really like to go back and play this game for the first time, not knowing anything. It was such a great experience back then and new players really should try to spoil their fun as little as possible. 
---
&gt; These people understand a lot more about how they have fun then you do.
---
If that were true than BFA might not be the shitshow that it is today. Many features were added because players wanted them. They thought that they would be fun, but ultimately they killed many of the things that made WoW fun.
---
Don't get me wrong, I get the sentiment of wanting to know everything. Especially when you've been playing this game regularly since back in the day, then yeah there is nothing to explore for you. But everyone else, who is new or hasn't played since vanilla retail, would probably have more fun knowing as little as possible.
---
Totem twisting adds 88.55 agility, not 77. Improved windfury totem adds 409.5 AP. Not to mention the enh shaman himself benefiting from all the melee group buffs and resistance totems which make it so the group doesn't need as much resistance gear.
---
I never said the enh shaman himself will top the meters, read my original post again "You are unlikely to top dps yourself, but the extra dps you provide to your group through totems will make you indispensable."
---
It's not about the enhancement shaman topping meters, it's about the raid benefiting as a whole.
---
Just speaking from my own experience, the raids (outside of heroic Rag) were subpar and uninspired, particularly Dragon Soul. The zones were a mixed bag - some of the new ones were cool (Deepholm, Uldir) and while I liked some of the changes to older zones, overall I was disappointed in the ways they changed some of my favorite zones and offered no way to the older version (would have liked them to somehow link them via the Caverns of Time but I get why they didn't). The story and lore were all over the place, Deathwing was wasted as a villain. An entire raid was cut. PvP wasn't faceroll yet but Tol Barad was shit compared to Wintergrasp. Class design wasn't terrible but it wasn't as good as Mists. In hindsight it just feels bad in comparison to the xpacs that came before and after. 
---
And considering my guild got realm first for both heroic Ragnaros and Deathwing I'm gonna go out on a limb and so no, my guild wasn't an issue.
---
I suppose that makes sense. I keep hearing how lackluster Beserking is in a raid environment though, in that it costs lots of mana and realistically speaking you'll get at most the 10% buff since you'll rarely be that low.
---
Middle of the pack compared to what? Other meme specs that similarly aren't sought after?
---
I agree with all your points, though the OP is not the video creator. However, I've written [macro explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3b97c/with_10_buttons_or_less_your_macros_can_access/) before and I appreciate the need to space out macros so that they're legible while you're explaining them. If you're explaining a macro, you generally need to write it twice: once to explain it, then again to condense it. I'll give him slack for writing them all the way out. That being said, he doesn't strike me as being experienced with writing or using macros since he didn't test these.

Will go to work, IRL.  Then I will buy gold.

This seemed obvious. Weird
---
Good work!!
---
Thanks for the detailed response. You've help me solidify my class choice!
---
Pvp
---
Sold!  Thanks for the thorough reply and the tip on deviate/noggens.  I assumed you'd still have your normal hitbox and just be a different model.  I love carrying those anyways just for the novelty.  Might just have to roll my warrior Tauren now for the same reasons...  They're one of my favorite races looks wise.
---
Interesting, whenever I was progression raiding with a loot council healers (I was a healer) always had lowest priority for loot as it was almost never more healing that was make or break for an encounter but the extra bit of DPS could be. Tanks always got what they wanted cause gotta keep them happy.
---
A big part of what made wrath feel better for me was that I had just quit the pile of shit known as Warhammer Online. Besides that, it was just naxx and arenas for me until I had to move and quit due to having shitty internet for a few months.
---
you have some high warlord and nax geard people but mostly same gear level or they have two epic items farmed etc . i tried every class and it blow my mind on what actually i want to play try it. 
---
its super easy to setup nothing to loose
---
Damn straight, also going through Rock Tunnel without Flash.
---
That is most certainly the plan :)
---
&gt; But everyone else, who is new or hasn't played since vanilla retail, would probably have more fun knowing as little as possible. 
---
Pure spectulation, right now I have had tons of hours of fun designing builds, armour sets, and general theorycrafting for classic wow. There are 100s if not 1000s of posts on here with people doing the same things. People fucking know how they have fun for gods sake.
---
But I don't know what I like.
---
This guy right here fucking gets it. It's a shame people are so naive
---
This is a good idea in general. Get ratchet fp and hearth. Or continue and get xroads camp t and thunder bluff at level one. Then hearth and start leveling having those flight paths will be handy later
---
Sheeesh i did not know us gnomes were so hated its undead rogues that are the proplem they are chicken and hide till i sit down to drink.
---
With totem twisting you only have one tick (maybe two if you're lucky) of 5SR since the WF buff is 8 seconds. 
---
Cast wf totem -&gt; GCD -&gt; cast GOA.  There's 8 sec left until buff drops off, and when your GCD expires there is 6.5 sec left.  So if you cast any spell (r1 shock), you have exactly 5sec until WF drops off.  So if you wanted you could purposely do a rank1 shock after GOA, wait for the mana tick, then immediately cast WF totem and repeat.  
---
On a boss fight (only place where totem twisting should matter) with mana pots or runes you can basically do this infinitely with the 25% reduced totem cost, any respectable amount of mp/5 which you should have from mana spring + what little bit is on your gear, and raid buffs like arcane int meaning you have roughly 4k, 5k mana at least.  
---
You don't have to rely on 5SR to be an effective totem twister as long as you have mana pots/runes and you don't break your back trying to totem twist and use these consumes on every trash pack.
---
Stacking world buffs is really stupid. Remove it Blizzard.
---
Thanks! :D
---
Need a pvp variant of just this song https://youtu.be/T5y-0ckrCoU
---
I absolutely build around winning world pvp encounters; these builds have the happy side effect if being fairly decent solo grind builds.
---
Haha true :D and thanks!
---
Dont get all worked up, there may be a work around.
---
Nope. It’s objectively bad
---
Yea I think world buffs are boring as shit and more obnoxious than anything, but definitely not an exploit at all. I'm not sure if they were ever intended, but they definitely were accepted and no attempts to change it was made on Blizzards part.
---
&gt; If you don’t all roll need, doesn’t that open the door to ninja looting; if everyone’s a ninja looter than no one is?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I really like the way you phrased that too! It has taken me a few tries to get through the whole thing (g d work, always interrupting my reddit time). Once I have, I'll give a better response.
---
Yeah I guess his video is aimed at people completely new to macros. That just presents an obvious problem when some of his macros don't work. How are those completely new people gonna troubleshoot it.
---
As in paladins can match hunters and feral druids for dps in addition to the buffs they can bring. Not every guild is going 6 holy pallies, 1 priest, 1 resto druid.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cfaypl/how_goodbad_will_ret_paladins_be_in_pvp_are_they/). 
---
They won't be matching hunters, and nobody is bringing feral druids for DPS, either.
---
Class design is terrible fucking pruned garbage.  
---
They gave flashy, gaudy, trashy, hamfisted Fisher-Price particle effects to fucking Subtlety Rogues, and pruned all time classic Rogue abilities like Gouge, Poisons, and Bleeds.  
---
Fuck the class design. It's absolute butchery. It's a disgrace.

Troll is better.

I plan on leveling a rogue with herbalism and mining. (Yes I know I can only track one at a time). Will focus on pre raid bis first and do 5 mans instead of gold farm. But when not in a group, I'll stick to dungeon farming rather than open world. I figure there will be too much competition for devilsaurs and herb routes. Will focus on stealthing through BRD and pick pocketing enemies while looking for dark iron ore. May form tight groups with some friends and farm righteous orbs and other dungeon drops. Will open world farm too, but main focus on dungeon farming.
---
Yeah it scales on a pserver and I have it, procs for about 450 lifesteal with all the +sp I have mostly just from t2 and t2.5.  It's great =P
---
Relatively low proc% on pserver though even with a full reck bomb I think I've only seen it proc more than once like... less than 5 times.  But it's nuts.  Full reck bomb + a self heal and damage proc for 900 is NUTS
---
Ahhh, nice!
---
Legion was fucking shit and ruined so many classes.  
---
This is a stupid and overly reductive analysis.

And no, there isn't an A team and B team.

Thank you for your detailed reply! I had a follow up question regarding engineering: I do hope to get back to a MT/OT role, but I have never tried engineering before and was wondering if you could please enlighten me as to its benefits for a protection raiding tank?
---
The last one is fantastic. I am absolutely the old fart. It's so funny I was thinking earlier... I might actually do fishing and cooking this time around since I've never done either. Old fart confirmed.
---
Damn right I'm mad. I've mained a Subtlety Rogue since 2005. I don't even recognize my fucking character.  
---
Fuck Legion, fuck BFA. Fucking trash expansions.
---
When will people understand that the act of having an idea doesn't mean the idea is a good one?
---
Triple box that shit. 
---
Or pay a chinese gold farmer to powerlevel it for you offhours.
---
"hardcore no changes" is a *fan* movement.
---
They’ve already said the population caps will most likely be well above that.
---
Deaths were usually failed mechanics not lack of healing in my experience. I only started progression raiding in the last few retail expansions though so things might have been different before.
---
Well don’t pick a Dwarf, IM the Dwarf
---
Im having a doubt now if anyone can help me. I will play not as much as i wanted, and i will RPG all my way through my levels. I want to know if its possible, and if yes, how so, to build a more defensive talent tree. Is it worth it? Or should i go for damage? Is tanking dungeons a thing? Should i have a build to help off-tank if needed? If i choose a more defensive build (ill be a tauren and alchemist) should i focus on doing damage or healing stats?
---
Any help is appreciated, thanks guys.
---
That does seem about right, I think he was around 2.4 - 2.5k  
---
He did have the full S1 set and the shoulders required 2.2k, so he was atleast above that.
---
"on farm in one month"
---
once you have enough guys to raid MC you should have it on farm.  if your guild can't clear mc with a full group you should find a better guild.  the one you are currently in is doomed
---
druid :D
---
how big is the grind in retail to be able to buy it with ingame gold? Can i like nolife the retail the first 20 days so i can be able to just play retail when i need to buy sub otherwise play classic? I'm from a 3rd world and paying for wow while being in school (not college) is kinda expensive ngl
---
The hammer has like 10x the drop rate this does though.
---
it was Damage Networks.. There was also Templar Knights, Mourning (I was in Mourning), and a few other decent guilds. I think those were the three top ones, though.
---
Who would that someone be?
---
I was the cheese bandit.
---
I said "good job"
---
nope, they might match the tank and the shadow priest
---
I think it's more the stacking of world buffs that is the issue here if a raid from time to time did get a dragon head buff that was intended but if every raid gets all available buffs all the time that might not have been intended and blizzard did change it in tbc
---
Did reddit flairs exists in 2006?  #nochanges
---
ill happily be your friend in wow, you sound like a great guy. lets kill some mobs!
---
What if they had no flesh? Would they be a No Changes Skeleton?
---
This is what people seem to not understand.  Blizz made Classic part of the main WoW sub for a reason.  I wouldn't doubt, if Classic is popular enough, that they release sub numbers again.  Even if just to brag that they have x million subs rolling in again.  
---
As much as they claimed we wouldn't want this, if we have the numbers Blizz will do what they can to keep us.  Especially considering it'll take less creative hours since they're just following what they've already done and adapted it to the current client.
---
Lok'amir is better but its a good point for 1% crit over 30 healing on a paladin. The +18 Int on Lok'amir I think may make the difference between the two.
---
Also, I had Jin'do's Hexxer in Vanilla :)
---
The answer is to just roll multiple characters
---
female orc warlock for me
---
/flex
---
yeh and theres a dead sea creature with pandarian looking seat/hut on top of it in darkshore which im sure was there since vanilla
---
&gt;The two first pieces of Thunderfury dropping in MC is one of those "quest mousetraps" because it requires Elementium to finish and you can't get that until BWL.
---
The Bindings of the Windseeker were added to MC loot table in the BWL patch
---
Thanks.
---
In regards to #2, yes, and I wouldn't have thought you were a douche. Which you were. 
---
In case you hadn't noticed, 1) first, foremost, and complete in itself, I don't owe anyone here my time. 2) Everyone else gets it. Look at the comments. Look at the karma. The confusion rests in a minority who seem to believe their confusion [is everyone else's fault](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/645/713/888.jpg). There are a lot of people around here with that "confusion." It's antisocial.  It's tiresome. And you can read on to see the trainwreck where dude was almost starting to get it, but somehow fell off the wagon this morning. This isn't the marines. If someone doesn't get it, and doesn't want to get it -- or hell, if I just don't feel like it -- it's ok to to leave them behind. 
---
So drop the douchebag taunts. Honestly, have you considered what you're doing when you try to taunt someone like you did? 1. you're trying to manipulate someone's massive insecurities. That's like using a pickup line that only works on syphilitic meth heads: do you even *want* it to work?
---
Nearly every class has Stun potential(skill or talent), or get equipment that Stuns. Not every class has Fear or Immobilize. Stun Resist is very strong, but still can't help against everything. If Priests could be Orcs.... they'd be absolutely unstoppable with 45% resist lmao. I'm so glad they can't be.
---
Skarm shoots himself in the foot by rebutting the points made in the video and then at the end saying he prefers if world buffs are disabled for the first month of new content..Waffling on the most important point of the video.
---
“Just play what you want” said for the 10,000th time this week, same as every week. The problem is we don’t know what we want.
---
*Cries in left handed*
---
FFXI handles it pretty well.  They have a system of summonable NPCs that function as your party so you can go play through old content while level appropriate.  
---
WoW did something similar when they took out world elites.  The problem was they never toned down dungeons or raids so new players could see them when they were still relevant, so Vanilla builds up to MC and BWL and then....   off to Outland!  Outland builds up to HFC and SSC and TK and BT, but then...  off to Northrend!  
---
And they’ve pretty much been doing that ever since.
---
19 here and can’t wait! Started back at the start of WOTLK and have always wanted to play Classic/BC. I’ve played Runescape since I was 6, and OSRS since it came out again. I love the old version of the game, and the same goes for WoW.
---
Undead rogue
---
What does the current year have to do with it?  People have always idolized other people, and defended the ones they idolize.  I don't understand why you expect that to change because it's 2019?
---
Regardless, I don't think the negativity and condescension is necessary, at all.
---
Nice I want ir
---
If orc priests were a thing, I wouldn't even consider other options lol
---
takes away huge class flavor having to spec into poisons though
---
It’ll be interesting to see how much stacking will occur in Vanilla. Private servers have the luxury of dropping the buffs whenever they like whereas we’ll be looking at a first come first served basis.
---
The sword is what corrupted Arthas and caused him to unleash the scourge en masse on Azeroth, and directly resulted in Naxx even showing up in the sky of the EPL... The Lich King, Frostmourne, Arthas wielding it and turning, all occurred just before the start of Vanilla from a time line perspective.
---
Just watch the Undead intro video from Vanilla and notice how it discusses the previous actions of the Lich King and them breaking free of his dominion of them.  This alone shows that The Lic King and Frostmourne were in existence and a part of pre Vanilla WoW lore. 
---
https://youtu.be/DKutw1zDgms
---
Prot warrior or GTFO
---
Yea, it looks as it could actually deal some DPS lol
---
3k peak on a private server would be way more alive than just an NA server that peaks at the same. There would be people online at all different times. PS have sort of two peak times, and the overall population of active players would be way higher. 
---
Private servers do die quickly tho, I'm not sure why we would assume it would be different for blizzard servers. Blizzard seems to think there will be a massive exodus and are planning around it.
---
Am i the only one who read the title in Mario 64’s voice?
---
Still a matter of RNG - our guild in Vanilla had AWFUL weapon RNG.
---
why not all 3?
---
Fire, Arcane, Frost
---
id say world buffs are more geared towards casuals, all you do is travel to a few places at most... it makes your night way more enjoyable
---
Have you played any retail?
---
21 here
---
I guess ill have to wait and see like you said only a couple weeks left.   Just playing on 5k-8k online felt really good.  Maybe you are right well see.
---
Playing WoW for the first time? And its Classic? R.I.P. your free time.
---
That being said, have a blast!
---
this was a major discussion a couple weeks ago, i guess we all forgot?
---
Yeah,  Lok'amir is almost strictly better, but I wasn't about to waste DKP on that when Judgement Raiment was on the line :D
---
That was phasing, both of you at different parts of a quest.  Fun fact, I completed the under city part of the meta achievement to kill all the faction leaders and get the war bear while not being able to see anyone in my raid because I had not done the wrathgate quest line completely.  The raid appeared on my minimap but not on my screen.  So I just stayed with the group and got credit for the achievement lol.  Sorry I forget the name of the achievement, been out of wow since 2 months into legion.
---
I really hope the droprates on private servers are scuffed. I've seen easily a hundred Crul/Asscandy from Nef and maybe 7 shadowflame/lok'amir. Archimtiros drops every week while tear and elementium band are once every couple of months.
---
Also auto shot is like half a hunters dps
---
I played Horde on Frostwolf. :)
---
Seriously. Shadow Priest and Orc are already pretty gd strong on their own in comparisons to their respective category, but in combination? It'd be the ultimate Race/Class Wombo-Combo.
---
Age minus 14 or 15?
---
&gt; I’m sure all these people who keep saying classic won’t be challenging will have a rough wake up call come up end aq/naxx.
---
aq and naxx arent the end all be all though. by the time naxx comes out people who were just there to enjoy themselves would of been fulfilled.
---
Low-key boutta roll horde just so I don't have to deal with paladins getting this over me
---
Yeah, a few 120 just got ilvl 400
---
obviously i imply when we have a server list.... we will have one at the latest for the character creation date...
---
I suppose we will have to agree to disagree. Stacking just the "viable" classes will just make gearing them that much harder.
---
It's taken from wowhead or similar sources, so I highly doubt it.
---
That's a question you should have asked yourself before you replied.
---
Aq and max are so far down the phase line that by then you could have gotten bis raid gear as holy and bis offspec - shadowgear, had 1 alt in 80% bisbgear and another alt at pre raid bis with 3 bis items
---
Once ZG is out all paladins' claims on mageblade instantly evaporate as there actually is an upgrade for them in an easy raid that has a shorter reset time than both MC and BWL.
---
I played that build as well, has always been my jam.
---
this time around I’m going pally, my friends made the decision for me by going alliance.
---
Lol. I mean it’s not like these guys released videos of the kills right?

Gawd no, I hate them!  I want to see my character.

* **What form of raid loot distribution is the best?** Loot Council
---
* **What form of raid loot distribution fails more often than not?** Also Loot COuncil
---
* **What form of raid loot distribution will your guild use?** Still loot council.
---
* **What form of raid loot distribution is ideal for pick-up groups (PUGs)?** 1 off PUG of mostly strangers: this is pure /roll every time. By its 1 off nature, there is no real "progression" to consider, so it shifts to "how can we fairly divide loot in a way that doesn't give the small cliques in the raid that know eachother more power through cooperation"
---
* **What guild structure is ideal?** I'm a big fan of Guild Leader --&gt; officers --&gt; class leaders --&gt; Regular members --&gt; Probationary members. Guild leader is responsible for making meta decisions, and **accountable** for guild success, stay tf out of day-to-day business unless something gets escalated to him. Officers handle day-to-day admin of guild (inviting/kicking members, serving as the first point of contact for questions/disputes, etc.), Class leaders responsible for raid organization for their class and for class advocacy on guild policy (Mages have gotten all of the cloth armor drops, Warlock team lead needs to chirping in guild leaders ear about Warlocks gear stagnating). Class leaders should be responsible for communicating what everyone in their class is expected to do in raids/bosses, responsible for evaluating their class members performance (you need to know at least who is doing good enough and who isn't doing good enough), and be the first point of contact for class based questions (what gear is my BiS? whats my dps rotation? etc.)
---
* **How many officers are ideal for a guild?** 4-5.
---
* **How will modern tools, like Discord, influence guild organization/structure?** Not a lot, most of the modern tools are just streamlined or improved versions of stuff that was available for Vanilla. Discord for example is like a streamlined combination of Ventrillo and your guild websites forums.
---
* **Did you use voice chat when raiding in retail Vanilla, and will you use it in Classic?** Yes and Yes, voicechat is mandatory for serious raiding. Not everyone needs a mic but everyone needs to be able to hear instructions.
---
* **Dealers choice:** Loot council - A lot of people assume loot council just means a group of players just wing it on every drop in deciding who gets what loot. That's how you get shitty loot councils. You need to back up loot council with a system of how you determine giving out loot, and only stray from that system under special circumstances. For example, my guild in Vanilla had a loot council, but behind the scenes we used a Suicide Kings list that basically told everyone what the loot councils decision would be in case of a drop. The Loot council only makes a snap decision if there is a (very)special circumstance (like a mage and a healer both have a BiS item drop, sorry mage even though you are higher up on the SK list), but for within class drops 99% of the time you go with the SK list. This prevents a lot of the corruption, you couldn't just say "well yeah ShiftyRogue is at the top of the SK list, but BuddyRogue is a really swell guy and just, he deserves it more".
---
Hehe I actually managed to convince the mage CL to make tear lock prio, mish was made mage prio to balance it out, but holy shit the mages complained! I'm like you don't need +hit to conjure water and portals.. get a grip!
---
Yeah, between 3% hit, 5% lightning crit, and insta cast lightning bolt or healing wave as the situation demands, it's really hard not to do the 30/0/21 build.
---
Let us hope that the devastation known as TBC will not be forced upon us in such a short time frame; or ever. Classic+ is the way to go even if old content is recycled in one form or another.
---
Discord DOES have a phone app, so it's worth a shot.
---
I completely agree - however that is phase 4.
---
Also, I do not think reset is shorter - ZG still resets weekly (20 man).
---
What points are you putting in enhancement? guardian totems and imp ghost wolf?
---
If you wanna play a game that makes Vanilla raiding challenging then you can play on a private server.
---
Spirit bond is a joke of a talent, it really doesn't add up to anything 2% of your leveling hp every 10 seconds is like 5 hp5 by level 40. It might heal you while you're running around a quest hub but it won't save any real time in the long run. Hawk is debatable, but you should defiantly go 5 or 0. I like endurance because I usually let my pet do a lot of the work and 15% more hp means I can drink 15% longer before I need to get up and start healing it. You also passed up bestial discipline which is a must take for bm.
---
Something like this https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/0500320151501251-051510305 is a more standard leveling build
---
TSM wasn't a thing in Vanilla, it didn't come about until Cata/MoP when the web API allowed for hourly auction house dumps without being in-game.
---
Auctioneer was.
---
He wont make it id he cant make it trough phase 1 on pservers. You dont join a new guild and say hi i will be your mt and i dont know any encounters. The warrior who has the best attendence usualy becomes mt , because its a role that you become not a role that you choose before even you join a guild
---
MT healers are going to be priests and druids, not Paladins. Paladins are better suited for raid healing.
---
Bruh. Popping into a BG and Bed of Razors starts playing. I'm fucking ready.
---
The only public data you'll find is the Pserver auctions that were tracked: https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/
---
I always found the +str negligible to the +int, if youre going down holy tree.
---
"Oh, that is an upgrade, but it is not my BiS for this phase.  I pass."  Loot goes all the way down and no one wants it because everyone is saving for the trinket that everyone needs to be competitive in PVP.  Now you disenchant a piece of gear that could have improved your raid survivability or DPS.  Also, You are the main tank, you pick a piece of gear, you get no more gear until all the other warriors or druids get a piece of gear.  Your guild can't kill any new bosses, because three weekly resets later, and you are still two melee DPS or warriors positions from getting the next piece of raid loot.
---
Yeah ofc there will be guilds of all types, how far the softcore/meme ones get idk . As for groups with free rolls, tbh I think to have a group that would literally just roll for gear it would either be a pug or a casual guild.
---
Most guilds, even the ones not planning to do anything too crazy , will be using some sort of system. Usually dkp for casual guilds. 
---
&gt;we shouldn't necessarily distribute all loot in a manner which is optimal, right?
---
I think for a guild that's trying to compete for server first on new content, yes this should be happening.
---
You want to hear your tanks , obviously, and then your most core people.
---
You don't want azuresong mageblade to go to a caster or healing paladin who may or may not be there every week, that would piss me off as someone who plans to have 100% raid attendance. As for dps? I mean it always helps but no fights in vanilla are really that testing for dps but fights also are usually suitable for either ranged or melee. Mechanics rarely allow for both to maximize dps. Some bosses will force melees out of range for an aoe ability, some will force casters to move, and more common, fights force mages to decurse so dps isnt always the full story but basically you want strong items on consistent raiders. 
---
Like if DFT drops and both tanks have it, even as a mage, over my dead body will it go to a non core raider like it's too important to skip someone who is putting in the effort.
---
Just my opinion tho sorry for long response
---
Then it may be the auctioneer dump files that they were referring to. I personally didn’t use either but I’ve seen several people mention they still have their server data backed up.
---
Yes it will another thing I look forward to seeing is how spelsong works, there might have been a cooldown on how often you could click it and only effected on person
---
More people would require dynamic respawns, I guess.. You can say keep it without the dynamic respawn, I for one too like populated servers. But mobs never spawning and being camped, idk.. And if they implement the quicker respawns, there will be mage groups farming like crazy, fucking up the economy. At least thats what most people will say
---
This is absolutely ridiculous!
---
Everybody knows Darnassian Bleu is the superior cheese.  Pair it with a fresh Snapvine Watermelon, and you're dining in luxury!
---
And this is coming from a life-long Horde player.  GIMME DAT ELF CHEEZ!!!
---
RIP my shaman friend. I fought pretty hard to get my friends to go Horde just so I could play shaman. Thankfully most of them were warriors, so all it took was the whispers of *windfury*.
---
Gnomes might have a lower melee attack range, so that's something to consider.  
---
Personally I like them because the smaller model makes it easier to see what's happening.
---
I played a priest from day 1 on Bloodscalp.  Never raided, just pure battlegrounds, conqueror title on priest.  From a BG perspective, priest is bottom of the pile by a long shot. Let us say you're defending Gold Mine in AB  If ganked - the best you can do is call for help and hope you last long enough for help to arrive.  One psychic scream does not cut it.  My preference now, for classic is Druid.  Simply, you can stop almost any class from cappping with mobilty nobody else has and importantly, STAY ALIVE.  No use being a super-dupa priest healer if you are dead, i speak from experience.
---
For WSG, Pally, Druid for reasons obvious.
---
Going from 1-60 in Azeroth as a priest ? No 1 target for gankers,  you're a guaranteed kill if you aint got Eng.  Druid ? They don't even bother trying....  every druid should have a /wave macro for when you escape cc , giggling as get away from your ganker. 
---
Those of you who put Druid bottom, quite frankly do not know what you are talking about.
---
yes i have just done 1-60 on both resto druid and holy priest, with most BGing in the 39 &amp; 49 bracket ( Sgt on priest, Senior Sgt on druid)  On Northdale.
---
Launch day of what? A private server? Cause I _heavily_ doubt you remember launch day of a Vanilla servers.
---
Where’s Sea Shanty 2?
---
It does more damage for a BM hunter (better frenzy uptime), but you shouldn't be a BM hunter. The rest of what you said is right, though raptors are slightly worse then cats
---
What happens if a piece of loot drop no one reserved, but on bosses prior or earlier in this boss's loot distribution someone won their loot reservation?  Do people that won their loot reservation get same priorities on open roll loot?
---
There was a dev interview I believe at either the end of last year or beginning of this year with Omar where he talked about population sizes and how the original sizing was more of a hardware / server side constraint than what they actually wanted to see and that it was very likely we’d see numbers “well above populations we saw back in 2006”
---
Yes, I have US Mannoroth - Horde data from 10 October 2005 to April 15th 2007.
---
Voulez-vouz coucher, Clyde?
---
Blood fury might get you killed whereas berserking gets better the worse your raid is.
---
No Pathfinding though?
---
Soo how many raids did you MT with a rogue? Just wondering
---
&gt; officers are competent
---
&gt; Went to a holy paladin
---
Doesn't sound like a competent loot council haha.
---
No he was full feral
---
this guy gets it.
---
also, if you are in a real pinch, can can NS Ghost Wolf since you didn't take improved Ghost Wolf
---
to pull off the 30/0/21, you dont need a lot of amazing gear.  You just need a decent amount of spell crit.  Your lightning bolt and chain lightning get  11% spell crit from Tidal Mastery and Call of Thunder.  You get your PvP spell hit in the spec from Nature's Guidance.  Just pile on as much spell crit and spell power on your gear and you have a viable pvp spec.  lightning mastery gives a -1s off of lightning bolt which makes it a 2s cast time.  I believe that is the only spell with a 3 sec cast time and an 80% coefficient that has a talent to bring it down to 2s.  Most other talents only take of .5 seconds from a 3s cast time.  
---
I love elemental but the mana reserves are a hughes problem.  
---
level as enhance, pvp as ele, raid as resto.
---
&gt;I literally proved that you dont know what you talking about in the very first paragraph
---
I literally showed how you are wrong in the comment you conveniently have chosen to ignore.
---
&gt;Fear and Blind are both disorients like i just said, they are not a different category
---
They are separate in vanilla, they were merged in WoD, sounds like you are mixing up retail with vanilla.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Diminishing_returns
---
"Warlords of Draenor will see dramatic adjustments to existing diminishing returns categories."
---
"The Fear DR category has been merged with the Disorient DR category."
---
Its gonna be great playing classic knowing youll be miserable on your hunter, or maybe youll go back to your private server so you can play vanilla+?
---
[https://itemization.info/item/17103](https://itemization.info/item/17103)
---
Absolutely will be in phase 1 in its 1.12 state. The interesting part is the 40 damage/healing added in 1.4 I guess.
---
major boomer
---
I will outline some for you.  I used the hybrid DKP system in vanilla and it was damned near perfect.  This is what we do differently.
---
* What comes in must be taken away (40 pts earned in a raid, we ditch 10% from everyone for inflation sake)
---
* No passing on clear upgrades.  This is the main one.  You can't pass on Item Y and stay in shit gear because item Z drops on the next boss.  The item might not drop on the next boss for weeks months) (anti-hoarding)
---
* If you want to pass on an item to someone else, they must have a worse item than you. Said person(s) link their item in /o chat and we decide if its alright to pass or not (this is where the hybrid system comes into play)  (anti-hoarding)
---
* Also have common sense restrictions since most people cant see past their own face in regards to loot.  No Tunderfury going to a Huntard for example.
---
* 10% eligibility Rule : If I have 100 dkp and you have 90, you are within 10% of my dkp which means you can roll on the item too.  (anti-hoarding)
---
There are others, but these are the key ones.  It worked out extremely well.
---
Yeah I understand it don't worry, I just want my mageblade man! 
---
ZG hammer, won't BWL be out by then though? Or am I mistaken
---
&gt; ums, they are really helpful too. I wish you best luck man, hope to see you sticking with palas, i tested one on a pserver, its so much fun. Do you know which professions you are gonna go, thats the point where Im at right know, prob mining engi/bs. Have fun!
---
I started playing retail WoW way back in the beginning of BC. Back then my pally was mining/engineering so I might stick with that.
---
Classic WoW is WoW before any of the expansions were announced. The game is the base game.
---
Pickpocketing enemy hunters.
---
Sorcerous Dagger was my first ever epic, ran with it until miraculously I got the nef staff because both the lock and mage officers were gone and two of them dropped. Nost was a bit strange with loot as I'm fairly sure he shouldn't be able to drop two of them at once. 
---
This time around I'll try and get my hands on the mageblade, then maybe the GM spellblade if I can get the rank.
---
yes, so there is no limit to the number of items some one can get in the raid?  
---
I'll give you a specific example that I see as a major draw back.  Once UberHunter gets the xbow and wins his roll vs Legolasx.  The next boss, or the next item on the boss is some mail gloves.  This item is an upgrade for both hunters.  Uberhunter and Legolasx have a second roll off, because they are the only ones using them as MS.  So, Uberhunter gets the chance to win both items plus others. Legolasx can surely leave with nothing, because he correctly put the most powerful upgrade for the xbow on his soft reserve list.
---
Troll has the largest potential for threat per second.
---
lol
---
Gold farming is my whole goal of leveling quickly. I’ll have a 60 5-6 days after release and plan to use the very low 60 community to my advantage. AoE farming popular area, being able to corner markets on the AH
---
Will be a great time
---
I really don't even know how to respond to this. As Paladins don't have a single muti-target or heal over Time...how are they better? Please don't say Flash of Light. 
---
I love that you felt you had to qualify yourself with pserver experience...
---
7-8 hours-ish, not so bad imo. Perfect if you happen to have a cold or something to that effect!
---
20% higher focus regen is 20% more claw damage
---
Exactly. You need the gear to make 30/0/21 healing work, and it's not going to work with early phases of gear. And it's not hard to spot the ones who aren't deep resto. "Drop Mana Tide."
---
Or you could have a priest healing and putting up shadow weaving debuff
---
Raids are part of the game  just like everything else. What a ridiculous thing to say.
---
I need to come up with some crutch for my character like this just to drive my battle buddy nuts. Nah man, we gotta run strat, i need that cheese.
---
Yikes sorry didnt check context of prior ones my bad. But orc is bae hands down.
---
You're definitely on the extreme end but I can relate a little.  There's so many times I want to just appear offline and level/grind alone.  I love my friends and playing with them, but sometimes after a long day i'd prefer to just log on with no talking, no tryharding, etc.
---
Even the guilds that take 1 often don't let them dps because there isn't enough debuff slots to justify them doing anything other than maintaining shadow vulnerability and tossing out the occasional heal.
---
Is there a world in which 31/0/20 is okay for battlegrounds and early raids? I know 30/0/21 is the cookie cutter, but Elemental Mastery is such a boss of a spell.
---
And threat is the name of the game with horde tanking.
---
Troll is the best, and then kinda tied between the other races.
---
Everyone's gonna be rocking [an easy to get quest reward as pre-bis until DM comes out though](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11904).
---
Same goes for mining nodes!  I remember farming mithril in Burning Steppes years ago and only looting the ore b/c my bags were just about full, and a short while later, someone in general is raging about there only being stone left in them.
---
Since patch 1.9 the 40-mans reset every week at maintenance while ZG/AQ20 have 3 day resets and Onyxia have 5 day resets.
---
It's upgrade from Rhok, but by the time AQ hits you should have Ashjre from BWL which is much better.
---
Oh. I thought you meant a guild raids mc a month before getting it
---
Oh that explains why I thought it was added in phase 2. Before 1.4 it's pretty much awful lol. The new item progression with 1.12 is gonna be so weird.
---
Only guilds with 4 or more locks can justify a shadow priest.  Shadow weaving in a healing priest is always justifiable, but they will generally be rolling on healing/regen loot, not dps loot.
---
1 point in improved mend pet is so that you can dispel your pet, mostly to deal with long debuffs so you just do it after a fight where 15% is a good as 50%
---
Troll &gt; Orc &gt; Tauren &gt; Undead
---
Increase poison damage.
---
Fishing was great. I used a fishbot program while I sat in front of my computer doing engineering homework. Mostly stonescale eels as I was a tank and needed them for flasks.
---
aurastone hammer also drops in mc so there is at least something to hold a paladin over with.
---
or a priest.
---
Nice.
---
&gt; Paladins are better suited for raid healing.
---
Do you know anything about Paladin healing?
---
They could have easily made them unstackable, or countdown in real time, not only when you're offline.
---
Doesn't matter what they *didn't expect*. They probably isn't expect a ton of things, but calling it an exploit is super ridiculous.
---
No I'm asking which is better between the two...
---
I think the Troll threat and procs from berserking just straight outclass the rest, especially if you're MT with priority on bindings.
---
If you're going to be gear limited Orc starts to shine, and if you give a singular fuck about PvP orcs outclass all else.
---
    /cast pick pocket
---
    /cast ambush
---
hunter weapon hands down.    
---
int = more mana and that means more specials. damage spell crit affect arcane shot, increased damage again affects arcane shot.. same with mend pet.  
---
definetly hunter weapon
---
ohh, now I get what you meant, 
---
yes but I'm sure most people wouldn't mind
---
If you get back into it enough to farm about 120k gold a month you can buy it with gold. Otherwise it’s $15/mo. and discounted for buying more time at once. Game cards still exist, too, at pretty much every 7-11, WalMart, etc.
---
Hah. I knew what this was going to be before I clicked on it!
---
&gt; Nope, at least not at Blizzard you can't.
---
Yes you can. [Paypal is my default payment method for blizzard](https://i.imgur.com/7rSW0PY.png).
---
WoW was originally marketed to the casual player market (they ended up overdoing it) while other MMORPGs were much harder. You’ll be fine. It’s easy to learn, hard to master. Try hunter if you’re really worried about difficulty.
---
Guess you don't know what *objectively* means.
---
Need an AFK dancing naked in org gif.
---
Oh god no, I'd abandon that in a heartbeat lol. If members have done their due diligence and have decent pre-raid gear then MC is a relative cakewalk.
---
The raids aren't too tough, end of AQ and Naxx have mechanics you must pay attention to (I mean every raid does, but I mean to a higher extent), it's just a time sink . 40 people and the it's not like it's 7 drops per boss, still like 4 so can be tough to gear everyone.
---
That's not better. 21 intellect and 12 stamina is way better than 9 spell power, even in PvE. The book is legit the BiS offhand for phase 1.
---
Going blind is the best choice you've made. I've played a lot of Vanilla/TBC/WotLK but, since I quit so long ago, I'm hoping it'll feel good.
---
Regarding your main concern and also the fact that you want to play on a PvP server, I'd say your best bet of finding casual guilds will be on "PvE" servers. **Make sure you understand the differences between [PvP](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/PvP_flag) and [PvE](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Player_vs._Environment) servers** and have a blast!
---
Dwarfs/Tauren are my favorite races, and I absolutely hate gnomes for some reason.. little fuckers..
---
Unless you can provide quantitative data as to how it’s bad, it’s subjectively bad because it’s about how you feel.
---
The 40 to 60 age group wasn't exactly a prime demographic for Vanilla WoW, nor will they be at ages 55 to 75 with Classic.
---
i dont really want to meme it, just have a safe way through leveling without much headaches with dying a lot. I actually dont want to die ever.. hehe jk
---
Worth mentioning that there are very few axes in the game, and pretty much none of them have the fast speed ideal for tanking. 
---
My vote goes troll as well.
---
This might not be the answer you are looking for but what we used to do in vanilla was to leave room for about 5 buyers that got to pay for specific items the main raiders no longer needed. Specifically eye of divinity and the hunter quest item since people got them and we just left them. So we started selling them and other items that people wanted to buy. Setting this up takes a bit of time for someone but it is a very nice way to earn guild money. Also those 5 people were often people who wanted to start raiding so they were most of the time buffed up with flask and pots to not be useless. Meaning they actually contributed to the raids progress.
---
Obviously your 3rd tank should actually want to tank, but its still more efficient to have them specced fury/impale in 3rd prio for tank gear and near the bottom prio for DPS gear. That way they will still be able to do the 3rd tank job of tanking adds by putting on a shield and they will do much more DPS than a prot warrior even if their DPS gear is bad.
---
That's nice, but that's not Vanilla. Not going to happen.
---
I agree and think that's a better way to put it. I just want to make sure that we're giving new players realistic expectations about raiding, hopefully before sinking 40+ levels into their character.
---
Lol the voidwalker needs to lay off that juice
---
Some guides say the first 100 fish always get a skill up and then the fish needed for skill up increases 1 per 25 skill. That would be about 1300 fish total at a maximum of 30 seconds each is almost 11 hours of casting a lure. 
---
About 1300 fish
---
use your VISA or Mastercard.
---
Every loot system will have its pros and cons, especially when you get into content like we're expecting in Classic with 2-3 drops per boss. It's entirely possible that you go weeks without even seeing something that you can use drop, so it'll make the loot drama that much more sticky.
---
The single most important thing in a loot system, however is transparency. Followed closely by accountability. Lot's of the posts in here are discussing the corrupt loot councils they've encountered in the past - that's because the raiders have not held their loot council accountable for those decisions. It's incredibly important to recognize that playing favorites or taking loot for yourself/friends will get you ahead in the short term, the long term outlook for that guild surviving (and therefore you being able to continue to get loot) is very slim.
---
Transparency and Accountability. If you can't trust those in charge of distributing loot, you're in for a rough ride.
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
BECAUSE FUCKING PAT
---
it drops in mc so thats probable
---
There ya go OP
---
PVPers?
---
There is gear that specifies holy shadow etc damage that doesnt come with healing power.
---
Fast Speed is more of a direct benefit for alliance than Horde. Windfury totem profs aren’t weapon normalized so you can hit some fat Windfury procs off a Deathbringer while spamming your GCDs. It’s less optimal for heroic strike spam or dumping rage when it spikes, but that alone makes it not as clear cut for horde.
---
As a hunter player, theres always only one answer.  Hunter Weapon
---
I dunno man... I would def rather buy the cheese from a vendor than pick up old moldy cheese that the dead have been lugging around, your def get that extra aroma tho!
---
i love these comparisons. people talk big about how everyone got better, yet they always assume old warcraftmovie creators are frozen in a time bubble and that they would be an exception to their self-created rule
---
He was asking if Blizzard will allow it.
---
/r/classicwowzers
---
The more you plan to farm, the more worthy it becomes!
---
That’s a lotta boob for a gnome,
---
Since multiple comments have pointed at the additional threat generated by trolls, consider some real values:
---
With a 2.9 speed weapon, and getting a perfect 43% buff on pull, a 2.9 speed weapon (Deathbringer, upper range of one handed speed) will get 6 attacks off in the first 12.1 second (the 6th swing isn’t benefiting from the haste but helps get to a closer comparative value). Without the buff, you get 4 attacks in 11.6 seconds. So it’s worth a little less than 2 full extra attacks (1.8, roughly) in the first 10 seconds of the fight but can’t be used again for 3 minutes.
---
With a 1.3 speed weapon, same scenario (representing Alcor’s, the fastest weapon and lower limit), you get 11 attacks in 10 seconds vs 8 attacks in 10.4 seconds. That’s approximately 3.3 extra attacks in the first 10 seconds.
---
Is that valuable? Yes. But is 1.8 - 3.3 extra attacks every 3 minutes worth more than reducing your glancing penalty by 20% and decreasing the chance your attack is outright avoided by 4%? I’m not convinced. It’s great for burst pull TPS, but the longer the fight goes the more the static buffs shine.
---
I reallly don’t understand this. 
---
On one hand you have everyone claiming how easy the raids are and if you can fill the group you can clear raids
---
On the other hand you have people claiming there’s just no room for rets and ferals.
---
How come if the raids are so easy, that you can’t possibly bring a ret or a feral?
---
Troll regeneration is stronger than playing Alliance.
---
All you have to do to counteract this is to log out once you get the buffs and wait for raidnight.
---
You’re in for a good time!
---
Sadly not, haha!
---
Pot buffs while leveling are so big.
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
The Dark Carnival always seemed like the coolest dudes on Horde side, despite never actually playing with any of them. Also anywhere Atemp wasn't
---
I've currently got a smaller group of 5-6 friends looking to play Alliance (NA). If you or anyone else is interested msg me. No official guild or anything setup yet but we're super passionate about the game and will be making some fantastic memories... guaranteed!
---
So much vanilla memories from it. It was in the famous warrior PvP video and I remember it from several other videos from my friends from that time.
---
Not only are you looking at a parse from Naxx geared players, but even then it supports what I said. A paladin putting in the work will do as much as a hunter. Hunter's best overall was ~1,450 dps with 800 dps average. Paladin's best overall was 870 dps with average 500.
---
Again, this isn't even taking into consideration the gear available in which the average gap is WAY smaller.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg for a link to the average and highest dps of each spec as of MC.
---
That's the only reason you need. It takes 130 Strange Dust and 10 Lesser Magic Essences to get to 100 Enchanting. You're not getting that many greens from quest rewards before you hit level 20. You're not getting enough gold to buy the mats at that level, either.
---
That is a fair concern that we will find a solution for.
---
So two things: 
---
First, gear won't fall off the bottom of the list because the people at or near the bottom can take the gear for 'free' - you can't drop lower than last, after all. 
---
Second, this is why you need multiple lists with SK, generally a list for each armor slot, each role and weapons (so like 40 -50 lists). 
---
Organizing it past that is simple. The top section of the list has all the people who need gear for their primary spec. The bottom section of the list has all the people who would take that gear for a secondary spec. People from the bottom section can never be higher than the last person on the top section. 
---
Gear falls from top to bottom, through the primary list then through the secondary list. If it's an upgrade for the last person in the primary section, there is literally no downside to taking it. 
---
And for progression purposes, you can 'loot council' the order of the lists and have a veto power to make sure you MT and healers are properly geared. You can put your MT at the top of every relevant list and have them geared fast. But after that the loot would start being distributed more equitably. 
---
As long as you have good record keeping, SK is one of the most fair-feeling systems, imo.
---
I do actually. You’re just a subjective moral relativists who believes truth is subjective. 
---
By your thinking: there is no way to make a “better” or “worse” game at all, and everything, including a game where u r locked in an all black room and can’t move, see, or hear is just as good as any other game... cuz “it’s like....just your opinion bro.”
---
That’s nonsense.

You are correct in that you get more benefit out of the gcd swap by timing every swap after an autoswing vs. swapping as fast as possible.  However, there's a couple of issues.  The primary issue is that your swing timer only resets on a weapon swap if it's not in your favor.  That is, in your example, your next mainhand swing is at 7.01s regardless of its weapon speed.  
---
Going by this, you only kind of "lose" 1 or so seconds of swing time!  But it's not just that; you're making multiple mainhand swings at 3.5s intervals instead of whatever its swing timer is.  In your example, your autoswings look like
---
0.0 onehand auto
---
3.5 2h auto
---
7.0 onehand auto
---
when it could just be 
---
0.0 2h 
---
3.5 2h 
---
7.0 2h 
---
which kind of defeats the purpose of trying to buff your instant swings in the first place.
---
i sense an irritational level of bitterniss within this comment
---
&gt; How come if the raids are so easy, that you can’t possibly bring a ret or a feral?
---
Usually comes down to the fact that 39 other people usually don't like being handicapped because you wanted to play a meme spec. 
---
Why would they take a ret pally when a rogue or fury warrior does the same job much better?
---
Yes, Totemic Mastery gives Tremor Totem to a 40-yard range instead of 30. I remember being surprised by this in actual Vanilla. The tooltip doesn't give any indication that it works on Tremor, but it does.
---
The correct answer is "I don't know but I can guess".
---
It's ok. I'll just pay venruki to play my duels against you. Problem solved
---
I don't think it's because of the class choice. But the grind gets really long around lvl 45. I often take a break around then to level an alt to 10 or so.
---
But only in low tier guilds are the DPS bad enough to not be afking at their keyboards because of the poor threat.
---
You should throw in that pump it up song Esfand plays.
---
I love that song.
---
Just add it once though.
---
Possibly because you're already 20 points down the shadow tree at that point.
---
They should make people read the rules and complete a little quiz before using this site.  The most important rule of the voting system is hidden in the middle of this list that you have to google to find:
---
https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette
---
&gt;Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.
---
It's number 10 out of 21.
---
A confused person being able to ask a halfway informed question is probably the only thing that this sub is good for, but it is also the most likely thing to be downvoted.
---
I can guess on whether any Hunter will figure out how to solo DM, but I know that if they do figure it out, they will be allowed to continue to do so.
---
I think WoW graphics are Gorgeous. The poly count isn’t as high as retail or other games now a days but they look so good. I think you will have a great time in classic.
---
I rlly? Ok, the. Prove that the claim you just made is true with “quantitative data” shows my it to be true... 
---
Ruh roh.... awkward...
---
In TBC in order to save on respec costs since I killed a large portion of my time each day doing battlegrounds and waiting for the raids I made "hybrid" pve/pvp builds. Where it was like 80% of a pve build but took a healthy number of points to be reassigned into valuable pvp talents. I had been doing this literally since day 1 in vanilla and nobody had ever brought it up. I remember thinking "jesus calm down" when my class leader demanded I stop doing that and make pure PvE dps builds with ABSOLUTELY ZERO alterations made for pvp sometime during serpent shrine.
---
Not at all? 21 int is something like 1/3 of a crit, which is nowhere near 9sp, and the amount of mana it gives is irrelevant in the early phases where fights are so short that you'll never run out of mana. As for stam, that matters even less in pve. Grimoire is literally just a pvp item.
---
My friend and I made a homage to World of Roguecraft back during Wrath and called it World of Magecraft. It was like 1/4 minmaxing, 1/4 crocodile tears, and mostly goofing off.
---
This scene happened entirely by accident - we were just staging a regular old machinama emote conversation in the Booty Bay inn... when this dwarf just randomly [jumped onto our table and /danced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6wR5_azqhs&amp;t=3m35s).
---
I hate humans of any class the most. What kind of a person spends all day being a human irl and then decide to be a human when they log into WoW? I'll tell you what kind of person does that; a pathetic one. 
---
I don't really understand why people hate gnomes. I've always been a horde player, and dwarves and gnomes on alliance are the ones I'm least likely to go out of my way to gank.
---
haste effects are multiplicative not additive. I wish that was the case :)
---
This dude probably doesn't have jack shit. As seen after the various big mechanic changes from the beta, people weren't exactly the best at theorycrafting or documenting stuff in retail vanilla.   
---
That being said, most non-scientific sources claim for it to be around an hour. Others even claim there was a DME lotus that could spawn in the courtyard with all the lashers.   
---
In the end, unless datamining proves otherwise, we'll just have to wait until the game launches to make any claims of how the meta will be.
---
Grand Marshal Warhammer was introduced in patch 1.10, that's post AQ
---
It's a mechanic that encourages you to not play the game if you get buffed close to your raid day and it becomes forced in decent guilds despite it simply being a time saver not a requirement to kill anything, losing world buffs kills runs, and it trivializes the content entirely, you're between 30-60% stronger with them than without and the game just doesn't need them.
---
It's objectively bad.
---
Is it dead? There's 2-3k online at the moment which is what vanilla servers were like.
---
&gt; the amount of mana it gives is irrelevant in the early phases where fights are so short that you'll never run out of mana.
---
That's just not really the case. That's 300 mana. If you wear all those nothing-but-spellpower items in every slot, your base mana pool is gonna be like 4k which is *not* plenty for endgame. You'd also have like 2300 life which is so little that you're at risk of getting one-shotted by mechanics. You can't just not have any intellect on your gear, and if you can get 33 points of relevant stats in exchange for *nine spell power,* that's more than worthwhile.
---
The thing about trolls CD is you use it at the start of the fight where threat matters the most. It’s a huge advantage if you can get extra swings off at a pull.
---
The 5% HP is insignificant because if you think about it that only helped in situations where you dropped below 5% HP during the fight. Usually if that happens your group has other issues going on. War stomp also feels pretty useless as soon as you get out of doing dungeons. Even in dungeons war stomp never felt good because you’re being hit by other mobs and suffering spell pushback on it
---
Armor doesn't go negative
---
i always read to not take enchanting because it's a huge gold sink and not worth it at all except if you are your guild enchanter, but your comment sounds different... would you advice to not enchant if you are noob but otherwise it's a fine profession ?
---
Nice
---
We had a 7 year old on our vent in Wrath so yes
---
Most actually are late 20's to early 30's IIRC
---
Since you are the one claiming that it is “objectively bad”, the onus is on you to provide proof to back your claim.
---
Since you can’t prove through actual data that it is outright bad, only that you don’t personally like their usage, then it is subjective to your feelings. Thus it’s subjectively, not objectively, bad.
---
I see that BPC right below her
---
My man! I’m currently rewatching voyager. But TNG is my fav followed by DS9.
---
I want to be an Alliance Shaman.
---
&gt; Blue post already talked about launching with hundreds of bugs. - Totally normal
---
Classic STILL HAD HUNDREDS OF BUGS AT THE END OF VANILLA.
---
Who the heck went through Rock Tunnel with Flash, anyway?
---
Same! Just recently rewatched TNG and DS9. Now on to Voyager. Good stuff.
---
They can dungeon level 15-60 so it’s not really an issue.
---
Lol, thanks I think
---
I watched the old Fart one and felt like it summed me and playstyle up quiet well
---
Really REALLY bland people.
---
Definitely!
---
Yes, I think everyone had to bid within 30 points of the highest bid. If you dropped 80, anyone who bid under 50 would have to increase their bid or drop out.
---
Usually no one bid over 25-30 DKP for 90% of items, it was key tier pieces and weapons that got the big bids.
---
I demand mystery meat!
---
&gt;The ZG hammer is better but comes out much later and I would give the mageblade to a mage if it ZG came sooner sooner.
---
By the time ZG hammer is out there will be better option,  
---
Lokamiri, Claw of Chromaggus, Staff of the Shadow Flame
---
Ofc you can lol
---
That doesn’t follow even in The slightest! How on earth did you infer that from what I said?
---
Ok. So dog crap is just as delicious and steak cuz “hey bro! Everything is a preference!”
---
You’re wrong.
---
Hell yah brother, I hope you find some more good times when Classic comes out!
---
Here a more appropriate playlist I made for a friend and myself. Open for suggestions.
---
[https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/23e5b3be-4922-4b1b-a0e1-38c60e98ac28](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/23e5b3be-4922-4b1b-a0e1-38c60e98ac28)
---
Holy Paladin weapon.
---
You know, it's going to take a lot of raiding to gear 40 people.  As much as people talk about optimum... it might be best to bring variety just so you can get meaningful upgrades for people every run.
---
On Horde side it was very dead when I checked in like 2 days ago at max level, as far as I could tell at least. One big thing I noticed was the biggest horde guild melted and reformed, cause someone deleted the discord or some other bs. Also I was an enchanter and I had some people message me in discord to enchant cause I was the only one they knew and they couldn't find any others.
---
I think its still the case in retail that you need the base game and the latest expansion, just nothing in between. I think im pretty sure on that but maybe im wrong. Classic however doesnt.
---
Except you made your own distinct objective truth claim that I challenged.
---
Now defend it. Prove it
---
This is a great post and really hit me in the feels.  I just turned 39, but nearly my entire 30s were a mad shit-show.   Went through an overwhelming amount that had me nearly giving up.   
---
Around Dec of 2017 I finally escaped the madness surrounding me, and ever since it’s been a journey of rediscovery (finding my individualism again), and recovery for my mental health.    
---
I came back to WoW around eight months ago only to find a couple of the same great friends I had made in BC/WoTLK.  It was helpful in my recovery because I wasn’t quite ready for a social life, but definitely needed some sort of human adult interaction.    
---
The game in its current iteration is so advanced and everyone is either guilded up, or flying through content with really no care to slow down for someone like me.   I’m really looking to Classic, and hoping to find a group of like-minded adults to become part of.   
---
You can't get both nature's guidance (+3% hit talent) and elemental devastation anyways heh, realized that after my last big comment. 
---
I commented elsewhere that 5SR isn't really relevant if you commit to just using mana pot and demonic rune if necessary on boss fights.  It won't matter on trash, if the fight goes that long you're already kind of screwed if it's just a trash fight.  So you can just drink up to full between. 
---
If you use a mana pot and demonic rune and don't waste any mana on max rank shock (only on totem twisting and rank 1 shocks) you have a couple minutes of full-on totem twisting assuming ZERO 5sr regen and that you start with a 5kish mana pool.  Which is very possible with raid buffs and the fact that a ton of high-end sham raid gear has Int on it.  The tier 2.5 set especially is pretty good for this spec. 
---
Even totem twisting you only get one 5SR tick if you never shock at all, you'll regain more mana just by having mana spring down and might as well spam the r1 shocks for the +crit. 
---
I had absurd gear but the Devastation uptime was very good, meaning I always had flurry and all the good things that brings.  Plus constantly buffing my melee group with wf totem + GOA (77 agility) which is like, 2 or 3% crit and a buttload of attack power.
---
Just 15% throughput, and a good 30 mp5 difference.
---
I hope they send them to those of us who don't play anymore so they know we are coming back for classic!
---
Even then, just play something like 2/31/18 and gear for more agi or crit. I find imp. AotH super inconsistent.
---
Why wouldn't they have a chance ?
---
Or start a guild called &lt;GET OFF MY LAWN&gt; and name yourselves Prunejuice, Depends, Shuffleboard, Mattlock, Programs, Crossword, Bingolady, Reruns, Balding, Badknees, Lostkeys, Slowdriver, Dentures, etc.
---
You are fighting constantly though and claw is at least 25% of your pets damage. We aren't talking about raiding where you have a ton of rap here, leveling your pet will likely outdps you
---
the best part of world buffs is taking them away from the opposing faction :D
---
buffwatch...
---
Actually quite a bit lore wise, play Warcraft 3.
---
It is. I've also heard of parents punishing their children by making them level their fishing.
---
Nothing flat about that gnome
---
In a magical world where everyone knows what they're doing, maybe.
---
When you google "define: strawman", just a screenshot of this comment should come up.
---
this is 1000 less compared to YOUR private server.  YOUR pserver inflated the armor and hp values of the bosses to make them harder
---
So subtle you never even see them! Truly the most powerful
---
&gt; How many servers are there going to be?
---
Hasn't been announced yet; stay tuned.
---
&gt; Also what are going to be some of the minor differences between 1.12 and Classic?
---
Not a ton, the mount training system is going to be the pre 1.12 one, the release of content is unique (look up the phase system), theres gunna be some server structure differences (look up layering, god help you in slogging through THAT conversation), but mostly they are trying to recreate 1.12.
---
&gt; ALso SUPER important but how do you download addons? 
---
Most classic addons are still being developed, you can look up https://willitclassic.com/ for some more details. Ability to download will be established on or around release.
---
&gt; Also, will the system requirements for Classic be less than for Retail?
---
Most likely. Classic is running on the modern game engine. 
---
&gt; Also last but maybe least any tips for levelling a Night Elf Druid or Alliance in general? 
---
Massive question, far too much scope to try to answer in one shot. I main a night elf druid on vanilla servers and will do so again in Classic; if you can narrow this down to more specific questions I'd be happy to answer.
---
Nobody uses big blue any more lol. Do you even meta bro?
---
I found that hard to sit through at times, definitely my least favourite. Hope you enjoy it!
---
avec moi*
---
I don't agree with that broad generalization
---
That's still
---
&gt;berserking + better weapon vs axe spec
---
The opportunity cost of Troll is axe spec.
---
The opportunity cost of Orc is either Berserking + swords, or just berserking for no benefit.
---
Warlock:
---
-Farm elite demons in Winterspring using Enslave Demon. This can also be done in dungeons. 
---
-Summon people off of cliffs.
---
-Summon an infernal near low level/AFK players, banish it and then watch them die to the AoE.
---
-Trick noobs into helping you summon a doomguard which will kill a player that helps summon it. 
---
-Give enemy melee players Curse of Recklessness to increase their attack power.
---
You should name your character Rick Grimes
---
Holy/Prot build.
---
This also would work wonders with a proper Shockadin spec.
---
Is there a source for this? Some people seem positive it does and I haven’t seen evidence either way, yet.
---
Totemic focus is sort of required if you are going to twist totems for any duration too.  It's like 500 mana every 10 seconds to drop 2 totems.   That means that talent is effectively worth like 65 mp5.
---
I think we might see more priests opting to bring Power Infusion from the Discipline tree and only spec up to Shadow Weaving in the Shadow tree. The priest won’t have the best heals nor much damage, but they’ll be a utility machine and buff the best dps with Power Infusion on cooldown.
---
Paladins, especially human ret pallys, always trying to gank me as a warrior, and taking 5 mins to do so. Most of the time they take to long to kill back, wish /suicide worked so it could just be over with.
---
This, like just spam chain heal Lol.
---
Undead doesn't have access to Fear Ward.
---
Dang. I stand corrected.
---
Sorry to nitpick but fear ward does not exist horde side.
---
This is just incorrect, and if you're telling the truth then you had a guild full of weirdos.
---
Paladins are the MT healers. There's nothing they have that works for raid healing.
---
Yeah. But I was only doing it for an hour or so at a time, and sitting at the screen in case someone came by, or whispered me.
---
Nopt sure why anyone would have an issue with world buffs.  Mostly world buffs were for cleraing content that your guild has already progressed through. 
---
In other words, by the time AQ comes out, MC will be trivial.  But you would still have plenty of people that need specific items from there, so you can't just stop doing it, and it eats up raid time.  So you get your DM buffs, your Ony Head, and your songflower, and your guild knocks out MC in an hour so you can get to the next raid. Not everyone has to get them but there will be plenty of tryhards in your 40 man that want to because they like seeing big numbers on their screen. 
---
And honestly, turning things like MC into a speed-run is fun as hell. Old guild could clear it in 45 minutes w/ buffs. Sort of like speed-running a game you've beaten 20 times.
---
Keep in mind you get the world buffs once before raid start, and if you happen to die, tough luck, you lose them. So getting world buffs before doing the latest progression raid was mostly pointless since a full wipe was very likely.
---
I get that she is busty, but it seems like it’s 2 dimensional. Maybe it’s just the angle
---
Thanks. I did not know that. It's only been CC for me since vanilla.
---
Fair, but those stats are a significant value, especially being up for 100% of a fight. Is the threat issue throughout progression really an issue of on pull threat or are warriors (and eventually fire mages), having to significantly throttle threat from start to finish, or throughout the fight? One of those classes popping all cooldowns on pull is going to pull aggro regardless of the 2-3 additional attacks in the first 10 seconds.
---
Awesome gear
---
Legit warlock weapon to me
---
78 represent, and still gaming :)
---
AoE threat is actually amazing on prot paladins. It doesn't quite work with the bomb tactic where you just nuke the fuck out of the trash while the warriors somehow keep threat, but that's not happening in mid-tier guilds. Well on private servers anyways, I'm sure it'll be different on Classic. 
---
And that's one (of many) reasons why we won't have a prot paladin this time hehe.
---
That's fair, personally I would (and have) run from any guild where rank has no relation to performance and attendance. So that probably colors my experience a bit
---
yeah because NEW, CASUAL players were totally the ones playing the BETA ...
---
and YOU might not know what's gonna happen until launch, but from a Community perspective it's been generally acknowledged and accepted (since the announcement of classic) that there WILL be a drop off of a TON of NEW players not long after launch, the real questions are When / how many people will drop off. (Hence why OP posted the question in the first place...because it WILL happen)
---
 This is a 15 year old game Not a new game, and people have had a TON of time to collect data and do research on every topic under the sun related to WOW ....But theres still a TON of people that dont fully comprehend what they're getting into and will quit when they figure out that CASUAL play will take MONTHS not weeks , of actual in game play time before they hit 60 and see any type of end game content 
---
That includes many of the "cool abilities and gear" that people often say draws them to the game In the first place. Let that sink in for a second and then consider the fact there is also ZERO instant gratification to be had.
---
As soon as fire comes out, ofcourse you can
---
werent they just high elves? huh i misunderstood something
---
The buffs you can't predict are the ones that could "hold you hostage". Ony/Nef Heads and Hakkar will be on 6 hour CDs. You also have to be in Org to obtain these. So let's say you raid Tuesday night and obtain the buff. Monday afternoon. There's no guarantee you'll be back in Org to get the buff before raid. You make the choice: do I hold on to the buff and log out to make raiding easier or not?
---
My nephew had max enchanting in vanilla and he was always the richest of the group selling enchants in IF hehe
---
Good. Keep the excite happening.
---
Can someone explain to me why paladins are MT healers? I have never played alliance before and by the paper it seems like FoL spamming is the best raid healing for alliance?
---
If you’re doing it based on racials then probably go with orc.  But honestly all of the racials are negligible in the grand scheme of things.
---
Just pick which ever one you think is the prettiest.
---
No tbc was 
---
But anything is better than retail
---
Hey op, can i ask what server and guild u where in? It sounds rly similar to the one i was in back in the days :)
---
&gt; we used a Suicide Kings list 
---
I've never seen the movie, could you elaborate on this?
---
Second that.
---
Damn that’s legit! Is a there a similar style one for mages?
---
Mageblade and offhand is 1crit 60sp, I'd love to see better for any raid situation.
---
''most ppl'' don't need a language specific server either, yet it was a simple and obvious quality of life and server health improvement to make, so after getting ding-donged, they eventually did it. RP-PVP is really no different in any meaningful way.
---
I third this
---
BC was the best ;)
---
You only get about ~100 rep per WIN in wsg/ab. Based on flags your team capped or points acquired. Pug games can last up to 30 minutes. And depending on a lot of factors, queues aren't always fast. So it's a bit of a commitment for your average gamer.
---
Depends on your personal opinion
---
What, HW? No dude.
---
That's a dip. Not nachos.
---
It was a much longer grind, especially prior to patch 1.12 and cross realms.
---
I actually bought these. When they arrive I will try to see if I can get used to strafe L-R and move forward keybinds on them. That will free my entire right hand up for non-movement related stuff.
---
Yep, because classic isn't about competitive gameplay. Which is a good thing. Retail has tried to be for a decade, but the mmo aspect has always diluted the waters.
---
As one of the pretty horde fire mages... seeing that artifact is one of the things that made me regret not coming back for legion.
---
I got it for ~$9 with that PayPal deal that was posted here a while back.
---
It’s unfortunate because the forsaken have some of the best lore and appearance imo. The undead missions were always my favorite in WC3
---
Just going to have a sack of raw onions to snack on.
---
That kind of thing is what makes games interesting.  It's scouring the game files and forums for little secrets that use the game mechanics in a way they weren't fully intended.  Look at MCP for feral druids, it makes them pretty much viable as DPS and great as Tanks where, otherwise, they'd be wayyy low on the charts and considered non-viable for raids.
---
Better be. Let's not go "NO CHANGEZ!" and then just give a huge "fuck you" to one class.
---
Was expecting a list of every loot drop in the game
---
*laughs in EU*
---
You got 99 options and you picked wrong.
---
is that in 1.12 tho?
---
Eh, TBC was just Vanilla with a few extras. TBC also introduced flying which is a cancer upon zeroth, and WotLK introduced dungeon finder and destroyed any sense of communities. MoP was the best expansion for gameplay discounting those two things from previous expansions, IMO.
---
Uh yes, but most people don't research a game that isn't out yet very heavily. That's part of the whole "casual" thing. There's instant gratification every time people get a level, and there are a ton of stepping stones between level 1 and level 60. You're intentionally ignoring all the positives of the Vanilla leveling process and going with this same tired retail mentality that no one gives a shit about.
---
Also randomly capitalizing words doesn't make your point stronger, it just makes my internal voice interpret you like that Spongebob meme.
---
sorry what? digits?
---
I Fourth this
---
Really? To me it seems clear that gnomes in the forefront, then VW, then background.
---
Just take your build - throw it in the trash and never speak of it again. Then - take your cookie cutter Hemo build and there ya go. There’s your BiS control/CC/utility build. Enjoy.
---
Best tankadin weapon
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just like, uh, your opinion, man.
---
&gt; Eh, TBC was just Vanilla with a few extras.
---
So a true *expansion* then! :D
---
About a month ^/s
---
Couldnt agree more. Vanilla with a few extras minus flying would have been perfect!
---
best one save myb bloodfang
---
Trigger warning please.
---
With what class?
---
Wasn’t there tokens?
---
Mend pet build, amiright?
---
I prefer some red velvet, cream cheese frosting LAYER cake, but to each their own (layer).
---
Yeah except druids are worse healers than paladins and get all the offspec gear, priests get handed a fantastic healing weapon in MC. lol Amir is a pally wep.
---
Raid leader?
---
I always liked this League of Legends parody; ‘Spin to Win’ by The Spins. 
---
https://youtu.be/jw44JdK3p9k
---
That’s an assumption that the health gained from spirit causes threat.  Mana gained from spirit does not, so lets not flatly assume it does.  If someone can point to evidence that suggests it does, cool.  I’m not yet convinced.
---
This correct - there is a innate priority system as well as a strength priority (rank 1 sunder vs rank 2) some debuffs overlap and others don’t despite doing similar things and other instances where they do the same thing but don’t stack etc.
---
I couldn't.
---
There are retail glad on pserv, that's a fact, sorry if it breaks your "retail players are way better than private"
---
Well I’ve also been a Hunter main since Vanilla and on every private server since xD So that’s a big factor too. But yeah
---
No one is going to give up on 100,000 dollars to play a video game lol
---
I did Mara farming as a Warlock in vanilla. Works perfectly fine.
---
It's not as bad you make it out to be here.
---
Mounting up is only worthwhile versus travel form is your next destination is greater than 24 seconds of travel away. 
---
If you are grinding as you move, then the only time you will be mounting is when you are going very long distances (from one quest hub to another, like Darkshire to Raven Hill length). If you're going from Chillwind to Andorhal to quest, for instance, just grind on the bears and bats on the way up and you'll never need to mount.
---
Whole reason I want money is so I don't have to work and can just play classic wow all day, so no.
---
I know what it was designed for. It was just crap compared to other gear you could get for less effort at that stage with dire maul/bg rewards/crafting. Really anyone that played seriously enough to deal with the long and expensive quest chains could easily pug ZG/AQ20 on the weekend for far better and easier gear than the 0.5 sets.  
---
Even if 0.5 sets were in from phase 1 and all their costs were halved they still wouldn't be very good.
---
News to me, thanks for the info bud.
---
That's an interesting way of looking at it...  
---
At multiple points throughout the years mail was made instant to various recipients (alts, friends, guildies).  
---
In Vanilla it took an hour, in Classic it will take an hour.
---
Remember the name?
---
shadowbolt my friend, always
---
Making leveling too fast but then making leveling take longer so if you missed the good time you have to just suck it up
---
Play a class that can stealth or a night elf so you can go AFK on short notice and maybe still be alive when you get back.
---
Agreed
---
It was tested on the beta by players. They would pull mobs have no one do anything and the troll pulled threat by regeneration
---
If I understand the phases correctly this will be technically available in Phase 2 with PvP rewards. Though I doubt anyone will be able to grind out the 14 ranks before phase 3, I do not think they are staging the GM weapons separate from the PvP rewards in Phase 2. I could be wrong though
---
They got rid of GOUGE? The most baseline rogue ability there is? Just the other day I logged onto retail for the first time in forever, but was too distracted by all the space anime to realize I was gougeless. Hurry the hell up, Classic.

---
Does it really? I thought it was odd when I first had it but it’s delicious I’d made right IMO
---
Ah yes, you're right. You get 3 per win. 1 per loss. An additional ~100 rep per 3 tokens turned in iirc. And you also get 2x rep during the weekend events
---
I assume this was for the caster? Paladins can't use daggers or staffs.
---
Yeah I was planning on going rogue (my OG main) or mage. I was originally NE but really what to roll horde this time round.
---
I'm a huge kiss fan, and love wow. that south park episode was amazing for me when it came out lmao
---
Thanks for the reply! Happy to hear that. I'm not good at making gold and that was the only good method I know of for lock.
---
Correct.
---
All you have to do is re word the question and the answer obviously becomes 'no'.
---
Would you spend $100,000 to play classic wow?
---
could play fortnite for that
---
So true. The number of times I have seen people go chase a random player and walked away from the AB flag they should be defending is insane. Just because an enemy is nearby, doesn't mean you should leave the flag to go kill them.
---
It's Ma'am!
---
Unless something changes they were "mandatory" for raid nights for the top guilds on my servers, one of which I raided in. (We were allowed a couple of infractions, not 100% but close to 90% of raid nights). They weren't just used for farm, more treated like any consumable.
---
30-60% DMG and 30% extra EHP skips a lot of mechanics, or reduces their relavant time period to the point that claiming it hasn't made something trivial isn't an opinion. It makes the rather challenging easy and the easy entirely trivial. 
---
And buff loss killed morale in my guild, if you arrived to get instantly goblin charged by 40 ally as we rush to zone into the raid that raid night was bleak, motivation was dead after you invested hours and avoided playing to keep them just to turn up and instantly find out it was wasted effort. You still clear obviously but it just isn't the same environment.
---
I honestly don't have a problem with them being in game, I intend to be a casual raider this time round and sit one tier behind most of the time but that's partly because I cba playing around world buffs on my main again, it's just not fun but guilds want every advantage available.
---
That was Kargoz. That was a 4 mage/ 1 priest group. He did a melee cleave test as well I believe but I havent watched that yet.
---
Unless you are the tank, using swipe in bear form, I don't druid is a great class for 5 man dungeon farming. You are probably better off solo questing/grinding, assuming you know you're route decently.
---
I'd also say it's easier to learn a standard leveling route or follow a guide than do 5 man dungeon leveling. In order to reach the same levels of efficiency, you will need to have practiced pulls in all the dungeons and know what quests to do as you move from dungeon to dungeon. Not to mention you'll be beholden to 4 other people's schedules.
---
Overall, I'd just stick with solo leveling as a druid.
---
On retail or pserver? After 100 fishing it takes more and more successful casts to rank up 1 skill. 250+ is 10 casts. Those 50 skill would be 500 casts at an average of 20sec each, meaning you take 3 hours for that stretch alone.
---
My guess would be 8-10 hours of straight fishing. Ouch.
---
I had totally forgotten I listened to the shit out of this odd group. I thank you for the nostalgia.
---
Pizza, ice coffee, red bulls, joints and chips. I might die but I'll die happy.
---
Ok cool, have fun.
---
Nope... I’m in an extremely good financial position already and $100K is less than a years worth of salary for not only me but my wife as well.  Would without a doubt decline $100K if it meant I couldn’t play Classic.  I would have to hope nobody mentioned the deal to my wife however.  She’d probably be willing to PAY $100K if it meant I couldn’t play Classic.
---
***So, the light's vaunted justice has finally arrived. Shall I lay down Frostmourn and throw myself at your mercy, Fordring?***
---
Jeeeeez... I remember way more of this RP than I thought I would after almost 10 years.
---
I’d take the money no matter how hyped this game is. I can easily switch to something else to do in my free time in terms of vidya games.
---
Do you take requests?
---
Stacking world buffs to ignore boss mechanics is an exploit. Can you imagine if there was something in retail wow that allowed you to ignore every phase of a current tier raid boss and kill it in 30 seconds? This would be hotfixed in 24 hours.
---
A 30 second boss is players breaking the intended design of the game. End of discussion.
---
Gnomes are wank mate
---
BC sucked dick.
---
Took the words out of my mouth bro!
---
Yeah fuck it I'll wait for WotLK.
---
A lot of People are too hard on you, but it’s sorta like asking how to be the best at guitar because theres a World Championship in 38 days hehe. I can’t contribute but gl man :)
---
I like it a lot, on pservers. 
---
The thing is, you have an incredible amount of ability to make things run smoothly, and if you pay attention to your gear and use your abilities correctly, it's nearly impossibly for your group to wipe you without them deliberately sabotaging you. 
---
It's also really rewarding, as it's very much appreciated to tank well. you never get bored, as the dungeon really just progresses at your own pace.
---
The one downside is that any quest objectives/herb nodes or mining nodes will CONSTANTLY get sniped by greedy dps who are mining while the fighting is not even over yet, but such is life. 
---
If you want to do it, start early, make sure you are no more than 3 levels below the level of the last boss of the dungeon,  and try to come in with decent gear.  If you do that, you will have a very good introductory experience. 
---
Also, if you are badly geared, really try to get a priest healer. Power word: fortitude will forgive a lot of sins. 
---
If you want to see what the main quests to hit early on are for alliance, [here's a short spreadsheet I made.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKv_1nPqFC06eqouNcqo4p6yMdHWpKBwQpilkyFs0P8/edit#gid=0). 
---
Try to get at least a piece of mail in every slot before you enter deadmines, even if you have to buy some from vendors. 
---
but if you pay attention to your gear while leveling, do the right quests, and show up at an appropriate level? learning to tank is not hard. 
---
Also, throwing weapons are mandatory. Bring them.
---
It's not toxic to have the non tank healing paladins spamming flash of light as raid healers. 
---
Also priests and druids have hots to help buffer tanks + shield and/or natures swiftness which make for superior tank healing.
---
Shaman LF guild that will let me get atiesh.
---
Oh that's right, the gear I will need I will only have to compete for it with other Tank Warriors right? About that con, do you think it's easy to find a guild as a Tank Warrior, or are/will there be a high overload of Tank Warriors? I know it's gonna be probably the most picked class, I only don't know if it's gonna be dps or tank most of the people.
---
I had a gnome warrior alt I hit 60 with fairly late in vanilla after AQ and my main memory of tanking is charging into packs in UBRS with my crappy blues/IBS, cleaving the crap out of everything and never really knowing if the healers could heal through it or not. Often not.
---
Heron will get a new life in 1 month !
---
**DESLA!!!!** (shakes fist towards Org)
---
I have a 4 month old. I feel for you.
---
What do you mean?
---
It was definitely good times, and googling that brought back some fond memories.  The leader of Burly men and two of the listed officers were RL friends.
---
I'm not wrong if I say you have to get exalted rep with Gnomeregan to mount it as a non-gnome race ?
---
Yep, same here. It was 100000% worth doing though, because I met some people I'm planning to rush to 60 with as a group.
---
No, Humans and Night Elves cannot ride any of the Mechanostriders.
---
That’s still before bwl, is it not?
---
I’m 19 and super excited
---
priests and druids can find solace in their staves
---
It's been my "4" keybind since 2005 and they fucking pruned it from Subtlety and Assassination.  
---
Now there is a gaping hole on my action bars and an even larger one in my heart.
---
Indeed.
---
Top dps as a tank? Crazy times indeed.
---
Nah healer is better. Just give them a big button thats bound to heal macro for your personal healbot
---
I'm not suggestion you funnel loot to officers in any way, just saying that from the perspective of your more casual raiders it can appear that way because we funneled loot to the consistent core raiders that perform well of which hopefully your officers are members. 
---
In my experience there is no benefit to dkp and its just a bunch of overhead for loot to basically go to the same place. Plus a little extra drama because you still need rules like non core raiders can't roll on dft no matter how much dkp they have.
---
ty, has been edited.
---
So it's binary then? Either you're financially independent or a broke gamer guy.
---
I wouldn't take the money either, but I don't feel the need to talk about an "extremely good financial position" on a classic wow subreddit. 
---
Your answer was one word answering the question and then 4 sentences bragging about your cash status.
---
Turn the sound up to drown out the crying, then wait for your wife to leave you.  After that, it’s smooth sailing.
---
From the dueling tournament, if the totem was hostile, /target tremor failed to work.  That is a carry over from retail, but sure when it was changed.
---
All classes do
---
Classic
---
I feel contractually obligated to disagree
---
Some thoughts as I am in the same situation:  
---
 More than half my guildmates (all from the vanilla days) are in their 30s-40s, with kids, families, studies for PhDs, careers,work outs, daily chores, shopping/grocery, etc. Around thirty of them will return for classic and we make plans on how to progress meaningfully through classic. Our guild's schedule, program, scope and vision has fallen into the casual spectrum. Maintaining a healthy life style is our number one rule for our guild, as if you fall behind on that, WoW will be the first on your list to be "cut down".  
---
 We anticipate that the  leveling progress will take from 3 to 5 months for most members. After that we estimate an average of 9hrs/week play time for each member, which translates to 2 raids of 3hr per week, leaving some room for flexibility. MC, Onyxia, BwL, ZG, AQ20 will be raids with minimal consumable consumption and AQ40 will be raided after we acquire \[very slowly\] some NR gear and the oozling pet. As for naxx we will raid the first bosses from each wing and farm trash mobs for some nice end game gear.  
---
 The server we chose will be PvE to avoid downtime from ganks while leveling or outside raids/instances. We will organize BGs, aiming for rank:10 and ranks:11-12 to some selected few by sharing accounts with the most active members. For our 40m raid groups we will restrict the "meme specs" to a total of 5 positions, since we will NOT farm raiding consumables, which means we need decent dps, healing and tanking duties from the optimal classes and specs. Specific items, like annihilator, thunderfury and nightfall, professions funneling tricks for axe-smiths and armor-smiths, item prios for warlocks (hit), mages(crit) etc are already fundamentals for casual guilds who want to shut down an MC raid in less than 3 hrs.  
---
 Furthermore, I believe after 2 years we will have 1-3 members at PvP rank 12, and most of our members will have at least 3-5 gear pieces of high end gear. That's a fantastic goal to achieve @ 9hr/week. Since we will have 30 people from the original crew, we will need to recruit 15-30 mature people to raid with us casually during those 2 years. For cases that our planning fails and we left we few people, we will be raiding 20m raids and try to make a pact with another guild for raiding spots as a contingency plan.  
---
 I would highly recommend on finding a somewhat similar.
---
In dungeons, you will have a lot of control over who is in the dungeon with you. It is generally understood in the community that if you are not willing to tank as a warrior, you will never get into any 5 man without the tank's consent (though you can bring enough to a 5 man they might want you, see, for example, 5 man dungeon cleave grinding). 
---
In raids, there is huge competition for tanking weapons, but tanks generally get a lot of priority on loot, so getting geared as a raid main tank is not hard. 
---
But generally, if it's your first time: do not expect to main tank. Guilds are built around their main tank, and While you can work your way into that role, any guild that would accept you as a main tank with no experience is probably a terrible guild full of fail.
---
Had to check which sub I was in...
---
Much of it was speccs and not classes. "PVP is like Rock, paper, scissors". 
---
But Shadowpriest. When I saw shadowform my weak ass tauren shaman went the other way.
---
So is an Enhancement shaman being the lowest DPS in a raid.
---
I'm always down for a suggestion my dude!
---
Thing is you shouldn't have any healing problems in MC, pre-bis + MC healing loot is plenty to get you through MC and even BWL. It's more effecient for the raid to gear up DPS to increase kill speed than it is to buff a paladin who isn't going to have any mana problem regardless. Our guild gave the first couple mage blades to top casters then opened it up to paladins after.
---
God that new model looks hideous
---
Two main tanks, to swap aggro.
---
Depending on the fight, DPS warriors, paladins or druids could offtank.
---
Be careful that tanking in Vanilla wasn't what it is in BFA.
---
* soloing, even simple farm, was a pain in the ass.    
---
* respec wasnreally expensive, with an increasing cost.    
---
* in dungeon, aoe aggro was almost nil. You had to cc some mobs of the pack, then switch between mobs to increase your threat.      
---
* in raid, a lot of boss were'immune to taunt. Raising threat when you were the second main tank, therefore weren't hit that much, therefore weren't generating much rage, was hard.
---
So it was fun, but don't expect to be the juggernaut you are in BFA. You'll be much less able than a hunt kby yourself.
---
And as for the baby: Level up slowly, wow isn't going anywhere :)
---
I never played priest and locks but I'm very curious about these classes. I'll probably make a lock or a priest on Classic (But later, I'll make a mage first) !
---
Yes. Stupid question.
---
It's a newbie trap to think int/stam are important for raiding.      
---
        
---
The vast majority of your mana comes from buffs/consumables in any difficult raid fight for a healer. Having 1k extra starting mana makes very little difference to how effective you are as a healer.
---
It wasn't bad for sure. Flying tainted it for me, along with the needless attunements but that's just my altoholic perspective.
---
The kind of people that wants to be handsome ingame too. Also animations.
---
It's a possibility, we'll see for sure post launch.
---
 [https://sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com/)
---
They did really BG that much. Also when it was the thing to do for gear, people really prioritized it. Every abuse you can imagine got used to game the system. With AV I particularly remember the alliance would queue as 40 to pop a new AV and the Horde would trickle in and quickly be overwhelmed so they could end quickly and start another. My group got our WSG flag runs down to a science, and if we ended up in a preform vs preform we would specifically not want to have a long stalemate.
---
Yep that early to mid 40's grind seems to get me but the good thing is the dungeons are really good ie ZF and if you break through you can get into ST, BRD etc so there's some light at the end of the tunnel.
---
Pick a class and spec and stick with it. Try not to play every class and spec. There is a super good feeling logging into the game and have your friends whisper you knowing you are good at X and they need it. Becoming a well known X will get you far in both the content of the game and the fun level of the game.
---
i buy it from the shady kid in the internet cafe here in angola
---
Never said it was binary.  And one word responses aren’t typically conducive to good forum discussion.  Not sure why the specifics of my financial position are so drastically offensive to you.
---
1 month (and 18 days) before Classic
---
Warrior is most gear dependent, so if you are pretty geared and willing to go to raid with consumes, shouldn't be hard to get into a good guild.  Raid tanking is a hard role so if you take it seriously I think you wouldn't have a hard time finding a guild.  
---
Loot distribution depends on the guild, but even though fury warriors are good, I'd think most guilds would give priority to the tanks.
---
My response was to the question, 
---
"Why do you think casuals and noobs will quit? Classic won’t be just hardcore players. Classic will be a ton of fun no matter the type of player."  
---
WHY would I bring up any of the positives about leveling as a reason WHY people would be quit?
---
What retail mentality are you talking about? This is the wow classic sub .... ya know the WHOLE point is to get away from retail. 
---
Also when I talk about there not being INSTANT gratification I'm referring to the fact that CLASSIC wont have a "free level 60 boost with every new account" that everyone has grown accustomed to whether they like the (110) boost or not, you DONT have to put as much time into leveling. 
---
Those type of things just wont be in Classic and it will all take a TON of time. Those are the points I was making as to why NOOB players will Quit. 
---
Lastly If You Quit Reading Shitty Memes With Old Over Used Pictures Of Spongebob , Then Maybe Everything You Read Wouldn't Look Like A Meme.
---
And pvp rankings and items come out on phase 2. It will still be better and easier to spec healer for phase 1
---
Classic?
---
Oh I had never heard about the Eye of Shadow on Beta.
---
Is there a twitch clip or screenshot floating around of it??
---
Pallys are such beast healers that it just doesn't really matter in the early phases you can heal anything in pre-bis + some mana pots for chrom/nef. Then when ZG comes out you just spam that every 3 days for the hammer which is better than mageblade. That's why most people prio it to mages, it's just more efficient over a longer period of time to increase their dps than it is to give paladins a boost to healing.
---
Thank you so much for the info and the spreadsheet! It's a lot to take in (especially because I never played retail WoW, however I am very much hyped for Classic) but I'll get around.  
---
About that spreadsheet, you reminded me of something. Quests back then were different than today and didn't have marks or anything. How do I know if I missed any quests along my leveling experience? In MMOs I always like to do every quest and I'm afraid I'll accidentally miss one. I also heard that quests too low for your level won't even have a mark above the NPC's head, which makes matters worse.
---
Same thing happened to me... But I was the Paladin and a healer!
---
Use of the word really here is hilariously presumptive and assumes the maker of this video has some Ultra top-secret information that nobody else knows. I really doubt that LOL.
---
Fuck yes i would take the money.
---
No game is worth turning down 100k for.
---
Fuck, I would take 10k to never play Classic.
---
Does it include pservers? Cause if not I’d take the money and stick to them forever... if so well... idk.
---
Only once, but the haircut changed atleast once!
---
What is the best pet to level with?
---
Whats SR?
---
I known right 😅
---
It's relatively narrow, which funnels players through it. The white bear is just the pet I had.
---
Stonetalon is narrow and has a lot of trees and obstacles to hide behind, and the mountains on either side are good for eagle eye to get a birds eye view of things.
---
It was relaxing, not being able to be targeted. So much uptime and no corpse running.
---
Horde has outpost in the middle of it, so it'd suit a horde hunter more. 
---
This would be a really fun thing to do as a party of 5 hunters, roam around as a pack of 5 pets while you're relatively safe behind the guards.
---
Hell i did weeks back in vanilla now i would have a heart attack if i tried that again.
---
Thats it, Thank you.
---
Taurens can ride the ZG raptor and baron’s dead horse :)
---
Dps tanking was pretty much the norm for the latter half of vanilla, and from the looks of beta it will be even much more so from day 1 of Classic. Any good tank won't be stuck in any mindset though, they'll have a wep swap macro bound and will switch between dps tanking and defensive shield tanking fight to fight as needed.
---
Anyone else fail out freshman year because of wow 😌
---
Check logs. Any pally putting in their due diligence does just under the average hunter dps and exceed feral. For example, at Naxx the average parse for a hunter is 750 and a pally using world buffs can hit 780. Like I said, they have to put more effort in to achieve the same results.
---
The spreadsheet is the main quests I know, but imagine every quest for example and I miss one somewhere in a random location, until I find it must be a pain in the ass.  
---
I used to play with a 1280x720 resolution in Vanilla private servers to get that Classic feeling but that's as hardcore as it gets for me. I'm fine with quests without markers, I only really need an addon that has a list of all quests and the ones I've completed or not. Does Questie do that? :D
---
Not sure I never raid tanked, but I can't imagine it being too hard (I'm sure some hardcore tank will take offense to this).  Probably should be able to google a basic rotation.
---
Why not just put the song on repeat?
---
There is no way to keep older content objectively relevant, despite blizzards best efforts to do so by way of pets and pet battles, because some people just aren't interested in that stuff. Likewise, classic did not need to give us reasons to go out into the world, we chose to. And we could have chosen to go back out into that older content at any time, it's not Blizzard's fault that the longer we play their game the more we need to be handed rewards in order to feel accomplished.
---
Youngin... back in the 80s we rocked IBM PC Jr @ 3yrs old, DOS bootin' dat OS like a champ. Playing Tapper while drinking pop, runnin' from dat Alley Cat, lazor blastin' text-based Klingon ships in Star Trek.
---
God no.
---
I make enough at my full time job, I deserve my choice of entertainment.
---
That's awesome, you're like the boss of the raid group. How many tanks are usually there in a 40 man raid group btw?
---
&gt;Once ZG is out
---
BWL and Lok'amir will be out before ZG.
---
If you are reading this, we are an 18+ horde guild recruiting 3 enhancement shamans for semi-hardcore raiding when Classic launches. Message me for more details!
---
Cool guy here, I bet people love spending time with you!
---
I liked the attunements lol
---
Questie puts minimap exclamation marks for every quest in the game, at any range, that you can mouse over.
---
You do kind of have to be in the zone. for example, if I start a level 1 dwarf, I can't "see" the quests in say teldrassil. I have to go there.
---
but if you are in the zone and the map is "Revealed"? You can see any quest on the minimap, at any range, and when you mouse over it, it gives you a level and a description.
---
Don't worry. With layering you'll see a chest and watch it disappear as someone else you can't see loots it.
---
Not gonna lie, first part of your post, i was thinking... is this me?
---
After playing the beta i gotta say, the hype is real... it's not the same a part of the discovery is gone, cos we've all played it all before, but the forming of random bonds during a deadmines and then carrying it through to lvl 30.... that was real as fuck man, you're in for a treat all over again
---
Rogues and feral druids. Being able to disappear is crazy powerful and annoyed me to death. Literally.
---
Soft reserve, everyone reserves an item prior to going and when a soft reserved item drops only people with SR on it can roll for it. If an item drops that has no SR, it goes MS/OS+1.
---
This rewards people who are just running a raid for that one item, because then you are not rolling against everyone and their mother all the time. It lets loothorny alts still get shit because plenty of drops will have no SR, but keeps them awsy from rolling on most of the exclusive loot
---
Solo you have low dps but will be hard to kill as long as you have all mail gear and a good shield. Get a warrior friend. As a duo you will be very strong healing and adding damage to the warrior while also dropping grounding, tremor, earthbind, purging and throwing in frost/earth shocks. A shaman warrior team is very effective. This is how I ran in bgs without having to respec every week from resto. As long as you want to be support you can stay resto and have a lot of fun.
---
Ohh I understand now. Yeah it makes sense, Warriors regardless of their talent tree will always be somewhat good tanks and should take the lead in a 5 man dungeon.
---
True but I liked this middle ground. Still can’t wait for classic
---
Been watching a lot of frostadamus videos on YouTube.  Learned a ton from him. Going to be rich when I hit 60 this time!
---
I was placed on academic probation, but I turned that shit around real fast.
---
&gt;Otherwise its like purely granates and few POSSIBLY useful items.
---
Correct, but the mob mentality of this sub and only playing 1 way = it gets touted as the only profession to use.
---
While it's the "best" option for additional utility - it's not the only option. Same as races... are gnomes better than humans for mage? Sure... but there is zero chance I roll a gnome mage.
---
Does that mean I suck at pvp - good I don't care, I don't get paid to play world of warcraft classic. 
---
:)
---
Engineering would easily still be the best pvp profession in the game if the only item it gave you was iron grenade.
---
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PLAY CLASSIC WOW WITH A BABY!
---
Baby has no fine motor skills.
---
Baby will be worse than a keyboard turner/clicker.
---
Baby can't harvest mats for you.
---
Baby won't have your back in Stranglethorne Vale due the shocking lack of skill.
---
Baby will be too distracted by bright colors to make any meaningful progress in game and will hold you back.
---
Leave baby dancing on mailbox in Ironforge.
---
Do you think being a dedicated Off Tank for progression raiding will require the same time commitment as main tanking? 
---
I'm trying to decide on my role and I don't like being dps, so I'm thinking of rolling a healer, but I've been tanking for years and I love it, but I dear I don't have the time anymore :(
---
You can make faps with fishing and a level 10 alchemy alt
---
I try to sound like I’m smart and know shit but I’m just a stupid average joe haha
---
Yes silly. You're wrong in the head.
---
Yes and Lok'amir is extremely rare and everybody wants it. You won't have every paladin with Lok'amir after two months of BWL, but you most probably will have Hexxers on every paladin after two months of ZG.
---
AV is pretty easy. WSG and AB will take much longer. Ive seen some math that works out how many wins you need in AB and WSG. Works out to about 350.
---
There there, you don't have to think of yourself as a stupid Average Joe, self-esteem is important.
---
I hate Gnomes
---
To be clear, you don't actually have to tank every dungeon. It is perfectly normal, for you to say, dps, when the group is priest who doesn't want to dps, druid who doesn't even have cat form yet, and you. Congrats. You are dps now, while the druid tanks and the priest heals. 
---
But you do have to be OPEN to tanking.
---
Awesome! I guess I'll install it on the later stages of leveling and check if I missed some quests, thanks!  
---
Leveling as a Warrior will be hella hard though, as I've heard from everyone. I'll have a challenge ahead if I do run with it.
---
A really skilled hunter you get so used to crap and average hunters that when you come across a good one they stand out.
---
Phallic sword.
---
Lol dumbest thing I’ve read all day
---
They really played that much
---
Wanted to toss a reply and send some love your way. It sounds like you're making some incredible progress from where you were before and that's the most important thing. Address the past and present and keep your chin up, both for Classic and life as a whole to come. Hope to see you in the field soon. Lok'tar ogar or For the Alliance, however you may roll. The community will be together again soon!
---
Nice! I thought Vanilla tanking was only spamming Sunder Armor.
---
&gt;on a pserver
---
boom downvoted
---
That is not an exception to #1.
---
*laughs in mage*
---
Any alliance and warlocks. It's just wrong.
---
Ahh, ok. Thanks for explaining it.
---
haha does not make the gear look any better and the walk is even worse
---
Learning the dungeon and its mechanics always seems fun regardless of what you're playing! I'll definitely not know every shortcut, I've never played Retail WoW.
---
i challenge u to replace the vase with a classic box
---
Thanks for adding your feedback
---
I know all these words individually, but I have no idea what they mean in that constellation lol
---
Yeah... To each their own, with everyone "bragging", but even though I make about that (or more) yearly, I'd take the money. That's just an insane amount of money. To anyone who thinks it isn't, you've let lifestyle creep get ahold of you my friends. No game is worth that kind of money.
---
I'm not saying a decision for your happiness is wrong, as some of these responses are very good by explaining it'd be tough, but they value enjoyment more. It's the ones that come off snobby like 100k isn't much.
---
I actually disagree with you and I play Holy.
---
+ healing weapons are better than this weapon.
---
People wildly oversell crit on paladins.
---
no starup guild for any mmo i've ever played has survived launch
---
If claw is 25% of pets damage, then increasing that by 20%, only gets your pet's damage up to 105%. The 5% isn't that big.
---
You misspelled Heroin
---
By meeting people and getting to know people
---
Boo👎🏻
---
Ok, pick your pre-raid or early MC/Onyxia tanking weapon of choice, and I’ll “Prove it.”
---
Unfortunately there is a lot of miss information out there about crit.
---
+ healing is the most important stats.
---
A healing 1h is better than this weapon. 
---
Crit is overvalued heavily on a lot of guides.
---
PUG stands for "Pick Up Group".
---
Im always a little surprised by all the love BC gets. I hit 60 right before it was released so I hated it even before I downloaded it. But putting my personal anger aside, I just dont like Draenei and thr sci fi theme they come with for a game like WoW. I don't hate Blood Elves at all like I know some people do, but blue aliens are just too much for me.
---
EU or us?
---
If you don't know the people in advance it's a really bad idea. So unless if it's pserver players essentially I really wouldn't recommend it.
---
Man I made this exact same post like a month ago of my 10 hour live to win Spotify playlist and a mod removed it for “ not being related to classic”
---
What is Alterac Swiss named after...?
---
Every single one. Like Mages vs Warriors. Or priests vs warriors. Or warriors vs warriors. Damn warriors ruined warriors
---
No lmao, average DK player
---
Lmao what
---
As someone who plans on non world first hard core raiding, I would never ever join a guild before the game even launches. This does not apply to private server guilds though.
---
Fuck that, mage or warlock. Horde side only.
---
If not all can roll.
---
P.S. sod off hunters
---
Wrong sub mate
---
Really? Wow. It’s cool that you finally found out.
---
Pretty much this. Join a fresh community and have fun with it.
---
Fair, I thought fear ward was normalized in Classic but apparently that was BC or WOTLK. That’s the problem with all of this, is having to do so much from memory 13 years ago or scraps of data here and there.
---
A post like yours proves how much
---
 misinformation is out there about holy paladins.
---
Yes, and looking forward to play with you old guys ;)
---
I don't know how many times I can say that it's been tested. You can throw as much theory as you want out here but it's clear there are things you're not accounting for that make it proc often enough to be a non-issue.
---
Not in vanilla noob.
---
US EST
---
I've heard that leeway is does not apply when snared. If the shaman somehow is not snared and stuck within normal melee range but the enemy is, they do not suffer the leeway range increase.
---
Imagine being so sure of yourself that you’d type this. 
---
You can tell you’re not a hard core raider from a private server lol
---
Charlga Razorflank was a girl quillboar... or 'grillboar' if you will, complete with the tatas. But I don't know how widespread the female model for quillboar was in the outside world. There's *definitely* a distinct grillboar model as of BFA though.
---
Based off my experience on Nostalrius and other private servers, you're in for a blast from the past man.
---
It's not exactly the same, but I still found myself yearning to log in and chat with my friends. I reconnected with my childhood best friend and we talked about everything for hours. I made some wonderful new friends too.
---
It ain't the same, but it's as close as we will ever get.
---
They do as I've tanked with it and talked with multiple other tanks that have all come to the same conclusion.
---
You are incorrect and private server tanks that know their shit would say it is constantly procced.
---
2, 7 and 9 reporting in.
---
Now you just need one for the altoholic so I can add a fourth number to my list just like I'll be adding a new character to my roster every few weeks.
---
I started playing wow when I was, believe it or not, 6 years old. I played a week after vanilla was released lol. I don't remember much from it but I am looking forward to it.
---
Then just show us a better bis lol
---
 Oil don’t agree more, I wish they never made them :p
---
Wrath
---
Problem is in retail you can use all skills.
---
In retail outlaw cant use poisons from assassin tree or kidney shot from sub.
---
In classic you can equip more skills, even if you dont have dmg from them. Like fire mage using ice skilks, or reverse.
---
It’s for this reason that guilds should take it upon themselves to discourage heavy consumable use until in late aq and naxxreamas. 
---
I at least, will be spending the mc/ony/bwl/zg days stockpiling consumes to use in the last two raids.
---
I am somewhere between meme spec and old fart
---
I did the same thing.  Logged in, looked at the abilities, had a hearty laugh, and logged out waiting for Classic.
---
What other add-ons do you think are a must-have for Classic?
---
The pain of being caught up on both campaigns :(
---
I joined one pre launch and I'm glad i did, good guys and enjoyable to talk to.  We all plan on going hard week one so i should have some people to group with while leveling.  That said, if I get to 60 in a couple weeks and everyone else is going to take a couple months I will have no issues leaving.
---
Makes sense yeah.
---
Casual classic wow is still super fun. You will love it!
---
I had a played a little before that episode but South Park really made me get into it lol.
---
Wait for realm list and find one before launch
---
What exactly is involved in pretending it is still 2004?
---
If you are that hardcore into PvP alliance takes a huge steaming dump on horde.
---
It goes as follows:  
---
horde pugs &gt; alliance pugs
---
horde premades &gt; alliance pugs
---
alliance premade &gt; horde pugs
---
alliance premades &gt; horde premades
---
Being so hardcore, you always run with guildmates and it so happens that support holy paladins are the most OP class in classic WoW.
---
There is just no stopping them when properly supported by peeling R1 frost bolt spamming mages and BoFed warriors.
---
Thats supposed to be irony, thinking back on it, should have gone Demonhunter or Tauren paladin.
---
Moonfire
---
I was absolutely shocked when I first played vanilla on a private server a few weeks ago and saw that instead of a port that could take me to Darkshore, there was just... a wall. Why? Why would they just put a wall there? It makes no sense. Even without transportation, I imagine a beach or port would be highly profitable for the city.
---
Dwarves are bros, they just fell in with the wrong crowd when they were teenagers. I'll still chill and share some beers with 'em after the fight.
---
Gnomes... I mean, they can be a little irritating sometimes but I don't actually hate 'em. They're just too much fun to punt. They're welcome to join the dwarves and I for a drink afterward, though. Provided they can find their way back.
---
I got nothin' against humans or those who play 'em; you do you, boo. I just can't be bothered either way.
---
Elves, though. Elves, man. Doesn't matter the class. Or the preface. Night, high, blood; all useless.
---
The only good pointy-ears is one with tusks.
---
Yeah that's true, with ZG being on a 3 days reset. 
---
But ZG comes out phase 4, BWL phase 2, so I'd say when ZG is out you'll have roughly 5-6 months of BWL farming.
---
Not having the shaman melee rag
---
You do what's best for the situation. If there's ranged mobs or risk of pulling adds you ranged pull/LoS, often other times charging in is a far better way to initiate.   
---
If you're waiting on bloodrage and ranged pulling every pack you'll be slowed down a lot.
---
They said they were uncertain about what to do in that regard.
---
In general your spec doesn't really function until max level.
---
Starfire
---
Thanks for the quick reply! So then the two ally harbors to get to kalimdor are just menethil and booty bay?
---
I think he's bored.
---
I am for the most part as well, but a minor graphical upgrade that follows the exact same art style as the original game has absolutely no impact on game play.  It’s purely aesthetic and is hardly what I’d consider a change.  Furthermore, a toggle option means those that prefer old models have them, and those that prefer new models also have them.  Nobody is negatively impacted.  Finding all the people downvoting me for giving my opinion quite entertaining.
---
And whats a traffic light?  
---
Do the posts count? Do the pedestrian lights count?
---
Calm down, there, Satan.
---
Stormwind is a trash city

(This post brought to you by Ironforge gang)
---
* You don't talk about anything after the year 2004 unless you wanna predict.
---
* You listen to music from that time and nothing after.
---
* Pop culture references are from that time or before.

No other professions (almost) give BoP bonuses for pvp, so it is a obvious profession to use for pvpers. (Blacksmithing gives a trinket that has fear immunity for a while, I don't think it is anything else that is BoP except for tailoring robes and druid tank trinket from enchanting)
---
For pvp you can have hotkeys to change trinkets and change as soon as you see someone that it is useful against and engage slowly so it might be ready during the fight, especially in world pvp.
---
Helmets can be equipped while running around to have cd ready, the issue is that Rocket Helmet only have 15 stamina and Mind Control cap have 0 stamina, so losing some hp when swapping helmet if it isn't needed but since normal helmets have no use effect you get the bonus instantly when changing to your main helmet.
---
Can do the same thing with net/reflection trinkets, since you can instantly change them out of combat and get the bonus from non-use trinkets you don't lose anything from having them equipped.
---
No offense to whoever put these together... But guides like these really should not be in video format. Text or a spreadsheet is just way simpler and easier to reference.
---
But they can use Lok'amir, while druids can use claw of chromaggus or even Staff of Rampant Growth (forgot about this one), and priest have benediction anyway, so while absolutely a good weapon Jin'do's hammer will  be not that useful for a lot of raiding guilds.   
---
BWL comes out in phase 2, ZG in phase 4. That's a really big gap to farm BWL extensively.
---
Okay, only if blizzard states that we don't get banned for calling people names that were acceptable back then.
---
I always struggle between Druid and Shaman as my main choice.
---
Ironforge, which easily could have had an exit on the other side of the mountain, but instead makes everyone walk all through Dun Morough and around the mountain to get to the port
---
Why not?
---
Probably not, but it wouldn't hurt, even if it's a quest mousetrap
---
I will borrow this as I level my void elf and eat Cheesy Poofs. “MOM!!! Bathroom!”
---
Modern WoW has this thing where they try to make levelling as easy and boring as possible. So if you're level 90 yeah... have fun with that. But it doesn't really have anything to do with modern endgame (which is 99% of the game nowadays).
---
I know it’s ridiculous isn’t it! Graphic choices will not ruin the game but they will kick and scream about it anyway if given the chance.
---
None of that makes it objective.
---
U got me
---
Once consumables come into play (discussion wise) it's essentially a question of how 'pay to win' you will be (in the sense that consumables cost resources). Stuff like reflectors were better before 1.12.x (e.g. Frost Reflector onto freezing trap would trap the Hunter who placed it) but not really a massive selling point.
---
From memory, you could (as alliance) mind control cap the horde flag bearer (assuming not a druid in form) and cast blessing of protection on them, making them drop the flag. I might have a faulty recollection of this though so don't hold me to it.
---
Most engineering items have a chance to backfire in some way but putting that aside, engineering (having it as a profession) gives you 'option's that don't exist if you don't (engineer specific items). Fun (useful) items like Discombobulator Ray can be used by anyone (after being crafted by an engineer) but the same could be said for Free Action Potions and what not. Having the potential (because you're an engineer) to do something that would be impossible otherwise is what makes engineering shine, but in most cases (consumables) you need to be willing to go to that expense in the first place.
---
For non-consumables, stuff like Glimmering Mithril Insignia (Blacksmithing) more or less renders Warlocks/Priests harmless (in the sense they cannot fear you for 30 seconds, so you have 30 seconds to freely beat them down) but (like many items) you would have needed to plan ahead of time to get the most out of it.
---
If you're willing to throw money into consumables to win a fight (even if they're relatively cheap on a per-item basis) it simply becomes a question of how much money you're willing to throw into a fight.
---
That's a huge list, to be honest, and I am not the one to say, because I play on private servers, which is a fundamentally different client at this point. I don't actually know what will carry over.
---
You will want enemy cast bars, some sort of swing timer, some sort of decent dot timers. I really like an obvious warning to let you know when to renew battle shout (like weakauras). These are very important. 
---
Some sort of threat meter is incredibly helpful, as is a dps meter. 
---
I really like a unified bag mod, like onebag, and An action bar addon is great. Ideally, one like bartender is likely to do, that lets you keybind on mouseover (this was doable in wrath of the lich king and is almost certainly doable in retail, but I don't think you can do it in private server clients, so I don't know of an addon).
---
An auction house addon is very important, ideally with some sort of tooltip integration like informant (tells you the vendor price and auction house price of items in the tooltip).
---
Gatherer is also really handy, if you intend to take gathering skills, and I STRONGLY recommend you have a trade skill assistant of some kind, doubly so if you want a complex and difficult profession like blacksmithing. 
---
Also, atlasloot is very good, as it lets you horse trade much more effectively with other people if you know what THEY are in an instance for. Even if you already have yourself figured out. 
---
In short, there are a LOT. And I am sure I am missing many.
---
And you can see other rogues in the video using SnD and shitting on his damage. One dude not using it isn't the same as it not being public knowledge, especially when alt rogues were brought in because they were so good for the fight in general.
---
Well you said commission so I was assuming I would pay you
---
Lots of George Dubbya jokes, and talks about how they’ll literally write anybody a mortgage in today’s day and age I assume?
---
So, hypothetically, if you’re against a game letting you stack buffs that are so powerful that you can kill every boss in 10 seconds flat, that person is also against ANY buff stacking...?
---
🤔
---
That's a terrible point of view.  If it's BIS it's BIS and you should be in line to get one.  There's no reason not to get it even if you prio the mages first.  By your own admission there's nothing better.
---
Any guild with that attitude won’t leave BWL lol
---
This is actually super easy for me, and I can basically do this every night.
---
...
---
Oh.
---
Nice ad hominem
---
As a shaman who tanked wailing caverns, yes.
---
Dungeon and raid mechanics are generally more complex, but everything else? Nah.
---
Yeah exactly, I just don't think they've addressed this part of vanilla yet. You shouldn't be able to transfer from pve to pop servers.
---
Best to ask your group if someone knows the optimal way through then, that's what I did every time. Communicating with your group is key, most people should be happy to help.
---
I guess some are hardcore purists, and that's okay as well. And I kind of understand their point of view as well.. I mean, for many, including myself, character creation was a big part of the vanilla experience, especially since you could not alter his or hers appearance later on.. One took pride on how your character looked (Even though you had to wear some crazy color combinations, and even dresses for some fellow plateweares, until you obtained a complete armorset). Some wanted an attractive char, some a mean serious looking one and so on.. And with the same models you are sure you'll be percieved the same way by other players as well. I for one think humans in general and nelf males look far worse with the new retail models for as an example, especially their faces..
---
I was until I heard that dungeon grinding is an extremely viable way to level.
---
You will find me tanking ZF/BRD/ST/Scholo until 60 haha
---
oom
---
I'm pretty sure I soloed Princess as a Warlock at least once back in vanilla. I don't recall how I was geared at the time though.
---
Self-group, right? Prayer is only the caster's group?
---
No, no. You said that “MT healers are going to be priests and druids.” 
---
I never said paladins can’t raid heal, but was asking you to justify your point. As it’s widely understood that paladins do it best. 
---
Paladins are the best single target healers in the game. Priest and druids are better at raid healing (mass raid-wide damage) with HoTs and AoE healing.
---
Paladins can raid heal just fine - but they are better suited to Single target healing.
---
More like you get burned out at 40.  It helps tremendously to venture out for different sceneries.  Sithilis is a cool zone.
---
Because of the crit aura?
---
:D
---
*YEAH*
---
*WIN*
---
The grind between 25-32 is imo way worse.
---
It's not theory. It's just common sense. Good tanks are consistent and predictable. That trinket is neither when you're in a single-target situation.
---
If all you do is tank dungeons, if you don't use CC, and if you chain pull to keep the buff alive? Then Mark of the Chosen will come out ahead of the Smoking Heart. No need to level Enchanting if that's all you plan on tanking.
---
Shut up you gay retarded midget.
---
Skill-caps peaked in WOTLK, especially in PvP, and then started to go down after that. 
---
Nowadays (BFA) it's a joke. Even Asmongold achieved Gladiator.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cf7al6/world_buffs_are_not_an_exploit_skarmtank/
---
Look at all those people who agree! :)
---
w/e the loot rules, the rules for legendaries should be the same.
---
Shaman should get priority on the hand of ragnaros.  
---
The MT should get priority on TF.
---
Mages should get priority on atiesh.
---
Human
---
You have 'perception', which makes it pretty much impossible for other Rogues/Feral Druids to get the jump on you and getting 'jumped' with vanilla/classic health pools was absolutely devastating. You can substitute escape artist with a free-action potion (for the most part) but you're not going to be able to substitute 'perception', even with catseye goggles (via engineering). Quite frankly the PvP choice should be Human or Dwarf
---
+ Dwarf gets rid of bleeds/poisons (so is useful vs Warriors, Druids, Rogues, Undead Priests, etc.)
---
+ Human means you never lose an opener as long as you have some sort of situational awareness (i.e. pop perception and scout).
---
Rogues don't have Cloak of Shadows, Deadly Throw, Shiv (or various other invaluable quality of life things that were introduced in TBC) so getting opened on will generally ruin you much more than clearing one snare (which you can do yourself via free-action-potion).
---
The average player is definitely much, much better overall. To me and some in my friend group, wow was literally the first computer game we ever played. No one understood jack about shit.
---
EXACTLY! What if it's the overhead ones? Do the wires count?
---
Yeah, it felt awful because those were the nights the server was down a bunch and when you logged in you couldn't find a group, and all your plans were ruined and you ended up staring at a login screen and complaining on the forums for most of the time.
---
Itt's an exploit, and the only one that wants it in is the pirated server scum
---
Find a grind with max level benefits to alleviate the quest droughts. Felwood furbolgs for Timbermaw rep, WPL cauldrons for cloth &amp; Argent Dawn rep, etc. I usually grind out the last 6 or so levels on Azshara &amp; Felwood satyrs to help with crafting a good chunk of my pre-raid BiS.
---
Ungoro is probably my favorite vanilla zone
---
I think the problem is that Sithilis is the ONLY cool zone at that level (55-60), and you can maybe get 1-2 levels from it before you run out of good quests.
---
It does, but unfortunately many minmaxers are happy to waste anywhere between an hour to as much as a day of people's time just to have the raid take *maybe* 35 minutes shorter, and that's *if* your raid doesn't die to some dumb boss mechanic or to an opposing guilt who loves schadenfreude.
---
Got that along with a Gameboy Color for my 6th birthday as a matter of fact.
---
This is clearly a rogue sword so they can get extra poison dps.
---
I know just looking for a pun, it does seem pretty flat
---
Yeah that is usually what I do, although of course its going to be more difficult to get a group without LFG.
---
Oof
---
You're giving me PTSD.
---
It's anthrax time
---
I grinded through most of 55-60 back in early vanilla almost exclusively in Scholo. Never once saw Headmaster's Charge drop, but dinged 60 wearing mostly blues &amp; somewhere around Revered with the Argent Dawn. Going to miss not being able to tag along in a 10 man zerg as a super lowbie.
---
With just that tiny portion of the characters face I’m surprised you can even tell
---
I thought no 40-50 is bad, but after that it usually picks up for me.
---
I'm not advocating it's removal, but something as simple as making the buff come with a confirmation and removing the handin CD but setting a personal CD of 6 hours on accepting the buff makes it significantly less obnoxious. You can then log in just before, or play hours brfore the raid with no concerns. You aren't simply hit with the buff early passing through SW and log.
---
It's just not a fun mechanic as it currently stands, it's one of the warts you get from no changes warts and all and it's honestly surprising to see someone get so aggressively defensive over an element of bad game design.
---
To me this is like people who defend honor decay, sure it was in vanilla but it's objectively bad for the player. It being no changes doesn't make it a good element of the game, nor does the fact that you can opt to ignore it and only join casual guilds.
---
It creates communication between guilds, that's the upside to it. But it also creates toxicity when casual guilds drop it off schedule on a raid night.
---
I saw the title and said to myself “every single track better be Live to win”. Was not disappointed
---
Jordan is a liar, and he was fired for being incompetent.
---
Can't decide either, here are my thoughts:
---
All races can tank perfectly fine. There are 1000 different scenarios where one class is better than the other, gear varies heavily depending on encounter/progress/role/situation. 
---
Trolls:
---
Berserking is overhyped from private servers, people won't  be able to use /sit macro on boss pull and immediatly get all buffs from furyprot and be able to time it perfectly. Also you can be unlucky with avoidance and not drop to 40-50% health right away to fully benefit from it. Great for speedruns on private servers in BiS gear. On official servers during progression... I guess DPS can wait 4 seconds longer before unleashing the keyboard warrior. Also troll warriors look weird. 
---
Tauren:
---
5% hp is great, especially fully buffed. Everytime you drop below 5%, you can save your guild time+money+stress big time. Imagine something goes wrong and you save the day and everyones worldbuffs / consumables with that extra safety net.  Extra melee range is awesome, you don't want to chase mobs like a headless chicken. Has also potential for positioning, like you could abuse it on Ragnaros to avoid that knockback back in the day. Awesome look+weapon size.
---
Orcs:
---
Weaponskill, weaponskill, weaponskill. 
---
But sooner or later you will be equipping a sword. And you end up with a useless racial for the eternity of time. 
---
Conclusion: Play human.
---
If you are doing speedruns, play troll.
---
If you want an awesome racial during progression, play orc. Also great if you plan to do PvP/ wield Nightfall as offtank.
---
Otherwise tauren is a valid choice.
---
Class won't make or break a tank. Skarm mentioned he will play tauren tank. 
---
Probably will play as tauren too. If they add racechange, I might start out as orc.
---
Honestly wonder if there gonna use these models  or the old ones.
---
Depends how deep you want to go and how efficient you are at it.  But get DM buff, everyone just cycles through a completed instance.  Hearth to booty bay and get ZG buff, take a portal to SW and get onyxia buff then grab your faire buff.  You're basically at the basics of stacking.
---
And it's not going to be in until a year after the release of the game or something.
---
&gt;They could have easily made them unstackable, or countdown in real time, not only when you're offline.
---
which is exactly what they would have done, if they were being abused.
---
99 fishing is a bit worse in osrs.
---
I've sunk my time into osrs to bridge the gap for classic wow, and seeing 300 hours to hit lvl 60 has been eye opening for how long osrs takes.
---
Everything is gonna be so quick by comparison now :P
---
I hope so too!
---
I saw on Ah at some point but I bet some streamer has a clip, maybe start with payo since he seem to farm/play the most even after beta died
---
Yeah, I don't think people are logging off their character for a week.  And really it's just for people doing something like the DM buff, then log out as those are the most travel intensive then log yourself out at the ZG island to get the buff.  Portal to SW, get Onyxia and Faire buff and you're pretty much set.
---
Stamina isn't all that it does. Even if you exclude stamina value in that spreadsheet it still gives dodge and threat benefits that compete with Smoking Heart. And that's calculating it at \~78% of full value to account for proc downtime.

---
Eh, I don't like the isolation of content from the older world and future expansions.  Something that made WoW cool to me was how large the world felt.  That pretty much goes away when you're limited to 5 zones with relevant content in the new expansions.
---
Explain this? Because on the surface this makes no sense to me.
---
That's the fun part, the planning!
---
Will phase 1 not have quests that were in 1.12? If so, then yeah, the final 50-60 stretch will be tough.
---
If all the quests that were added throughout Vanilla are in, then it'll be no issue.
---
Except using Perception pops you out of stealth so in a Rogue vs Rogue matchup it doesn't do all that much
---
Where did you hear that? From my memory dungeons were never good xp/hr, unless you're talking about one full quest run. Did blizz announce something, or was this in beta?
---
Priests that are secretly shadow
---
until he responds ill just assume you are correct.
---
Your rotations suggest you think instant casts will interfere with auto shots, only multi/aimed shots do that. Maybe you are using a very old hunter timer that makes it look like that?
---
Throw some Steve Miller Band in there duude
---
How dare you!
---
I guess I’m in a minority. I play high DPI but very low sens. So when I’m mousing around on reddit, or moving items in my bag, my sens seems “high”. But when I’m pivoting my camera in wow, or doing a 180 in Apex, it’s nearly a full mouse pad of movement.

I basically try to emulate my my sensitivity from FPS games with my camera movement, but for everything else like targeting or auctioning, I can get away with barely moving my wrist.
---
Woa! Literally just finished that episode about an hour ago.
---
Human Prot Warrior? Same :D  
---
That's awesome man, having a reputation on the server (idk how it will be nowadays but I hope it's the same), probably getting all the gear too!  
---
I like it being more sophisticated, the more complex it is the better and more fun in the long run.  
---
But I presume you must have been in a semi-hardcore guild?
---
pirated scum likes ez mode
---
Does parry make next auto attack hit faster for mobs as well? If yes, being a healer will be morw challenging. Rolling enh nightfall shammy and holy priest, I love this thread
---
Play after 7-8pm when baby sleeps.
---
Pretty sure that's not gonna be allowed.
---
The party buff is better yes, but that's not all. They do substantially more damage, giving the weapon more potential, and it's just an overall better upgrade for them.
---
This is Atiesh in a Mage's hands:
---
* 32 Intellect
---
* 31 Stamina
---
* 24 Spirit
---
* 2% Spell Hit
---
* 150 Spell Power
---
* 2% Spell Crit to all Party members
---
This is Atiesh in a Warlock's hands:
---
* 29 Intellect
---
* 30 Stamina
---
* 2% Spell Crit
---
* 33 Spell Power to all Party members
---
This is Wraith Blade + Sapphiron's Left Eye:
---
+ 16 Intellect
---
+ 22 Stamina
---
+ 2% Spell Hit
---
+ 2% Spell Crit
---
+ 121 Spell Power
---
So to a Warlock, Atiesh is worth:
---
* 13 Intellect
---
* 8 Stamina
---
* 62 Spell Power
---
* -2% Spell Hit
---
And to a Mage, Atiesh is worth:
---
* 16 Intellect
---
* 9 Stamina
---
* 29 Spell Power
---
The lost 2% Spell Hit is worth more than 13 Intellect, 8 Stamina, and 62 Spell Power.
---
Right. It is a great trinket. But if your goal for your gear is to mitigate as much damage as possible (aka you want to wear a mitigation set), choosing that for the dodge and stamina benefits is questionable. If you topple over early in a fight wearing that trinket, well, shoulda worn the 2% dodge trinket (at least for warrior, not sure how 2% dodge compares to the armor scaling you get on HoTM)!
---
Yeah I mean if you're just looking at exp.  At  level 50 you can also start farming for bis pre raid items  which can be fun depending on your luck. Some of the dungeons have low drop rates on some really interesting items.  Which is killing 2 birds with 1 stone.  Gear for raids while leveling.
---
Watched an Paladin grind his way to a chest in wintergrasp. As he pulls last mid I destealth and loot chest then restealth. #JustRogueThings
---
The only thing I am dreading is the final month of waiting. The next 5 weeks are going to drag worse than levels 50-58.
---
Yes, most hybrid specs fall short because you usually have to sacrifice damage for utility and survivability. If you are really going into a hardcore PvE guild there isnt a choice. If you are casually raiding, do whatever you wabt.
---
&gt; It makes no sense to use them for progression.
---
that is literally what they were meant for....
---
Alliance is significantly more boring after 40 when youre done with SM
---
How's does that dress fit, healbit?
---
I get that, but I’m imagining the OP is a retail player, where shadow is a “viable” DPS spec (it’s not really anymore, but cata-legion it was a top contender in the right hands).
---
Also it was a joke.
---
Warriors have the largest weapon selection to pick from I believe besides maybe hunters. You can use basically anything.
---
Where else would it go?
---
Beta.  Search the sub or google for more information.  It was pretty well discussed during the initial phases.
---
lol that's kinda funny that the combat regent generates threat the same way as a passive self cast HoT would.
---
Nah, it's a common grammatical error.  You're still you.
---
Imo giving this to paladins is like giving BoA to a hunter. Sure it's "technically BiS", but it's a much bigger upgrade for casters.
---
And honestly I think the crit paladin thing is a bit of meme. Crit doesn't give much efficient healing, yes it gives mana by refunding crits, but when's the last fucking time you saw a pala oom?
---
Show me a log where your priests and druids did the majority of the raid healing using HoTs and AoE.     
---
     
---
Because that log will be one of vanilla healers playing their classes very poorly. If you need raid healing weak 12 second HoTs aren't going to help. Prayer is nice but it's very rare in Vanilla raid damage is evenly spread and the group can bunch up. Tranquillity is a terrible spell in vanilla rarely worth casting.
---
More comfortably than any piece of metal you'll ever strap to yourself, honey.
---
Don't rush it. Have fun.
---
Exactly. Got 80 base as a preparation, now time to maximise my time off!
---
Tobacco chew
---
Where’s the “Off” version?
---
So you are saying your officers aren't competent?
---
Wasn’t the point of the stress test to overload the servers? I’m sure on launch players will be more spread out on all the different servers (have they given a list yet?) as well as layering like you mentioned
---
I think only the Zul Gurub and maybe the ungoro ivory raptor.

Damn
---
Since getting the staff means you've cleared all content anyway, most guilds give it as a reward to a top guild contributor - regardless of class.
---
I hope so, I would probably leave a guild if they would give this to a holy pally first.
---
Got it. Miners of Bodom.
---
Combat isn't a terrible PvP spec. Once you get a decent dagger, you can go with a dagger-focused Combat build (15/31/5) that will allow you to do the usual rogue stuff (Ambush and Backstab) in PvP without gimping your PvE DPS potential. You obviously won't be able to do the gimmicky stuff that Cold Blood/Prep rogues can do, but you also won't be totally reliant on cooldowns to do anything.
---
It’s your rodeo, cowboy
---
It’s a bowl of Dinos
---
They literally had a toggle option in WoD (when these models were introduced), they removed this option in Legion iirc.
---
B. is completely false lol if you have a raider spot in a guild you'll for sure see both AQ and Naxx idk who told you that. They fall behind mages and locks but it aint THAT bad. And yeah if you don't want to spend 100g every week for respeccing hunter is the better choice, you can just play the standard 0/31/20 for both PvP and PVE.
---
Hmmm, years you say... I [might](https://i.imgur.com/M4wRBMy.jpg) have something going up tomorrow then...
---
Afaik, selling is the only illegal part of that scenario, and I’ve already had offers.
---
I think you missed the point. Paladins are better MT healers.
---
Since when does Perception break stealth in patch 1.12.x
---
&gt; [F: Perception (Human Racial) is now usable while stealthed](https://shadowpanther.net/roguechanges.htm). Patch 1.8.x
---
Did you mean nonaxe with Berserking?
---
If so, I disagree.  I’ll prove the math out, and you give me honest feedback on whether it makes sense or not. But first, give me a gear level range. What Axe vs. Non axe should I run the math on? An orc would most likely use Bone Slicing Hatchet pre raid (ignoring difficult to acquire world drops), they would use Deathbringer in MC/Onyxia gear, and the Nef Axe in BWL gear. Which tier and non-axe equivalent do you want to compare against?
---
A kid came over my house one time and asked me to play outside and do something, I remember vividly telling him, “It is inside play time for me today.” while I was playing WoW
---
Think he'd make a trip to North Dakota?
---
Eh. Rotations in Classic are more simple, but Classic has more abilities than BFA does, even if a lot are situational. I think when most people talk about complexity, it's more about the difficulty of raid content compared to vanilla - I haven't heard many compare PVP between the two.
---
It wasn’t allowed before, but was highly prevalent.  Why would this time be any different?
---
&gt;They've pretty much already figured it out on the Warrior discord that the pserver Fury tanks will still work. 
---
Did they now...  You see the thing is... They are idiots.
---
Same.
---
We also have revenge/ shield slam/ demo shout
---
A level one bank purely for storage, sticking stuff on AH and keeping my mains bags clear, and a level five for a bit more storage and disenchanting all the BOEs, infact I’ll likely get those two set up before I start my main, if I can resist the urge of getting stuck in instantly
---
Perfect for a snow day adventure too
---
No. That is the point,
---
Makes you wish they would crush your head between their thighs, don't lie.

A zoomers with a boomer heart. You're alright kid

There's already a tool for this: https://classictinker.com/flight-master/
---
For some it’s a lot harder to find guilds that do things at their playtimes.
---
Example: I don’t get online u til 9-9:30pm CST nightly. Most guilds I’ve seen posting start at 7 or 8pm. This has left me out of most.
---
Luckily I’ve found a group that plays my times and I’m taking this time to get to know them and stuff before getting into the grind. Makes the guild a lot more meshed and together on getting stuff done.
---
...so the next time you think it's hilarious to post a clip of someone that was *so bad* in AV, remember, they were probably eight years old and having a blast spamming consecrate on the Horde.
---
They people for it don't have a legitimate argument, so they just throw out a semantics red herring.   Whether or not you want to call it an exploit is irrelevant.   It shouldn't be allowed, because it breaks the game.
---
The idea of using the soul of a player, one YOU killed, to cast a spell is awesome lol.
---
In retail you press 2 buttons the whole day.
---
Yeah I mentioned the crit in my comment lol 
---
As for kill times you’re probably right for most people. 
---
My guild won’t let people raid without max engineering. I also mentioned that in my post too lol.
---
The dungeon route can be faster in certain level ranges, with certain group compositions if you have a dedicated group that are willing to spam the same dungeon for hours. They also do not do full clears after the quests are complete, instead farming mob dense sections, resetting and doing it over and over.
---
From memory it's not great xp/hr, but Winterspring is gorgeous.
---
You don't have to be such a douchbag about it, especially since they're right about it being the bis weapon for holy pally in phase 1. You're arguing something different but you aren't even explaining what exactly you're arguing (which is if it's a big enough upgrade to give to a pally over a caster dps)
---
facts
---
WTF do you call  50% raid dps and 30% raid health other than exploit?  What other term is there for it?
---
Hey, good tunes are good tunes
---
World buffs aren't an exploit but are just way too powerful, I've been in guilds that clear Naxxramas in a few hours once world buffs are allowed to be used.
---
People see the Illumination talent and their instinct is to go *OMG crit = infinite mana!* forgetting the fact that Paladin is already the most mana efficient healer in the game.
---
Mana isn't the main issue for holy paladins, it's throughput. The only way you can consistently improve throughput is to stack bonus healing. There just isn't enough crit on gear to make crit paladin achieve anywhere close to the same HPS as +healing stacking paladin.
---
If you're going OOM it's not because of your gear, it's because something else went wrong.
---
This^ and also no mount.
---
Not by design
---
I knew the meme spec gif was gonna be crazy but I was not prepared. Almost gagged on my sidecar (the one with booze not wheels).
---
The post talks about it being a Paladin weapon. It’s not. 
---
If you want to debate something else that’s on you lol. 
---
Again this is not a Paladin weapon.
---
I’ll never stop being a douche bag to a douche bag lol
---
Grinding quests is one of the main ways you will level up. They added more quests to various towns and hubs and other areas in the different zones after the original game launched with certain content updates. Having more quests to pickup as you move through the zones leveling in your journey will end up giving you more exp for doing them. The thing that takes the longest in old wow is basically traveling. Sticking in leveling zones and clearing out every quest you can will help you reach 60 faster than trying move into each new zone as soon as you can and meet the minimum level requirement. The bulk amount of exp you get for quest rewards is well worth the few minutes that they take to finish.
---
2.4 WAS the highest rated in my Battlegroup rating inflation startet with WOTLK......so 2400 back then was 3k now
---
Let me guess, you think ragnaros wont die within 7 days?
---
With how the mobpathing works in the world I assume the boss pathing will work like expected. In teldrassil for example you can abuse roots and trees to force mobs to go on weird paths (they basically never reach you). 
---
They can however apply custom fixes to the boss so who knows if it will work.
---
Yea TBC put me into probation
---
Took this long to get someone who knows what they’re talking about to back me up lol. 
---
Thanks man, this sub is crazy lol
---
When choosing a class vannish seems awesome with kids. If you need to afk fast it's a perfect out.  With only some failure. I won't roll alliance at all so I don't know what to do.
---
2 for me. That’s where it started, and that’s where it stayed, until from my bars it was untimely ripped.
---
It's possible, but unlikely.  You would almost certainly need multiple people playing the characters, and even more farming mats.
---
We will clear it in five. Quote me on it.
---
If you're already comfortably rich I dont see why you wouldn't. For some people 100k wouldnt mean much, for others it would mean a lot.
---
This document does a LOT to prove my point. Look at the weapons and look at the Prot threat column as a baseline, since everyone is so “threat is all that matters” about everything.
---
Chromatically Tempered Sword has a value of 581.3, and is considered better than Edge of Chaps which has a value of 565.6. Look at the racial tab. The orc Axe bonus adds 115.4, so edge of Chaos in the hands of an Orc Prot Warrior is now valued at 681, making it the best horde tank weapon until mid Naxx. Better than AQR, conventionally considered to be a “better tank weapon”.  Weapon skill is a BIG GAME.
---
rofl
---
So who will make consumables, or ony cloak, cloak of the wild, lionhearted helm?
---
Sorry I modified my comment while you were responding, it was a little too harsh imo and I shouldn't have called you a douchbag
---
You don't *need* to win AB. You got rep ticks at certain resource amounts. I would just guard stables on my shadowmelded warrior and hope the rest of the team could take care of the rest. Easy rep for the amount of effort required.
---
Yea I did lots of questing there in my 50s lol loved that place. It’s like azeroth’s own jurassic park.
---
I don’t understand.
---
Do you think Engineering takes up two professions?
---
Yep, pug dungeons runs are not efficient at all. First there's the waiting for everyone to show up at the dungeon, which can easily take 30 minutes or more depending on where everyone is. Then there are the people who make the dungeon runs take longer than they should because they don't know how to optimally play their class. You also won't be squeezing every last bit of XP out of an dungeon by killing every mob. You'll mostly be taking the fasted route to each boss, sometimes skipping bosses to get to the last boss as quickly as possible. Then the group will disband and you'll have to spend time sending tells so you can refill the group and start this whole process again.
---
That said, I spend most of my time doing dungeons in vanilla because I find it much less boring than grinding mobs and questing. Just don't expect to be one of the first to level 60 you go this route.
---
Thanks
---
Yes, who do you think set that record?
---
Ah gotcha, no worries! 
---
Thank you for responding &lt;3

Flying. Sure, it was awesome at the time and I love a lot of those mounts, but it killed World PvP and my old means of exploring. Flying made the world feel small. I'm not keen on the megaserver thing I think the servers share now? People phasing in and out... Dailies are fine, in *moderation*. A daily grind to unlock another daily grind killed the game for me. Give me an extra max level zone I can work through, toss in a few dailies at the end but leave it at that. Don't make the entire end game for max levels be dailies.
---
who gives a shit?
---
O my bad - thought most of those professions would want to gather as well.
---
Is scholo doable pre 60?  I remember that place being a wipe fest
