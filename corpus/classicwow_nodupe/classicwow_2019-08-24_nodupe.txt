Don't worry, as a fury warrior you won't have to try very hard at all.

Oh for sure it's a great area with a nice vibe to it, beautiful flat lands with nothing in sight except for endless salty flats with basilisks, vultures and scorpions. Can't wait to find those pesky venom sac's again to be honest :D

Not if you haven‚Äôt subbed

It won't end. There will be a few restarts.. But you can log in and create a char all weekend. Monday morning you can start making 10 chars per realm, up to 50 total

Any class that uses PoD would be the most expensive at 39, and probably hunters after them for Shadowforge Bushmaster.

It happens here because people have been tired of retail for almost 10 years now or more.  This isn't a competition, if people felt like it was a competition we wouldn't have been saying that we think retail is shit for the last decade or more, but instead just started doing so.  The reason you are hearing it now is because we aren't being downvoted like over on /r/wow where if you whisper of hating some features like raid finder and wish it were removed we would be badgered for asking to remove the QoL changes.
---
We had a wall of no posted for christ sake when we asked for the version of the game we desired more because we disliked retail *so* much.  Retailers made fun of the idea of classic and would always just tell us to quit if we didn't like the game.  
---
Now that we have the game we want, whenever I hear someone come in and ask for stuff like transmog or balance changes or guild banks.. you bet your ass I'm going to shit on any retail-esq idea.  This isn't a competition for me idgaf if retail has 10million players and classic has 10k... keep the retail shit over on retail because it ruined the game for many of us.
---
i dont believe these will be available phase 1
---
Yes but in FFXIV you also have those people that refuse to listen when you try and help them (theres a reason "YOU DON'T PAY MY SUB" became a thing). I love FFXIV's community overall, but sometimes... Had a healer fairly recently who would literally just spam their Medica/Medica 2 outside the range of everyone and we would die from guaranteed damage and would get upset when we call her on it. After about 3 wipes on the same boss we were like can you at least stand close enough to us to hit us with those spells if that is all you're going to do. She would literally run to one corner and spam those 2 spells and miss everyone while we were doing mechanics of the boss. Was frustrating but we tried dealing with it. Eventually she got mad at us and called us jerks (we never were RUDE we just tried to teach her) and we got a replacement healer and finished the dungeon without any issues at all... Sometimes people just don't want/care to learn or try :|

I don't think they're as bad until you realize the first image is the current images and the second is the older ones. It's such a downgrade in quality and personality.

Yes, but remember you're limited to 3 characters total per account until it actually launches.

The classiclfg (aka CallToArms in actual vanilla/pservers) addon makes searching for a group easier as it parses the chat and alerts the user that someone is forming a specific dungeon group. On the other hand, if you want to make a group it posts in the public chat channels for you. If you believe anything else, I feel sorry for you.
---
thanks for fix and update
---
Took me about a day to figure this one out.
---
Can I get a link to this addon? I was searching for it recently and didn't manage to find it.
---
[removed]
---
I mean, I don't think it's truly in the spirit of classic.
---
Which is why I won't use it.
---
Others will likely have an improved classic experience because of it, and that's what it's all about.
---
Maybe. I was on a full server and it was not used (the same server as Leeroy to give you an idea lol)
---
I have a feeling it might have been popular mostly on a specific server or three, but unknown on most others. It'd almost have to be the case for it to have worked well with enough people to see benefits while still having so few downloads.
---
I agree that the classic servers will have a lot of people using an LFG addon.
---
Medium is more players than a full server in Vanilla. I'm sure its fine.

Paladin is not a nightmare to level, if you genuinely believe any class with self healing and an immunity bubble is a "nightmare" to level then there's something wrong with you.
---
Paladin leveling is boring, it's not slow nor painful, it's just boring.
---
I'm in this boat. I subbed, and then did some testing on a private server.
---
Almost every single time a large game developer has had the best modders in the community run a game release by themselves it's an absolute shit show.
---
before i got in a melee cleave group i was going to multibox warlocks and a paladin just so i didnt need to level as ret lol

I just want a Teebu.

This is retarded and the reason why Reddit can't be used to dictate anything.

Don't. Just 70 more hours. You can endure through this. You can.

Isnt 0.5 just a catch-up tier? If you raid you dont need it.

Don't worry they'll coax you in with a free polar bear cub pet at the tail end of BC, next thing you know you'll be drinking verification cans of mountain dew.

Manually adding them is super easy. I've never trusted any of the "apps" that do it for you.
---
But then you get down to ‚Äú/who level 50 night elf priest feralas‚Äù and suddenly it doesn‚Äôt matter that it only returns 50. That‚Äôs how the census addon works.

Shitty stuff my dude. I‚Äôm not looking at classic as the ‚Äòsaviour‚Äô but man, am I ever looking forward to it.

"the 11th of october" and "october 11th" are used interchangeably though...

you ever heard "the fourth of july"?
---
What are these archaic relics? Some sort of primitive storage device?

Not a personal fan of the talent path for leveling but otherwise this is outstanding!
---
Great work!
---
Never, I believe the negatives far outweigh the only benefit of "style"
---
Others will be able to answer more in depth, but long story short.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
a) It is the fastest class to level.
---
b) it has probably lowest raid dmg but certain abilities make it an essential companion in a raid.
---
c) it is very easy to play, but mastering it is very difficult.
---
I downvoted before reading the post. I also kept the downvote after realizing what it was for.
---
Enpass. It‚Äôs a password manager! It remembers and can create random passwords for you!
---
Sure, it is less punishing, but it can be very punishing depending on the dungeon.
---
Can you imagine getting a replacement in sunken temple? There are so many elites outside they will never make it in alone.
---
Scarlet monastery as ally? It is located in buttfuck - nowhere and most people won't even have a mount at this point. Dire maul is similarly remote.
---
This is of course moot if you have a warlock, but even then you have to run outside to port people in, risking fighting re spawns and PvP.
---
Yes, absolutely.  You'll see a guy killing the same mobs as you and you send him an invite.  Once you say I have x left and they respond, you ask "Do you have this quest", next thing you know you're running a bunch of quests together
---
True, I'm sure encryption can be done if you really wanted.
---
great post, thanks. i played vanilla but never used a Call to Arms add-on, and this clears a lot of things up for me
---
i agree that this is not a problem at all and a total non-issue. classic release will probably come and go and people will forget all about this silly "controversy" by next tuesday

How does it work with the skill tree when you swap weapons like that? Do i go points in both arms and prot with more focus on the prior?
---
You're going to be spammed with people inviting you to a group.  So, nope.  No problem.
---
I personally hope they unfuck retail and make it like classic again. There are some changes I will eventually want like improved graphics and the ability to use different mounts for tauren.
---
I can't get those in a #nochanges wow classic, but retail blows.
---
&gt;Will I have to be a GM and/or a raid leader to even get a spot anywhere?
---
Definitely not. In pretty much every MMO, tanks are always the role with the highest demand.
---
&gt; I know if I mess up just once in a rotation that I could cause everyone to wipe
---
This definitely is not the case in lower level dungeons, it might cause a bit of chaos, but with more experience you'll be able to regain control relatively quickly or prevent it from happening in the first place.
---
&gt; I just hope people are a bit more forgiving early on in dungeons as i'm learning it all
---
As long as you let them know you're relatively knew ahead of time, people are generally fairly understanding. Depending on the situation, tell them it's your first time tanking, first time doing a specific dungeon/boss, or that you've only done the instance a few times. Most groups are just thankful that they found a tank.
---
A couple small tips I'll give:
---
* ALWAYS use revenge when you can. It's your highest threat generating move and it only costs 5 rage. The final protection tree talent, Shield Slam, generates more threat but also costs 20 rage.
---
* When pulling a pack of mobs, make sure the group is on the same page about what mob is the focus kill priority and what mob(s) are CC priority. This can be done with raid icons, or if your group is experienced with that dungeon, it might be understood what the priorities are. Also note that this isn't mandatory to clear a dungeon, but it can help a rough dungeon run go smoother.
---
* Remaining on the subject of mob packs, make sure you hit as many as you can with a Demo shout and then focus revenges on the main kill target until it's about to die. Demo shout generates a bit of threat which prevents your healer from pulling aggro.
---
* If your healer (or whoever) does pull aggro, and the mob isn't close to death, taunt it! After you taunt the mob, make sure to use an ability or two on it, otherwise the mob will most likely go back to attacking the person that initially aggro'd it
---
Mate, I don't even have/know what e-mails I would have used!
---
Consecration is a holy talent. You only had 2 Buttons, seal and judge, 8sec cd and if you "spammed" it you went oom. At higher level killing a mob literally takes 20-30 sec.
---
The proc rate of clearcasting was waaaaaaay off on private servers and that might influence these guides. Without that not sure how you can compete with the mana efficiency of frost or AoE grinding.
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
I shed a tear in solidarity for this. Undead or troll priest or maybe an orc warlock. Or maybe an undead warlock. Undead my favourite race but trolls be flippin out mon and orc warlocks makes me feel like Gul'Dan. Life is easier than WoW.

In addition, stir fries are easy to cook and heat up in the microwave well if you didn‚Äôt want to skillet to heat it up. My favorite quick recipe is below.
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
---
**Emergency Protein with Curry &amp; Cabbage**
---
Recipe from the Nom Nom Paleo‚Ñ¢ app
---
Makes : 4 Servings
---
Hands-On Time : 15 min
---
Total Time : 15 min
---
The idea behind emergency protein (a.k.a. garbage stir-fry) is to quickly cook up whatever protein and vegetables you have lingering in the fridge. Ground meat is budget-friendly and perfect for stir-frying, and with some vegetables and spices, you'll soon have a big batch of food that you can shovel into your mouth whenever necessary.
---
**Ingredients:**
---
* 1 pound ground meat (venison, beef, pork, or lamb)
---
* 1 tablespoon Ghee or fat of choice
---
* ¬Ω large onion, diced
---
* 2 teaspoons Madras curry powder or seasoning of choice
---
* kosher salt
---
* Freshly-ground black pepper
---
* 2 cups roughly chopped cabbage or bite-sized fresh or frozen vegetables of your choice
---
* Juice from ¬Ω lime or a splash of vinegar
---
**Preparation Steps:**
---
* If your meat's still frozen, submerge it in hot tap water for 15 minutes or until it's thawed. [1 lb ground meat]
---
* Heat your cooking oil of choice in a large cast iron skillet. [1 T Ghee or fat of choice]
---
* Cook the onions until they're soft and translucent. [¬Ω large onion, diced]
---
* Add the ground meat to the onions in the skillet.
---
* Break it up with a wooden spoon, and‚Ä¶
---
Stir fry until the pink's gone.
---
* Sprinkle the curry powder on the ingredients, season with the salt and pepper to taste, and stir to incorporate. [2 tsp Madras curry powder salt pepper]
---
* Throw in the cabbage, and‚Ä¶ [¬Ω small cabbage, roughly chopped]
---
* Cover and cook for 2 minutes or until the cabbage softens.
---
* Taste and adjust the seasonings as desired.
---
Add a spritz of lime juice, and‚Ä¶ [juice from ¬Ω lime]
---
* Plate it up. This recipe calls for curry and cabbage, but it can be endlessly modified, so feel free to improvise. Just sample the food while you cook, and stop seasoning when it tastes right.

I head the average /played till level 60 is 8 days, or 192 hours, I hope we don't lose a ton of people on the way
---
Hid the names on the messages so this would t become recruitment for them
---
Nightmare? Far from..they basically have zero downtime. You just keep killing whereas warriors have to take good breaks after every other mob. Paladin is *easy* to level. It‚Äôs just slower and less engaging than pretty much every other class.
---
What server are you playing on? If you want dm me and we can see about playing together if you'd want. I'm always looking for more peeps to play with.
---
Maybe I want to dress better than a hobo...
---
Yeah, I quit in Wrath and I felt like the game had a satisfying sendoff this way.  The lich king was destroyed, I was happy, and my rogue went to sleep with his blades plenty bloody from PvP.
---
That said, bring on Classic baby.
---
There are still people in the WoW subreddit with that mentality...
---
Most obvious cosplay ever?
---
lol dude, my last guild once 1-shot Twin Emps, and then did an Ony that same night and wiped twice because of overzealous DPS.
---
None of them will be needed for the first 3-7 days at least. I would wait and let others be the beta testers and then get the mods people are suggesting after a week.
---
This way you also get to experience classic with no mods like it was back in the early days.
---
This, and it seems like the Danes and Norwegians are going to Firemaw instead.
---
That's bullshit and you know it. Most classes don't even have AoE at that level. 
---
When did you last level in BFA, I've leveled 3 characters from 0 to 120 in the past four months. It's certainly easy but pulling 30 things or anything more than 3 on most classes? hell no.

---
that boy ain't right
---
I waited outside in the cold for 3 hours at a Seattle, WA area mall for the WotLK launch with hundreds of other nerds.  Lots of good natured ribbing between horde and alliance players. Was a lot of fun.
---
I'm sorry but that video is pretty terrible. It's a nice little tip for niche situation but by no means a necessity.
---
This isn't exclusively a warrior thing, but know that they are certainly the most gear dependent while leveling, but even more so than that, mobs are dangerous. Often times aggroing an extra mob can be really dangerous if you don't have some cooldowns or potions handy. Just play smart. Sometimes it might mean you have to use a ranged weapon to pull a mob rather than charging in there.
---
One last piece of advice I'll give for leveling: initiate the fight on mobs with Demoralizing shout. Depending on the mobs level and your rank of Demo shout, this can reduce a mob's melee attack by 15-30%. Also, Spirit is secretly the most amazing stat on warriors while leveling. Your Health regen while out of combat becomes ludicrous. Bear in mind that it won't really help you with tanking dungeons, so having secondary gear for tanking would probably be a good idea, but don't sweat it if you can't find anything suitable.
---
Hopefully all of this conflicting and varied advice isn't overwhelming. As long as you're willing to learn, you'll do fine!
---
look how retail gone ''family friendly''....
---
especially kids love family friendly content, don't they people?
---
More content like this please :)
---

---
This person replying is a support rep, the best support that person can do is forward it to another department if that is even an option. "Hey it's something we'll look into" is customer support lingo for that message is going into the void of other customer comments and feedback. The rep saying that has about as much weight behind it as cashier at a supermarket saying it.
---
I'm going to refuse anyone that uses that addon from my group on the principal that its a fucking bot talking to me and not a real person.
---
Good movie to me but not entirely accurate if I remember correctly.
---
Sorry, I already bubbled the warrior after he pulled, threw a renew on him, and mindblasted the boss. What did you say?
---
Imagine having to make the stupid unoriginal joke every time anything is 3 days away from release because you can't be excited without jerking eachother off with shitty repetitive memes.

It's hilarious because in a few days after making their character they are just gonna want to switch again

yeah i guess i hope he maybe takes it a bit more casual then if he wants too

[ClassicLFG](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg)
---
Features that are included.
---
* Groups created using ClassicLFG are visible to all players using it on the Realm.
---
* When looking for people it will periodically write in a public channel of your choice to make people without the Addon aware of the group.
---
* The Addon automatically parses all chat messages and lists them as groups to queue up (even across layers!) Note: If you apply for such a group it will whisper the leader of the group with the message that you provide
---
Features that will NOT be included:
---
* Automatic group matchmaking
---
* ILvL restrictions to groups
---
Hey man, my pet can tank better than you, get that through your head.
---
Haha i was thinking the same
---
Yep, it pretty much never worked. People still used LFG chat for group forming. It was a taste of things to come. The shared horde/alliance city in tbc was also lame, as well as flying mounts...no longer could you be waylayed en route and forced to wpvp. You just flew over all boundaries and un-immersed yourself from the world. The raids and dungeons were pretty sweet, but nothing touches classic. Something about the 1-60 process makes classic wonderful. You can always level an alt and experience this long, drastic journey from 1-60. You may run into a 60 in certain zones, but generally you‚Äôll be unimpeded and have a really fun experience. None of the expansions were able to capture it.
---
They aren't top tier, or even second tier usually, in any area except niche PVP stuff like duels and flag carrying, so people think they are "bad".
---
The inconvenience of spamming trade looking for people IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART of classic socialization. It's the very 1st step in a chain of interactions that is vital for a healthy community. 
---
The inconvenience of doing this forces you to be nicer to people and be more forgiving because it's easier to struggle a bit with a noob then go back to town and find someone new. 
---
When you finally get that group together you feel more satisfied and excited to go dungeon/raid. 
---
Because it was so annoying to build this group your now willing to stick together and run more dungeons while you have the full group. 
---
And because your sticking together your getting to know each other more, and then bam! You fill out your friends list with reliable players and fun people to be around. 
---
Naturally you'll end up guilding up with these people that you have invested time with and build long term relationships together.
---
[Field Guide](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/fieldguide) :\^)
---
I'd recommend the same.
---
It's pretty interesting comparing that video to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTE2o79lgg)
---
Fair enough. I‚Äôm rolling on one of the lower pop servers because I think they will fill. 
---
*As a contingency* I expect Blizzard to allow me to transfer servers if that doesn‚Äôt end up coming to fruition.
---
I think you could condense the basics to "How little can I get away with casting to stay at the top of the threat meter"
---
The main thing I've found playing Protadin is to find that sweet spot of using the minimum mana + abilities to stay a comfortable distance at the top of the threat meter.
---
Holy shield is a fantastic low cost ability, you can comfortably keep rank 1 without your mana bar dropping. The mistake people make is using anything other than rank 1, which should only be done if you really need the threat/mitigation. Even with blue gear you can keep R1 up for most fights without needing to drink regularly.
---
Mostly agree with your other stuff and appreciate it being put together for people that want to give Protadin a try. Resources are pretty lacking so always a good thing to have more stuff out there.
---
Good luck making that distinction :)
---
&gt;How about this. Instead of removing useful addons, Blizzard makes a handful of servers for the people who are 1) over the age of thirty five, 2) at least moderately obese, 3) have shit for a life other than wow
---
need 2, because asmons fanbase will already fill one of them
---
more like repost famous
---
I got all of that from the beta like I said? These are known things mate you been living under a rock or something?
---
Sharding, itemization, skeletons, no armorless mounts
---
That‚Äôs actually the best way I‚Äôve seen anyone put it. 
---
Now I‚Äôm not quite so sure I‚Äôm rolling an Undead Lock! Haha back to thinking again!
---
Thanks :P
---
Thanks.  I have listened to this over 9000 times and I never realized until you posted this that he calls out the wrong side for the *many whelps*.
---
&gt; Odd groups got left
---
&gt; Whelps, left side! Even side! Many whelps!
---
No, your auto attacks aren't how you generate threat as a tank. Defensive stance, heroic strike, sunder armor, and revenge build aggro faster than auto attacks with a two hander. 
---
You can still use some of those abilities with a 2hander, but I don't think you'll build more aggro than a 1h and shield warrior of the same spec. Not until you've got some BiS DPS gear, at least.
---
Because it's not worth paying $7.50 just to reserve a name that I won't even get, on a server I probably won't even play on.
---
I remember seeing a crappy orc model in a gaming magazine in the early stages. I thought it was going to be the coolest thing ever. I was wrong though, it was the best.
---
Sam I will personally castrate u
---
All of these are incredible works of art. I love the effort you put into these. With that said arcane isn't a spec you really do anything with. You almost always dip into it in pve and pvp but full arcane is below average in all aspects. The private servers have skewed these guides you find online. Frost is the best leveling spec, fire is passable. Frost and fire are good for dungeons. Frost is the best in pvp and fire variants are passable and very fun with good burst. And as you pointed out frost is what you start to raid in but you swap to fire.
---
Never played vanilla eh? It's fine, just 3 more days.
---
Ah yes, more alarmism. Did you learn this on the MSM when they sold you lies about climate? Russia? Racism?
---
Yea, why not? I mean, the two I can think of specifically were unemployed. One retired, one disabled. I would imagine a large portion of that time was spent afk, but that still counts, right?
---
Not sure why I‚Äôm being down voted for sharing an anecdote lol
---
If they got it done in that little time I guess it wasn't near as impossible as they always swore it would be.
---
Yea I would like one for priest too. :)
---
Commas and quotations would‚Äôve made my brain not hurt. Ty.
---
Not anymore. Guild I was in for years disbanded, mutually of course. And nothing really besides perks, since they implemented cross-realm capabilities people can raid with whom ever they want to. Classic makes guilds super relevant again.

They would probably push away more people than what it's worth to them. Best option would be to re-release TBC while retaining classic. "It would separate the players even more" is a common but weak argument against doing that.

Retail's benefit is that it's *expected* to change. A lot of people still enjoy it despite what you'd gather from this sub. People who quit classic have no real reason to ever come back after naxx. People who quit retail will most likely at least try the newest xpac.

I went into this 15 years ago because a friend told me to play, but never played any RPG.  sometimes there can be moments that are overwhelming, or even scary that you are going to die, and you will die, and you will make mistakes. But after everything you overcome, and all of your individual levels and talents add up, you just feel good about your progress. 
---
Vanilla wow rewards this feeling of tiny accomplishments of additional power without eventually being game breakingly powerful than any other game I have ever played.
---
My advice is to take nobody's advice on class or race, and just do what you think is awesome - because at the end of the day their is not a wrong choice for either.
---
1.12 had already seen that balancing as well as the talent updates.  Arms is PVP at best.

Lol no, you are not the only one.

So, when the free server transfers to Korgath opened, I was among the people to make the move. Death and Taxes also made the move. I actually signed their guild charter on Korgath, and then like 10 minutes after the guild was formed I was kicked lol.

Detecting automated input like that is mostly likely incorporated in any anti-bot detection they might have.

"I got all of that from the beta" is not proof, again, it's just you typing whatever random shit you want. In fact there's been multiple times that Blizzard confirmed that the math around things like dungeon mobs and exp and elite mob damage are exactly the same as classic on the forums.

Alright I didn't want to respond to a troll but people are upvoting it so...you think 4% reduced physical damage from frost warding is worse than casting a frostbolt 6% faster when you are AoE farming then I don't know what to tell you other than you are stupid. And 80% frost crit damage is better than 40% crit against frozen targets...end of story...you can crit at any point whereas shatter is only going to affect 1 or 2 spells. So please go troll somewhere else :)
---
Regulation as in preventing frequent server hopping there is definitely merit to.  Perhaps a cost to transfer should be a part of that.  But it definitely only costs a fraction of a cent to transfer a character in terms of computing power and network activity.

Are you also going to refuse dps meters too? Because they function the same as this addon. Instead of it reading chat and consolidating the people looking for group, dps meters read the combat log and consolidate it to show you your performance.
---
Of which this addon changes none of that. You still have to spam the chat. Or are you just that incapable of reasoning about these things that you can't see the big picture that this addon changes nothing for anyone not using it, and simply adds a mechanism to pay better attention to the aforementioned chat spam for those that will use it.
---
You still have to go to a city or whatever. You still have to wait the same amount of time for someone to respond or to find someone advertising the group you want and ask to join them. They still will have to talk to eachother to hash out finer details and make the decision to invite or note.
---
You will have no means to discern the addon advertising a group vs a person typing it manually, nor will you have any means of discerning between someone using the addon to find your group advert. It's simply that unobtrusive of an addon, which is the point of me making this post. To try and shut down the FUD and outrage being spread by ignorant asshats.

A funny cheese was that in vanilla the flare worked kinda like earth bind totem. It took .7 seconds for the effect to "pulse" which is what took rogues out of stealth. You could get your stun off if you got lucky with your use of sprint.

Massive group collusion with the sole intent to block a part of the game from the player base as a whole is probably against the ToS for disruption of gameplay.
---
It isn't PvP for PvP's sake, "let's go murder everyone in STV for an hour", etc. The point is to control part of the game world long term. That's just disruptive and hopefully Blizzard stomps on it.

Agreeing with Techtech when it comes to arcane for world pvp - it is pretty exclusively thought of for its' 21 point talent and once geared more, arcane power. So it's a 21 or 31 point ARCANE spec that is iconic and very well performing in WoW, bringing one of the few "one-shots" to the table in all of WoW.
---
It takes the same amount of time tho.. It makes no difference besides 2 exchanges of "lf tank for dm" "im a tank, inv"
---
Good call.
---
You probably wouldn't talk to anyone in the group anyways.

It's simple, people watched asmongold being outraged on stream about this addon after watching MrGM clip about it, so they just became sheeps who can't think by themselves and started to hate it too while not informing themselves on what the addon will do on release....

---
[You're so original ](https://i.imgur.com/JgxCnBj.jpg)
---
Lol.. I dunno man I‚Äôm not blizz. I‚Äôm just giving my opinion based off the CoC.
---
Primarily in PvE, you start out strong DPS and slowly as you progress you'll begin to fall behind other DPS classes. It's because pets don't scale off your own personal stats, and the class is heavily balanced around the fact it has a pet. You're also usually "locked out" of your highest DPS output spec, in order to provide utility to the raid. This doesn't make Hunters useless, just shifts their primary role from DPS to Utility. Tranq shot, Trueshot Aura, and kiting capability makes Hunters valuable to raids, pretty much through all content.
---
In PvP they don't really fall off. They have strong utility and some of the heaviest ranged burst in the game. Surrounded by a team, you're a pretty valuable asset with the ability to mana burn with Viper Sting, mass slow with Frost Trap, and keep constant pressure on healers/casters with pet, as well as just sniping people down.
---
When it comes to leveling? Pretty much the easiest there is, just make sure you're fully stocked on ammo and pet food before you set out somewhere. If you're playing on a PvP server and in an area notorious for ganking, sit yourself on a flare whenever it's off CD, so rogues can't take advantage of you.
---
Other than that, if you're totally new to Hunter? Practice controlling your pet as you level. Put it on passive, send it for attacks, try to make yourself aware of where it is at all times and take special note on how it moves when it approaches mobs, because that awareness will help you in dungeons at higher levels.

I‚Äôm having such a race crisis. Do I go Dwarft on the chance that I get to end game and fear ward to ony. Or do I go NE like my original character so I can shadowmeld to mess with people when they least expect it!
---
If you can catch a rogue out of stealth hes basically a free kill since he can't clear the debuff and you can most likely kill him before he gets in range. Even if you get ganked by a rogue I found that even if I do die to the rogue there's a good chance the rogue dies to my dots.
---
Can you elaborate a bit about hunter pulls? How is this advantageous to having the tank pull? Ty
---
What if I use a macro to paste lfm in chat? Pretty much the same thing lol
---
TBC heroics were easier and harder at the same time, because they were 'tricky'.
---
ie, they were notoriously difficult not because of the bosses necessarily at all, but because of the trash. The most feared heroics were stuff like Shattered Halls--Shattered Halls was specifically feared because the mobs cleaved, the place was narrow, the mobs were in packs of like 5 and your team had to CC everything and pull and kill stuff really quickly so that you can kill the Executioner on time.
---
In Shattered Halls specifically, when you enter the dungeon, or maybe it's when the first pack dies, I can't remember, a cooldown starts. The Executioner starts killing people after the cooldown hits. Each time you wipe a pack of mobs, a few yards away another pack steps in (meaning a fleeing mob could pull the next pack of 5 cleaving mobs that will annihilate you).
---
So you're doing these mobs that really require patience when you're actually hurrying like mad to kill the Executioner, because if you kill the Executioner before he kills any prisoners, you get a Badge of Justice.
---
What, am I supposed to placate ignorant whingebags who are already reacting with their emotions rather than using their brain to think critically and logically about something instead of autistically screeching at Blizzard to save them from the evil addon they don't know the first thing about how it functions?

Sad, LFG addon is good for classic reduces spam. If they disable it me and everyone else will be forced to spam World Chat channels.
---
Yea I think it was 19~ months after release
---
Here‚Äôs a tip I haven‚Äôt read yet.  Whenever you‚Äôre in a town or village, about to head out to quest, ask if there are any healers around that want to pair up.  You miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take, so can‚Äôt hurt to see if anyone‚Äôs down for some duo questing.
---
If someone says yes, use that opportunity to practice against multiple mobs.  Learn to use tab-targeting (it has flaws but is useful).  It‚Äôs not absolutely comparable to dungeons, but you can practice tactics there.  Someone mentioned banking rage; this is a good way to practice using rage at the beginning of the pull, banking at the end, and using it to start the next fight.  And chaining this together.
---
This can give you some confidence in what fighting groups is like, vs. one on one.
---
Damn, dude.
---
Truly disgusting
---
You are a village idiot if you dont see how thats the case. Alternatively just have your head stuck really really reaaallyy far up your own ass.

Everyone's hyper focused on transfers. I'm hoping they don't add a classic cash shop for pets/mounts/cosmetics.

---
Is it one where everyone in the party has to have it installed too?
---
Thats what everyone assumes apparently, but no, I would talk because I do want to socialize and help other people, ehat I don't want to do is have to pay attention to chat for 30 minutes while I try to find a healer as I spam my lfm macro in /2, its a waste of my time.
---
And on the wrong side :(
---
BFA doesn‚Äôt deserve a military funeral. Just throw it in the sewer
---
You realize that is the retail version right? Look at the players race... This is what I mean by people jumping to conclusions quickly.
---
Don't need the addon to see the format, especially not if your only intention is to corrupt the data.
---
Lmfai. Oh thanks i needed a good laugh
---
&gt; I mean, if the drop rate was 100%, they'd just say, 'Go kill 7 bears, berry-eating little assholes.' And that'd be that. Same damn thing as having a near 100% drop rate for quest items looted from mobs.
---
Interestingly...not quite.  At least early on bag space will be a premium, so if you go out and do 3 gathering quests before turn-in that's 3 slots you aren't gonna have for loot.
---
Not saying it'd be easy, but it would be possible and well within reach. I believe the devs simply don't want to MAKE you have to over buff just to clear it.
---

God, this brings me back. I apped to Juggernaut as a warlock in the middle of Naxx progression. They made all the apps join a different guild called like Juggernaugt App or some shit.

if you are worried about missing a quest, honestly, look it up when you think you're done with an area, or just search to see where a quest is! don't use an addon that is just going to hand it to you. or, ask someone else in the area about quests. there are items that drop quests in areas that you.... just might not get, too! and that's cool. it's what makes it replayable, in my opinion.

Why is this addon a problem? Realistically speaking.

People know that similar addons existed back then, and banning this ingame will not prevent an external source of matchmaking utility to exist. There _will_ be LFG tools around, with or without blizzard's approval. This changes nothing. Stop with the mass hysteria.

I worked there in 2005-2006 and the pressure to close tickets was already high. 10 tickets per hour was the minimum.

Pretty stressful and thankless job.

He isn't talking abour toxicity.  He is talking about having to socialize to participate in group content. Not press a button and join a group.
---
Is this a joke? Because I would be so happy if it was one of those things that was a joke, but was also real.
---
Mmm, well, I personally wouldn't recommend a version that continuously helps out with current quests. That wasn't in the game in Vanilla and I think might detract from it a bit. I think it's funner to explore, and find quests on your own; definitely feels like you're actually exploring. The game will always have quests for you, so you shouldn't have to worry about that.
---
But, I would advise you using WowHead or a site like that, to help you find stuff (quest objectives) when you can't find it. If you have an add-on to point you in the right direction in-game, you might just follow waypoints rather than actually look at things on your screen. But having some support from a website is really useful... you will likely want some help at some point! hf!
---
Yup
---
I didn't do a whole lot of tanking until BC, but I remember it still being fairly hard then, especially with pulls with more than 4 mobs.  It was a challenge to maintain threat on everything if multiple were loose and your group wasn't focus firing.

---
um well why have the need to respec for just the late teens that take less than an hour per level anyway?  Also it is going to continue to scale past 15 because you get higher ranks of frost armor?!?! It is like I am talking to someone that has never played WoW before (or you just like to strawman). Also there is a difference between disagreeing/criticism and saying someone has no idea what they are talking about (which is an insult)...And yea shatter is still shitty without ice shards cause a 50% chance to crit on 2 spells is uh not great especially when the crit will only be 150% damage.

The secondary location is correct. Using the traffic sign and exit detailed above, we can pinpoint it to exit 34 of the A28 highway. Since the buildings initially *did* not line up in Google Maps as you say, I thought something was off, which really tickled my inner Sherlock.
---
Governments with bills to pay don't place the larger and more expensive type of traffic signs willy-nilly. Therefore the sign must be correct. Was the entire building moved? Unlikely. I recalled how they used camera tricks to make the hobbits seem smaller and Gandalf larger in the Lord of the Rings movies. Perhaps a trick of perspective?
---
My conclusion is that the picture was taken from the exit of the nearby Total tank station also situated on the A28 just south-west of the secondary location.

Face the advertisement tower to the right of the highway in the the north-east and zoom all the way in. It's a perfect match.

Judging by the red glower on the eastern horizon, a daylight calculator and [this photography light calculator](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/sunrise-sunset-calculator.htm), I'd estimate the picture was taken roughly around 5:00 in the morning.

&gt;We‚Äôve been closely following the community discussion around this add-on for WoW Classic, as well as analyzing it to make sure we understand how it works. After careful examination, we believe the nature of ClassicLFG is incompatible with our social design for Classic. Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it.

&gt;In line with what we shared at BlizzCon last year, we intend to be very careful about allowing add-on functionality that might undermine aspects of the social dynamics that are core to the Classic experience, even in cases like this where it‚Äôs clear that the addon author had no ill intent and was simply trying to provide a service to the Classic community. Ultimately, if a streamlined group-finding system was something we considered compatible with Classic, we would have kept the modern Premade Group Finder tool rather than choosing to remove it from the Classic client.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs difficult to articulate a clear-cut rule for exactly when an add-on crosses the line. However, when an add-on goes beyond presenting information or providing aesthetic customization, and attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely.
---
Boom
---
you monsters, what have you done!
---
Yes. A good example is the ring that drops off Princess in Maradoun. Its BiS through Molten Core. Another example is druid shifting dps gear, which is low 40s I believe.
---
Overall, most near-BiS is sub 52.
---
I remember spending a lot of time on the warrior forums discussing the best gear setups for certain bosses and just answering questions in general for newer tanks.  I haven't checked the forums in a long time, but the last time I looked(a month or two after BFA launched) class forums had very little in the way on constructive discussion.
---
7 days irl? No, 7 days in game? Sure
---
Warden staff, Edgemaster Handguards. Primo stuff
---
GG
---
VI VON
---
No. 7 days is potentially even unrealistic for in-game time for someone that hasn‚Äôt leveled in vanilla before, especially on warrior.
---
another addon will appear so dont worry
---
It's this no-changes mentality. 
---
Just thinking about players yelling #nochanges behind their 1 Gbps connection with their 8 GB video cards and  4K monitor is beyond me while they level using an in-game addon with fully optimized quest routes. Group finder never was a problem, the instant teleport killed the interaction on retail, with the addon you still need to travel, sometimes easily 20-30 minutes, that's still a lot of time to interact with each other. 
---
BUT
---
Whoever promoted the addon mainly fucked up  showing  the ilevel requirement whisper messages, that's what made folks angry. That shit has no place in Classic.
---
~150 hours /played, so more than a week irl.
---
Nvm me lol
---
Streamers win again.
---
I always thought that was the dumbest saying in the world. The moon is literally billions of times closer than the stars.
---
Or you can be pro and play video on mobile and put it next to the mic. 200 IQ
---
Is the joke that you won‚Äôt need to be anywhere near your computer for a long time?
---
"a lot" are the minority enthusiasts and most of them overestimate their capability. There is absolutely no way that even 10% of the players will reach lvl 60 in the first two weeks.
---
I think I‚Äôm going to go mage. There really isn‚Äôt anything major that I‚Äôm worried about not liking in mage, whereas I can clearly identify things I wouldn‚Äôt like in the other classes.
---
Thanks heaps for your input. If you‚Äôre on OCE I hope to run into you one day!
---
Yeah the ‚Äúah dude 4 strength 4 stam leather belt‚Äù quote comes to mind.
---
I'm not going to lie, this makes me even MORE excited than I have ever been for classic... if that's even possible. It shows that they are truly committed to the actual classic experience. It may seem insignificant to some, but they could have just as easily said that it is up to the community to deal with this. Taking a hard stance like this is extremely comforting to say the least.
---
Would the console have to be chipped/modded in order to use the addons? Depends on what the EULA states in regards to thirdparty changes to game settings.
---
I can't imagine Sony or Microsoft being that fussed about addons if they are moderated in such a way.
---
I feel like Blizzard is really re-building their goodwill with the community through Classic. Great to see this.
---
Hence asking what other addons will it break? Limiting the API will affect any addon that is using the same ones.
---
12.5 k downloads that are going to not work either.
---
Ditto.  The new Doom will be a definite purchase along with Halo MCC when it comes out on PC.
---
are you retarded, that was an example. 
---
its the same as having to scroll through anal spam or where is mankirks wife
---
An oooooold one, at that.
---
BRING BACK 2004 MEMES
---
I'm pretty sure putting an in game addon behind a pay wall is against blizzard tos so joana wouldn't be able to do that. My problem is that the guide has been free for about 10 years and now he's cashing in on it
---
How is it a dumb comment? People bitched and moaned because there was a streamer who showcased an addon working in retail wow and so now they are breaking the version that was being made for classic.
---
This community is just as toxic as always, it‚Äôs just that in classic it stays on one server and is called ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù
---
&gt;log on 5 minutes before release
---
OMEGALUL
---
Mine was Immortality, forget the server but was during WOTLK
---
Agreed. Frost is the only viable pvp spec in classic, unless you are pug stomping in a premade. Just because you "can" kill people with other specs means you have any sort of sustain.
---
Anything other than frost is spending a lot of time waiting to rez at the GY.
---
going shopping
---
probably going to be glued to my chair or asleep atleast the next 72 hours. any recommendations for food/other stuff?
---
Damn this is clean. Did someone do a legit Warrior one?
---
Too bad Blizzard told you to fuck off then with their recent blue post regarding it. :)
---
I am just copying and pasting my comment from another thread, but I want more advice/opinions " I played retail Wow for like a month, 2-3 years ago and got bored of it.  Classic looks good, should I give it a shot? also will more content be  coming for it, like will I not be able to finish the game in a month and  be done, will it have a long life? "
---
Stop oppressing my min/max lifetsyle REEE
---
Thats not how it works. It's blacklisted based on its code. It would take significant code structure changes to bypass a block.
---
Hey everyone! Since Classic is so close, I thought it‚Äôd be a good time to get my 30th episode of Memories of Vanilla out there. Back when I hit level 60, I really wanted to raid, but unfortunately had no idea what I had to do in order to get there. This is a short story of my wake-up call.
---
What was your first raiding experience like?
---
Yeah I feel they are really underpromoting it since their target audience already knows its gonna happen and 'new' gamers might find it underwhelming to be served a 15 year old game, even though in our hearts we know there's nerds out there somewhere that're missing out.
---
Is that really how you are gonna choose to level your talents? Big yikes
---
To the ground!
---
It is a local variable that will be compared to game time to see if its ok to send the message yet.
---
Learn to socialize or go back to bfa.
---
Quit telling people how they can or can‚Äôt play a game when it doesn‚Äôt affect you in the slightest
---
Holy shit, quit to DOS
---
Stick to retail if you aren't planning to socialize like a normal fucking MMO player holy fuck. How hard is that?
---
Name checks out
---
Well done, sir
---
Then, perhaps, don't play a game where this is expected of you?

---
Fed up of this shit.  I want an official v1 server.
---
I didn't play one during Vanilla and I'm planning on starting one.  If I remember correctly there is a split spec that will let you off tank or heal without having to respec.  I'm going to go that because screw respec costs to switch lol.
---
Wakka wakka
---
Until the end of phase 6. Then, no matter what happens, I will probably retire from the Warcraft franchise for good.
---
Alright. I'm now officially disgusted with the "classic" community. 
---
Congrats, guys. The game isn't even released and your collective autism is already forcing people to play the way You demand they play.
---
Noice
---
What is there to cope about? Theres going to be LFG addons, this one got axed, another is going to pop up.
---
Seriously, they need to remove add-ons if they dont want add-ons.
---
Groovy
---
I'm going to assume you've never actually played Vanilla, at this point. I feel bad for you my man but much love &lt;3
---
Really?  I think I dislike that the most about FFXIV (Except when they deleted my house's stuff I spent months building...), when I get a low lvl dung in a daily queue and I have to go back to using 3 spells max because im in a lvl 16 dung.
---
 But I do understand what you mean, i'm just not a fan of scaling.
---
Move those retail arguments that way &gt;&gt;
---
Well you can build a pc which runs retail wow with 100fps+ for like 400‚Ç¨ ($450 or something) so you are cheaper than buying a console since you also need to buy all games for full price.
---
Mouse and Keyboard can be pretty pricey tho.
---
&gt;Take a look at FFXIV their port uses controllers with more spells than WoW currently includes. Granted it is tricky but it's doable.
---
Well yea but I need to say that FFXIV is way easier to play than retail WoW.. retail WoW can be really hard if you raid myth or do 2k+ arena.
---
You need to time many things better and move a lot preciser which is simple not possible with a controller.
---
Streamers were kind enough to pick a server so everyone else could avoid them, I know little about the add on, but the point is to keep things feeling like an authentic feeling of original vanilla, I won't be in a discord group, I still intend to find/make groups and meet and socialise with people, same as last time.
---
"Classic WoW is going to kill Retail" but also "This one addon is going to kill Classic WoW".
---
It's not a big deal, the same people as well as the people that were against it will just continue to use subreddits and discords to find groups faster. 
---
Though I'm curious to how exactly their going to stop this addon and any future addons that will do this exact thing, as well as other addons that "goes beyond presenting information or providing aesthetic customization", such as cast bars for pvp.
---
yep
---
Good news lads, Blizzard shut it down and will make sure the API doesn't allow for anything like this again.
---
It seems that Blizzard shares most of our opinion and believes that such an addon does not align with vanilla‚Äôs ideology.
---

What chat-parsing addons are you worried about being broken?
---
No, it‚Äôs not hard. It‚Äôs just time consuming and I doubt someone wants to waste their time doing that.
---
Thank you Blizzard.
---
Well done Blizzard! I love addon and I already have my interface configured (stress test ftw), however, this LFG addon would be completely against the spirit of vanilla. Assembling your party was such a large part of vanilla and really made you connect with people; LFG in retail is pretty much the same as playing a single player dungeon with 4 NPCS with you, it‚Äôs really not fun at all. 
---
An argument can be made for m+, m+ still offers that group building experience and that, to me, contributes to the enjoyment of higher keys. 
---
Classic is going to be incommensurably better without the LFG addon.
---
Chat, meet people, form meaningful parties and have fun slaying virtual Dragons!!!
---
Looking forward to the many people I will meet, perhaps you reading this will be one of them! :)
---
until they re-release wotlk and then release the argent tournament, I thought that raid sucked. Ulduar for life.
---
Toilet paper and baby wipes.  You forgot those!
---
If I actually enjoy it, I'll probably do like retail and play what I want of each patch/phase and play other things in the downtime while I wait for the next one, and then quit entirely when there isn't anything else.
---
Well, it *is* an MMO. A community driven one at that. You need people to play with. Why not people from your area?
---
Im holding my anxiety to resub the whole week, but I think it can't wait anymore, I have to create my character, even if just to look at him
---
I think that's what bothers me the most. 90% of this sub never played vanilla and claim they know anything because they played on private servers. Not many things grind my gears but these people definitely do.
---
Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it.
---
sweetie did you even read the post....? i know youre blind with rage right now but cmon...
---
That's how most warriors do it. Arms is the least bad leveling spec and is typically played with a 2H while solo, and a 1H+shield when you're in a group. Leveling dungeons are all tuned to be tanked by arms warriors, prot paladins, and bear druids. A prot warrior would be overkill. Usually people only go prot if they're designated as MT or OT for a raiding guild.
---
I've been getting the impression that Blizzard is trying to "unify" the art style of Warcraft into the colorful, cartoonish, family friendly ooze that it is in retail right now. Part of that is purging any hint that there has ever been a different art style. It goes so far that some of the newer cards in Hearthstone even look like retail's ingame models, despite being entirely hand drawn.
---
Well, thank you for your service, I suppose.
---
They've done this exact thing in BFA, and past expansions. This isn't new.
---
See I am going to have to disagree with the discord argument. The addon caters to the lazy who want to create a group without talking to anyone. The lazy are more likely not going to go through the trouble of having to use an entirely separate program rather then using in game chat.
---
Appreciate the detail here. This helps me get a better mental image of what each class will be like. At this point I'm leaning towards going mage for my main, and down the road perhaps a rogue that I wouldn't intend to hit 60 (and just do lower level wpvp on). 
---
The problem is World PvP will probably be at its peak in the first few months of classic. So isn't now the best time to play rogue? 
---
Also help me think through this scenario: You're a rogue in a BG. You open on somebody, blow them up, and they die. You then get hit with a ranged attack. Can you escape? Or are you so vulnerable out of stealth that you're now doomed?
---

---
I played a shitload of vanilla, I just care about things that actually matter. And number of skeletons on the ground just isn‚Äôt something that keeps me up at night or makes me worry about the ‚Äúintegrity of the game.‚Äù
---
The addons you can make for classic are 100% less toxic and game breaking than the addons people did have in vanilla. This is hilarious and you are so cute.
---
Yeah it's a good thing you're dealing with Blizzard. If this was Nintendo you'd be fucked.
---
Arcane shit for pvp and pve
---
Hybrid arcane fire or frost good 
---
Don't want new players thinking deep arcane is meta :P
---
My hot take from like 10 years ago was right. The only WoW killer there will be is WoW itself.
---
until i'm tired of it. and that only happened when i finally realized i was wasting a bunch of time in retail, so, i don't see an end tbh
---
&gt;reefer
---
Had to google what this meant. Laughed out loud.
---
I'm planning on at least 2 years minimum. I want to clear all raid content and really dive into pvp. More likely in the 4-5++++ category,  especially if I find a guild with like minded players.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cu6a86/no_dungeon_group_finder_addon_for_classic/exrtitu/
---
This addon wasn't doing shit you guys are happy for nothing lol
---
A good call. Getting a group together being a bit of a pain is part of what incentivized people to make friends and connections in game. Running around spamming is no fun, so you add the people you had good runs with to your friends list and group up with them again. If getting a pug together is easy a lot of the incentive to do that goes away.
---
Blizzard obviously doesn't have control over those things, why are you complaining when they address things they can and should?
---
Highest I have is only 30 days played but I haven‚Äôt checked any other chars cause it would take too long
---
I plan to socialize. In WORLD OF WARCRAFT CLASSIC not in a third party chat site.
---
Why are there so many Scandinavians????
---
I feel that. Leave good enough alone. I‚Äôll play through WOTLK if it happens for sure. It‚Äôs a pipe dream, but I‚Äôd do it all over again up until TOC.
---
VanillaGuide won't be updated for classic, matter of fact it's not even avaliable oficially for 1.12.1 because Joana filled DMCA strike on it and it got removed from GitHub.  
---
For now the best leveling addon I know of Is probably Guidelime  
---
It has auto quest turnins and pickups, shows quest locations and arrow pointing where to go (like questie) and supports a lot of custom guides.
---
IIRC AllyRoute for Alliance and TourGuide are also good
---
I‚Äôm like this. Discord might become a LFG channel and people will actually have to communicate with each other.
---
BFA players will find it hard to learn to communicate with other human beings.
---
They are used to their small cubicle where they don't have to interact with other people, because it is more safe.
---
*glances at War Mode in retail*
---
Not really.
---
Yes it would work .... Final fantasy runs on console wow can to .... But Blizzard dosent need to give Sony any of that WoW money so we will never see it
---
so many useless skills*
---
id get the upgraded drinks, armor and portals. other spells you dont really use/need ranks for
---
I'm gonna level feral/resto just so I can fill all the roles while leveling probably.

Just wanna say I appreciate all the effort your wife and you put into these.
---
Makes me remember the good old times when my dad and I would level together. He always played a Tauren Druid and I played an Undead Warrior. He played a Tauren called Halata, and therefore a lot of my names nowadays are variants of it.
---
I was fairly young so I couldn't get into classic fully (was 6 when I started) so I'm excited for this opportunity again. It also shows me just how much variety each class had!
---
What are you doing?
---
TBC seems obvious to me. I‚Äôm sure they already planned for TBC before they announced Classic.  They don‚Äôt just announce something with no plan for the future.
---
I‚Äôm sure the conversation was like: 
---
‚ÄúSo what do we do after Phase 6?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúBurning Crusade seems legit‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúYeah we can make a lot of money and bring back subs‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOk‚Äù

---
Play it however you want
---
Retail keks üëâüö™

As a curated system, Discord is way better. As a public place to find as many people as possible, LFG is much better.
---
I think thats a good system. Its encouraging people to build communities for a better experience.
---
May be forced to wear a dress? Just about all of your clothing is gonna be a dress.
---
even if they would make some special controllers for WoW it would just not work trust me.. i've tried to run dungeons with the controller addon and it's impossible to play as a caster since you can't exactly stop at the location where you wan't to stop and that hurt the dps.
---
If something like this was implemented, it would only encourage people not socializing or gathering a group. Making friends and sticking in the group until the end. It would cause people to drop group because they could easily join an insta-que to get another one. I am so rejoiced knowing this is going to be broken and watching all the people that encouraged it.

---
I don't have to, Blizzard already specified that it does infringe on what they deem as acceptable, hence they told you to fuck off.
---
It doesn't matter you say, it doesn't matter how hard you throw your little fit, you won't have your precious tool to avoid actually doing something. That's the end of the line bud, jog on to your private servers.
---
Resorting to ad hominem just shows how base your argument is
---
I know this might seem unpopular but with so many people spamming lfg in city chat wouldn‚Äôt an add on like this simply help a little? It‚Äôs not like they get teleported to the dungeon everyone still needs to run there correct? Is it just a group finder tool similar to old style wow group finder?
---
The frost spec in vailla is actually more arcane.
---
&gt; Its worth noting 1.12 chat API was much more restrictive than modern. 
---
Lol, say that to quickheals or healbot (the original versions could target the lowest HP person in your group/raid and auto downrank the spells for you
---
or to the original Decursive that would auto cleanse
---
effectively playing the game for you..you could bind quick heal to your mouse wheel and be a god.
---
there were some silly things you could do with past api's.
---
Lmao I agree won't be paying for food or drinks from mages .... I am a priest n e way so I don't need it ....
---
What about the auction add ons? Providing price info to users.
---
Classic runs on Legion/BFA API. It‚Äôs not the old engine.
---
Also played young and got ninja'd hard multiple times be skeptical of things and if it smells fishy it's fishy
---
Retail sucks dick and nothing about this addon is remotely like retail LFG.
---
You are just a stupid fuck unable to understand that.
---
Lots of people here for the hype who don't actually know why we need Classic in the first place. They see a convenience and they want that convenience. Same way we got to BFA.
---
agreed. 2 points in frostbolt is too little
---
Oh man that was amazing!
---
No!
---
i mean... you're not wrong...
---
Very happy to hear this. It is also very nice to have devs that are this receptive and involved in the community.
---
An integrated party finder would 100% be aninprovement, and increase social interaction. It helps bring people together but leaves 99% of the group gameplay process untouched.
---

Hi u/dipolartech, &lt;Night Witches&gt; might be what you're looking for!
---
Server: Grobbulus-RPPVP
---
Level of RP: Light. We don‚Äôt plan to have any guild storylines, but those interested in RP are welcome! We do plan to participate in server events.
---
Raid Times: TBD, 1-2 days per week.
---
Loot System: Rotating Loot Council. The council will be made up of the class officers, and rotating spots chosen from members of the guild.
---
PVP: Medium. Scheduled PVP events, such as premade battlegrounds and raids on enemy faction towns, cities, or capturing whole zones.
---
Guild Info: We are a group of left-leaning gamers based in the USA, primarily in the EST timezone. We have come together to form a guild so that we can enjoy all of the wonderful adventures Classic World Of Warcraft has to offer in a chill, toxicity free environment. We are LGBTQIA friendly and have a zero tolerance policy for any bigotry. Personally held leftist views are not required to join the guild, but we ask that you simply respect our views and eachother. We welcome players of all skill and experience levels to join the guild.
---
Goals: Our initial guild focus is leveling up, running dungeons, world PVP, while fostering a social atmosphere with fun events. Expect safaris to Hyjal, scavenger hunts, raids on Astranaar, Southshore, and more. Once we have enough members, we hope to raid 1-2 times per week at a casual to semi-hardcore pace. We do not demand players to pick optimal races, classes, and talent specializations. We welcome theorycrafters, and people who think outside the box with their strategies.
---
We are not racing for world firsts or contesting world bosses, so we would rather have someone who is on time, listening, and having fun than someone who is chasing the #1 spot on the DPS meters.
---
Then you just lost the argument! you havent done any of the hard content in bfa. you should just not speak. because you are shit
---
My problem with paid transfers is simply the fact that they're microtransactions. It encourages a model of revenue that I feel has corrupted the spirit of gaming. Microtransactions rarely mesh seamlessly with a game, the game needs to be designed to accommodate them. That does horrible things to games I feel.
---
I just don't want to see more of that model, certainly not in a mandatory sub game.
---
Please do one for Horde as well.
---
I do have the Google doc of all wands but a general picture is way more convenient.
---
Someone is just going to go ahead and make a 3rd party site sadly. PoE couldnt stop it and so someone just made PoE.trade instead.
---
Wasnt there something like that back in Vanilla or TBC? You would register and sign up for raids and special shit?
---
And I feel like I'm losing my mind seeing Blizzard cave to whiners over a non issue.  Guess we're going the way of BFA.
---
Druids can survive a LOT, they don't just sit there and eat damage, they can get away and recover, as they can shift out of roots and slows. (And polymophs)
---
"No changes" would be allowing for addons to do whatever was possible in 1.12, which this addon falls under.
---
What you are really saying is "no changes besides the ones I deem acceptable for the game to conform to my idea of what is acceptable", which, while fine because everyone is entitled to their opinion, is something entirely different than "no changes."
---
Of course; an epic but never forget [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM)

---
I have no choice but to wait, i booked a trip to Canary Islands before classic was announced, past month i have had regrets but i'm not too fussed anymore because all i will miss out on is a few resets of molten core that is, in my opinion, the most boring raid dungeon in classic.
---
Damage Meters should be fine because the Damage log is a special kind of channel so i think they will exclude it from their changes but i could see them breaking most chat addons and expecially stuff like spam Filters or they dont allow usage of world wide custom channels which could lead to These addons spamming in trade and lfg. Also if they break the invite function thinks like inviting with passfrases will not work so instead of everyone /w the raidlead he has to invite everyone manually. As someone who do bot realy care of the addon exists i fear its a phyrrus victory because it will probably break other things and the function of the addon will just be exported to a website which could include even more stuff like Rating for Group members or information from warcraftlogs etc.
---
Fuck yes, thank you Blizzard
---
Just use rank 1 entangling roots. No need for the talent. You shouldn‚Äôt be casting it in the face of melee anyway. Stun, kite, then root.

Just telling it like it is, you boomers will just downvote anyone who presents an argument you cant actually refute so might as well insult you as you bury my comment.
---
If you are serious about it, you will be best off moving to the starting zone of the race you want the mount for. Once you out level the quests there you get reduced rep, and you won't hit exalted by questing.
---
All we need now is for them to confirm that Devilsaur Mafia violates TOS and I think we will be out of things to bitch about.
---
An add-on that literally just sorts the global LFG channel and picks up the dungeon name, player name, class, and level may be okay. No autoinvite or anything, just literally an LFG bulletin board based on the already used channel. Help sort through the spam and bypass the trolling in global channels.
---
There's already a standard message. "DPS LFG WC" So that should be an easy parse, and it doesn't require people to use the addon to show up in it, and it doesn't appear in an abusive way to people who don't use it.
---
Just the same as searching "/who", but it's by LFG instead of class, level, etc.
---
As long as it's literally nothing more than sorting the already existing channel, I don't think it breaks the spirit of the game.
---
If you can't explain it you don't understand it yourself. 
---
Also I am a vanilla veteran.
---
It's not that hard, sure 3am on a Monday it might be hard but at 20pm it goes quite fast.
---
I‚Äôm fairly sure it would take multiple corpse runs if you can‚Äôt res outside of the lava, that, or the best lava jumping skills Azeroth has ever seen.
---
Better then having this addon. Sounds like you wanted this addon in-game. So sad, to bad.
---
Spoiler: It's you

Yeah the shaman recolor is awesome!

I found this series on YouTube by Scrotus Maximus (not me) about all the pre-WoW lore.  It covers all of the Warcraft RTSs from Warcraft I: Orcs &amp; Humans through Warcraft III: The Frozen Thrown.  I have always loved the lore of the Warcraft universe and this series has been a great refresher since it has been a hot minute.  It is holding me over for the final stretch until Classic WoW officially launches.
---
Yeh true, 24 hr is a but exagerated. Im expecting it to be crazy tho
---
cope.
---
Alright.
---
&gt;An integrated party finder would 100% be aninprovement
---
Thats what this fucking was.
---
&gt; I'm not really sure where this idea that streamers know best comes from. This isn't helping anyone or anything.
---
I‚Äôm not really sure where this idea that people disliking the addon came directly from streamers. Look at the thread on the front page. The front page of this sub. This sub, that is notoriously anti-streamer.
---
Maybe the community just didn‚Äôt want it.
---
Apparently someone is working on a huge discord server to basically do the same thing.
---
Jesus christ if you want to describe anything as a tantrum it would be the shit flipped over this addon...
---
I mean, you gotta log in to find a place to retire your main at.
---
If you want LFG blizzard already has that as part of retail. People dont want that pick every game has that. They want to go back to a simpler time where live player interaction is a thing. No one is forcing you to play Classic.
---
TCG items started in TBC. I have all the early one so fingers crossed we can re-enter the codes and it‚Äôs not account bound like the panda etc.

I love doing that haha
---
couldnt agree more
---
&gt; I'd suggest banning everyone that uses it to remove their stupid lazy toxic mentality
---
How is using a tool "toxic". . .
---
Then you haven‚Äôt looked. They also went and checked the original 1.12 client and that‚Äôs how it was.
---
Good info, thanks for the writeup. Fun to see the code.
---
But man, the delivery. That is not how you change people's minds.
---
The addon let you auto join a group, it worked like the LFG in retail WoW. Discord does not let you do any of that, it works like Vent did in vanilla or teamspeak.
---
Classic WoW is best with a limited addon API. if you want the game to play itself, play retail.
---
Well, that would still limit it to a way lower player group.
---
Would our quest lines converge if I am playing the "intended" way? And if so, when?
---
talking to people = social interaction. the chat being alive = important to making the world feel alive. i'm sorry that you are evidently too stupid or you are being intentionally obtuse and aren't able to understand this. it's an mmo. anything that detracts from the world is bad. thankfully blizzard is in charge, not you.
---
Imagine wanting to waste hours just trying to get a group together
---
Oh well atleast I applaud them for caring about ''gamebreaking'' addons, Retail devs could learn a thing or two about that
---
What‚Äôs with the attitude? I said ‚Äúsadly‚Äù. How does that sound like I want it?
---
It is an automated group finder.

Boomer dogshit players looking for that keyboard turning clicking playstyle to be back in style.
---
Dumb fucks are going to be flabbergasted when they find out they are still dogshit in Vanilla 20 years later.
---
You think tanks and healers are going to be in the LFG full of idiots?
---
Nope we are going to all be in discord where we know the idiots wont last long.
---
Have fun in LFG where you only ever find dps and chuck norris jokes.
---
A list of all the important addons to have handy?
---
If you want LFG blizzard already has that as part of retail. People dont want that pick every game has that. They want to go back to a simpler time where live player interaction is a thing.
---
 No one is forcing you to play Classic.
---
LFG/Trade are probably going to be nigh useless due to the much, much higher population on the servers. You know how fast Twitch chat gets during like, a CSGO major? Probably kinda like that.
---
Change that to 5:55 ***AM*** login if you want to play right away
---
Gnomes it is
---
I literally leveled a rogue and a priest to level 30 yesterday because of classic hype. 
---
I did it by pulling as many murlocs as I could at crystal lake, then moving to westfall and killing murlocs on the north coast. It‚Äôs literally one of the fastest methods for leveling 1-20 right now (I‚Äôm not sure if it is for all classes, but definitely anyone with dots)
---
I agree addons are not the way forward for controller/console porting. I think there has to be an official port.
---
Unfortunately, it's too baseless to trust (I hope you don't take offence to that comment). This subject is extremely technical and would require extremely sophisticated game mechanics in order to implement in an already working system.
---
Although like i've said before you're entitled to your opinion and I respect that.
---
I like this summary better
---
A GM could watch opposite faction players ignore each other but commonly fend off others.. would be obvious and easy to tell who's breaking the rules.
---
classic devs are the homies, screw this addon developer.
---
Its gonna kill most dbms and those. gonna be funny.
---
Yeah being a white boy must be so hard :( you fragile little princess
---
Beneficial is literally up to opinion in this case. However, *problematic* can be defined.
---
If 1) you don't need to have it installed to participate in the game, 2) it doesn't provide information that people don't already have, and 3) it doesn't automate human interactions, I don't see any problems.
---
This addon in question had autoinvite functionality and whatnot, which is problematic. But literally "/who LFG Uldaman" isn't a problem. You still only get class, level, and name. You still have to reach out. And people already will invite you just based on a /3 posting without talking to you. So people's nature doesn't change much. They'll still message the guy who is LFM. And decisions will be made that way.
---
A barebones parsing system with nothing else is not going to shape the way people play the game. It just makes it easier to read through the spam.
---
I reiterate. This particular addon was problematic. Other add-ons with less functionality may not be. And that's okay. If you don't think it's beneficial, and you don't have to download it, that's literally the ideal addon. You don't need Gatherer, but it's nice if you want it.
---
I sent you a bnet invite
---
Im not saying this is fake, im just VERY skeptical with all the hate Whitemane is getting and its not even OPEN yet!?  
---
Thank you for the 'confirm' Im not worried. Chinese are good players.   
---
Q: How are they going to play on NA servers with CHINA game?
---
Lol if u think ur hitting that p1 /shrug
---
This whole situation has brought up what I consider to be a pretty interesting question. I'll preface this by saying that personally I would rather **not** play with groupfinding addons. 
---
However, in general, are addons that were possible in vanilla really in violation of classic (even if nothing quite like it was ever made)? That is, assuming this addon could have existed in 2005, does that make it valid for Clasic WoW? I'm certain f these were made in 2005 then we would consider them an integral part of the classic experience. In that case, the banning of them would be not about creating an authentic experience and more about creating an experience that appeals to personal nostalgia. Which might be okay-- should we value nostalgia over authenticity?
---
Limiting the functions and information available to addon creators to an authentic level is the most objective way of combating these controversial addons, but banning them because "we've determined we don't like this one" makes the line too blurry for my comfort. Of course, maybe Blizz just knocks it out of the park and there's nothing to worry about. What do y'all think?
---
People will just use either a 3rd party site, of discord bots.
---
Dude, ppl defending it, cmon just go to retail
---
I embrace the hate. I am the neckbeard
---
This is making me nostalgic for Newgrounds and YTMND (where I saw this).
---
All trash? You eat only trash? Not onr single veggie
---
Naw, Activision isn't asking them to do that. The whole point of Classic and the reason it was made was because they believe it will get valuable customers playing WoW again, some of which will leak into retail. Once they are there, then there is the in game cash shop.
---
And then on the other side, players who play retail have more value added to their WoW subscription and are less likely to unsub during content droughts. They can just hop over and play classic.
---
It really is a good business move to make Classic WoW, even without a cash shop, provided making it didn't cost an abhorrent amount of money.
---
I'm sure there will be a few
---
Feeling a bit cranky about the Classic LFG cancellation, are we?
---
Hi, /u/P0unds

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cun81u/its_great_to_know_when_people_start_bitching_and/). 
---
One could say it was a classy move.
---
Fair. Then I understand the uproar and hope that someone eventually does a "filter" based addon to determine when a "LFG ----" message was posted.
---
Lag
---
VICTOLY
---
but why is everyone else answering that it will work? :D
---
Not saying it can't be done, but the number of people who think they'll do it is a lot bigger than the number that actually will.
---
the projection is real LOL you are one sad fuck
---
yah, classicLFG was too game breaking, so everyone will be on discord/twitch to find groups. People know the vanilla system of finding groups was hella bad, so even now, before it's released, people know to use 3rd party systems will be the best way to group find
---
freaking millennial get outta here!
---
I theorized an add-on without that particular functionality and said it might be okay. I did not advocate for this particular add-on. Specifically, autoinvite is bullshit.
---
Haters will call us fanbois
---
I mean, there was global LFG channel in vanilla added in patch 1.2 afaik + there was global worlddefence channel for players above certain pvp rank.
---
how many hours per week would you play if say you were really enjoying it and wanted to invest your gaming time into classic?
---
Now can we get rid of dmg meters?
---
Good riddance.  About time.
---
No it's NOT!!!
---
i wont be loading up retail , i know they have something big planned to bring in classic players but not for me thanks 
---
im sure its the sort of conversations people have
---
Because baxck in vanilla like 12 people on each server used a LFG tool because no one really knew about them and somehow that means that 12,000 using it instead is #nochanges. Lol
---
The way I see it, additional revenue is fine because it helps justify the game's existence and additional development. That said, where I draw the line is when you're charging for something that's part and parcel of the game.
---
WoW characters are not really meant to move servers. WoW, especially classic, is built such that players are meant to become immersed in their server community. I'm sure you can agree with this, since we agree on a cooldown, that it should be a rare thing (ideally, nobody would ever want to move servers)
---
So if we're talking about mechanics that are something you're really not meant to do in the game, I'm okay with taking a fee. If you want to argue it's opening the door and crossing that line, well I disagree because Blizzard has been very clear and very adamant about keeping the Classic experience as faithful as possible, and Ion himself said microtransactions are directly against the classic ideal.
---
k
---
Yes, I do think it's a fine addon.  But predicting a tantrum when literally what we've had for the last 2 days could be described as nothing else is fucking laughable.
---
This is very narrow minded. 
---
Bare in mind Blizzard had a rough start through BFA and the census doesn't lie. However, FFXIV since patch 4.2 and their new expansion recently, numbers are up. 
---
But again, this is taken with a pinch of salt as both companies will not release an active subscription user census.
---
The reason why people were speculating whether to port to console back in June was because of many games being ported to console from PC recently. You've mentioned a number of times that it isn't a great marketing strategy, however why not expose your game(s) to another market? I cannot see the validity of claiming that it's because of the game "mechanics".
---
The thing is, times change and so do companies. They have to swing with the times in order to stay relevant. Lest we forget that Blizzard also mentioned a couple of years back they were not going to make classic WoW? "You don't want that" - For reference.
---
&gt;Wrong WoW is for many the only game they play hell I would even say it's like 50% of the community that doesn't play any other game besides overwatch/diablo/hearthstone since many ppl are in their late
---
I'm really not sure where you have got 50% from, I would like to see the data behind this.
---
Vanilla had similar addons already, calltoarms is one of the,
---
naw its not me its all you "classic" elitist trying to force how you want to play on the entire playerbase
---
Why the hell is it being released on a weekday?
---
It's pretty disgusting actually, and almost sad. People constantly say that classic should be about community but this was just sad really and obviously we don't know what blizzard next step will be but it was clear they didn't want to have any discussion about it at all and they were really pushed by influencers here. Hopefully we get info quickly otherwise launch is going to be a mess.
---
Also thanks for the website, it really does help out the community.
---
&gt;  but I don't think there is any real danger of this.
---
I think you underestimate the value of MTX. Blizzard has outright stated that subscriber count is no longer the best metric for their success due to the cash shop and a dev recently stated 70% of their playerbase is in China, which is much more comfortable with MTX.
---
Well, if the potential is there in the Classic API... really it was only a matter of time before the players created this addon anyway.  Not unlike gear score addons and other functionality blizz has been inspired to implement.
---
Russia will hack your emails. JK Twitch is good for addons. They bought the curse addon system, which is what i used to use.
---
They'll review it likely on a case by case basis, changing their API if they notice a potential problem area regarding the modern API structure and what addons could pop up due to it.
---
The old API was a lawless wasteland and people could make a lot of intrusive addons, such as Decursive and similar things that over the years got broken by Blizzard because they didn't like what the addons did.
---
I don't think many of them liked stuff like decursive and other similar addons, hence why they made sure people couldn't make stuff like that anymore.
---
They've said most of the heavy lifting is already done. If Classic is a success and maintains an audience, I suspect it will be a short jump to them investigation progression servers.
---
hell no not 2 horses will get me to install discord.
---
ts did it the last decade and will still be able to do it.
---
Boss add-on shouldn't ever be in Classic.
---
Can you really blame the puppy though? Alliance scum!
---
I‚Äôm assuming one of two things. 
---
They have it set to /who specific names they designate to check a zone regularly and if more then 5 of the same people are in the zone it flags it as a raid. 
---
They could have an add on that spams a person with group invites and if they are in a group it alerts them. I doubt it‚Äôs this one cause it‚Äôs to easy to get caught with.
---
The party member can loot what they need and  you can pick up your piece after. We did this in Beta.
---
it's an great song
---
that some time can be a long as time
---
White hoes offended
---
Hmm, I played a Pally in vanilla (still play him to this day) and was going to play one in classic but after seeing this maybe I‚Äôll main a Mage in classic...
---
That's exactly why I'm going Tauren warrior. Because in my mind I will think I look as cool as that picture.
---
"Author" hasn't updated it since Legion on the two main add-on sites. Not sure WHO the current author is, as it has changed hands a couple times over it's long life-span as many add-ons have.
---
Why is a post asking if anyone has heard anything about a certain subject that no one else has posted on here about, perceived as a "problem"?
---
 It's beyond me. With the amount of traffic coming thru here, this seemed the best place to inquire.
---
I completely understand.
---
Lol even without LFG discord was always going to be the go to place to find a group. So no not really getting rid of the LFG addon just pushed me out of the games in game chat even more. You could say the lfg was keeping me within woes own social networks.
---
Blue dress instantly popped in my head when I saw this picture well drawn
---
ha, no problem. i was just instantly wanting to go off on you because i was arguing with like 3/4 people about how it was a good thing, so i instantly assumed you were just being malicious. my bad
---
Maybe I‚Äôm having the mendella effect because i‚Äôm almost positive I had small shoulders for an entire patch or 2.
---
It seems kind of weird to say that it isn't keeping in the spirit of classic, when Call to Arms, vQueue, and GroupFinder were all widely used add-ons in Vanilla and were never disabled.
---
What is War Mode?
---
I feel like people are looking back at group building with rose tinted glasses. It only automates the smallest part of it.  
---
You still need to make sure the group composition is solid, you'll still have people that are slow or try and pressure a warlock into summoning, you'll still deal with people leaving mid dungeon, you'll still have to communicate through the entire dungeon, etc. etc.  
---
The automation was really just saving a few chat messages and a few clicks. It didn't seem to trivialize anything important in my opinion. I get others disagree though.
---
Shitposts are fun
---
No kidding, the game isn't even launched.  Why not wait until people get to actual experience it.  They are over correcting now and if after launch it will be an uphill battle to convince them to change course.
---
No no no no NO!
---
To be fair, the thing they are saying 'no' to, WAS an addon for classic wow.
---
Personally this is one of those rose tinted glasses situations, people are freaking out over what's going to 'ruin classic' if anything is going to ruin classic it is going to be streamers (which is why I am not rolling on a streamer server) and purists who feel that THEIR IDEA of what classic should be super-cedes everyone else's opinion even if their opinion is against things that were in classic.
---
Wasn't even gonna use it, bud. Really couldn't care less one way or the other, just find the purist elitism is a bit over the top.  
---
You enjoy launch though, as that's what we are all wanting.
---
Retail is that way --&gt;
---
I mean it's not like it's that hard &gt;.&gt;
---
Kinda surprising so many people stuck around with the absurd fucking gatekeeping that goes on.
---
You could say that but it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs coming out of nowhere. One of the fastest to max level multiple times, led multiple raid groups to world firsts. He‚Äôs pretty good at the game himself and brings out the best play in others, and probably knows it.
---
I played Vanilla from the first day to the last and never even heard of that add-on.

Nobody ever, *ever* talks in retail LFG. Seriously I can run like 10 dungeons and try and crack jokes or whatever and no response. Even when people are bad they either just vote to kick with no warning or leave themselves, what the hell happened
---
Skarmtank on youtube has a video about this.
---
Jesus talk about crying.
---
Oh that‚Äôs excellent, thank you for sharing that information :)
---
Oh man, this makes me want mountain dew code red and pizza pockets.
---
It wouldn't drastically change anything, and addons like these were in vanilla...
---
Still waiting on that diablo 2 HD and diablo4
---
Agree completely. And I'm not saying this is stuff anyone has to do.. it's just fun stuff that makes the world more immersive and inclusive in my opinion. I loved getting druid buffs, or mage food, or whatever. I've had random people enchant a weapon for me out of nowhere.
---
I‚Äôve never been stuck in a queue for hours. Speedrunning requires a bit of aggressive planning for launch strats.
---
YO I'm white, can I get some hate brother?
---
to quote myself from Yesterday's BullShitStorm:
---
&gt;BTW, [addons doing this existed in vanilla.](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/CallToArms/)
---
&gt;It just goes to show how many people didn't play vanilla. I didn't either, but at least I'm willing to do some research before posting.
---
&gt;[Auto-invite was a thing in classic too.](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/inviteomatic/), btw.
---
&gt;edit: [So were quests that sent chat messages for you, too.](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/questannouncer/)
---
Addons that could talk to each other were a thing too.
---
All the functions of this addon existed in Vanilla. 
---
But because of rose tinted glasses, Streamer lies and overreaction (AsmoDolt primarially) some guys hard work just got shat on buy the devs, and the community.
---
Honestly no. You‚Äôll get noob, asshole, friendly, and good players on either side. Everyone makes stereotypes themselves but after playing a decent amount of both you‚Äôll realize they‚Äôre pretty much the same. Play whatever race you feel connected to the most that also has the class you want to play
---
I'm assuming you work and have a life, right?
---
Because the addon wasn't going to change Vanilla.  It wasn't going to be cross-server, change the way the dungeons work, change how you get to them.  All it would do is streamline the group finding process.
---
And if you got someone too lazy to travel or too bad to do the instance, you would be stuck with that.
---
LFG tool wasn't a problem for the first month of Cata when the instances were hard.  It was a problem after that when they got nerfed.
---
Goblin guilds. A loose coalition of gold farmers that mostly try to 1 up each other.
---
I'm seeing rather universal praise in all communities that this was broken. I think you got the majority/minority mixed up.
---
Ffs level those CDs
---
It feels like they caved to baseless whining.
---
so whats that mean for addons like Questie?
---
yOu GoT WrEcKeD cringe
---
Auto inviting was already possible through vanilla addons like lazypig and Leatrix. Presumably Leatrix classic  will also be broken and banned if they use a similar mechanism.
---
That's a great response. I think they're going to take things like this seriously. They have to know the importance of classic wow and what it means for Blizzard.
---
Retail is that way then -&gt;
---
So you paste a blue poster, without checking how the addon works. Too bad what this blue poster said is false and just PR bullshit.   
---
Let me tell you how this addon works.   
---
You have a chat channel and people there are spamming LFG A, B, C, X, Y, Z instance, but you are only intrested in Z instance so all these LFG A, B, C, X and Y are spam to you and make it harder for you to find people that are also LFG Z. What this addon does is filter chat for you. So if you are looking for people to go to Z instance then you put that in the addon - now when you open the addon you will see there only messages with Z instance keyword in it.   
---
Additionaly what this addon does is keep posting LFG message on chat so you don't have to spam it manualy + whene someone whispers to you, their message will also show up in the addon, so you never miss a whisper.   
---
And that's it. There is obviously the auto invite function and auto inspect funcion which shows you info about the dude, but it's worthless and can be deleted from addon with no charm to it's funcionality.   
---
Now if someone doesn't have the addon, he still plays the game in exactly same way, except that he has to filter the chat himself, but he will still see the LFG messaged being posted on chat from people using the addon and will be able to reply to it and join such groups.
---
It isn't about how the addon literally function s but the social culture it creates. It is a bit more complex to see it in that manner, but that is the issue at hand. The addon had a ton of features that were going to be incredibly harmful to the community and blizzard agrees.
---
Even though I found a terrific guild through discord, I recommend just playing the game and do it the old fashioned way.
---
I guess we'll see in what way they're snipping the API. That post makes it sound like they *don't* have a problem with addons that don't go beyond presenting information, and my point in the original post is that presenting information is really all you need:
---
&gt; On top of this, keep in mind that Classic will have a global LFG chat channel. This means that an addon that does nothing but let you manually specify a whitelist filter for that channel will be able to replicate the most-used functionality of Call to Arms without needing a private addon channel to communicate to only other addon users. **I genuinely think in a world where everyone has that channel that CtA would become a glorified chat filter** (though really, that's most of what it did anyways).
---
Unless they're unhooking the CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL event from being listened to (which they might), an addon that can't directly communicate with other players/form a private social network still can do everything I care about- compiling LFG and LFM messages- by reading chat.
---
Are you too disabled to type anything else? Or are you just practicing your "social experience" by copy-pasting spam?
---
This makes me wanna roll a druid.
---
Fair point, I understand. So its the automatic group creation that this addon would provide that people are upset about (?)  
---
The reason I personally dont have any issues with this addon is that its not like retail LFG that teleports you to the dungeon and match you with different people from different realms every time. I mean at least with the classic LFG one would still have to run to the dungeon and the people one would group with would be from the same realm so they would 100% meet each other again. Thus the addon would not affect the whole "protect your reputation"-aspect that Classic have.
---
In 2004 when WoW came out I was living in the middle east. WoW was the only game i could play online on US servers without having a lag issue. You should be fine.
---
what we're comparing here is the API calls that addon developers are allowed to use. in vanilla, all those calls were fine. now they are not. guess that shows #NoChanges was just a marketing gimick.
---
next up: are you saying that people having brains and getting better with addon coding over 10+ years shouldnt be allowed? if so, why are any addons allowed? No one had them when classic launched. why arent all addons broken?
---
They're launching 4/5 more servers on NA/EU, possibly even more depending on how many people try to play. You'll only run into huge queues if you're intent on playing on one of the full servers.
---
This addon existed in Vanilla.
---
So yes, it is part of Vanilla philosophy.
---
It's not about hand holding, it's about not wasting an hour to get a group together when you can do it in 10 mins instead.
---
I heard satan has confirmed he's rolling on Whitemane too
---
also, theres the thing that more pixel count = less fps = u can't put 100 ppl in your screen and have a good time
---
LOL keep throwing that tantrum bro.  
---
I haven't played retail since Cata.
---
In my opinion it's similar to how we have game knowledge changing and guiding our experience of classic. We will never have that true authentic experience.
---
Blizzard now has knowledge that guides them on what is good or bad for the game. Exploits or add-ons that existed or could have existed previously should not be allowed because Blizzard has this opportunity of hindsight to make small changes to protect the integrity of the game. Some of these changes they might have made back in the day given the opportunity and some they might not have such as disabling this add-on. 
---
But they had no idea or appreciation of what the "spirit of classic" was back then. This can only be defined by looking backwards.
---
You clearly killed it with your argumentation. Haha, I mad, coz I don't like when people lie or speak about shit they have no ide, haha so funny, me mad hehe
---
Weebs roll gnomes. Chibi and all that.

I look at it kind of like poker. We both have a stack of 40. You raise to 10, I raise to 30, you fold. I "win my 10 dkp" and then we move on.

---
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
---
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like wouldn't you
---
What it feels like for a girl
---
I don't think that is the case but I could easily be wrong and in that case I'd retract my statement; I don't believe "world" channels existed in vanilla. LFG may have existed but it was for the specific zone you were in.
---
Ah yes. no real argument, so turn it around on the other guy. i see.
---
PM me and I may OR MAY NOT have a .pdf of a particular guide that SOME people may or MAY NOT be interested in for Horde.
---
relax there, bud
---
Reddit will kill classicwow
---
Just wait for people complaining about world PvP soon
---
&gt;Shoutout to the idiots such as yourself who do not know that there was a LFG addon for dungeons back in Vanilla that most people used
---
Do you know what the word "most" actually means? I doubt most people even used addons in classic.
---
Anyone want to wager this black-cat is on a list?
---
I think the biggest barriers honestly was having the amount of people that could work together. 40 players with back ups is a major guild and, at least on my server, there werent too many pugs and the larger guilds were elitests at the time
---
I see a lot of "but fire gewd" and this is definitely true, highest dps raid spec after BWL. (BWL actually has MORE fire immune bosses than MC iirc).    
---
But my point here is that frost should be dropped down to neutral. You need a few WC spec mages (debatable) that are deep frost but really the highest DPS in MC/BWL is AP/frost, which is 31/0/20. Yourdeep frost mages are gonna be 15+ on the meters.
---
im sorry they broke your favorite addon.
---
They aren't going to kill the addon outright just some of the functionalities. They are very aware of how it will impact other addons and hopefully will take proper precautions.
---
&gt; Yeah that argument is super common and I don't fucking get it.
---
You're not "adding on". You're flag out disagreeing with me.
---
You're the one who's being condescending, implying people who use LFG don't have friends, people who use LFG aren't good players, etc...
---
If you can't take the heat, stay out the kitchen.
---
Oh well get blue posted.
---
I'm tanking, and I am not going to waste my time alt+tabbing to discord when I can just post in game. I have discord and use it a ton, but for LFG naw man, thats a bigger pain in the but than in-game
---
So the whole idea of classic community is spamming the chat with a macro and not actually communicating during the dungeons?
---
Fair enough. I have a feeling we'll see something similar to a filter/chat finder; but depending on how they much jack up the API maybe its beyond repair or ability.
---
It's not just aesthetic customization it gives an advantage that's not originally in game by showing you what other players are casting.
---
Yeah it takes 2 min. I have mine memorized
---
I would bet on 1 week. I dont need the addon because i already have more than enough premades for Dungeons but i fear they will break some other stuff while the addon will just become a website.
---
my journey lies ahead
---
Wait what do you want Blizzard to do, ban streaming of their games? Discord is now against TOS? Cmon bro. Lol
---
You're hilarious, I bet gearscore was in vanilla too huh?
---
On a separate note, there's a reason so many people lashed out against the addo, and you don't have to agree with what they say to understand that it would change the game in a way that a lot of players don't want, and that's reason enough to not want it in the game.
---
Because he lost and he's now trying to grasp for any straw he can.
---
Yeah, whites unite!  
---
Wait, wait let's not do that.  That's uh...  awkward...
---
So gonna have a group during classic with a warrior, Paladin, priest, mage and Warlock. I was originally going to have the priest heal but now getting second thoughts and if we need a healer was going to have the Paladin heal instead and have the priest go shadow. Your thoughts?
---
Surnami is hyped! Nice poster!
---
Godfather reference for the zoomers out there.
---
Looks like you'll have to actually engage with the people in your group, figure out why a wipe happened and work to correct it. As it was in vanilla, and as it should be again.
---
Why would people abandon a dungeon that took an hour to form after one wipe? Have you ever played a vanilla server before? People actually communicate and work to solve problems they encounter
---
&gt; You just basically just want bfa with a classic skin.
---
Things this addon did not do and would never do:
---
- Port you to the instance
---
- Group you with players outside your server
---
These are the things that destroyed the "community" aspect of WoW, and they are terrible. In this instance you will still be playing with players on your server that you will possibly see again in the future, so if they are good you will care to talk to them and play with them again.
---
CallToArms was a thing. The LFG tool that was added to the official UI in Burning Crusade was a thing. Neither of those destroyed the community aspect of vanilla or BC. It was random dungeon finder with cross-server grouping that did that.
---
I played on US servers from scotland and was a top tier raider back in the day, no issue with latency. the time zone thing sucked though.
---
This too should be banned.
---
Ease of use is huge. Even just 30 extra seconds to minimize to the website and an extra couple minutes to pm in game to form the group.
---
Literally billions of dollars of industry are based on simplification something from quick to mindlessly easy to do.
---
There's a reason Amazon had the patent on "1-click" ordering. "But, you could just click the Shopping Cart icon and just hit Order again? What's the value!?" The value is a fuck ton more money from people that lazy.
---
Who the heck would play vanilla and download that add on anyhow??
---
Ground or air?
---
lol. what is the saying now? cope.
---
... Those may be blue eyes but that face screams something entirely different than *"great destiny"* to me.
---
In fact I am fearing for my virginity.
---
should probably try the classic discord
---
TLDR please?
---
As a resume, this is fairly bare-bones.
---
Best of luck.
---
I love how I bolded the portion that specifically spells out even functionality like the current lfg tool in game is incompatible and you just ignored that like it wasn't relevant to the conversation.
---
I know how the addon works.  You don't know how reading comprehension works.  One is far more crucial going forward in life.
---
Are you draft? This guy says he wants to never talk to anyone in game and just get into groups, and you take that as classic community only being chat spam?
---
Tell us about your katana collection.
---
Can you elaborate a little more or link me something to what you're talking about here?
---
How much does Human vs Gnome Mage really matter?
---
Seems like you are crying now
---
Probably not as private servers use the actual 1.12 client. More likely youd be able to steal your retail/BFA key binds since the engines are almost identical since it was originally based off 7.2.5 (Legion) afaik and then updated from there.
---
Oh definitely yeah. The cat herding involved in getting 40 people pointed in the right direction is absolutely insane. I actually cannot comprehend why people are nostalgic for that aspect of it. "It's more epic" falls apart slightly when Dave the Warlock takes his third piss break of the hour, the tank keeps DCing and the healer's parents are insisting he walk the dog.
---
Calling grown adults "mouth breathing retards" really doesn't help your argument. I think you forget that the player base who wants classic are the ones who actually played the game? Your statement about "dumb fuck boomers" ruining "this thing" really makes NO sense. Vanilla was amazing. Millions of people might disagree with you. So if making the game like it was, like we want it, and like it's supposed to be ruins that experience for you. Then head on back to retail. I doubt you'll last further than. Level 15 as you realize you can't just afk mash buttons while leveling.
---
dont speak this evil into the world
---
Classic isn't even out yet and the fanbase is already toxic and elitist as fuck.
---
Fun 'fair fights'? What?? It's the unfairness of it all, receiving or giving, that powers the world PvP. What is a fair fight even, a duel?
---
That's amazing.
---
I played vanilla from 04-07. And then I played it from 14-18 So 3-4 years seems to be the norm. But realistically a very long time since private servers burned me.
---
It would be so heart breaking.
---
My childhood, monetized.
---
That would truly be the end of gaming for me
---
You think you want this addon, but you  don't.
---
/s
---
Possibly. Or the community's strong reaction to it, plus they're apparent dedication to remaking the experience as closely as possible.
---
Most people didn't and this is coming from someone who used one back in the day. The problem is that this add-on would become way more wide spread than it was back then and would also ruin his precious #nochanges but he's blind to that for...reasons.
---
Why does he look like he lives in a crack den?
---
Blizzard often revises the API to address issues like this. If they didn't and just banned whole addons, the API would remain wide open to similar infractions. Like the saying goes, treat the cause, not the symptom.
---
Needs a sticky. The top 3 posts in rising are about this.
---
It also forced people not to be dicks. With retail groupfinder, people can be and are jerks.
---
So like everyone that buys brand name clothes and shoes?
---
Don't care for the add-on if it stayed or went but isn't that exactly what this community has done for the last couple of days?
---
Addon will be rewritten to use another logic ü§£
---
I may provide instructions how to make it work again but there are more clever people out there that probably already know that
---
You can only get away with bare-bones as Undead.
---
RIP, that's a killer name.  
---
Too soon?
---
Theres 10k people on your server at once all even if only 0.1% type a msg every 2 seconds your msg will be missed by anyone looking for it.
---
Good luck with that
---
Sucks. Classic experience is in the progression and full blown RPG experience, not in making all QoL improvements disappear.
---
Spending half your playing time trying to find that last spot tank or healer won't be fun to anyone. Regrettable decision by Blizzard.
---
nice
---
I played in vanilla. This add-on was in vanilla.
---
It's always the same isn't it. "Just don't use the addon!" "Just don't use lfd!" "just don't use transmog!" Oh and I loved this one in wod: "you can still use your ground mount, just let me fly!". It's like these guys never spend more than 5 seconds to actually sit and think about the effect these things have on the game experience
---
Tell that to the Catholic Church.
---
did you just describe something? Because that is not how the LFG add-on works.
---
Should also say that his character name is unavailable
---
&gt; a bunch of casuals (for lack of a better word) who don't actually give a shit about what Classic is supposed to be
---
So, no different from the people actually playing the game back in vanilla.
---
I dont have room on my hard drive for that bloated game.
---
I would argue the faster I run dungeons allows faster to find enjoyable players to play with. The speed of finding a dungeon is the only thing being changed compared to spamming a chat channel.

I doubt they‚Äôll do classic+ if the #nochanges crowd is significant and for realsies. I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll dip their feet in the water with small changes to see how accepting the community is...if backlash is minor they may go down that slippery slope, but if it‚Äôs major they‚Äôll probably try to stay true and just follow progression to BC and maybe WotLK. Highly doubt there will be any life left in the wow community at that point but if it‚Äôs still lively then maybe they‚Äôll consider some ‚Äúplus‚Äù content.
---
Again, I don't consider spamming a macro into a global chat to be "talking to players" and it's utterly bizarre to me that people on this subreddit somehow consider that "social interaction."
---
You talk to players while you are in the process of doing a dungeon. That is not talking to players.
---
i have
---
No need. If they violate the ToS they'll be banned. People here were just educating others about how this addon goes against the very spirit of Vanilla, and it was confirmed today by Blizzard.
---
Have a great launch!

 Hello and welcome to **&lt;Controversy&gt; (Alliance), Arugal PVP server** **Loot council. Raid times:  8-11pm, Friday/Saturday NZST.**   We are a New Zealand based / Australia based raid guild. We are semi-hardcore but will be allowing meme-specs to raid!  We have a great mixed group of raiders, socials, classic veterans, retail and new players. Come and introduce yourself on our active discord server! [https://discord.gg/25SeBtH](https://discord.gg/25SeBtH)

5:55pm xDD
---
Yes, but it would still be easier to get a group together again.
---
TBH I am mostly worried for what the change to prevent this will do to other addons.
---
FYI they specifically said they will limit specific functions of the addon, not get rid of it entirely.
---
My guess is they will stop it from auto inviting.
---
Cheers! So many more I want to snatch up hahaha
---
Nobody knows what that means.
---
It's provocative. It gets the people going.
---
The point is that there is nothing about the addon that is special. Everything it does was possible in vanilla (if fact, real vanilla addons and macros could literally play the game for you).
---
Removing addons that were possible in the vanilla api is not nochanges.
---
Thank you
---
troll
---
Dad please stop
---
2019 a 2nd monitor will run you $30 bucks. Helps with raiding as you stream videos on the 1st while you raid on the 2nd with the complex vanilla rotation 111111111111
---
If you‚Äôre on a pvp server this is a dumb thing to do. When you reach contested zones you will be at a disadvantage level and gear wise. Making the leveling experience much more harder.
---
Thanks! hahaha it was just a random little thing I did on my free time. I got all my footage from either Blizzard's released stuff already or the very talented "Hurricane" WoW traileres on youtube!
---
Not nearly enough ramen noodles
---
They literally said they would take actions against these addons at BlizzCon. If we start creating LFG tools we might as well just have Blizzard implement group finder themselves. Vanilla didn't have group finder and so shouldn't Classic. Fuck off.
---
Lol Hunters don‚Äôt benefit from leeway..
---
Little tip, my man. Include information like your 'spec', your past raiding experience, your general age range, and your time zone (so they know when you'll be active), and anything else you feel is relevant, such as how quickly you'll be ready to raid after launch day, etc.
---
Preheat your hardeners bois
---
I logged on and played some of my geared low level characters in some BGs. 
---
I only played for an hour and can't touch it ever again. 
---
CLASSIC PLEASE.
---
Because you don't want to be the guy subbing on the 26/27th and have the payment server break because it got slammed in the ass by half a million people.
---
Nope, the entire system doesn‚Äôt exist in classic. No custom group finder or LFG finder
---
Hey Ipse - First off, thanks for all the Weak Auras you make, I use them on pretty much every character. 
---
My comment here is really aimed at the streamer bit though - Esfand had Suu on his stream a few nights ago to explain exactly what the addon does, so he was well aware of how it functions. He's also completely right - most players did not use an LFG tool on retail Classic or BC. 
---
What private servers did isn't really relevant either, because they're not exactly true to the experience and there was an understanding that you needed to expedite your play on those servers because they could go down at any time if Blizzard chose to strike. You didn't have the luxury of being assured your progress would be there the next day, so most players were not content to take a day off from looking for a group, they wanted to get to cap ASAP so they could do the content. 
---
I think the conversation here isn't nearly close to over, and again I appreciate your insight on how this might impact mod development and what you contribute to retail, but as Ion said at Blizzcon, addons like these very quickly become ingrained into the fabric of the game, and lead to less and less "Classic" iterations. They really don't belong in this iteration of Classic, which is aiming to be as true to the original as possible.
---
The talent takes away the cast time it‚Äôs instant and automatic
---
You are taking a lot from my comment that I didn't actually say. I could have wrote more clearly but "These people must have had really hollow friendships if the only reason they didn't think of other players as NPCs was a lengthy wait to assemble the group" should have made it clear that I am in favor of the addon. It was directed at the people arguing that inefficient grouping is inherently beneficial.
---
The whole point of my post was that all of the socializing that the people who hate the addon talk about can still happen in groups that assemble more quickly. I honestly feel like in your anger you are hastily scrolling through and didn't actually take the time to read and try to understand what I meant. So like I said, chill. Or at least don't try to tell me what I meant with my own post.
---
It‚Äôs all well and good until they break something you didn‚Äôt know you were using.
---
Nicee

I dont know what else i would need to put. i dont have gear, my raiding times are flexable

Man you have picked the weirdest hill to die on. Lol

On what basis do you make that assertion?  Because you don't like them?  Is this another #somechanges situation?

# &lt;Platform&gt; EU | Horde | PvP - Firemaw | Casual Raiding/PvP/Social
---
Ever dreamt of having a bar you could hang out in, bash out some pre-mades, sit back with a beer and power level, perhaps grab a pizza and run some PUGs with the guildies?
---
Welcome to Platform, an e-sports and social gaming bar founded in London, with the mission to move out and to the rest of the UK. Founded by a motley crew of the hospitality and gaming world, a lot of us have been craving classic WoW for years (sitting here counting down the hours to launch), and we've decided to run our own all inclusive, casual raiding, PvP and social guild - with the benefit of a bar to call home. (Raid times TBD.)  
---
We're open to anyone and everyone, whether you've never played or have been here for 15 years - our ultimate goal is to embody the social spirit of the classic community and capture the magic of playing this game together with others.
---
Unlike any other guild though, joining the Platform family means some guildy love anytime you come down to see us here. Discounts, extras, a whole e-sports stage with decked out gaming PCs, as well as a community of regulars and staff who are all going to be rearing to go in Azeroth too.   
---
Our plans include WSG nights, events for content phases, dungeon grinding nights and more, with the feel of an old school LAN party. Did I mention we're a bar?
---
We're sitting here with names reserved ready to roll Horde on Firemaw, and we hope to see some of you there too. If you're interested, drop us a comment, message, or join us on our discord here - [https://discord.gg/8nW5TKW](https://discord.gg/8nW5TKW)

---
yeah, here's the link+discussion:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cu9gck/fairbanks\_super\_coalition\_using\_addon\_to\_gain\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cu9gck/fairbanks_super_coalition_using_addon_to_gain_an/)
---
Yeah. That's why I try to take a rather neutral response on the topic. Some things like auto-inviting as a function alone isn't a problem. It is more-so when you can (potentially) build a group based on roles without even being at your computer. 
---
So that's why my post was more focused on what ClassicLFG or other similar addons could become being the problem, rather than the specific functions of it itself.
---
This already exists in retail in the form of Raider.io.
---
It ain't fucking different.
---
Except the fact it will. üòÇNow either another addon will appear or discord bot will. I saw amazing discord bot out there for other games:
---
Bot lists your group in special channel where anyone can press a button and party leader gets notified and provided with a chat line to quickly invite in game
---
Just perfect
---
Who you calling pal, friend?!
---
Hey guys ! I would want to play Fire only for non-raid contents. What spec can you advice me to do please ?
---
Too long to read sorry. Thanks again for your opinion. Have a good weekend!
---
The spirit of vanilla cutting off features in vanilla. No changes is a funny thing.
---
This addon will likely still exist just as a chat parser/poster, so it can still filter out messages and list it in the addon.
---
Also your example isn't going to happen 99.9% of the time, only around launch when asmongold is on and if your on his server...
---
I do like classic wow, that is why I played on private servers.
---
The thing is, there is going to be a SHIT TON of players in classic, and many are going to spam /2 for LFG FOR X LFG FOR X LFG FOR X LFG FOR X.
---
Personally a large part of my nostalgia is chat interaction, having a swarm of LFG LFG LFG LFG LFG, to me, stops that. 
---
(that is also why I am avoiding Farliena or whatever the server is called, because of streamers)
---
Is this power rangers? I just got mind blasted back to the 90s
---
The vanilla API was much less restricted than the modern API. That is why it was possible for people to create macros/addons/etc that basically played your class for you.
---
The reason you didn't see "gamebreaking addons" when you played vanilla (if you did) is a combination of there being less knowledgeable addon developers back then compared to now, or you simply not knowing about the ones that did exist.
---
Hes a coward that's why
---
Lotta people here that don‚Äôt know what meeting stones do.

Unfortunately, there's toxicity to be found on both sides. Sort this thread by controversial, and you'll find plenty of name-calling to the effect of *"retail shill"*, *"BFA baby"* and the age-old gamer insult of *"noob"*.
---
Is it really so hard for people accept that other people like different versions of WoW to them?
---
classic elitist lol....ive been playing the game since launch and again you elitist are trying to make everyone play like you want to play....guess what i bet blizz didnt mean for addons like DBM to come out so people could auto pilot boss fights with an addon telling them when to move and what not lol
---
"limit"
---
Thinking the same but dwarf vs human
---
I'm thinking surely someone would go dwarf in a guild so i can go human
---
CalltoArms and another one with a different name. Same exact thing, it's just a chat parser, like DPS and threat meters. If they break this add-on it's gonna break those too and you guys are gonna be crying again.
---
Retail is cross realm, that's the problem. These aren't. Spamming chat in /2 is not social interaction, nothing is lost. You still have to talk, travel to the dungeon, and complete the dungeon. That's where the social interaction is.
---
The uproar was from people not understanding what the add-on did.
---
This was my thought exactly.  Not terrible in its current form, but lots of potential to be bad in the future and it's hard to cage that beast after it gets out.
---
Classic will be the best wow version for you IMO, lots of old school players will play and help you out. Take it fast or slow
---
You realize the exact same functionality exists in meeting stones right?
---
are you fucking kidding me?
---
global lfg will exist in classic
---
very likely if the pop is strong when classic has run its course content wise.
---
they specifically said in the AMA tbc would be relatively easy to port now they had done classic.
---
Put a shirt on!
---
With how long it takes to level, and the fact people have RL friends who may choose different servers, paid server transfers are very reasonable. Appearance changes should be free. Everything else is probably best to be restricted.
---

That's us to a T. We're all friends from middle school and high school but now late 20s, married and careers. None the less, we're rolling Skeram. Horde.

---
Modern Premade Group Finder tool is fucking miles away from this little chat filter addon.   
---
I just fucking told you - it is a generic PR response that shows this dude posting it has no idea how the addon works.   
---
First he is comparing it to retail PREfuckingMADE Group Finder, then he is talking about how such addon can affect people not using it.   
---
Not to mention that exact same addons used to be present in Vanilla.   
---
Seriously I am out, It's like talking to a wall.
---
Such good nostalgia. Bill Roper and Chris Metzen will forever be the voices of the two factions in my mind.
---
Good responses that actually take effort instead of 'ReTaIl Is ThAt WaY' low effort responses hoping to gain upvotes by "he said the popular thing!" also that way --&gt;
---
This is interesting, since I posted a rant about not wanting LFG Addon at the same time as Blizzard posted they'd ban it.
---
I wouldn't describe myself as a purist. Add Ons existed back in the day as well. Mostly Add Ons that allow you to change the UI and track your buffs - which I am fine with, as these do not alter the game itself, but rather make it prettier or let you see information.
---
However, the LFG Add On not only changes the game drastically, but it is one of the main reasons people dislike modern MMOs and were happy about classic being announced. In my rant post, I argued the following:
---
"The thing I loved about gaming back in the day was the community as well as the planning you invested into your character. If you geared up your character through tons of grinding, it means you put priority on it. If you invested that time and effort and eventually raid with it, you wouldn't simply do that for shits and giggles. Back then, you were standing in whatever capital was yours, shouting in the chat looking for a group and members. During that time, you socialised. You made friends, you also had a reputation to maintain or lose, as the servers were much smaller, gaming was niche and thus everybody knew each other.
---
First, LFGs appeared - starting from WoW, taking over other MMO. Step by step, the community grew, gaming grew out of being nice, so the servers grew as well. Combined with much more accessible raids (gear being easily obtainable instead of grinding, raids becoming easier and shorter, introduction of dailies), this vastly shaped the atmosphere of a new MMO generation. When level and gear became easily obtainable, raids became easier and shorter and LFR provided anonymity and the loss of a personal reputation, not only did it go towards a singleplayer game, but the quality of the community dropped drastically."   
---
Conclusion: The LFG Add On destroys the entire point of Classic WoW. If you want a more anonymous/LFG experience, there already is retail WoW. I don't see why you would want to go to Classic WoW.
---
so Neo vs Smith in the 2nd matrix
---
&gt; that will drastically change
---
So do you just not know what meeting stones are or....?
---
lol autoinvite is in other plugins and has been in the API since the beginning.
---
&gt; 20pm
---
what the fuck
---
Probably Nop I guess. There's probably a lot better ones still available if you aren't emotionally attached to these..
---
‚ÄúDelete Character‚Äù and try the naming game again. ü§£
---
this is 15 years later and casuals of today are not the same as they were back then. casual wow today is BfA, compared to vanilla which is seen as way more hardcore (because it is). and as you know, vanilla was casual compared to other MMOs back in the day. clearly the term's meaning has changed. what's even your point?
---
Maybe.  We might end up with something like destinylfg also.
---
Thanks a ton for taking the time and for the op.
---
If you don't like it...don't use it? Who the fuck cares

It's curious that when discussing Blizzard's business side, people put Activision forward as if Blizzard would never do the obvious things any company with massively popular IP beholden to shareholders would do. 
---
You can love the devs who make the games you like while also criticising the company they work for. Blizzard is a business, the people making the games all have great ideas and a drive to make good games but they aren't the company.

Many addons were used in Vanilla wow. 
---
I stopped playing retail two months into BFA so I am not a retailer, in fact I want to not give blizzard my money for retail so badly that I am waiting for launch day before I even buy game time so as to not support the shit garbage that retail is.
---
Maybe you should actually explain why it is bad for the game instead of using a strawman and going "Retail bad" "You retail, you bad"
---
About Three fiddy?
---
This sub is both good and awful at the same time and I really don't know how they manage to do it so well. It has good memes, informative posts and all that. But then you have others shutting down anyone who didn't start basically exactly on launch day 2004, people whining about the most insignificant things, or bashing Retail.
---
It's great, but terrible. The die-hard Classic community seems to be very toxic, but here's to hoping they're just a loud minority.
---
Going to be worse if it pushes people to discord because it will split the groups of people looking for groups.
---
Absolutely true
---
Yes, yes of course I'm going to wait 3 days before I login. I hope everyone else will join me in this trial of patience. /s
---
Hopefully they ban all addons.
---
Post quality = shit
---
Name quality = shit
---
At least you're consistent.
---
I'm gonna try -- I took the next week off though. After gaming for so many years, I've learned from other peoples mistakes time and time again of taking PTO on release and being disappointed when the game is down. I always expect issues on launch day, even launch week. If I'm able to play on launch day or the day after, I'd be pretty stoked.
---
This sub loves insulting bfa players, you get free upvotes for doing it.

The biggest issue I have with gnome redesign is that now all the faces look really serious and scowling most the time. I just want a fun goober.
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
"¬†Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it."
---
They are limiting the functions to the LFG addons. They aren't getting rid of them. The amount of people up in arms over an addon most people wouldn't use is just sad and pathetic.
---
No, it really didnt. It was LF1M Shaman for Strath. Someone messages you saying to invite, you invite. That is no different than this addon.
---
Let's bet. If it will appear - you will lick your cat if no - I will lick myne
---
The social network part of his comment just suggests they'll break the addon communication channel aspect, so it may just be converted into a LFG channel chat parser + advertiser unless they also break it's ability to use normal chat channels.
---
You‚Äôre the MVP. Thanks
---
It has a lot of bloat other than the addons but it works and you can just close it after installing stuff. It's like the old curse client.

pinnacle of social interaction
---
I plan to play until Naxx or TBC comes out but really it's until I get bored
---
I'm glad we have newcoming casual players because having them helps recreate the vanilla experience. If the only people playing classic were those who really care about "what classic is supposed to be," the landscape of the game would be totally different from what we had in vanilla.
---
The only reason they defended it was they want classic to fail and retail to remain the prime game. Classic will take over sooner or later.
---
If it wont change anything then you won't miss it.
---
The advice here is good. Just play the game and enjoy it but be aware that for a lot of the quests you have to read the text and make inferences. A lot of the talents are not explicit in how they work and it might be a good idea to look up mechanics of a certain class that you‚Äôre playing because respeccing talents isn‚Äôt cheap. Overall just have fun man.
---
Again, Im biased, but 100% YES.

I'm OK with server transfers tbh

Anyone can claim to be a consistent raider and have no life, but until you can provide that in some way it's just meaningless words. You'd edited the OP now, but very little of that makes you in any way attractive as a raider (or even a guildie).
---
Soo good *claps*
---
Dude/ette it's not me that is the issue, I form all my groups because it is faster to do it that way, it's other people freaking out on each other.
---
Obviously I don't want the group to dissolve but I can only do so much to smooth the table cloth before someone flips the table.
---
Fair enough. I hope that it's not a mass psychology thing that has just changed as the generation of gamers has. As our skill has improved with generations of MMO's, I find the average person in games to be more toxic.
---
If you didn't know you could always just for the addon go to versions tab and install classic specific update.
---
I'm a former shipper/reciever, you were my fav courier service to use. Nice website, friendly drivers... Whenever I was required to use FedEx I hated my life. They have the grossest, most terrible interface.. Anyways, I'll stop venting :P
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind both being dropped at the same time.
---
Honestly there are a lot of addons they should break, this isn't one of them.  People are going to use questing addons (I know I am) Which will stream line my experience gain.   I plan on being 60 with in the first week because I know what addons to use.  It took me 3 weeks when Vanilla released, and I even had beta access.
---
I must agree. This really does give hope that this amazing game will make one heck of a comeback! 
---
For the alliance!!!
---
well, ignore list gota be used somehow lul
---
I'm not specifically talking about Asmongold spam, I'm European anyway so luckily don't have to worry about that. I'm talking about normal LFG spam, Tradechat, random questions, political discussions, general shithousery.
---
This will be the normal speed of LFG/Trade, I've seen it before on private TBC/WotlK servers that were less populated with an actual LFG.
---
The people crying the hardest over the LFG addon will be the first ones to install it once they realise this.
---
You're still a jackass, you just happened to be upvoted by other jackasses.
---
I don't really care about the add-on and haven't played retail for a long time. I played on day one of Vanilla and up through Icecrown.
---
The official Blizzard statement on Classic is "an authentic recreation" of Vanilla WoW. But, they've made a few conscious changes from what Vanilla actually was like. It seems inconsistent when some changes are made to be "in the spirit" of Vanilla and some decisions are made "because that's an authentic recreation of what it was in Vanilla."
---
I just think that if they want it to be a modified Vanilla experience, then do that. But, you can't have both "an authentic recreation" of Vanilla and a modified game that is "in the spirit" of Vanilla at the same time.
---
Having a consistent design philosophy is important for a game.
---
It was so useful for setting up guild raids. Its like people here didnt even play vanilla.
---
We‚Äôre going to raid to one song and one song only, my humps by the black eyed peas.
---
Lol as if you have to choose
---
Great news!
---
I appreciate the breeze from those moving goalposts.
---
Too many zoomers playing classic it seems.
---
Eh, I would not recommend that for raids, but I am restogang
---
My instinct says this is parody...but I know better. Wish I didn't.
---
This looks great. Don‚Äôt worry! Blizzard ran of resources to finish paladin too.
---
All it does is read an organize the chat channel. So no one is excluded. Everyone else is just in the chat channels.
---
Not enough hot pockets
---
i didnt know that they put a "classic mask" into the legion¬¥s engine, this brings a lot more question about bugs on retail that probably work on classic, regarding my question ill look into it
---
It‚Äôs not to late to delete this post
---
Purple bag Doritos. I see you are a man of taste.
---
unlikely. I don't use any addons.
---
is boomer being used to refer to anyone older than a teenager now? that is my main takeaway from this thread.
---
there was a world defence channel that notified you where various places were under attack
---
It won't be filled with the same people spamming the same message that they're a DPS lfg (or 3dps LF Tank/Healer) for random low level instance making 90% of groups impossible to find.
---
I do not, you are correct. My addon functionality knowledge is only minimal with current retail things like player/weakauras and the likes. 
---
However, I do still have faith in blizzard to make a good decision and figure out a way the classic team has had a incredibly good record so far. Blizzard understands how important these other addons are and they do not encroach on the game's community in a similar fashion to this one. I still firmly believe this was the right choice and there has to be some sort of way for them to do it. 
---
They are the developers after all I am certain they understand how their own addon system works probably even better than some of the addon developers.
---
prior to hidden/addon channels, they just used custom public channels with standard messages which got 'hidden' by the addon itself.
---
disabling hidden channels without also disabling non-hidden channels will have no meaningful impact and would just be annoying.
---
I don't think people understand just how little this addon actually did, it was basically just point-and-click TradeChat.
---
I don't get it, if you think it's easy to just group up without any enormous social interaction, why in the fuck would you need an LFG add-on?
---
Might as well eat literal shit
---
The way lotus works makes it very difficult to control like that. Much harder than devilsaurs.

thanks bro :)
---
I use Bartender in retail.
---
And bartender seems to be in Classic and if it is anything like retail you can literally make your bars whatever you want, and hotkey them with pretty much any button you want. Might take a bit of time to learn how to use the add on, it isn't too complicated but you just need to mess with a bunch of settings.
---
I love a good grind but I find levelling to be a tedious slog of an obstacle between me and the fun grinding
---
Because in retail it's cross realm. This isn't, so you can't be a dick.
---
It's now 57/43... but idc as a horde on Skeram

but you can't pixel cast with a controller it's not possible to move that precise with a controller.
---
Sadjsjsjshdjhs I thought that was the hunters pet
---
Hell. Fucking. Yes
---
This addon really put me off Classic for a bit, I was ready to step off the hype train.
---
One of the main reasons I want to play Classic is to stay away from the LFG bullshit. So now I know the devs agree this addon is an issue and they will destroy this shit it makes me very, very happy :)
---
ii I am going to try it when it comes out Tuesday, no other games really to play either. Have little experience with retail WoW but classic seems like a must try, thanks!
---
Zug zug
---
Really glad they are sticking to the "authentic" scene of wow vanilla. This modern day casuals want to ruin the game.
---
&gt; break the popular addons that deter people from being social in an MMO and it will solve the majority of the problem.
---
That's the thing, though - how? In the past, when Blizzard has dealt with problematic addon inclusions, it's not like they have some system that can somehow just ban Addon X, Y, or Z.
---
They do it by restricting access to certain API hooks. Like the character positioning stuff that they restricted access to that affected DBM after WoD. The list goes on. 
---
To get rid of any form of LFG addon, you would have to prevent ANY addon from interacting with the chat. That would be a lot of collateral damage.
---
Yes, it's unpopular for a good reason.
---
Great. Now I need chemo.
---
Banning an LFG tool is already a /#somechanges situation
---
Seriously this subreddit used to be data and maps and people posting about their thoughts just 2 months ago.
---
Now it's memes and pictures and tattoos and battlestations. It's like all of the people who ruined retail are migrating here to ruin classic as well. I feel like this subreddit is Texas and the Californians are coming here complaining about high costs of living
---
&gt; yes, exactly what they did.
---
I'm not cleaning my desk to take a pic. :P
---
I am disappointed in the addons that will be broken because of this. Addons that we used in vanilla.
---
You have to sub, but beyond that it isn't any extra. So, yes it is $15, but that's only if you didn't already have a sub.
---

---
Lmao weeks... no, it‚Äôs done as of now.
---
Yea, it was insane. The retail players who have joined this sub and defending shit like that gives me horrific flashback to when people defended LFG etc when those systems got added in WotLK etc, and what ultimately led to WoWs downfall.
---
Responding to both you and the other response saying the same thing. An automated experience is not the classic experience that people generally wanted and remembered when they asked for classic. The game is better with limitations in place to prevent past exploits.

the way I see it, I'm more likely to stop playing over 2 weeks prior to the end of my subscription. So getting it early to snag a couple names I want is no big deal.

Blizzard needs to bring back that little comic of the week thing they used to do. There's a gold mine of those in the archives.
---
Give me a break.
---
As a druid on private servers, I would top healing meters if I was assigned main tank healer.  A lot of that came down to skill though.  Sadly much less skilled priests would be assigned MT healer  solely because of their class.
---
Exactly.  You get by on keyboard turning, so it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue for anyone else.
---
One of the few speaking sense here. Restricting capabilities by changing the API is vastly different than outright banning the addon. Most likely they are taking out the autoinvite feature and checking talents. It'll probably still function in the same way other than that. 
---
Not that I was personally gonna use the addon anyway. I would imagine other things such as discord and 3rd party options will still be used.
---
Would be unfortunate if this negatively affects harmless addons as collateral
---
&gt; Yes, I do think it's a fine addon. 
---
And I couldn't be happier that they rained on your parade today. They made it clear at Blizzcon this wasnt fine. You guys found some way to twist Ions words and convince yourself LFG in Classic was OK... This was stupid, it was clear this wasnt going to fly.
---
I have this kind of old friend myself,we still talk everyday, but he's not going to play :(
---
I'm afraid that playing casually with 2 kids around isn't going to be easy making new aquintances
---
There was a global world channel on the beta realms as well as global LFG.
---
Dwooid?
---
I honestly doubt that. We all know where the game has gone so far. If they do progress all servers I don‚Äôt think it will make it to cata since that‚Äôs when they started losing subs.
---
What's the fairbanks nonsense? Was planning on playing there.
---
Yup I agree. Although the mechanics were fresh then for most players, and that made Raiding relatively difficult initially, that will no longer be the case.   Even LFR has mechanics that are a lot more difficult than things featured in classic WoW, and the player base knows a lot more now than they did then. 
---
It really was just the difficulty of wrangling 40 (plus sub) players together. Once a group had a raid completed it was EZ mode. 
---
PUGS will be much more common this go round and I imagine a lot more people will be experiencing end game content.
---
Does poly really last this long in PvP classic?
---
&gt; However, when an add-on goes beyond presenting information or providing aesthetic customization, and attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely.
---
.
---
Whatever they decide to restrict it will unfortunately most likely affect a bunch of other addons as well.
---
What about Oqueor whatever it was in MoP. The creator of the add-on played on my server. Was a cross realm group finding add-on. Like the one used to form groups in WoD.
---
&gt;Inspecting and talking to them is nice, but doesn't really tell you much more than a decent gearscore addon could. 
---
It absolutely does.
---
Life Before Death.
---
Don't apologise for that kind of thing, no one is judging you here
---
Would people have prejudices against others that did not have Discord server access?
---
NA \^\_\^
---
Any weapon = hunter weapon here you go
---
This new LFG addon had a lot of automation built in, with client to client crosstalk, so clearly it wasn't just presenting information. It went much further than that.
---
Either way, Blizzard's decision protects Classic from deviating away from Vanilla and towards retail. If you believe in the spirit of Classic (i.e. putting in the work and not having things spoon fed to you), then the dev team's decision really shouldn't bother you. If it does bother you that much, then you need to have a long hard think about why you plan to play Classic, and not retail where all those easy mode features belong.
---
Papa bless blizzard
---
I think the question is at what costs. We do not know what Blizzard wants to change but it could cause side effects for many other Addons. For example roleplay Addons, DPS/threat meters, unit frames all kinds of Minigames(Poker or betting) and things like loot council dkp etc. Most of these Addons can only be realized in game and could be broken to break a add-on that can easily be outsourced to discord or a website.
---
Why do you think that an addon of this nature would detract from your vanilla experience?
---
nothing wrong with casuals. you can be casual and love classic for what it is. its just cancerous retail players trying to change classic into a game that its not.
---
All well and fine, but how do you realistically expect to stop stuff like this? Even if blizzard stops the functionality of ALL of these add-ons  (something I don't think they can do without breaking 100 other addons) 
---
What is to stop a discord server or a website?
---
The box has been opened and you just have to accept a lfg panel is coming.

Ye addons are not really supposed to be a big deal and only really help you set up a layout that you like. I feel the addons that are created go way overboard and make for a different game.

 What are your thoughts?  It's a bit more defensive at the cost of losing Blast Wave.
---
&gt;ClassicLFG is incompatible with our social design for Classic.  
---
Is that the quote you are talking about?  
---
I do not see anything at all in there about banning any addon and/or any restructuring of the current API.  
---
Will be fun to see what &amp; how they intent to change this without bricking every single other addon that utilize chat.  
---
hastagReality
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter how the addon works, or how it does what it does. What matters is what effect it has on the community and gameplay. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre removing it because it‚Äôs not a INTENDED functionality of classic wow. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so hard to grasp
---
Nah, it's fine.
---
I played in vanilla, and this addon isn't really that big of a deal.  I probably wasn't going to use it, but the fervor over it is ridiculous in my opinion.
---
You're on a public forum, dipshit.  You're talking to everyone.
---
You don't even understand how forums work.  No wonder you can't grasp the point.
---
The top comment in the thread is about the same thing.  You either scrolled past that without reading it, or failed to comprehend it multiple times.
---
To piggyback on to this point:
---
I agree that *if* an addon was built to neglect existing LFG/LFM methods and cause two mutually exclusive LFG pools- one with, and one without- that addon would be a problem. 
---
If the addon is built to be *inclusive*- not favoring joining or inviting people LFG with the addon over those without, purely by advertising the user's LFG/LFM state through the usual LFG chat channel so even people without the addon are aware of the group- then I believe the existence of the addon would be beneficial to everyone, *including* people without the addon. At that point, it's just preventing people and groups from falling through the cracks, helping overall more groups form, and reducing the incidents of groups falling apart because they didn't fill out that last slot before someone got fed up and left. 
---
People without the addon get the benefit of people with the addon still having a listed entry that they were LFG or LFM even after their message got pushed out of the chat window, and are easier to find. That's better for people *without* the addon than a world where the addon doesn't exist at all. It also reduces the rate at which chat LFG spam needs to happen, and makes manual group finding through chat easier as a result.
---
It's a bold move Cotton, lets see if it pays off.
---
bump
---
I‚Äôm indifferent on lfg and gs I just really enjoy a lot of classes during wotlk.
---
I can honestly see arcane being a super strong leveling spec, and its also used as the "Frost spec", so I'm not sure I agree. For pvp its garbage for sure.
---
Activision/Blizzard probably saw the success of OSRS and wanted to do the same with WoW.
---
Disagree
---
Human weapon skill is OP for PvE, Orc weapon skill is OP too.
---
Trolls are strong tanks since they can consistently get the 30% attack speed from bezerking.
---
Dwarf stone skin is a strong PvP tool.

---
&gt;It isn't about how the add-on literally function s but the social culture it creates.
---
Which is exactly why some people didn't want to play with streamers on their server. I'm hoping people that are against this add-on are also against playing with streamers.
---
One of the reasons for the magic of vanilla WoW was that your character choices were permanent, leveling was a grind and so was gearing up. This lead to a strong identification and emotional bond with the character you made and, ultimately, stronger immersion, more investment and a high quality playerbase. 
---
I am aware that nowadays it is fashionable that everything is casual and nothing is supposed to be really permanent, because "you might choose differently the next day". However, that is not classic WoW. If we want retail "modern" WoW instead of classic WoW, we should just play retail WoW. I hope the devs will make classic WoW classic, otherwise there is no point to it.
---
All you have to do is read the quest text and it says where to go
---
I remember I started playing WoW just ar the very end of Burning Crusade so I‚Äôm pretty hyped to check out what it was like before. I always read hours about AQ40 and old Naxx, I definitely want to reach raiding those famous 40 men raids.
---
As per my friends, I guess we‚Äôll go FOR THE HORDE! ‚úäüèª
---
Another idiot
---
Exactly!! It's human nature, and that's exactly my point. It's a prisoner's dilemma type scenario - by doing what's good for you in the moment you are causing more harm than the benefit you receive.
---
The problem with this type of add-on is that it makes this behaviour very easy to do. Rather than scrubbing a chat channel like vqueue does, it's quietly putting the info in front of you, with 0 cost to fulfilling your marginal biases.
---
I'm interested! Warrior willing to roll on Grob

---
That's what I'm looking forward to. The remade classic raids didn't really have the feeling of the real classic ones
---
I'm curious to see how the anti lfg people handle it when people still use the lfg addon and it still parses chat into lists of people/groups just like it always did.  Will they start crying again?  Will they just pretend it doesnt exist?
---
"If you're not doing it my way, you're wrong."
---
https://youtu.be/HdKqAVpUOwI?t=5
---
Fuckin tourists.
---
Why would you need this add-on in a game not at all designed for it?
---
That‚Äôs what the social side and friends list is for. 
---
The ‚Äúfaster I run dungeons‚Äù is just LFG and certainly didn‚Äôt help with social aspects.
---
The discord shit bugs me a lot too, but sadly there's nothing that can be done about that.
---
Do you not know that Thottbot and IRC chatrooms and BIS lists were a thing back then too?
---
F
---
I think your reaction is a little bit extreme.
---
I don't see how this idea removes any of the necessary socialization. You still have to whisper the person and send them an invite. Dungeons/raids being more difficult also means that communication is a necessity. Because you're on the same server, and are likely to encounter that person again, socialization is still encouraged.
---
I dunno, I think Classic promotes socialization in so many ways beyond spamming "LFG" that a small add-on like this would be inconsequential.
---
You all know the will fkup something and messup other addons also
---
Hey, not a problem.  I am glad I can help!
---
Server xfers were In vanilla tho..
---
&gt; There's so much misunderstanding about what the addon actually does. It's a glorified chat parser.
---
If that was true it would never have been an issue.  The chat parser was never a problem, automation was.  They will probably break the ability for addons to auto-invite and perhaps other API calls which can be used in automatic decision-making.
---
My pessimistic outlook would be that since Classic is still a sort of pet project at Blizzard the only people working on it and making design decisions are Blizzard "OGs" from the old days - perhaps with more autonomy than the leaders of the more major projects might have. If this is the case my concern would be that if Classic turns out to represent a potential cash cow for them that dynamic may change and the passionate og devs may lose their decision making power. 
---
Hopefully that's just a wacky theory and that never happens!
---
The harder you make it to implement stuff like this, the less likely people are to use it.
---
If they heavily disincentivize addons from the start, then that alone will make people reconsider I reckon.
---
Yep its so obvious these guys have ulterior motives
---
"However, when an add-on goes beyond presenting information or providing aesthetic customization, and attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely"
---
Not sure how watching a YouTube video on someone's views on the strengths and weaknesses of classes is in the same category as this
---
So glad for this. I've never played WoW without groupfinder so this is a welcome thing, and hopefully will help build a proper community.
---
RREEEEEEEEE fuck yourself. Go back to BFA.
---
What is a spell cleave leveling group?
---
You're obviously going to play classic wow enough that everyone has one on every character, thus the question is redundant, everyone gets it eventually.

---
I played a lot of RPGs in War3 custom games, so seeing this screen and hearing about WoW when it first came out was a dream.
---
well, classic pvp is "different"
---
I would say that, playing 100% optimal, it does have less skill than newer versions of wow. But classic doesn't rely only on classes, it also uses a lot of professions and weird items.
---
While you fight you have to decide how much do you care about winning that fight. Are you willing to use ALL the items you farmed/bought? Are you going to throw a grenade + pot + bandage + magic dust just in one fight? How many cds are you going to use? Unless talented, a lot of skills had, at minimum, 5 mins cds. If you use all in that fight you would be vulnerable for a lot of time.
---
Usually, you don't want to spend a hundred gold per fight, so you might have to use items in a creative way. Maybe fake a grenade cast so the opponent stop casting trying to dodge a grenade you won't even throw. Or just get better without using anything. During TBC I played a rogue and tried to win as many fight without using vanish.
---
I would say classic pvp is more about outplaying the other player rather than having more skills
---
The API and general coding experience from addon creators back then were very limited in comparison to today. If we let LFG tools such at these run rampant they will eventually get to a point like they are in retail, and sooner or later the addon becomes a must have for everyone. It doesn't matter that Call to Arms was a thing in Classic because it wasn't required, people weren't as tryhard it wasn't forced down your throat. Look at raider.io as an example. Trust me, if Blizzard doesn't take action against these addons, we would basically end up having a mini LFG tool in Classic sooner or later, which is not the direction the vast majority of people wanna go. It's why people wanna go back to Classic, so why is this such a big deal to you?
---
The biggest issue with this add-on, an not many people even brought it up is this, What comes after it? If it's allowed to thrive and be pushed onto people. Dps score integration? Some form of Ilvl check that will alienate people who play off-hand and whenever able. An if this addon is pushed and prodded for everyone to use WILL be a thing.  This addon could have been the precursor to no longer needing guilds, bringing back a social stigma in BFA that is not welcome or wanted in Classic. So the 'If you don't like it, don't use it' idea is bullshit. An it leads to bad things. Thank you Classic team for standing up for what we all waited years for.
---
Okay that makes sense. It seems like it can easily be done in a way that doesn't require keeping an open active connection to a single server, either polling to see if the queue members are still active or spreading the load across servers maintaining connections, but I can understand why there may be a real limit here.
---
Whoever puts the time in.
---
Stay away from the voodoo.
---
Super stoked to see this. I wasn't going to use the add-on, but allowing it to be in the game would have divided the community and seriously affected the social aspect of classic we all know and love. Thanks classic team
---
&gt; Discord which is exactly where groupfinding will go
---
Oh hell no.. keep your sanity intact and stay away from public Discords.
---
They have repeatedly since the announcement, but [here's their official response from today.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classiclfg-addon/263761/10?u=nukecrater-illidan)
---
It does, however it typically breaks naturally after 10-15 seconds
---
There is always that one asshole in the group.  I'm kinda dreading having to go back to when threat actually mattered.  DPS shouldn't really be much of an issue in general in Classic.  I can guarantee lack of threat management will cause significantly more wipes than low dps.
---
Meh, sleep for health.... this guy doesn't game.
---
What exactly happened? I too thought I was safe on Fairbanks.
---
I'm conflicted. This template meme has been regurgitated and beaten to death for far too long now but this is pretty well done.
---
Fuck no, Classic WoW isn‚Äôt free. 
---
But It‚Äôs only $15 a month to play the best game ever made. 
---
It also comes with this other free version of Classic WoW which is more millennial friendly I don‚Äôt know much about it but some people think it‚Äôs ok if you like being spoon fed.
---
So fkin jealous. üëçüèª
---
This video brings back memories
---
I still use "partially fused with infinity".
---
thanks for proving my point :) i didnt ask you to say why you didnt like retail, only this addon yet youre rebuttal was still 'retail bad' lol
---
Well, it breaks everything *if* they close off the hidden chat channels.  It does almost nothing to this one addon if they just remove the auto-invite-accept ability.
---
That's funny, my to do list is very similar, the only difference is the time that is different on my country
---
I'd say start with a hunter. It gives you a chance to play the game solo with a safety net in your pet, and group content as a non-critical class simply doing damage. Make sure you turn off your pets taunt ability in dungeons by right clicking it so it's not sparkling. If you make mistakes while solo as a hunter your pet will have your back. Warlocks have a pet but also a steeper learning curve than a Hunter.
---
No clue, and Blizzard likely won‚Äôt release numbers comparing the two. Subs will be way up and they will just leave it at that.
---
I like to put down a Hamstring or even Disarm as needed, and even a Demo Shout or Rend can be nice. At times when I see someone kiting things around I like to Charge/Hamstring the mobs on my way past
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
You also need to have 99% attendence, if MT isnt there 39 people are stuck especially in the early days.
---
Had a lot of fun taking back towers in AV while wearing a tuxedo
---
Because the youtubers/streamers have decided that all you need in wow is warriors, mages, and down rank spamming holy paladins.
---
The real question is, would it parse LFG DM as Deadmines or Dire Maul? /s
---
I played @ Cataclysm launch and I remember it was similar. Launch is going to be a shitshow as is. But if release was at like, noon on a Saturday? You would be sitting in a queue until Monday anyway.
---
Until wotlk classic, I hope
---
Did you repost it?  
---
Yes.
---
What did it cost you?
---
All the karmas.
---
This is beautiful, great work.
---
On another topic.... I wish that face and hair combo was possible for UD females, I always though she was very pretty &lt;3
---
A big reason I dislike retail these days is the lack of seeing someone with something cool and knowing that they got it by putting in a ton of time and effort. Or any effort at all.
---
Like in vanilla, seeing people with a different factions mount was a rare and awesome thing. Now everyone has a thousand different mounts and there's not much special about any of them.
---
This is caused by a Twitch App bug.  Twitch App often assigns the wrong game version for an addon (eg. TomTom is showing as 3.1.0, IceHUD as 2.0.1, World Quest Tracker as 7.0.3, GTFO as 3.2.0, Recount as 2.3.0, Skada as 3.0.9, etc).  Obviously all of these game versions are wrong and very out of date.
---
Even worse, sometimes, Twitch App doesn't get the game version right at all and it assigns an addon a game version of N/A.  This can cause the affected addons to disappear from Twitch App and this is the problem you are reporting here.
---
This problem only affects authors who publish updates from a code repository such as GitHub or CurseForge SVN.  Addons which are published via the website aren't affected by this bug.
---
The good news is that Twitch are aware of the bug and will fix it (hopefully sooner rather than later).  In the meantime, affected authors who publish from a repository can work around the bug by manually assigning the game version from the website after the file is published (this needs to be done twice, once to change the game version to something else and again to change it back to what it should be).
---
This gets quite laborious so hopefully Twitch fix this issue soon because it's making the Twitch App feel really pitiful when it can't even figure out what game version an addon is for.
---
&gt; Quite possibly something with the messaging systems as well. 
---
Im really curious to see if they go down that route, that would be a massive change and conflict with their nochange policy pretty hard, since many addons communicated via chat messages back then.  
---
interesting nonetheless.
---
besides making the addon?
---
Except this isn‚Äôt pure, its the opposite. These exact addons existed in vanilla and were widely used. Call to arms and vqueue were the shit
---
#FWOOOOM
---
Quick, go make /r/tbcwowplus

Rather than digging through all their previous discussions, [here's their official response on this from today.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classiclfg-addon/263761/10?u=nukecrater-illidan)
---
Say what you want about the addon, the fact that a video game environment would even produce this is slightly genius.
---
How exactly do you jump off from the original concept of "we want authentic vanilla wow" to this "Classic experience" you're espousing that is something completely different?
---
Man, I bet a ton of the people who loved Nostalrius for being as close to vanilla as they could get fucking hate this subreddit because the people that didn't even play (either Nost *or* vanilla) are clamoring for Blizzard to break things that actually existed and were used in 2006.
---
600 somethibg days played in my mage.
---
Cause it‚Äôs not
---
is this thex?
---
ok...
---
This didnt have automation?
---
His shirt is like two sizes too big.
---
I'm glad we are all Sanderfans gere
---
I think they just struggled to think of anything negative to say about Mages. 
---
Probably the most well rounded and capable classes and all aspects of the game with some amazing perks.
---
Thank you blizzard
---
This is almost as dumb as Barrens chat.
---
You can move quite a lot, you just have to stand still for the last 0.5 seconds of each auto shot and obviously when you‚Äôre casting aimed shot. Aside from that, move all you want.
---
Agree to disagree then. I think blizzard (who wrote the damn game) can figure out the difference between their own definition of a "interconnection social network" and what API calls actually create this functionality and useful addons like damage meters would. Not tooting my own horn, but I'm also a software engineer and these things don't even live in the same realm in terms of functionality. But if you prefer living in doomsday world, have at it.
---
3 months from now. 
---
Game will be dead when people see how awful end game content is. Bc and wrath raiding could save it so maybe blizzard rushes those
---
87 days
---
Retail and Progression servers will take turns leapfrogging one another as they release new content.
---
Not quite the same, but the summer before my senior year in college in 2006, I was at the peak of my Vanilla WoW raiding career. 
---
One of the biggest arguments I ever had with my parents came after they yelled at new for wasting my summer playing WoW.  Nevermind my 3.9 GPA and that I was a year away from finishing my bachelors in nursing (and also had a part time job), WoW was wasting my life. 
---
It sort of makes me laugh knowing I‚Äôm going to do it all over again but it‚Äôll be my wife and daughter yelling at me this time around (although they‚Äôre a lot more understanding).
---
Good luck with that in Classic. Especially when the general retail playerbase starts hitting max level.
---
Vocal minority of people who actually want to play classic and not a AFK simulator like BFA
---
thank god the addon will be disabled
---
Too bad Blizzard disagreed with you.
---
You are a BFA player that recently joined the Classic hype. I look forward to you quitting in week 2. Typical tourist, enjoy your dying retail WoW.
---
Holy shit the irony.
---
How hard do you think it would be to add a simple calculation of a person's average item lvl or some sort of value based on the average of their stats to show up when queueing, and do you really think the people wanting to use this add-on would reject that functionality? Congrats you just made gear score
---
I played a lot of HoN / LoL but never got into dota2.  I still watch 10 and know most of whats going on.  First place 15 Million usd+ is too good to pass up watching.
---
I can see being upset with that. Personally I (again) think there's the opposite side that if they gave a strict restriction, someone would just barely skirt around that and cause this whole drama all over again. 
---
The way I read it is they don't want anyone replicating social networking aspects of 'modern' WoW into Classic. ClassicLFG was more or less a bad version of the Premade Group Finder tool (RE: Not Looking for Dungeon). 
---
So I think for addon developers. This is a message as to not 'port over' any functionality that exists in Modern WoW that impact social interaction on both ends (IE: How you search for players affects them even if they don't know it, where as say a chat addon like Prat or WIM may not affect -how- you do something, just making something more readable. Which doesn't affect someone else.)
---
But yeah, I 100% understand being upset with it not being clear enough, but I also understand a necessity of some vagueness.
---
Cough server additions
---
Its not rocket appliances Julian
---
Using trade chat, global, /who, guilds is easy.
---
this post means the opposite of what you think it means.
---
My only real complaint is when grouped, the gather or slayer quest suuuuuuk.
---
Ice Thistle Yeti. They are one of the few mobs in the game that are humanoid but also skinable. I thought they dropped cloth too but apparently they don't.
---
Thank you sir
---
Don't pick your face, it will leave a scar.
---
Warlock.
---
Wow... so... basically not classic WoW at all. Good job fellas.
---
They can slow it down a bit and the people that have cleared everything can play regular servers until the expansions happen. I mainly just hope they do it eventually.
---
&gt; I‚Äôll get home from work an hour prior to servers going live. Should I instantly log in or does it not matter until the moment the server goes live?
---
+ Log in 1 hour prior and you'll get kicked for inactivity after about 30 minutes
---
+ Join the queue at any time prior to exactly 30 minutes going live and you're likely to be sitting in +10k queues
---
The problem is (much like at name reservation) that the servers probably aren't going to be 'open' exactly as the clock ticks over so you're having to gamble on
---
+ When the actual 'open' will be (time wise)
---
+ How many other people 'log in' prior to you late enough not to kicked for afk, but soon enough that they're at the front of the queue.
---
The comment you originally replied to was talking about lying about the addon segmenting players, that is what we were talking about.
---
You may not want to have a Druid icon while you say that.
---
Grama nazi in 2019 is so out of place when words like selfie exist
---
Is this really you? I remember watching this video when it came out haha
---
20lbs of smoked pork and a little slaw should do the trick
---
Addons were a part of classic though. And a big part.
---
In fact, there are addons that work in classic that are intentionally broken like Decursive.
---
Further, I can play classic and not want a classic experience. Except this is my choice. Just like you can choose no addons if you believe addons ruin your version of classic experience.
---
Like I've seen this pretty much exact meme so many times. How could this possibly be funny or unique after being done so many times? I guess I just don't understand anymore.
---
Same!
---
Well said. As much as I'm in love with this game and have nothing going on in my life right now and will binge it as much as I can, I would totally swap positions with you. &lt;3
---
To have an "authentic experience" you would need to be brainwashed to forget everything you ever knew about vanilla WoW, and then also not use Reddit, Discord, WoWHead, or anything else about the internet that has been created since 2006.
---
It's simply not possible.
---
For sure to the end of classic, I just want to see all the pve content. I may not rejoin if they ever reset and do fresh servers after phase 6. 
---
If they decide to go for Classic+ though.. I would most definitely play.
---
I don‚Äôt have much interest in TBC or WotLK.
---
Love how it gave him all dps
---
YEP
---
Yes you can move while not shooting, I think everyone knows that hunters have the ability to move like every other class.
---
not a bad idea tbh
---
I'm reasonably certain they don't need someone watching, they can probably set up a script to gather all the data from the server.
---
Neither would anyone on your voice comms.
---
Why does it matter? As long as people's preference stays up and running it's only a good thing as everyone gets what they want
---
How can you be sad about it? I ion said at blizzcon, if people use the new technology that allow addons to speak with eachother to make things they took out of the client (like lfg) they would be forced to break it
---
I'm playing dwarf rogue because I love the restealth vs rogues / warriors / hunters and standing a chance vs ud priests.
---
For me with 26k achievements, appearances tab completed, 400 toys and mounts etc it's just shy of 400 days.
---
I‚Äôm sure that your wife loves that.  
---
A - Fucking - Mazing, btw.
---
Buff before instance.
---
It auto invites even if you dont have the addon. as long as the person starting the group has it.
---
The largest demographic will likely be those who play both going back and forth between patches. Since it's all the same sub, it matters very little who has more at the end of the day. People will just play whatever happens to be fresh at the moment.
---
Holy shit they did it.  This blows me away how much they are responding to the community.
---
Well, that's Reddit as a whole. If you manage to discover a cool subreddit that's not very well known and stick around, eventually you'll see it grow into something really, really, really lame.
---
I leveled a mage in early vanilla started as arcane.  It has a 10% chance per spell cast not tick / missile.  Arcane explosion / blizzard / cone of cold is 10% per cast not per target hit.
---
Imagine thinking classic will be real vanilla. Don‚Äôt think you will have issues with 20k pop servers.
---
As far as I know (and iirc some streamers blew up about it) it is being carried over.
---
Is $15 a month REALLY that detrimental to your life? I‚Äôll never understand that. I spend $40 to go to a movie with my significant other after tickets and popcorn. That‚Äôs for 2 hours of entertainment. Then there is a game that I would spend a minimum of like 50-80 hours a month. $20/hour vs $0.3/hour. The devs spent time and money on getting this functional and worthy of releasing, that‚Äôs worth the money to me.
---
What does the GetTime yada yada ya actually referring to? Normally macros are pretty self explanatory and this one may be as well but I'm lost
---
Nah ill just avoid wow forums until they fix it.
---
BLIZZARD IS BACK BABY
---
I have absolutely no clue what is going on with the loot tables and it‚Äôs really annoying and confusing. I just hope Atlasloot is accurate, so I don‚Äôt have to go research patch dates for every item.
---
Saved. Cheers
---
I made a lvl 1 UD priest as I intend to do monday just to scratch that itch.
---
Man have they dumbed stuff down.  I could pull 3-4 things at once no problem at level 3 and not die, never even think about mana use.
---
Can't wait to see the flood of "what's the big deal, y'all are over reacting" bfa players
---
Got it. Thank you very much for the information, quite useful
---
There's been a few interviews where they've said as much, [here's one of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo&amp;t=12m20s).
---
According to Blizzard, after checking the reference client, it is working as it should be in 1.12 patch of Vanilla WoW. They also said they are stilling looking into things like this and will keep making adjustments to changes that were made within the Vanilla timeframe. 
---
Check out [https://youtu.be/fREa-rfs8aU?t=1453](https://youtu.be/fREa-rfs8aU?t=1453) for Blizzard's side on skeletons. Also, watching the whole thing would be good, too. It gives more information on  blizzards side of things.
---
Grammar*
---
Hmm I‚Äôm planning on going into enchanting and tailoring. I wonder if I could somehow capitalize on the twink market...
---
Server transfers at the end of vanilla were a case by case basis though per sever.  You could transfer from one server to a specific low pop server.  And you couldn't not race change without a little bug and could not faction change or change from pvp to pve server.  It's a delicate topic to go over.  Also you could not transfer to a new server till it was like (3 months old)?  Also no transfering every week you had a cooldown.
---
yeah but what if I just where Twill?
---
&gt;This is not at all how Vanilla was, so why are the devs changing the loot tables for Classic? Widen the gap between hardcore raid guilds and everyone else? This is shameful.
---
This isn't Vanilla WoW its Classic WoW. They also didn't have 1.12 talents when Vanilla launched. They aren't remaking vanilla. This is the closest they can do to Vanilla and they aren't changing loot tables for raids like that.
---
are you telling me gatherer and threat meters or incoming heal addons didnt talk to each other in classic...
---
This needs cast time &gt;&lt;
---
Nah your opinion is just completely moronic on so many levels. You purist bunch is what will kill the community in classic. You have this preconceived notion that this will take you back in time and you can relive something you enjoyed. Sure, nostalgia will hit but soon after getting max level you'll see how bad and unrefined end game content is and you'll be begging for changes. 
---
Retail has tons of mistakes that make it bad but wow classic will have many more and it will die and will only be bolstered by releases of other expansions where the game was actually good.
---
Only the most refined shitposts deserve this level of admiration
---
It's a bannable mod (Not addon) that allows you to chose your character model to be any valid NPC display ID in the game on your client (Only visable to you). So anything from other races to bosses to a random boar. 
---
For the longest time it was under the radar / hard to detect for Blizzard, but they literally just had a mass ban wave regarding it a few months ago on live.. so I don't know why anyone would be asking if it's okay. lmao
---
Still great news.
---
made an ugly ass dwarf priest named karren for a future twink. talk to the manager haircut and all. gonna MC yo ass to 'make it right'
---
&gt; Dude, it's a post made by community manager. Their job is to spew PR bullshit.
---
Hold up.. you actually think Bornakk took it upon himself to make this decision on behalf of Blizzard?  You can't be serious.  He just spits out a prepared statement of what he was told to by the higher-ups in the chain who actually got together, examined the addon closely and its implications, looked at community feedback, then made a final decision.  How are you this naive?
---
This guy has a great Don McLean/ John Denver vibe.
---
Never heard this one, thanks for sharing  :)
---
Actually, in terms of the communication with addon developers they've been basically radio silent according to the WA developers, which is apparently a 180 degree turn from what the retail team does. You're not telling wrong information, but maybe this addon wouldn't even existed (in this form), had the classic team communicated better and more clearly which types and functionality of addons go way to far.
---
Fatty bear livers? Okay stupid world quest in Azsuna. I'm onto you.
---
The real question is how did he so perfectly slide the shirt on top of the bear can with absolutely no resistance or tug
---
Thank you for the response I will take all of your answers into consideration. Trust me I know as good as anyone that I will be robbing myself of the classic leveling experience, but I am most looking forward to raiding anyway and my buddies guild that I am in has a leveling time requirement. Also, that is just my personality, I feel as though I have to plan everything, do everything as fast as possible and efficiently. I wish I could take it low and slow, but I can't so I appreciate you helping with my cause, thank you.
---
Don't be stupid.
---
It would probably be more efficient to level an alt to farm gold to pay for your respec cost
---
People believe all types of stupid shit, flat earth etc. There's just dumb people out there.
---
Right. A chat filter/searcher would be cool.
---
616 hours played. I am... Ashamed. :(
---
Blizzard should take the population cap and divide it between the two factions on PvP servers, giving each a separate queue.
---
Not like a battleground queue--it wouldn't behave any differently based on the other faction's population. It would be like each faction had their own login server completely independent of the other.
---
Lok‚Äôtar Ogar!
---
Vqueue came way later and its a pserver addon, call to arms has 1/10th of the downloads this does already.
---
They arnt the same at all
---
Oof where to start. They're not banning the add-on, they're restricting the API the add-on, and other similar add-ons, use to parse chat and auto invite. So no, another one won't pop up  Secondly, have fun using discord to form groups. Literally no different than typing "LFG SM" in the looking for group channel in game. Why do you want to play classic of this is how you plan to interact socially in the game?
---
Days!*** not hours. So, so much worse.
---
i play on WoD private servers and im pissed
---
Yes, and that is confirmed blizzlike.  On some private servers, every missile/target of an AoE spell could proc it.  This bug would naturally make arcane levelling insane.
---
Nah man don‚Äôt feel bad, we all count on you guys to save us from enemy 2v1‚Äôs and low HP ganking. 
---
I‚Äôll buff a hundred horde rogues without a second thought, knowing at some point one of you is gonna pop out of stealth and save my ass. Karma repaid.
---
Molten core and onyxia are not hard....and i would be willing to bet those items where added in the later patch to fix some item imbalance issues. Adding them at the start makes sense if the devs added them originally to fix a problem from launch. This isn't BFA loot rules and guilds will use ML systems aswel as the items actually dropping. They arn't changing the loot tables, stop overreacting.
---
Wow this is what I like to see....OG game and OG attitude....BLIZZARD LAYING DOWN THE LAW.
---
unexpected Sanderson, to be sure.
---
and so the lfg website was born
---
I took a peek at the Addons thread that is linked here, trying to get an idea which addons I might want to use. The thread didn't really help much with which I should use as it was mostly just people asking if something would work in Classic, I was wondering if anyone has a brief list of mods I might want to check out and consider using at launch. Thanks.
---
Just because something 'can' drop doesn't mean it will.
---
They've given countless (logical, rational) reasons for why things are the way they are and by the time it'll even matter (i.e. battlegrounds) the difference will be negligible.
---
If you can somehow find a way to argue who someone getting loot from PvE to support their progression of PvE content, when they are not part of your PvE group somehow negatively influences your PvE experience, by all means do so.
---
balls balls balls balls balls -- steel steeeeeeeeeeeel
---
And scatter shit, intimidate, beastial wrath, wing clip, raptor strike, mongoose bite, deterrence, aspects, etc.
---
Funny numbers
---
I hear ya... But it‚Äôs different this time because there‚Äôs no expansions to come, no stat crunches, etc... it‚Äôs not never-ending, and as an adult without a lot of free time, it‚Äôs a really appealing and places a much higher value on my time than retail would. Just my two cents.
---
Destruction in leveling ? That's insane, pet can't hold the aggro of crits. Demonology is better, even if nothing beat affli in leveling
---
Raiding in affliction is "okay" ? That's like a crime against demonology you can't put a single dot &gt;&lt;
---
I agree with the rest
---
WARLOCK FOR LIFE
---
&gt; All this does is encourage players to rush to 60 and kill Ragnaros so they can attain these top end items faster.
---
Do you seriously think this wouldn't happen regardless?
---
If I have the time to level, would it just be more simple to have two and have them permantently specced? :)
---
If I were to quit classic I would NEVER play retail. That is a mobile game adapted for pc.
---
Why did you delete it?
---
The raids are great. The classes are mind numbingly boring and homogenized. BfA class design is perhaps the worst it's ever been. There are no spells left, and nothing endgame to enhance your playstyle.
---
Those White Castle frozen burgers are nasty.
---
Very true. I'll probably take a tolerence break starting soon until classic comes out then go hard on grinding for like 8 hours and take hits in between to keep myself going to frankenstein levels. Think when you havn't blazed in a while and you take some tokes that keep you up until 4am. Then when I'm crashing from that I'ma drink one of those salted caramel java monsters. Should be a easily a solid 16 hour sesh. Love grinding on wow, you never know when a cool pattern, epic or bag will drop at any moment! I'm kind of treating classic as a looting simulator since I'm a bit burned out on Path of Exile. Screw my level I'm getting leather, whelps and cool/unique drops. ;)
---
something else will come along. If you think anyone other than the vocal minority on reddit and other sites are indicative of the entire player base, I got news for you.
---
Plus with servers that have 15k+ (minimum) after a couple of weeks the constant spamming of LFG will make it damn near impossible to keep up with trying to find a group.
---
Man this community is pretty exhausting to engage. If you disagree with anything you are bombarded with "Go back to retail!!". Turned into a bit of a toxic mess before the game even launched.
---
Dang, I thought we were 3 days away! Suddenly it's more than 2 months away :(
---
yes! i remember something like that, but tbh i would be ok if they add server transfers with a CD.  
---
I mean if you transfer to a server, you need to stay there for at least 90 days. I think this in going to happen, especially with Herod. iirc transfers back then had a cd.
---
Were it not for the Demolock rework, I would have stopped playing BfA a month or so into the expansion. The spec is tons of fun right now. But I understand that some other class specs are in a near desolate state.
---
Woah, I don't want you sucking my dick too.
---
Discord will not be more convenient than the in game chat.
---
You will want fireball / scorch at max rank too because some quest mobs are resistant to frost.
---
Well that genuinely upsets me. I‚Äôm with the streamers on this one.
---
My Druid, also from December 2004, has around 400 days. Haven't played the last few expansions though.
---
A multi boxer with 40 chars and the right tools could clear all content eventually.
---
Yes lol. I never played druid in classic though. I stuck with Mage and Rogue. Druid become my go to when they added Flap.. jk Lmao. I just really liked Feral when it became a little better late in the xpacs
---
Are you being willfully ignorant of the point of classic? Do you understand why the current game is a garbage fire? This fucking logic sucks.
---
‚ÄúPlease make game easy for me like BFA.‚Äù
---
What a fucking d bag.
---
Please don't share self-harm here
---
Make an alt, opposite faction, and play through it slower. Trust me- you are going to miss the majority of the game and it‚Äôs a damn shame.
---
The only real solution
---
For anyone worried, I do plan on (if no one else does) coming up with a workaround to keep a LFG AddOn a thing. Too many people I know avidly used them in Classic and I consider this blue post to be absurd. I don‚Äôt intend to use it myself (I didn‚Äôt even play Classic and I want that experience), but the disallowance of it is stupid enough of a decision that I will put work into getting around this idea.

---
People who use or need this seriously need to reevaluate their upcoming classic experience
---
I would imagine bwl would be a pretty hard roadblock. Mc would be incredibly difficult but if you did something like 40 pally multibox with best possible gear I guess it's theoretically possible.
---
Gnome a cute
---
It rewards that type of playstyle and widens the gap between those that don't.
---
These items were not in Molten Core at launch. The gap between dungeon weapons and raid weapons was not that wide, because most of the best items in Molten Core were added until 6 months after launch. In Classic they will be there day 1.
---
There are two ways a species evolves, physically from genes, and culturally from memes.
---
I think TBC and wotlk are almost an inevitability unless classic flops which seems incredibly unlikely at this point.
---
Personally I'd love to see both pure classic and classic+. Worst case scenario they mess it up and there's still classic. But I really think Flying mounts and daily quests go against so much of classic. LFG was the final component that triggered the avalanche that lead to retail WoW.
---
I honestly think there is so much they can do in classic that would further the sense of world and encourage player interaction. As well as providing more content for leveling, solo, and small group content
---
Remember that time you got banned for being a sloppy crying vagina?
---
from the post they clearly find addon listing other addon users' groups "problematic"  
---
ilvl will exist one way or another
---
Not confirmed but my guess is yes. ANYONE that kills a civilian gives the ENTIRE GROUP that same dishonorable kill loss of honor / rep if any. This is why I think having a 'pet' that is 'part' of your 'group' even if not in a party most likely also shares the loss.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
protip: they are trolling
---
And if it was gaining enough steam in Vanilla, they would have taken a hard look at it. The reason they allowed it back then was because add ons weren't as popular as they were today. There is definitely a popularity factor that determines to whether you shut down an add on that may be a problem or not.
---
Umm yes?
---
Me not that kind of orc.
---
Yeah but they all played back in the day and have been asking for classic for years too guys. 
---
[can I get away with this here?](https://i.imgur.com/xVKtPJF.jpg)
---
&gt;There is obviously the auto invite function and auto inspect funcion which shows you info about the dude, but it's worthless and can be deleted from addon with no charm to it's funcionality.
---
Wait what?  That's the ENTIRE reason people wanted it banned.  Noone gives a flying fuck about the chat parsing bit.  Hell I want an addon that filters through the spam, that's totally ok.
---
Poor addon creator/-s behind this infamous LFG addon. This was my reaction, with them in mind upon seeing the blue post by the way:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LM0CZZ9Uw8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LM0CZZ9Uw8)
---
I was under the impression that an lfg addon would be a glorified chat filter (which is what I want). But I could never see that shit working out in classic. That's too much. I still want a chat filter addon so can finder groups better in trade chat.
---
Are you seriously trying to argue that the presence or absence of &lt;item xyz&gt; is the difference between a raid-geared level 60 being able to gank you (or not gank you) successfully, when you're not level 60 and in leveling gear? Or are you literally being pedantic about the difference between 2 shot and n shot (where n is any number greater than 2)?
---
Did you bother reading it?
---
Regardless, it doesn't matter. Blizzard neutered the add-on rendering it useless. Despite my downvotes, looks like common sense prevailed after all.
---
Go back. More horde means more horde for me to smash.
---
I'm just gonna be playing differently this time around
---
city raids were a lot more impactful when all of Orgrimmar was coated in a layer of skeletons
---
oh yeah, i agree.  
---
Probably phase 3 or around that time.
---
Just want to comment to show my support for this. I think most of the people who were defending the addon were more so saying they don‚Äôt think blizzard will actually do anything to stop the addon. Glad to see they‚Äôre putting their foot down.
---
I liked this series.

---
Your assumption that ‚Äúsomething else will come along‚Äù  is wrong. Addons cannot connect to the internet and their only way of networking was is standardized chat messages. If that‚Äôs taken away, there‚Äôll be no networking thus no addons like this.
---
Judging by my 12 year old self it may be the opposite
---
Unless you get to Naxx it wasn't really useful knowledge anyway. Wasn't worth taking some crappy spell hit gear for taunt resists until you got to four horsemen in Naxx. By then you ran ZG until your main and off tanks all had the fishing reel spell hit trinket just for that one fight.
---
Actually, OP never made such a statement. Read carefully:
---
&gt; I would far rather get into a group more easily and **then** actually talk to players while playing the game.
---
lmao are you implying you want layering in classic?
---
I don't know what else you want to call them but someone who's been playing an mmo for several years and who's played long enough with its economy (or have knowledge of real life economics) to understand all its intricacy, and knows how best they can get a monopoly through resource control, as well as how to use, and most importantly make (cause not everyone can code) third party tools and addons to help enforce that monopoly, to me, is a hardened veteran. As in, they know much, much more shit than the average player, and can use that knowledge to get an edge over everyone else.
---
But ... that's what it looks like to me. I might be wrong. They might be trolling, their strategy might collapse near instantly, Blizz might just pop in and ban them, they might be in over their heads. It still looks very possible to me that without any Blizz intervention, they will achieve a monopoly and succeed in funneling most of the realm's gold into their pockets. Player-driven efforts might make a dent, but their goal here seems to be 24/7 camping of resources, and only 24/7 ganks from "freedom fighters" will have an effect. Such server-wide coordination seems unlikely to me. But I have to admit, it would be very fun to see it happen, and it would make a very interesting server-wide pvp "player event". What would be nearly as fun would be seeing them all get banned by Blizz. But in any case, none of it would change how I'd call them.
---
A streamer told them to hate it
---
While it was zoomed out I thought explore said expire. I was very confused why you wanted to die. Azeroth.
---
Oh wow good job, for some reason I thought this was random footage from something else and you just pasted a date and timestamp on it.... haha
---
 **Marcus Aurelius:**  
---
There was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile.  ‚Ä¶.. Same as WOW classic. Thank you devs.
---
Many of these Molten Core weapons were not in Vanilla until 6 months after launch. Adding them into Classic on Day 1 means that hardcore players will have access to far superior weapons. This affects the balance of aspects like PvP. It trivializes dungeon gear and widens the gap between a hardcore raider and the rest of the players. Do you understand what I am saying?
---
That staff.... It will be mine... Oh yes... It will be mine...
---
when the bulk of fatties on reddit complain what do you expect
---
Jaded from the wait much?
---
Lmao if you need addons beyond bartender in classic you shouldn't be calling others keyboard turners.
---
I mean... you could... but that seems like a huge time sink. You could roll an alt and just pay the money to respec from the double income, and have more farming potential. Priests can‚Äôt farm gold very well anyways.
---

---
Aw man did they scrap that idea? I thought we could toggle between new models and old? :( That sucks.....major turnoff for me
---
hopefully they will remove the other cheat addons as well, like the TSM thing that automates the entire auctionhouse for you
---
We will see. I just like to talk to people I play with and socialise, but some people just want to stfu and get loot.
---
Set one of the monitors to auto decline duels, that might work
---
Literally the moment they "break" it the new version that only uses trade/lfg parsing will be out lol.
---
the thing you're missing is that my 100 hours of classic prep makes classic that much closer
---
Fury Warriors first- then either Pally/Sham
---
It's literally just reading LFG and giving you a list of people who are looking. What's not okay about it?
---
Imagine crying on the internet because you have to use 1/100th on your attention span to talk to people in a video game.
---
2 repeat phrases in a row isss idk hmmm. Wasn't ever a fan of it in poetry or rap, doesn't fit tooo well in song either
---
I'll spare you the plea to stop and smell the roses and enjoy the game.  
---
Being that you're playing a mage specifically you have a few options for how you want to level because mages have the unique ability to aoe grind. This is generally considered the faster way to level, but on a fresh pvp server unless you do manage to get significantly ahead of the crowd you may not be able to gather up enough mobs to AOE grind in the world, or pull it off without getting ganked. I saw a video on YT the other day where an UD mage AOE grinds silverpine from 17-20 in a little over an hour.
---
I havent actually played a mage in classic so I cant really say much for spells. Any time frost bolt ranks up seems obvious. Any new rank of AOE spells also seems obvious if you're trying to AOE grind.
---
Not sure what the benefit of upgrading spells like nova, sheep, or blink early. 
---
If you really dont want to think for yourself I'm pretty sure zygor is going to have an addon for classic. If you pay for a subscription on his site you can download it and it will provide an in game guide 1-60
---
It was something us regulars could get off every once in a while and be like "YO I GOT HIM WHAT MY STEALTH DIDN'T BREAK!"
---
Think about the average PC specs in 2004-2006 and then ask your question while looking in the mirror.
---
Wouldn't it get annoying to keep respecing back and forth, or does it not work like that?
---
Classic is an optional game that people that don't want it don't have to have.
---
You know it. You already know the truth.
---
See you in Azeroth at 4:30am getting a group to snag some dragons. See you at home.
---
I did. You're all fucking retarded. He wasn't in charge of his father's company, and the settlement said company paid out was an anti-slapp settlement, not a fraud settlement.
---
I don't even like Tipps, I think he's cringe and out of his element. I'm not defending him, I'm just taking a big ole justified shit on reddit retards that rile themselves up over somethings ***they*** won't bother looking up.
---
Reddit detectives are fucking magical. Knocking them out of the park since the Boston Bombers.
---
Classic is saved!
---
Thank you SO much for doing this! (again)
---
first time i saw the gnome i went AHHHh!! WTF
---
I consider transfers NOCHANGES 
---
as long as there is the cooldown i think its always been 30 days?
---
so sure if someone badly wants a name change they can transfer off a server then transfer back 30 days later
---
im sure someone did stupid things like this back in the day, i only ever used the free transfers most servers had
---
If you don't think that the ClassicLFG app has "anything" in common with Discord LFG instead then you clearly don't actually know how the ClassicLFG app worked. All it did was replicate the Dungeon Finder feature in the current version of WoW, a system that has existed in some form since The Burning Crusade.
---
Without this functionality players will simply go to Discord and do [this](https://i.imgur.com/t1CkPNX.png). Which, might I add, is [exactly how the ClassicLFG addon looks](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/45344-wow-classic-addons-classiclfg/).
---
This is the LFG channel in the Destiny 2 Discord which exists because Destiny 2 doesn't have an in-game method of looking for groups (and you can't find people in local chat because there's rarely enough people to pool from). There's nothing major happening here, it's just an inconvenience that I have to go through because there is no in-game alternative.
---
The only difference the ClassicLFG addon has was the ability to send an invite to listed players automatically (which is just sending the /invite command in-game, it's not black magic) without having to first message them and alt+tab out of the game to see/find shit.
---
There is functionally zero difference between having [this](https://i.imgur.com/t1CkPNX.png) list presented either in-game or on a separate app in the exact same way as it's seen here. [As said, this is literally the main feature of the addon.](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/45344-wow-classic-addons-classiclfg/)
---
If you think that whispering someone "invite plz" or spamming Trade with "lf1m healer" is a good example of social interaction then you need to fucking get out more. Two words don't constitute a fucking conversation.
---
It depends entirely on how much you plan to respec. If you only need to respec twice a week then I'd probably stick to 1 priest. If you want to be playing shadow all the time and respecing every day to dungeon/raid and then back shadow (especially if this happens multiple times a day), then a 2nd priest becomes a whole lot more appealing.
---
It's also a time equation. Is it worth the time to level another priest (not insiginificant at all) and then gear a 2nd priest at level 60 vs earning gold for respecs. If you farm your gold (via gathering professions or just killing mobs) then eventually there's going to be a point where you invest more time farming gold than leveling and maintaining 2 characters. If you have a more efficient way to make gold, say via rare crafting recipe or AHing, then you may find it easier to just stick with 1 priest.
---
Someone needs to make an add-on where people can flag themselves for the dungeons they are interested in doing, and then anyone can look up a list of all the names of people that are interested in those dungeons.
---
This would allow players to avoid the trade chat spam thing, while still requiring groups to form organically through messaging people that have shown interest in doing the same dungeon.
---
Good point.
---
So you want full T2 in Molten Core? That's how it was. That would probably be worse.
---
T2 was removed from MC and stats changed, that's why the loot table is the way it is from 1.4
---
They're using 1.4 loot table because it'd be weird to have full T2 early only for your stats to change when P2 arrives.
---
I did look it up. You're all fucking retarded. He wasn't in charge of his father's company, and the settlement said company paid out was an anti-slapp settlement, not a fraud settlement.
---
soul shards management is an inconvenience at worst, its massively blown out of proportion when people say its a big deal
---
Paid server xfers included?  Because get ready.
---
"Nochanges" is from the time when we thought classic might just be a vanilla like retail game. When we didn't want group finder or achievements. To apply that to the game in it's current state is a little shortsighted.
---
Classic is full of changes where it matters and lacks changes where it goes against their pillars. I believe in protecting the game integrity and providing a authentic experience. This is obviously what they are doing here and what they have said they will do all along.
---
Should watch the 2 1/2 Q and A with dev's on classiwow or whatever it is called. They go into depth why they do what they do especially on loot in question. Do not understand the rants without research.
---
As if this addon existing would've stopped that from happening.
---
This is disgusting, please just stick to retail.
---
The parts that talk to each other. Hell, threatmeter would be broken.
---
The old addons had a range of like 40 yards or something, so to stay synched, they would use a special channel to let each other know what was happening.
---
40 yards is 36.58 meters
---
It‚Äôs viable in BWL if you have good hit gear. Reason being crit cap. Hit expands your crit cap enough to make SF daggers viable. Crit cap is reachable in MC, but it is a much lower crit cap than in AQ where hit is on like every piece. It goes without saying that high crit percentage is what makes SF viable. So AQ is where most people consider SF viable, but BWL gear + world buffs is still more powerful than unbuffed BiS AQ gear (honestly probably on par with unbuffed Naxx gear). That‚Äôs why I said SF is viable earlier than AQ in top guilds that don‚Äôt wipe and therefore you retain world buffs.
---
I am saying that adding Molten Core items such as weapons from 1.4 gives a huge advantage to hardcore raiders. These items from 1.4 were not in Vanilla until 6 months after launch. In Classic you can earn them during the first week after launch. It affects the balance of the game.
---
Exactly. I haven't played for over 8 years. Foolish to think I or anyone like me would go back to retail if that bullshit invaded classic. That slippery slope BS made me quit in the first place, and I'd be happy to vote with my wallet again.
---
that human chick is a smoke show!
---
It‚Äôs not always that simple of an interaction in vanilla but okay 
---
hope you enjoy your BfA mobile game experience lol
---
Got proof?
---
Looks awesome dude!
---
You can‚Äôt huh? Lol
---
It‚Äôs not that annoying to do, but it does cost gold. But let‚Äôs say you are a decently fast leveler and it takes you 7 days /played to get to 60. Is spending a week of your life to repeat leveling the same class worth the gold??? I‚Äôd find that more annoying.
---
Can you tell me in PM who/what you are talking about everything with info got deleted in here...was on Whitemane and then hecked off to Stalagg when server pop got big but now the French are invading Stalagg....I just checked Whitemane and got my old name back so I‚Äôm flexible.
---
King's honour friend
---
You ok mate?
---
Omg don't bring up hots, dumpster fucking fire from the beginning
---
Yeah, and gear out two characters, no big deal. Oh wait, huge deal.
---
Real talk I couldn't care less about the lfg addon I just love watching you guys lose your minds over it because you think 
---
1.  It'll ruin the game
---
2.  That it can be stopped
---
Later dude good luck with the low critical thinking
---
I think this is right, don't make much sense though as boomer refers to a specific timeframe after WW2 where the population exploded.
---
I saw this, was it on TV Highway?
---
All of mc and bwl could be cleared by multiboxing but only some bosses in AQ and Naxx would realistically be doable.
---
I‚Äôm actually planning on soloing mc/ony/bwl by multiboxing hehe
---
Nailed, it. Thank you!
---
lol why are you so upset he doesnt use addons?
---
I don't know if you can say "will not work in Classic WoW." In their post they stated " we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it. " I think they will just try to make it so there is not auto invite and it can't check your talents. 
---
That's just my opinion, anyways. I am just glad they responded quickly and are focused on making Classic WoW similar to Vanilla WoW in almost all aspects.
---
WutFace
---
3spoopy5me
---
Yeah me too what a scrub who didn't know. 
---
What's this post about again?
---
if you get any of the bis items- throw them in your bank for a few months then once your server is well into raiding throw it up on the AH and get rich
---
Thank you! The gf didn't appreciate it! Lol
---
Just remember, Everyone is a Little Bit Racist lol
---
They kinda hard to find. Some grocery stores sell them and they also come in big cans too.
---
Depending on what stores you have in ‚Äòbama, I‚Äôve seen them at Publix and Fred Meyer.
---
No wonder I get my ass kicked in PvP
---
Glad I could help friend
---
No
---
I definitely will do that. Initially, I will miss out on the experience, but down the line, I want to get the experience because I agree that would be a damn shame.
---
wow. didn't expect that at all, but cool!
---
This isn't true.  I've done the job so have first-hand experience.  The people freeing your character from being stuck, returning items to you, answering questions, banning hackers......these are the guys that are low level.  
---
But tickets about shit like a Devilsaur mafia will get escalated and then you get the senior GM's involved.  And they have the power to not give a fuck.  They will just come straight in with the ban hammer.  I've witnessed it.
---
I'm telling ya right now.....Devilsaur mafia's wont last long unless they are sophisticated.  If a GM logs on and sees alliance and Horde sharing mobs,  dance around each other and selectively killing in pvp......everyone involved is getting a 24 hour ban on the spot.
---
/r/cringe
---
That would kill boss mods and such that whisper you when you're the Geddon bomb or something. My assumption is that they're just going to remove the ability for mods to invite to party.
---
The boomer thing is a meme. Google '30 year old boomer'.
---
It's just a meme reference to oldest millennials.
---
I won't need luck since everything in classic is so absurdly mechanically easy, any retail player with the gear will have absolutely no problem being at peak efficiency.
---
Like the only thing you could say retail players would be bad at would be the long grinds, which are already done if they have better gear.
---
There is an LFG/autoinvite already in classic/vanilla if you use the meeting stones/talk to innkeepers.
---
You probably shouldn't play if you don't think you will be able to limit or control yourself like an adult.
---
I mean that's basically what got a lot of people quitting or taking a long break from WoW :\[
---
I dont think the part they want to break have anything to do with chat and instead alot more to do with how the addons can speak with other people with the same addon over the API. That was atleas what Ion hazzikostas said they were afraid people would use those features to create addons like lfg addons
---
My man, do you not realize people used outside severs for this during vanilla? They don‚Äôt want it in game because of what it leads to ( looking at raider.io and gear score ). Vanilla players used icq and ventrilo, what‚Äôs different about discord?
---
I sell only the _finest_ goods.
---
the dude who made the 116 hour record is expecting 96 hours himself, and he has a heart condition.
---
80-90 is expected from the more modern speedrunners.
---
You'd rather not play than implement group finders, but also won't have time or energy to play due to the lack of a group finder?
---
That alone doesn't condemn him.
---
Now, if he were to read this post and immediately go on a tirade about the "oppressive Blizzard taking [him] down" then sure, feel free to call him a prick.
---
But as it stands, no, merely making the add-on is not enough.  If he didn't, someone else would have.
---
Honestly... Just because Austin Powers was great, I may consider Bigglesworth, but... Lord Incendius, master of flame still is pretty sex.
---
You think you think, but you think
---
Yes it is.
---
Classic is so much more about positioning than editions I played, which seemed much more about memorizing the correct order to defeat certain classes and forcing cooldowns. 
---
It just seems so much more natural and fluid. As a person who likes both pvp and pve I love that the gear I get raiding isn't useless in pvp.
---
Well, they are naturally useless in Classic. The itemization doesn't even allow for any practical uses of it. Like, there are quite a few items that are below level 60 and are BIS for a lot of classes until AQ. One example would be the Rivendare caster chest.
---
This is coming from someone with a guild who wont need the addon regardless.  
---
The concept is so basic that I dont see a way for blizzard to prevent this addon from existing.  Good thing is people will be too busy playing to want to code so it likely will be a minute before it reappears.
---
There is alot of irony in people just blindly parroting streamers and not understanding how little the addon actually was planned todo.
---
Also, vanilla wow api was probably the most wide open in the games history.  Hilarious how many "no changes" people are expecting blizzard to heavily change the game to meet their whims.
---
I just hope this doesn't destroy too many other addons.  I'm not intimately familiar with the classic api yet, but again the addon was very simple stuff so breaking it will break countless other things.
---
Thanks so much for making all of these; they've been delightful!
---
You can always ride that spiraling downward train into the madness that is addiction. I'm fucking conducting it all the way to crazy station where you slowly slip into the void of grinding and dungeons.
---
I see your point. I guess people just value that differently!
---
The circlejerk were coming you and your LFG groupies. Typical tourist trying to fight your precious LFG feature. Stick to BFA. I look forward to you quitting in 2 weeks.
---
I find it impressive. Lots of people are mocking them but at least one of them had the knowledge and dedication to make an entire addon (and a third party program apparently). It might be for shitty reasons but it's still impressive.
---
I don't really care about server names, but I'm going there because it probably won't be full when the game goes live. I'm also not worried at all about it being a ghost town because I have no doubt plenty of people are going to jump on after about an hour of waiting in a queue for another server.
---
Good point.  Easier said than done, of course.
---
Legendary quest items dropped before 1.9 so yeah that makes sense. I don't get what you're saying.
---
&gt; No out of combat rez
---
Druid would be my main if not for this. I'm planning on doing a lot of 5 man content, and I'm very concerned of how much of a hassle not having an out of combat rez will be. Mistakes will always happen which will inevitably lead to one or more of the party members dying. 
---
Is this really as big of an issue as I think it will be? Can I mitigate this by being an engineer with jumper cables? or should I just stick with playing a Paladin?
---
Fuck Moash.
---
Got a ring in there last night
---
I'm still not sure between Mage and Warlock. I think I'll play both to 10 and decide then.
---
You don't have to be hardcore. You can just enjoy the game as a casual too. I'll probably average less then 5 hours a week. I will still have fun
---
I'd be sitting at my computer regardless so I'm not going to really be losing out on anything if there are queues that night
---
Why are you asking this question really?  You talk like you've leveled a mage before... Tiny differences in utility you should be able to decide what works best and when or just what you like better.  I just don't get it I guess.
---
K bye
---
There will be a pet store and you can buy realm boosts that  bring them to 110%.
---
I mean people waste way more than 15$ on so many other things in life but the sub thing seems like the biggest deal to people lol. But to each their own.
---
Gearscore really doesn't work in classic unless they give prebis items a higher gear score. One of the rogue prebis rings is from mara. They would have to give that ring an ilvl or gearscore higher than other rings in the game pre raid.
---
Literally discord #lfg channel would work the same way, except unironically better since I can get pings while playing other games or while afk on my phone.
---
It is pretty terrible.
---
A masterpiece of its time
---
I just as excited for this as wow:c
---
Find a battleground premade group to play with on your server. It's certainly a different experience than arenas, but I absolutely loved it. It's especially fun when you're matched against another premade from the opposite faction
---
Go on your server discord and look at the Guild Recruitment channel. Look for one that seems like what you want and apply and hope for the best. You aren't married to them if it doesn't meet your expectations.
---
Was gonna say this
---
The sad reality it the Classic "purists" community doesn't actually know what they what, and that they don't even realize that they helped destroy something the claimed they wanted.
---
Classic "purist": The LFG tool in Retail is so toxic! It makes it so you never have to leave the capital city and explore the world!
---
Also Classic "purists": This Classic chat parser is so toxic! You don't have to stay in a capital to make a group!
---
Can I bring my hunter?
---
I couldn't care less about a skeleton. Sorry
---
solid idea
---
Well sometimes, I ran a fairly large LAN Party group in Australia where WoW was prominent, played with a number of people whom i actually knew in real life, and never heard nor saw anything of it in any guild on any server i was on.
---
Probably around 5 hours or so
---
I was rather unsure so I chose the 3 classes I have mained previously and will login on launch and decide at that point what I actually choose to load first. Still split fairly evenly between the 3.
---
I could even live with race changes, names need to be permanent though.  If I've blacklisted someone I don't want them swapping names.
---
if you could stop sucking and just barkskin hurricane every pack like true druid tank would
---
Jesus fuck, thank god. I've been following the news on skeletons..I get it. Been following the news on servers...makes sense. 
---
But this? This literally breaks the game. No one wants a gearscore LFG addon in this shit.
---
Thank you devs for breaking its functionality! &lt;3
---
This is one our guild did and tested them on the stress tests: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTu-v4E34NcUAInGd3pin4OcaLLBoosADFufzdJV0dQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTu-v4E34NcUAInGd3pin4OcaLLBoosADFufzdJV0dQ/edit?usp=sharing)
---
True man...
---
Like part of me wants to stay on Herod just to see the absolute fuckin' mayhem.. But part of me and everyone else  has been waiting so long for this...
---
Do I really want to sit in a que for 1-4 hours just to play?
---
I've got a mage,  warrior and shaman just being me to each be the first and I'm torn.
---
They aren't cheat addons.
---
look up "30 year old boomer"
---
and then try to understand the meme
---
thats the joke
---
I leveled a mage in classic before mage armor was added in patch 1.3
---
I mean yeah you'd clear everything eventually if all you had was a computer WoW (multiboxable) and time.  Some of the non tank and spank fights would take a lot of attempts and practice. But hey what else you gonna do?
---
Everything is a learning experience if you're willing to teach. 
---
Thank god serial killers aren't like the Sith.
---
Hey mate if you played on Zenedar EU you can find a lot of us on Firemaw alliance as we are currently planning to roll there (unless queues are completely crazy). 
---
If you check the blizzard find a friend function on the official forum you will find more info in the Zenedar thread. 
---
Ciao bello
---
&gt;much harder.
---
Same difficulty, just a lot more aids than it was in vanilla.
---
AKA tedium for the sake of tedium.
---
Yeah and when your mana runs out do you want to get 2 hit by a mob or survive? Ice armor dude. I've done 2 mages to 60.
---
That's exactly why im playing one. Only other choice was a rogue in full tier.
---
Okay now back to skeletons everybody!
---
A full disadulation
---
Keep in mind that breaks features of addons such as BigWigs/DeadlyBossMods where it messages you indicating that the player is in a raid encounter.
---
But preventing them from whispering other players wouldn't actually stop the addon from working. The addon advertises in chat channels and invites when players whisper or when it detects a person LFG in chat (ex. "LFG Deadmines, can tank")
---
But.. paid transfers were in vanilla wow...
---
I was just thinking of FFXI's old system, where you could flag yourself as Looking for Party and set a search comment, but people still had to search and communicate.
---
While I am definitely against the LFD tool being added to classic, it‚Äôs a bit naive to think that limiting the functionality of an in-game addon will limit people‚Äôs ability to quickly find groups outside of general/trade chat.
---
We have Discord, and I would expect various sites to crop up for the purpose of group forming/finding.  The simple reality is that we have 15 years of technological progress since classic, and some things are going to change whether they are in game or out of game.
---
I'm going to go ahead any day every server will be full by the end of the day on Monday. At minimum a horse of 100k new subs will go active and flood every realm, especially the lower pops.
---
Honestly confused why he asked at this point.
---
Thanks.  I did play vanilla, but it was mostly shaman.  I'll look that up.
---
Why I ask. This doesn't make much sense
---
noone uses it because it's trash. thank god for that.
---
Mandatory. Pampering.
---
I'm going to play warlock and i will just try to resist the urge to roll something else when i see a mage blinking.. a rogue stealthing or a druid shape shifting into a cat. None of those things will make me 
---
re-roll to that class like i did back then, I hope.
---
Make a strict guideline. You ONLY get on at a certain time. There's no "well, I got out of work early...". I get on at around 9 every night. Work, come home play with the kids, spend time with wife, lay with kids/workout, and then game.
---
Reminds me of the Osrs vs Rs3 fued. Osrs membership also gives rs3 membership lol. Why must we fight with our brothers who like a different version of the game as us.
---
Point simply was the game community is different than it was 15 years ago.  People are talking about day 6,7 or 8 Rag kills.  Believe me, there are plenty of trash players in BoE greens that you're going to wish weren't in your party just because they're a human sword combat rogue.  
---
I'll happily roll ret and enjoy it, and will find groups accordingly.  The tired take is just trashing ret when most have never actually played it in classic (which I did straight through WOTLK).
---
the great thing about classic is that you will be able to remember who he is... hes stuck on your server and if he builds a reputation as a scumbag no one will accept him in groups.
---
I took the following week from launch off, to try to smooth out questing a bit, Will still play in the evenings the 5 days leading up to it
---
Pretty much the path that modern warfare remastered went.
---
What are you even on about?
---
I rolled Horde because of the undead warlock in the trailer. Just sort of ended up preferring it as well.
---
Agreed.
---
nice job on blizzards part fast response
---
&gt;To advocate that Blizzard eliminate addons that existed in the past as collateral damage in an attempt to recapture 2006 is folly.
---
Obviously not, since they listened and its happening.
---
14 year old me still remembers the velcro on the box's front cover
---
So hypothetically let's say that almost everyone will start using meeting stones, will you ask Blizzard to remove them?
---
Imagine being so stubborn you wont accept a feature that was in the game in 2005
---
Yeah, but if you're going to level an alt to 60 don't do the same class twice. Shit takes long enough. I'm going to do warrior first and then hunter or mage... not specifically to farm but knowing they can pay for those warrior bills.
---
I actually think MCP powershifting ferals will do okay against relatively equivalent pre-raid bis during phase 1 progression based on stuff like this [raid log](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=37511&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=60325) for example. Although, it doesn't really matter too much to be honest unless you're working towards a speedrun.
---
On a side note, I've come to rather dislike legacyplayers because they show the most recent equips on the character instead of showing the items they brought to that specific raid; rather bizarre.
---
I do agree that MCP powershifting ferals fall off rather hard once other classes start getting gear. Also, the common trend seems to be that they do fine on short single target fights, but they just can't compete in any fight with adds that can be AoE'd. 
---
It's no coincidence that Shedo is the ONLY druid in EVERY raid he attended. I saw his feral dps montage, but the reality is that he's just in the middle of the dps chart in the majority of his raid logs. It's rather disheartening.
---
But yeah, a bear off tank is cool.
---
&gt; My guild swapped from horde to alliance to help fix the problem.
---
Filthy traitors like you *are* the problem.
---
Or something akin to destinyLFG. AddOn may be dead-ish, but now we'll just get a website/discord server where we do the same thing minus an invite button.
---
It's not that's the point
---
Congratulations on completely missing the point they were making.
---
If you can't be arsed reading the comment and understanding it then why bother replying at all?
---
Lol probably because the language he used to point it out was unecessary
---
Classic devs dont want all the twats ruining classic too. Nice.
---
Felt.
---
Hunter is fastest and easiest leveler for sure. Despite what people will tell you, hunters are great in group PVE and raids up until Naxx, where their damage output falls off pretty hard. You'll be strong (and necessary for tranq shot) for well over a year.
---
I thought raiding was really good in BFA persibally.
---
How many time must I tell you that the add-on, Call to Arms, didn't not what ClassicLFG does? It doesn't auto-invite, create private grouping network, and track your specs.
---
I‚Äôm gonna miss this.  Been Ally since day 1.  The guild has decided to roll Horde to change it up for classic, which I was on board for.... but I did a board late night fly over Elwynn, Westfall, Darkwood, and Redridge last night.... the nostalgia hit hard.  Gonna miss not starting here again.
---
No thanks. The community is not single-minded. I also played during vanilla and my experience also matters. I have a bad feeling that the main body of the classic community is irreparably toxic.
---
&gt;You should thank me.
---
Hard no.
---
It was a cash mount.  Total Biscuit had a popular video calling it That Stupid Horse or something similar.
---
Ventrilo and TeamSpeak had very limited capacity - they were places for your guild to talk, not massive external chat channels where you can assemble PUGs much more easily than in-game. 
---
I don't get all the hoopla over this addon, when it's possible to form a group and voice chat with them in Discord without typing a single letter into the game itself.
---
Discord will have much more of an effect on restricting community growth in Classic than this addon would have, but people are too addicted to Discord to give it up. Even the people crying the hardest about this addon will be using Discord to group up instead of contributing to the in-game "sense of community" they're so obsessed about bringing back.
---
That's the thing that has me sorta perplexed about the statement they posted. The LFG addons we've seen doesn't actually require other people to have the addon. There is no client to client communication. The only thing they can touch other than the chat functionality is the invite functionality. There simply isn't anything more to the addons.
---
blizzard please.
---
Getting all the mats for opening the gates of AQ would be a terrible grind
---
Ask you wife, maybe she will.
---
Cos I played in vanilla and we had a similar add-on.
---
The thing that destroyed communities was cross server dungeons and bgs. And yeah I guess the teleporting to dungeon thing of the lfg tool probably didn't help. 
---
The big issue is your just not going to get the community feeling back because people are just angrier and more pedantic about gameplay nowadays. Like nobody would have told someone to fk off back to the game they came from just because they liked something in a diff game (well a small portion maybe) but far less than this entire thread.

this is going to be better for dungeons and WPvP - you want feral faerie fire for pulling and its insane utility in PvP. Savage Fury is 20% dmg to maul and claw alone, its 100% bis dmg talent
---
The kind of materials you need for some low level crafted items.
---
Tailoring contains patterns that require Enchanting, Skinning, Herbalism, Mining, some random item that only drops from one specific type of mob in Hinterlands.
---
Like, how high were you, Blizzard? I love it, but who the hell did this.
---
Yeah, you got dat ring?
---
Sorry, was unclear, I'm specifically referring to hooking on to CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL with an addon so you can parse &amp; search the LFG messages and filter out things you *aren't* running.
---
The effort in finding a group has nothing to do with the inefficiencies of /lfg and everything to do with filling a proper group.  I don't see how a chat parser would really change the effort you need to put in to find a group, you still ultimately need to be reading it and contact them to join.
---
I wish you would stop strawmanning LFD.  Most of the problems you outline have more to do with instant teleports to dungeons, instant teleports out, and ease of finding replacements, and nothing to do with having a list of lfm/lfg parsed from chat.  Even if that addon were kept in exactly as is (which would suck), you couldn't behave the same way as your retail example otherwise your group would fall apart and you'd be in the exact same situation.
---
2 reasons:
---
1. Unlucky and someone toke your names.
---
2. Something bugged and your toons are still "alive"
---
you can always use the same name again after you deleted your toon.
---
I mean I can make a gif if you don't trust me lol only a matter of seconds
---
The issue is it was in classic. And you can't stop it. People will just use discord or an app. That's what people use in destiny 2.
---
I've put in about 600 hours into stardew valley so far. Amazing game. I agree with your statement.
---
You miss far too many defensive abilities and bonuses by not going deep frost to level. Arcane missles isn't something that is worth casting outside of LoS for pvp. Going into arcane simply for arcane power to level is a complete misstep if you are going to optimization.
---
Yea exactly. But it sounds like his purpose of making a alt is the save the gold cost/time, but the time to make an alt same class or not is to high.
---
If you're making another character for fun though that's a completely different story.
---
Well, mage was my first character ever so I may be biased, but I think they are more intuitive and probably better for beginners. Fireballs, fireblasts, counterspells, etc.
---
Warlocks have a lot more nooks and crannies with pets, a just have kind of a weirder kit of stuff they can do. You'd have fun with both classes, but all things being equal I'd rec mage for a new player. Though lock's skill floor is higher.
---
Flip a coin :)
---
shit tier diet what are you 15? RIP your arteries and say hello to diabetes. Enjoy the 20lb fat gain from all the carbs and good luck in your 30s-40s (if you make it).
---
Great decision! I'm actually surprised and very glad they make such an early and clear statement.
---
Dude, there are hundreds of reasons that Classic is better (or better for someone) than *just* there not being group finder. There's a reason that "pristine" servers weren't well received at all. No need to gate keep so hard, man.
---
I sacrifice the rest of my FREE TIME to make time for WoW. That means I'll probably give up my Reddit browsing, stay off my phone at work, watch less television, etc. I never let WoW cut into my other time, like responsibilities, work, or health related stuff like eating and sleep. I also make sure to carve out some of that free time to maintain relationships; take my girl out on Friday, see my friends on Saturday. That's obviously optional, but if you have people in your life that you care about, I highly recommend you check in with them from time to time, haha.
---
Fair - I've not used that part of Gatherer so it didn't click.  Yes, if Blizzard breaks the LFG add-on in the way that people are expecting them to, this might no longer be possible.
---
Why? Monitoring DPS was very much a part of my vanilla experience.
---
Except it would lack the functionality of automatic matchmaking based class or role and dungeon.  That wouldn‚Äôt be hard to build into a mobile app if a website proves to be too much of a hindrance.
---
Discord is pretty diff cos thousands of people can join on their phone and use it while in-game.
---
See the destiny 2 lfg app.
---
Lol so back in the day we actually figured out he was on my server (Draenor),  because we recognized people and guild names from the screen shots (mainly when he‚Äôs dueling outside IF) 
---
He actually ended up joining my guild when we were in AQ40, I still remember people were inviting friends and someone said ‚Äúinvite this paladin‚Äù and we were like ‚Äúlol‚Äù. Then he joined our guild a few days later. 
---
By then he had calmed down on his addiction, and he was a pretty cool guy. 
---
I remember he quit a little bit before BC (I think?) and he was pursuing an apprenticeship in carpentry. 
---
If you‚Äôre reading this Dracoda, Onesia says hi, I hope you‚Äôre doing good still.
---
Well I could make the same gif showing in 24 hours all 3 names don‚Äôt work. Again two of which are not common and I‚Äôm sure I could create them on every other server. Bug is possible? Should I report to Blizz ?
---
I went to install Recount and it's giving me popups saying that I'm using a new version of the game or something, and using the mod might cause problems. Was it confirmed to be working during the beta test? None of the others you suggested gave me any issues and show up in the Addons list after server selection.
---
The experience of a moron who wants lfg in classic and hates social interaction is not one I or blizzard cares about when it comes to this.
---
Please stick to your single player game. I want a mmo back.
---
it's boring
---
Not true, something like this existed for a while in vanilla.  They did end up breaking it, but it mostly just parsed a list of lfg/lfm.
---
Same here, I never realized DK icon is an axe
---
You see, this is where you are wrong. You have either never played vanilla or are remembering this shit wrong.
---
Not saying there wasnt addons like this back in vanilla. I remember hearing about them a week or two before tbc launch. But to say that they were widely used is a total BS statement.
---
There were chinese bots on vanilla too. Should we allow them too ? I mean, the were in the game back then so we should allow them, right ?
---
Theres a group of suboptimal people who are willingly putting a guild together for raiding on Alliance side. I can't for the life of me remember the name though.
---
https://i.imgur.com/uQwdz1a.png
---
"Hunter, why have you done this?!"
---
"BiS"
---
no, there is only one green jesus, and thats Metzen.
---
it's just used as a meme now. 12 year olds think boomers are 32 year olds, but that's fine given the reverse happens all the time in the media with "millennials" being a catchall phrase for "younger person than me who is doing something I don't like".  I feel like the actual demographic descriptions have become less relevant
---
There fairly interchangeable, both have good suport/utility spells.
---
Early game the warlock has a tank pet + healthstones/soulstone, the mage has conjure food/drink + mana gems.
---
Late game the warlock can summon, the mage has portals. 
---
For playing with others it's a coin flip, for solo the warlock wins for me, because of the pet and the fact that their level 40 mount is a spell they learn and is the cheapest one along with the paladins version.
---
That's the difference in retail and classic to me. Retail feels so single player. Classic is a community game.
---
fuck out of here....no one that "eats healthy every other day" would dare fathom doing this to themselves for a week. Plus you can see OP in the reflection of his microwave and he's already a marshmallow.
---
I don't really see the point, but whatever. Making grouping easy sounds like a great idea. There really isn't any downside to that.
---
Because I never said that the modern system is better? The idea being proposed here is not even similar to the modern LFG system. It is literally just a catalog of people who said they were looking for a group recently. You still have to message them, communicate with them, invite them yourself. It‚Äôs at such a minor level that it wouldn‚Äôt even become a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù thing - it‚Äôs just a more convenient way to browse LFG messages. 
---
Again, an extreme reaction.
---
It's because grammar nazis have been slipping that words such as "selfie" exist.
---
I mean just making tank/healer/dps role and a level range role would make that shit easy.
---
Why do you even bother commenting when your output is this bad ? LOL FUCKING FATTIES AMARITE ?????
---
Classics " brand" if you will, is community. Blizzard is essentially karma farming the no changes boys for pr with this reaction. Same with all the influencers.
---
The biggest thing classic has going for it is people aren't cynical towards it. The notion that an add-on which would simply be qol for forming groups on your server would derail community just shows how fragile and possibly non existant it will be. 
---
This kind of add-on or even website is inevitable and having a less cynical take on it being the go to version would have been a much better solution.  But hey something something no changes.....
---
A talent spec that facilitates this, at least for mages, is missing some key pvp talents that might pose a problem on pvp servers. It's also pretty monotonous.
---
Wow. I completely forgot about locks needing shards. Yea, it‚Äôs gonna take a little bit to get back into the swing of vanilla things. Retail has spoiled us severely
---
Yeah the fact is this is also a change. Since similar add-ons existed in vanilla
---
I don't *wish* people to be prejudice, I merely expect that they will be. I hope to be incorrect, because if I am, we both win (by you getting to do what you want to do, and me actually benefiting from it). Only one way to find out. 
---
It's going to kill me to see people in BoE greens, no matter the class. I'm sure a few greens are actually pre-raid B.i.S. for a few classes, but I also loathe to see lazy people who want to shoot straight to being carried to purples because they don't want to embrace the grind and put in the work to prepare.
---
But it is about not confusing new players who don't know any better and think an Arcane missile spec is a good spec for raiding
---
Make sure you don't fail. And if you're planning on doing something with your degree where you grades matter (mine never did...), consider not playing seriously. It probably isn't worth it.
---

Thanks buddy, good luck on your... warrior? leveling.
---
2 years, 1 month, and 24 days. Sorry, alcohol makes me want to be more precise on things. It is always alcohols fault! 
---
Anyways, I think they will always keep Classic (Vanilla) servers around forever, as long as WoW is around, to keep those folks that want to stick around to just for that game. I am sure they took into consideration that private servers have been around since, I think with some research, TBC was released. Personally, I want TBC and Wrath, but I think I will always want to enjoy Vanilla, too. I played WoW for over 12 years and there doesn't seem to be anything stopping me from playing any version until they day I die. WoW4life no matter what people think!
---
You're the real mvp
---
I feel very strongly about this: pick the class you think is the coolest from an aesthetic perspective. One of the best facets of Classic is that they capture the archetype of each class very well. Have you played Warcraft 3 and thought the far seer was cool? Pick orc shaman.
---
But if you want something diverse with a beginner skill level, hunter is probably the best way to go. The most beginner friendly class for sure. Its rotation is not very complicated at all but then again, very few classes in WoW have a complicated rotation.
---
Enhancement shaman has a fantastically diverse toolkit with answers to tons of niche situations, but can be a bit hard to keep up with if you don't know what you're doing.
---
I see people are suggesting druid; go for it if you want, but in my experience it's dull and can be tough to level early on. It's rare for a reason. It has different animal forms which are each kind of a scuffed version of another class. Bear like warrior, cat like rogue, etc.
---
That‚Äôs disappointing
---
Even with lfd in classic, people dont allow auto accept.  I struggle to understand how in classic people would leave auto invites on.  You're going to have a lot of different people who dont want other classes in their group so they dont have to roll against them on loot.  Or, you want to make sure you have enough CC for whatever you're running.
---
They did at one point, although they were removed in their official capacity. Nonetheless, at some point enough people just started typing in /join lookinforgroup or /join lfg ,and the channels became populated.
---
&gt; Language evolves over time
---
Your idea of "evolution" is others' idea of "devolution."
---
**thog like fun!**
---
A millennial is like mid eighties plus.
---
I'm not trying to gate keep. You're right. Sorry.
---
You don't need other factions.  You just bring a mage.
---
Anyone not in your group tries to kill a devilsaur (presumably to skin it) and you chain sheep it until they go away.
---
Guess you didnt test it. It 100% had addon to addon communication. It would invite people who had the addon installed without any of the 2 people with the addon writing anything in chat. And I think that's the feature they want to kill. The chat filter is not a problem we have had calls to arms which is an chat filter lfg addon since 2005. So its 100% the addon to addon features they want to kill
---
Yes, that‚Äôs all we hear you saying.
---
Interesting, but I‚Äôm happy you had a good experience!
---
Def join your server's discord. They all have guild recruiting sections. Most guilds, even serious raid guilds, accept social players, so it should be easy to get in somewhere solid.  
---
But finding people you vibe well with will always be trial and error. Meet people naturally while playing or join a random guild, evaluate the vibe, leave and try again.  
---
I'm keeping an eye on guild recruit posts, but most likely will wait and evaluate guild reps during leveling and early raiding. If I happen to find cool people while leveling, will start there probably until things settle down and can really get a feel for how different guilds conduct themselves.
---
Let‚Äôs not cross lines there, bud.
---
When Vanilla was first out did Blizzard go out of their way to nerf addons like this?
---
Actually, according to [this article](https://www.techinasia.com/china-doesnt-censor-skeletons-the-truth-about-game-censorship-in-the-middle-kingdom), Blizzard decided to censor themselves in order to "help the game sail more smoothly" through the approval process performed by the Chinese government, because their censorship rules are too open for interpretation.
---
In vanilla the combat log had a relatively short range, so addons need to communicate between several raiders to get the whole picture. Not sure if classic has vanilla range or live range.
---
Missed opportunity.
---
They are a Class act. What was this AddOn used for?
---
You need a pretty empty (of other players) area to do it effectively, and its significantly more difficult with ranged or caster mobs.
---
Imagine thinking teenagers don't watch movies
---
Layering.

here you go dumbass: https://youtu.be/fREa-rfs8aU?t=742

Mind linking??
---
sweet chain link
---
and there are some people that feel away, so why not give everybody everything they want
---
Yes, it is I hahaha.

So this company called @Home back in 2003ish had just released cable internet in my area (lived in Dallas, TX at the time) and so my grandfather was the best and got it for us. I think AT&amp;T eventually bought them and they were absorbed. Those were definitely the days! At some point a year or two after vanilla launch my life shifted me out of the city and into the country (East Texas) where I had dial-up and was forced to play WoW on that. I got like 300-700 ping most of the time and damn was it challenging haha. That is too cool about your gma! Glad you were able to at least experience DSL over the dial-up! I can't even remember the company name but it was like 1-3 mb/s down.
---
I can't wait either! I haven't been this excited for a game since the photo of me playing above during Christmas break of 2004. Monday cannot come soon enough!
---
Also. If you like pvp at all. Arms is THE GO TO spec for warriors in pvp. Which IS 2H weapons. You basically cut through clothiers like butter. BUT you need gear.
---
Prepare to die a lot in battlegrounds first.
---
And leveling before that.
---
Warrior is not for the light hearted player.
---
You can take your time! But it is a lot slower than a hunter or druid.
---

Lmao, same üòÇ

you just need discord tbh

I was gonna buy a lamp and get a dark shade/dim bulb as well but went with a scented candle as usual. Gives me enough light without being too bright and smells nice.
---
I'm doing similar but a female dwarf rogue. I'm gonna be a special snowflake that everyone I gank remembers.
---
A submission of mine not dying in new? Surely you jest!
---
Kinda surprised I haven't seen a version of this post before, actually
---
This is against the spirit of classic!
---
I doubt it was doable in vanilla, even so I doubt it was popular.
---
Blizzard need to ban key rebinding.
---
Good tip :)
---
Retail tourists is the new edgy thing to say.
---
It's pretty cool that you know someone with a horde wax seal!
---
yeah and you can your other faction buddies and mage is dead now.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because I studied info systems but I never had enough to do in college to keep me from doing whatever I want in my free time.
---
It seems this wasn‚Äôt the case for many people .
---
This goes to what Ion said about addons being much more powerful now. 
---
Things that were sort of possible back then(due to the API and limited developer knowledge) will be much more powerful now, so they want to be cautious about what Addons do.
---
Go to a FedEx Kinko's and get it spiral bound
---
lol. I thought I was the coolest kid. Little did I know haha.,
---
I never asked for retail and I was just as loud on #nochanges as anyone else, I just happen to disagree with Blizzard's overreaction to an addon. A community feature that does not violate the ToS should not be policed by Blizzard. If the majority of the community doesn't like an addon, then it will die by itself. Instead, Blizzard overstepped their control and set a bad precedent on the eve of classic. Who knows how bad it'll get if Blizzard is trying to force the community itself instead of letting the community enjoy classic the way it wants. Blizzard should just stay behind the scenes and make sure classic looks and feels like vanilla, leave the addons to the community.
---
And it was so idiotic. That was LEVEL 100!! 
---
You can't discount that sort of psychological angle.
---
That expansion should've been the pinnacle of celebration of everyone's character and the game and its unique style that has gotten everyone to this glorious point.
---
Instead it was some half-assed cynical cash grab that shit on wow's unique style and tried to turn it into some bizarre mix of GW2 and a mobile game.
---
Myself and many other people i know came back specifically for WoD and level 100 and soon left again in disgust (i was so pissed i skipped all of Legion, and idiot that i am chose to risk a buy of BFA).
---
It was the easiest free money and goodwill they couldve made, and they shit the bed completely.
---
TBC was pretty bad with the catch up mechanics. They removed black temple attunement around the time you came back probably so there was no reason to do tempest keep anymore. They also added tier 5.5 badge gear for 5 man dungeons which was better than SSC, mag, gruul and basically anything before black temple. The start of black temple was actually quite easy as i figured that was your reward for beating Kael'Thas, a few farmable early black temple bosses. Suddenly these easy starting bosses became available to all without needing to kill Vashj and Kael'Thas.
---
This guy reeds/rites.
---
&gt; Nobody will want to interaxt in classic if any criticism raised, people get yelled at to "go back to retail".
---
Those who don't want to interact because of being told to go back to retail should probably stay away from Classic. It's a MMORPG, people have different views and opinions and people will definitely tell others to play something else instead of changing the game.
---
You can raise criticism but you can't expect people to be okay with the thought of Classic ending up like retail. Addons like LFG is what led to Vanilla becoming the garbage game that it is today. I hope you understand this when playing Classic.
---
I thought it was Cranius lol

I don‚Äôt know, I normally want people to be kind, but the prominent goal here is to keep the community on track for ‚Äúno changes,‚Äù and if people start brigading this subreddit and shifting the conversation that could eventually poison the spirit of the game, then I‚Äôm ok with a little aggressiveness right now..

Of the Boar/Wolf greens always were a head scratcher for me.  I can appreciate some suboptimal itemization as much as the next guy, but not even enhancement shaman will equip that shit.
---
Also Earth shock and Rockbiter generating extra threat, and no shaman aren't tanks, no I don't care if a naxx geared one tanked onyxia with naxx geared priests healing him).
---
It's a coalition of guilds on a particular server from both factions who collaborate to camp the Devilsaur spawns 24/7. Devilsaur armor is incredibly important for early tier raiding, so being able to camp it non-stop will allow them total control over the price of a limited resource which will be incredibly high in demand.
---
Boy are all those players gonna be pissed once they realize [they though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wrw3c2NjeE) they wanted WoW classic but they didn't!
---
Studying as much as I can now so that I can slack off the next week or 2.
---
And i have never played a private server, but I did play vanilla and into naxx raiding as resto... and I also topped healing meters if I was assigned to the MT - which was usually the case. And you're right, individual skill does matter. Druid healing is pre-emptive and not reaction based, as we have slower heals. If you can anticipate damage incoming, and with MT's you certainly can, you can top those meters.
---
Shit I‚Äôm going to search tomorrow. Drink those and some ruby relaxers. When my buddies and I used to lan I‚Äôd get drunk find some crazy porn turn my screen to them and pass out. Idk if my lady will approve big SHE GUN LERN TODAY

Classic is around 5gb. It has nothing to do with Retail.
---
It‚Äôs a separate download and it‚Äôs like 4-5 GB.
---
eh, once you get out in front of everyone you can stay in front
---
just that you don't START being able to aoe farm, so you have to catch up first
---
I don‚Äôt have any vacation days, I get all mine back in October. I didn‚Äôt think Classic was going to happen until like 2022 or something. 
---
But I have a 4 day weekend next weekend, Labor Day plus inventory on Friday so second shift doesn‚Äôt have to come in.  
---
I‚Äôll have those 4 days to really sink into it.
---
I think you've put more thought into the loot table phases than blizzard has. But also generally you make good argument and I think it is what we'll see. Blizzard is trying to strike a good balance between #vanilla and also not making a convoluted mess and by all accounts are doing just that. Common sense will prevail, and we have an actual game to play, people don't actually care that much about many changes (ie raid frames, ability cds, bag changes in beta).
---
Where is this addon that did group finder like auto grouping? the lfg addon didn't do that. 
---
Even if it did, break that part. A list of who is LFG is a good idea. Everquest has it on their progression servers, it's fine, it helps in putting together groups. 
---
Reddit just loses it's mind when it thinks it hears "retail style group finder". Reddit is retarded.
---
Drink before boss fight.
---
still don't get it why people want to waste money on it
---
WoW classic is something you can't play without incriminating yourself
---
WCIII is something you can play any day and the only change this game will bring is to swap technical limitations on unit micro from the old WCIII engine to the limitations of the SCII engine
---
So I'm normally pretty chill on streamers.  I think most of them are nice etc, I would just prefer to stay away from streamer servers.  But what bugs the shit out of me about this situation is seeing streamers complain about this LFG addon.  Oh yeah a LFG addon breaks the game.  What about some WoW god that can sit around a main city and accept free gold/items from people.  Streamers just say 1 word and they will have the best people begging to start a group.  It's really pathetic seeing streamers complain about QoL things in WoW when they are basically WoW gods in the game.
---
yikes
---
felicia day is so hot
---
Sex number AND drug number
---
Folks meet addiction
---
Haha I'll be opening this subreddit every 5m until launch...
---
80 hours played to 60? Ffs...
---
So where's the reason? All I hear is senseless squabling
---
Funny original and good editing it‚Äôs gonna climb fast.
---
Neither do I
---
Played from day 1, hated how casual the game had gotten by wotlk and unsubbed, remember add-ons worse than this in vanilla, and think the complainers need to calm down.  This seriously isn't the problem people are making it out to be.
---
There was an add-on that would help preform av groups and click the queue simultaneously ensuring most of the av group was a premade.  In vanilla.
---
Thank you blizz!
---
If we're talking about original Vanilla WoW, the jankiest thing was probably the flight paths. For the people who don't know, originally you had to manually start every single flight path along the way instead of just setting your end point.
---
You are the problem :|
---
Lmao!
---
Careful you don't cut yourself on that edge.
---
That's why it was such a victory today to have something like the LFG addon get shot down.  
---
I hope to see you out on the battlefield!

if youre going to be a rogue, it doesn't matter too hugely but humans are very strong due to +sword/mace skill
---
huh wow i didnt know calltoarms allowed you to inspect talents, and also had an automated queue system where it would only group you with other calltoarms addon users
---
Will be playing on launch day but I'm also still working Monday to Wednesday and then taking a vacation for Labor Day weekend. It's not going to matter. Classic leveling is definitely a marathon and not a sprint for 99% of the population. The only people that absolutely need to be on and playing at launch (and throughout the first week) are those with ambitious goals like world/server first 60s or even week 1 Rag kills.
---
You can choose to install the classic client only. My folder is 4.2GB.
---
This sub went downhill LONG before new people showed up...
---
Seriously debating it. My little group has a couple hardcores and a couple semi-hardcores due to work/school. Reality is, the semi-hardcores will be hurt a lot more by big queue times, since it eats into when they can play a lot more.
---
So yeah... we're undecided right now. Gonna have a pow-wow tomorrow.
---
Your mistake is not queuing while you sleep. Amateur move
---
Take some nasty skank home. Get you some new STD's for launch day boi!

---
Funny how hard some people try to avoid accepting the truth.
---
GMs don't speculate about these types of things because they would blow up on the forums **every single time**. Blizz knows better by now. If a GM says it, then the dev team probably gave them the OK.
---

---
Good on you. Git er dun.
---
Is this r/wow?
---
What the replies seem to be missing is that the best gear could take weeks to farm, and is character bound. Gold can be easily transfered but gear can't.
---
A photo of a monitor as well as inactivated Windows, very nice
---
Hype is real. We just wanna play.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd like to see them release pre nerf. People said it was mathematically impossible. I‚Äôm curious today‚Äôs gamers could pull it off.
---
&gt;I don't really see the point
---
yes, you don't
---
Hells yes.
---
^ this.
---
But, To be fair we didn't really have a concept of the impact those changes would have on the overall experience... Until they were implemented.
---
Honestly, I love the runescape voting system and if they decided to go the classic+ route I would be in full support of adding something like that to WoW.
---
No cos there were multiple ones like this in vanilla
---
I mean, so you lose a day. Unless there are people you're supposed to be leveling with, there will still be hundreds of thousands of players that will be starting the same time as you.
---
And it will be nice to see what they decide to do, the primary function here is to pull text from chat, and display it in a nice UI for easier readability.  
---
The autoinvite could be removed, no one would really care.  
---
They could ofc remove the entire API for reading chat, and that would brick a whole host of addons that people used and loved back in classic.  
---
So their options are somewhat limited there, they could go for a huge change that would deviate massivly from how it was in 2005, leaving us with a completely new experience, nothing like how it really was.  
---
That would however also go against their #nochange policy, so stuck between a rock and a hard place.
---
Yeah HOTS closed down
---
We're WAY past no changes. I can't wait to see the looks on the faces of the nOcHaNgEs clowns when MC is piss easy b/c of 1.12 classes/talents/gear. 
---
Starting in 1.12 is a change, and it's going to make the game a joke until AQ40.
---
Thats why i said even if it means u need to start at 1 again.. I dont think the community will be too happy if they turn classic into tbc..
---
Upvote for hon

I‚Äôve lead guilds in retail and pug regularly.

You‚Äôre giving them too much credit. But sure.

Layering doesn't g
---
Yeah some people really just want to suffer. I am all for lfg, I would prefer premade group finder to be built in honestly as I won't have much time to play. Limiting people to use discord or some other third party app instead of us being able to find players in game just separates the community further.
---
Play the games you like.... new...old... whatever. If you dont enjoy playing video games, then go do something else. If you feel like you are giving your life to Blizzard, then I would suggest not playing.
---
He is at the Goldshire Inn.
---
Should‚Äôve came out 9 months ago.
---
Im hoping Classic takes a lot of the same paths as OSRS has. Being community driven/focused, and letting live be the marketing/dlc/bs cash cow that it is.
---
I resub every expansion and usually play for a few months after. BFA was the first expansion I couldn't even get to max level on. I gave it another shot when I resubbed for the stress test. I logged out after less than 30 mins. It's sooooo bad.
---
I would have liked a LFG addon just for expediency sake, but I understand why it doesnt have a place in classic. Good on Blizzard for sticking to their guns on things like this. Cannot fucking WAIT for monday.
---
We did it, Reddit!
---
This solves next to nothing. It will simply be made into a website if Blizzard completely breaks the addon.
---
Well, it is a dive bar
---
That's cool, how does that work?

How did you stick around in Warlords of Garrisons?

---
Amen. Ya I was gonna be precise but ya know. Im juat glad ill be able to enjoy content more with less rush for the next content. Vanilla seemed to keep you busy longer. Getting all ur BiS post-raid gear takes forever long. Just feels more laid back in a sense I suppose.
---
I would also love a full set of warrior macro's. Im Rolling on an RP server for the first time and this stuff really interests me! Cant offer much but i'll Gild you if you can do a set of warrior ones like the hunter ones you did. Thanks in advance and no worries if you cant!
---
This should clear it up  [https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-pepe-the-frog-hate-symbol-20161011-snap-htmlstory.html](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-pepe-the-frog-hate-symbol-20161011-snap-htmlstory.html) 
---
So I think anyone that posts Pepe is either:  
---
1) using it as a dog whistle for racism/far right  
---
2) someone that don't know it was re-appropriated by racists/far right
---
Yep WoW was designed for casual play. However in todays world the vanilla style is kinda far from casual
---
S17 was cool. I wasn't sold on the theme for this season. Eagerly looking forward to what else the team comes up with.
---
Groupfinders aren't all bad. The blizz version is what made the game terrible (not the only thing of course). A simple add-on that just shoes you who is interested in what dungeon as seen on private servers can work easily. I am happy blizzard is hard on this topic and personally have no need to use such an add-on but simple implementations are kinda ok. Happy they keep it this way.
---
As someone that played from the beta test, I can tell you I'm pretty aware of changes and how they killed the server communities.
---
I agree the lfg tool did. The lfg tool being the cross server one that randomly teleported people to dungeons from diff servers. This is not what this was doing though. And these kind of add-ons existed in vanilla.
---
What also really killed it was cross realm battlegrounds. No longer did you see the dwarf in wsg in the overworld and hunt them down. But from my understanding we are going to get them (as they were in like one of the final vanilla patches?).
---
The last thing is def the raid finder devaluing raiding.
---
I just don't think we are going to get the same kind of community feeling as everyone is too well versed in the game, min maxing and just generally angrier.
---
It wasn't in the game in 2005 though. It came with TBC, I can't remember if it was in the pre patch or not so it might have been in the end of Dec 2006 but I think more people would consider it a 2007 feature.
---
Love the Orc and Undead art pieces.
---
College student, but I'm on a quarter system and don't go back until the end of September! 5 weeks of classic! Usually I hate being on the quarter system, but it's pretty great right now :))
---
Obviously everything's technically possible. I can't possibly expect four professional players (largely, a pro and well geared healer) in pugs.
---
Pretty sure Alliance outnumber Horde on Blaumeux.
---
I would 100% love to play tbc, it was an absolutely amazing expansion. The gameplay, and especially the vibe it has. 
---
The flying mounts were the only downside for me.
---
Fuck your friends and roll ally!!!! Aesthetics over friends!
---
Now you're talking!
---
Addons communicate with each other through chat channels. In vanilla, all chat channels are public, but only few are default (general, local defense, trade, etc). If you somehow know the chat channel the addon uses, you can join that channel even without the addon and you will see the data the addons are sending to eachother. That functionality has existed long before 2005.
---
However in later expansions, they allowed you to create completely private chat channels where only that addon can communicate. That functionality may or may not be removed in classic, but for the sake of the LFG addon it makes no difference.
---
Yeah? This is the classic experience. Its not easy, Its fucking hard and it sucks sometimes.. but when it does click it makes the reward that much sweeter. But hey, the people who dont.. will quit. Theres no shame in that.
---
Cheers!

Hate all you want but Ion is an OG vanilla wow player.
---
I don't think hardcore as in doing stuff slowly and repetitively for a long time requires as much skill as hardcore reactions and practice.
---
If you can run BFA you can run Classic.
---
I would rock the earthfury trainers
---
Orgs drums make my butthole pucker.
---
Elemental is rough until 40 at the earliest, that mage water would sure help the constant mana issues as well.
---
you don't have to be the age of an actual boomer to be a boomer, it's a mentality, and u got it buddy.
---
To be fair it is an interesting social expirement if they can pull it off. The idea of having to form a counter attack to take back the devilsaurs is an option.
---
No kidding, I'm not even mad about this. That's just awesome.
---
[Throw in a "Huntard weapon" meme and snickers.]
---
Where are the #nochanges people at? Wasn't this allowed in classic?
---
Hot pockets, my friend Kyle, and killing boars.
---
If you saw the AMA w/ the devs the responses heavily indicated Classic will likely follow-up w/ BC &amp; WOTLK via progression servers.
---
So I think you‚Äôre 100% correct. There will at some point always be a Vanilla, BC, WOTLK in Classic.
---
When you go to those zones to kill the enemy enjoy the soundtrack.
---
No, as an equal.
---
the lack of a reoccurring main character, gravity defying tits, panty shots (or a combination of the 3) every 5 seconds - means that either anime has changed in the past 15 years or someone thinks that a soundtrack is enough to call something an anime intro
---
Can't imagine why it would not be in at launch.
---
No it ain't.  It's exactly like the LFG tool.  Did you even look at it, or you just here for the contrarian Olympics?
---
Blue posts are saying that Classic realm pops are larger than Vanilla realm pops. 
---
The chances of you remembering these people (unless you keep track somewhere), much less bumping into them again, are slim.
---
Yeah I got told shadow priests are ok to heal too !  
---
and what professions would fit best ?
---
So that most Blizzard employees don't have to work the weekend fixing the servers lol.
---
You did when you used the 'PUG' term to describe it.
---
we don't need that toxic shit putting down people who play ~~any~~ most versions of WoW.
---
Your gonna need to press more buttons than 1 when WoW comes out, unless you play on a controller like some weirdo casual.
---
cool thanks! which professions would you go ?
---
Pve rogues should go human
---
Pvp rogues should go dwarf or gnome
---
We'll need this in a few months
---
Human. Music.
---
Probably depends on class but I watched a mage get it done in about an hour and half, maybe a bit longer.
---
&gt; i played when i was also really young and predators *do* exist
---
?? elaborate?
---
Got a link to this spec you spek of?
---
Guild officer/whoever is willing to fork over the thousands of gold in mats. It will frequently go to enhances/rets but you should expect warriors and even druids to run around with it.
---
It's not a useful raid weapon like TF/Atiesh are for the guild or even for personal DPS. It's a PVP weapon/status symbol.
---
I have done my research, played since closed beta in 2004. Yes, those things also helped making it anti-social and guess what the start of it was? Automated lfg :)
---
More alliance means longer PvP battleground queues and less people to PvP against.  More alliance could also mean less time getting ganked.  In general, horde like to PvP more so it could even itself out.  If it ends up being a 60/40 split once most people get to 60, it could be a real problem for both factions.
---
Yep. I played vanilla and as I said, the enjoyment was in the achievement and the community. That *requires* that you put a fair bit of time and effort in to the game, and the cross server LFG stuff took a lot of that away. Especially once they started adding raids to it.
---
If I don't have time to play the game that way and reap the rewards, that will suck. But I played the other way and it was nowhere near as fun.
---
I tried to log in to farm a token while I wait...I think I've played an hour so far this month of retail. Couldn't do it.
---
So no dungeon finder addon? That‚Äôd be awesome
---
I cannot access my books because my wife is asleep, but I am almost entirely sure this is wrong.
---
You just have to look at the ages of characters to see this. Varian was a small child during the first Warcraft game, he had to flee Stormwind to go to Lordaeron. At the beginning of World of Warcraft he is a full adult and even has a 10-year-old child himself.
---
They absolutely did not, that sounds ridiculous. Anyone that played a mage can tell you that.
---
If you want real challenge you need to hit 120 and try your luck on Mythic Lady Ashvane, after that you've got free loot until Azshara.
---
+1 for the #changes crowd. I wonder how far they'll go with their rioting.
---
On a fresh server it can be hard to find good spots to grind that aren't already crowded with other players trying the same thing.
---
Also, while the grinding xp is really good, because you skip so many quests, you wind up a bit behind on faction rep. You can try to offset this by grinding mobs that give rep on kills, but again, see the first problem.
---
Grrrrr the first one I made was the mage... you're great at tempting....
---
It's probably because wrath version of Naxx was super easy and you just blew threw everything.
---
I wish classic was coming out 3 months from now
---
- November 24th, 2019 
---
To be exact.
---
3 man 1:50
---
Yea. And it's a way for people to advertise. Dropping bodies to spell out a website name in skeletons. Saw my fair share in IF. However, I'll never forget the rip Steve Irwin in skeletons when he died. So that outweighed the negatives for me.
---
Top row is the order to get talents while leveling. -- The middle stuff lists all abilities you learn at every level, and their costs. -- The right column is mage quests that reward items/abilities. -- The bottom row is info about stats as they pertain to mages -- the left column tells you where to learn swords and daggers -- below that is a simplistic description of how to use your main abilities -- and the costs of reagents is listed near the bottom right.
---
your suggestions are both strong. although, if youre serious about pvp and end up being a priest, you might want to consider engineering on him aswell. but generally ench/tailor is great for clothies
---
you sound just like Crendor. it is amazing lol
---
race, classes?
---
I know nothing about stocks, but if the dev team flat out told them that was a terrible idea and would tank WoW, and they go ahead and force it anyway, wouldn't the stockholders you know.... have a problem with the blatant negligence on the part of the board of Activision?
---

Yup, saw a Warrior do it in an hour fifteen or so. My time is pretty great myself. But trying to see the general consensus on how people on reddit are doing.
---
It's not hard.
---
This community, and I'm sure others, have expressed #nochanges as a purity test. 
---
When all you have to do is just not make changes (even legitimately good changes) to Vanilla, these kind of stances are extremely easy to make.
---
To put it another way, even if this system would be a positive effect on the game and community as a whole, Blizzard doesn't want to deal with the hate that could spawn from it. It's not worth it.
---
Well that‚Äôs great to hear, I‚Äôm finding that in all these years in private servers, people are discovering old memey things that are actually viable. And I am hearing these things from people that played back then and never revisited it. So they‚Äôd much prefer a priest or pally

I still don‚Äôt understand why this is bad? If you don‚Äôt want a group or don‚Äôt want to do BRD, why should you need to get asked to do it?

Vanilla was a great game, but it wasn‚Äôt perfect by any means. There will be QoL improvements and people honestly need to understand that - look at osrs as an example. There will be this same type of interaction just on discord where bliz can‚Äôt control it.

The only reason I can see anyone doing that is if they want to run BRF as if it was current. That raid is super fun and blackhand is such an awesome final boss.
---
It doesn't modify game assets.
---
Plenty of people in vanilla used CallToArms, or other addons that allowed you to autoinvite guildmates to raid, or people to battlegrounds. To say otherwise would also be rewriting history.
---
But more than just that, many more people used other addons that had nothing to do with grouping or dungeons, but relied on the addon interacting with the chat. To imply that breaking those to avoid a LFG addon is a desirable outcome is disingenuous at the very least. Then to further imply that doing so would provide a more "authentic vanilla experience" is an outright lie.
---
it's up to you but I personally will be maxing elemental precision asap. I think you are underestimating the importance of your spells actually hitting your target. it is especially useful if you are fighting a target 1-2 levels above you, which happens quite a bit in Classic. Also, take critical hits into consideration. If those resists you lose out even more. Unlike the guide here, I will be taking the rest of Frostbolt just after iceblock, so it will be maxed out by level 33.
---
I noticed if you click them and go to versions it shows that a lot of them have been optimized for Classic.

Because if you make finding a group trivial it stop people from going out of their way to bond with the groups they do find. 
---
When it is hard to find a group, when ever you do find people you want to make friends with those people so that next time you look for a group it will be easier for you. Since you now know people who you can rely on and have experience with, you know they dont ninja loot or leave in the middle of the dungoen or so on.
---
If you make finding people for your group trivial you dont need to do that. Be cause it doesn't really matter you know you will be able to find someone fast any way. 
---
For it to be harder to make groups makes for people to cherish people they meet more and therefore it's good for the  community

Might have been me, I was friendly with Tips when he was starting out before he got popular. I'm starting off with a 72 hour marathon before settling into a 6 off 18 hour on schedule.
---
I've done this three times before for 3 separate Diablo 2 ladder resets, I'm in pretty decent shape and I generally consume water/veggies/nuts and sandwiches during the marathon so I haven't had any significant side effects. Day 2 I get super tired but if I can push through the initial tiredness I get a second wind that keeps me going the second day. Third day is similar and I've never tried a fourth day. It's also easy to get up regularily and move around during down time (there's going to be more of it during wow with flights than where was with D2)
---
I also didn't find my efficiency was that bad, I definitely wouldn't drive or operate heavy machinery, but in D2 I 2 boxed a necro/barb in HC mode so if a marathon like that didn't get me killed in D2 it sure won't slow me down in a game like WoW.
---
Just a different type of humor

I'll for sure be playing both too. I mean, just because I'm remaking the warrior I made in vanilla, doesn't mean I have to forget the OG!

I'm gonna give you the real answer.  Blizzard added their own lfg and it's tied in with some other really bad shit like being teleported to the instance and crossrealm.  The actual ability to open a window where people can say they're lfg in a static place instead of spamming chat over and over isn't bad in anyway.  Wow players are extremely stupid though so they know retail lfg is bad but they lack the mental capacity to understand what about it makes it bad so they see lfg and are incapable of differentiating between retail built in lfg and a simple chat parser so all the negativity around teleporting to instances and crossrealm gets pushed onto an addon that doesn't do anything bad.
---
Tldr they're idiots
---
I have this image of these guys wanking off about making group being social interaction just having nights where they make and drop groups constantly just for the thrill of it.
---
I don't think the add-on is a good idea but people's reasoning if fucking absurd.
---
Correct, remember the addon that was created for premade AV groups? Remember what happened to that addon when everyone started using it?
---
It happens for sure.
---
Stealth Shenanigans mostly. ,
---
Looks awesome
---
I'm not acting like I know, so can you fill me in on how others will be safe but LFG won't be?  
---
Also of note: I don't want the LFG addon, I'm just a curious guy *wink*
---
Huh
---
Do you even know what spell batching is?
---
i hope you‚Äôre alliance on my server.
---
Straight up
---
oh sweet! thank you  that definitely looks like the answer to my question.
---
You want to pay for atleast 30 subscriptions?
---
For playing horde
---
Can't imagine being this low IQ.
---
Why would you need someone whispering you when you have weakauras or DBM?
---
Probably the second fastest class to 10 tbh. Mobs dont do much damage and they dont have to wait for mana.
---
It's also other designs that were changed as well overall in WoW that killed off a lot of social aspects, unless you're raiding a lot. Like making dungeons just AoE races and not needing to coordinate pulls or what mobs to keep out of the fight. 
---
I'm more curious about if people don't want this add-on because of their ignorance to remember that something similar has existed in vanilla, or is it because they're nitpicking what will personally ruin the experience for them. To me, if an add-on existed in vanilla, it should be allowed in classic. I don't blame people not wanting to sit through the same "LFM" spam in chat and then in reaction, has to make them spam themselves.  Maybe take out the auto invite part out, and still require whispers to get invited to the group.
---
I suppose if he knew about the all 40+ guilds, it'd blow his mind.

---
10k responses total and so far Gehennas is almost 50% Swedish.
---
Have only one IRL friend who isn't coming back for classic. "I don't have enough time." Yet he doesn't have a girlfriend, he only works 30 hours a week, but he isn't willing to sacrifice his "social life" to play classic WoW. Oh well, myself, my other friends and family are all gonna be taking time to play wow classic and start a guild from the ground up.
---
Destroy the economy? That a stretch. It's preraid BIS for a few classes, but it's not like those two pieces of gear will make or break it.
---
And as for black lotus the best they can do is set a price ceiling. The only way to actually lock everyone out is to violate TOS and work with the other faction.
---
Good luck trying to get a group when the game first launches and you have dozens if not hundreds of people in the same zone [and this](https://imgur.com/a/m9iPgjp#4rETnjf) is one of the only ways to get a group.
---
Yeah I will. I saved me a name too. I figured it would be nice if me and my hubby can play some time together since he likes it so much üòä
---
Clearly that's false because blizzard literally said it would be significantly limited
---
While i like these, i heavily disagree with them. Your warlock one had "Demo" as poor... even though it is a major part of many of the best specs.   
---
And this i would say fire is neutral because of the first 3 raids its literally useless, and arcane poor aswell as its rather meh overall.

Faerlina might have an alliance heavy faction due to asmonbald.

Horde. That's not even a question.
---
Studying second degree, work full time and wife is 4.5 months pregnant. No time to waste on two toons.
---
Can I ask how it makes it replace them in a few minutes vs 20+ minutes? Legit Question
---
From what i understand in classic there was LFG channel. It was global, so you could use it from the inside of dungeon. How does wiritng in that channel "LF1M DM" makes it so much less efficient than listing your group through addon which not everyone will use? Addon that works based on that LFG channel.
---
It does not port player to instance of whatever. You still gotta wait for that player, help him get into instance, summon him with warlock or whetever.
---
 I agree that autoinvite should be non existent. But otherwise i see no few minutes vs 20+ here.
---
Ashenvale or in general the Night elf starting zones are my all time favorites, it just has something magical to me.
---
Sadly i'll still be playing horde.
---
Most of these people are unable to distinguish between the LFD tool, the gutting of dungeon difficulty, and cross server grouping. They just lump them all together as one, or worse, ignore the latter 2 and put all the blame on the former. Thus the undeserved hatred.
---
Also figure out exactly what it is you want from classic. There will be enough guilds that you can find one that fits your needs. Don‚Äôt join a guild with a loot system, management structure, progression timeline, allowed specs etc that you don‚Äôt agree with. Don‚Äôt be a team player except for the exact team you want.
---
I'd be happy to help! No need for gold. Let me know your character's race and gender and I can tailor it to you better.

Tier pieces still cost dkp or free roll for the class?

Yes because having to actually talk to another player is SO MUCH of a hassle in a MMORPG
---
you‚Äôre actually using brain dead logic rn
---
Word. The other issue is depriving yourself of essentially 3% hit through your race means you have to make up for it with gear, so you're not breaking even with gear vs humans until you have that and you'll never rival them in dps.
---
Devilsaur Mafia cracks me up. Bunch of a out of shape losers in they moms basement trying to pull scams.
---
Yep then they start talking about addons talking to each other not about the lfg functionality.  Luckily this doesn't need to be debated when the addon never goes away you'll know I was right.
---
Can't revise if you're dead!
---
The issue is with things that have on use or proc effects. Sure, you can basically sim every item for each class and assign it a value based on that.
---
I'll be honest though, you'd have to basically just get a kick out of people nerd raging, because it has fuck all use and it's way too much time and effort to do that, even if you can automate the process of building a database with that information.
---
The normies are invading. Launch day is upon us.

I would like Vanilla WoW to work sort of like the Diablo series. Have ladder and nonladder Vanilla. One set of servers that people stay on which are progressed forever, and a set of servers that have complete resets every 2-3 years. The characters on the ladder servers get a choice to either go to the vanilla nonladder server, or go to their TBC servers.
---
Considering it's literally a rip of someone else's video? Not quite.
---
Username checks out
---
Probably let things slide at lvl 18 running WC for the first time again, but I'm going to be a lot less patient if the hunter forgot his ammo and the warlock has no shards and we are running through mara.  (Though a warlock doesnt need a lot of shards to do a dungeon, just a few to summon people, and they can replenish mid-instance).
---
.&gt;RP Servers

The fact that you held that view to begin with should make you feel bad. You were wrong and you are dumb.

I grouped with people who were looking in chat.  Some were good, some were bad.  Friendships were formed, guilds were built, raids conquered, drama had.  If I'm honest, I'm looking at the right hand of this page right now with an ad for a lvl'ing service, probably chinese.  I have people I played with in other expansions say they are going to play classic because they used services like that and never did any of the content.

---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=20203/defilers-mail-pauldrons
---
As for the warlock one, I labled it as poor for demo because it is used in a hyrbid spec, which doesnt really fit into the simplicity of the guide (hence the note)
---
And as far as mage goes, thats why we put a note about the specs being reliant on the boss your fighting. It feels very disingenuous to label fire as anything but excels, considering in Naxx its their highest DPS spec! 
---
And as far as arcane goes, one of the "frost" builds actually is extremely deep into arcane, hence why arcane is labled as good!
---
But that's what Blizzard's premade finder is.
---
It's a shame though that old boxes/guides is against the rules here. Wish I had my old ones still
---
You seem like it. If retail was truly great, you wouldn't be so offended if someone called it trash. If someone told me that "classic is bad" i would laugh at them, and move on. You decide to get all butthurt, maybe because you know retail is bad but you dont want to admit it to yourself.
---
If I could have UD aesthetic for all the horde questing I‚Äôd be set.  But going from that to...wooden spikes and hides with drum music. Ugh. Why do the other classic horde races have to be so primitive xD
---
Just don't play on 	Faerlina
---
Pretty sure I owned this desk back in 2005 (well, an earlier model of the same desk). Probably the best desk you can get for under $100.
---
Stuff taking time is what makes it not so casual for todays casuals. Classic just demands your time, theres no instant gratification.
---
Just parked my Nyx and Apostle accounts so I can enjoy eve. üòÇ
---
Discord LFG isn‚Äôt as accessible, thus many people won‚Äôt use it. Which from a social environment standpoint that Classic wants to recreate, that‚Äôs good.
---
Vanilla is a social game, and having a streamlined add on someone can just easily install that lets them bypass some do those social barriers hinders that. Not to mention how an LFG system can hide ninja looters from getting bad names etc.
---
You create a reputation in vanilla wow, an LFG system lets you keep that reputation hidden.
---
You dont need an addon for devilsaur farming, just plug some shit into a macro and batta bing the built in timer does the work
---
Fairly sure this kind of transaction is against TOS and might even be illegal so I‚Äôm not sure how YouTube allowed it in the first place with its insanely tight criteria.
---
This addon uses some of the most base parts of the API. Almost anything they do to limit it's functionality will affect other addons.
---
If they restrict addons from being able to invite people - that's probably the least worst, since it will only break inviting addons obviously, so no auto-inviting your raid team at raid time, but not the end of the world. 
---
The issue of course is - just limiting that wouldn't really have any effect on this addon at all. It'd just create a pop up window with the text to copy and paste to invite instead. 
---
So they have to break parts of the addon communication system  - which a huge number of addons use. Depending on how they break it, it may 'only' break basically all RP mods, but it might also end up affecting a huge range more, far too many to list. 
---
End result is this - either a huge chunk of existing addons are either straight up broken, or have their functionality reduced by varying amounts from a minor reduction to basically broken, or the result is basically fuck all and doesn't really do anything to stop this addon either (since there would be workarounds). 
---
Short of it is, it's very possible that whatever they're going to change will end up breaking lots of things. Far more than they've broken in the past with making API changes to block certain things.
---
Its roo much like what they think destroyed WoW. LFG didnt help kill WoW, LFD helped kill WoW and these saps dont know the difference.
---
Big true.
---
There's a whole lot of ignorance packed into such a small post.
---
But I'll just respond the same way the devs did... Why allow a shit version of LFG... when they removed they own LFG that was already built into the client?
---
Just use a chat parser totally not lfg addon to yoink out keywords and display them in a static easy to read place :)

Wow, if only you could just leave channels when content becomes bothersome

We came to the conclusion that all the whining on forums was the problem. People whining about having to talk and acually write in the chat to fund a group, people having to WALK to the dungeon.. Oh the humanity üò©
---
I remember that some day I realised that playing at night felt weird. I couldnt really put my finer on it until I googled it. Turns out a handfull of people complained that they worked strange hours and they could only play during the dark nights in wow.
---
Try classic, youll feel the difference in immersion, because dark nights with the moon coming up and the quite night with just the sound of crickets in the background was for me a BIG part of the immersion.
---
My point is that the retail version of LFG got LFG and it slowly ruined the game together with many other bad implements to the game that were called "quality of life" improvements. Turns out they just ruined the social interractions and immersion that a RPG needs. So the RPG people left wow and the beloved RPG game died.
---
Thats why we dont want LFG or any light version of it in the game. We want a fully immersive, punishing and rewarding game to play and meet new people in.
---
Same PSA for the US servers as well.
---
But a welcome one

This is seriously a brilliant response
---
Yeah that's good, he said basically what I wanted him to say, displaying information is fine but the shitty part is that it can do things beyond that. 
---
I like that he mentions that the add on author had no bad intentions, because that's the feeling I get from it too and they must have been getting so much shit over the past few days.
---
They automate complete sets of actions (decursive targets and dispells eligible targets). A close example is a healing addon automatically choosing the lowest health target and healing them on 1 button press.
---
ClassicLFG filters chat channels and can also invites them. The receiving side has an auto accept option. Each action is embedded in the game's core. Reading channels (DBM, combat text), inviting (DBM, Leatrix) and accepting invites (Leatrix).
---
I don't quite understand the community's discontent for an addon that cleans up communication. I don't see how this is the lesser evil of what will eventuate which is Discord channels with bots that do the same thing.
---
What am I supposed to take from that , does dwarven cheese age well or not ?

Yup started when I was 14, now 29. Just proved how awesome this game really is.

Of course, no one knows this because they just parrot whatever their favorite streamer tells them. :) That said, like any other community, it has a sprinkle of people from every other source (4chan and Reddit included).   
---
Saying "4chan fedora tippers" is the same broad level of generalization as saying "Reddit fedora tippers", by the way.
---
Alliance isn‚Äôt edgy enough for 12 year
---
olds. Human? Elf? Dwarf? Why even consider that when you can be some skeleton/zombie guy or cow-man?
---
I would hit my head every time I stood up. Good thing you ideally never stand up playing WoW.
---
"its not a problem for me cuz i dont use addons" alright dude no one asked
---
Goldshire will probably best bet for a while
---
The problem then is them killing a useful addon from vanilla that was used to set up raids.
---
I'm finding that the frost talents you suggest do well, especially when coupled with a scorch emphasis on the fire side.  For a frostbolt opener and this spec:
---
https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=mage&amp;l&amp;t=JBpBqRpJpKsusvswpFqTqUqVqWC3C4pDsIsJpIp7p8JhJiJjp6pHpLqXqYqZq0pMpxq6zazbpRzcrgrhpy ,
---
followed by scorch spam/fire blast, the results look just as good as the arcane talents with fireball spam I previously listed.  The kph is about 5 higher for level 46, the same for level 48, and 2 lower for level 50.
---
Thanks for keeping an open mind on this.  For some reason the attitude about frost evolved into, "it's better because everyone knows it's better."  I suspect there will be an even steeper uphill battle regarding fire in Molten Core.  My theory there is that unless a high fire resist boss is gating the rest of the instance, mages going fire will result in faster clears.
---
Probably feral druids are great healers since they get increased intellect.
---
Does this mean that Social RP add-ons go against this? TRP allows other people to see additional information in your tooltip if they have the same add-on. I understand the evil of ClassicLFG but I don't want this to avalanche into other non game breaking add-ons.
---
That guy who was working on the become a vendor add-on. Not sure what it was called but the add-on would communicate with other people with it and would show items that you are selling. This is cool, but goes against the "attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on"
---
Gunna be a long block list.
---
That‚Äôs literally the addon-specific channel he mentioned in the OP
---
maybe like 8 hours.
---
level 1-5 really quick, run to ironforge troll in trade chat for a couple hours. Take tram to stormwind. Jump on mailbox get naked /dance beg for silver.
---
Then go to female night elves and /whistle at them say hey baby you want some fukk? 
---
Then run back to dun morogh and level.
---
So that's against your rules?

I remember that. It sucked so bad lol
---
Got in all dps groups.
---
It felt like Blizz was using us to beta test something they should have tested in house.
---
Had like 0 effect on how we found groups
---
yeah but why is Old Blanchy dead.
---
It's possible to have those notes show up. I'm just saying, it isn't inherently a bad thing to have a window that organizes the messages.
---
Also, I cannot emphasize how much worse trade chat is going to be on more populated servers and the Twitch chat community. Being able to bypass that portion to get to the information you want and is relevant to the actual world experience, not the meta experience, is a good thing.
---
I get where you're coming from, but to me the mayhem is part of the fun. Plus with layering and dynamic respawns I dont think itll be as bad as some people think.
---
Yeah he's looking at this all wrong, small races are where its at.
---
Yeah leveling isn't 80% of the game in BFA. Pre-raid BIS for vanilla will take you dozens of dungeon runs. It is also really dependent on if you're doing guild runs. If you're rolling against 1-2 others at 60 you're gonna have a bad time.
---
IIRC you could transfer from PvP to PvE, but not the order way around since the "difficulty" of leveling/gathering PvE were significantly lower than PvP leveling
---
That is one of things I miss in the current version. I liked that the professions were dependent on each other because it meant you couldn't do everything yourself and had to interact with and rely on other people. It also meant all the professions had something someone else wanted.
---
Wow, you're so nonchalant and casual. Very cool!

lol not even the same thing???????? In literally every way possible
---
Mailbox dancing has been outlawed in all provinces save for by the Stormwind bank and the Goldshire Inn.
---
oh, great idea!! I didn't even think of that
---
Considering they added the Looking For Group interface panel in Burning Crusade I think it is fair to assume they did look at group finder addons in Vanilla. That panel wasn't disruptive like the later WoTLK dungeon finder. It also wasn't particularly popular.
---
This decision is weird because it seems obvious that disallowing more efficient grouping methods in game will just mean that people who don't want to spend hours assembling a group to use out of game methods (discord and websites). So I'm hoping the possibility of a parser that just provides a more easy to read version of the chatspam will still be possible, without the built in communication and inviting ability that ClassicLFG had.
---
Honestly I work with a bunch of teenagers and I only know one that has seen godfather. He also listens to music that is 20-30 years older than he is. Sure theres plenty of teenagers who have seen the movie, but I'd wager 800g that the vast majority of kids 13-19 have not seen it.
---
There are always going to be people like this no matter what, It‚Äôs best to let it just die off on its own. At some point it‚Äôll get regulated by Blizzard and it‚Äôll be a backwater type of thing similar to gold buying back in the day.
---
I dropped my pants
---
Dude....
---
D2 remastered
---
Holy shit son.
---
Do you think maybe cross realm is why people don't become friends or create a strong sense of community with retail lfg?
---
Lok'tar Omar
---
I look forward to finding groups in Discord just like we did in the old days!
---
That's a great idea
---
No, Classic will be the 1.12 version of WoW which includes connected flight paths (introduced in 1.10).
---
depends one the class and game knowledge.
---
I imagine the level 1-10 bracket the fastest possible would be an undead warlock duo with priest. And with optimal luck you might be able to get sub 1:30... But I imagine most would average 1:40.
---
First thing I do is look for other mature people.
---
don't worry, he'll be back on retail in like a month, and good riddance.
---
The LFG in vanilla was only for bring the last 5 players that clicked on the stone in front of each dungeon, nothing else. That was totally useless. 
---
When call of arms was released, no one used it. So please spare me you history about LFG addons, because even in TBC no one used it even the channel LookingForGroup was abandoned.
---
It's wild to think someone would go well out of their way to visit a section of a server community, (Discord) then elect to go to channels within that subsection of a community, become shocked by what they see in off-topic channels, and proceed to project poorly concluded opinions upon an entire server populace. That's some mighty big IQ you're workin' with.
---
lol you guys have no counter argument, all the addon does is make it where you only see chat of groups you are looking for essentially so you dont need to read a scrolling wall of text with a ton of posts you dont want to see. But nah keep replying with "BFA BAD" like that has anything to do with the argument
---
thanks plato
---
Yeah, I always had 24, upgraded to a 27 and it feels just a tad too big. Next monitor 5 years from now will go back to 24.
---
https://youtu.be/D1vF3-BsoxE
---
I Like this one too, altough its a TBC commercial
---
No I'm pissed at the lack of moderation in the chat channels and the removal of tools that would help with the lack of moderation.
---
If they are going to remove the tools that deal with it then they need to have more moderation.
---
It recognized 12/17 of my addons, I wouldn't say it's quite ready yet
---
tons of people talked about it during the interview, and they might do reboots during the day for maintenance before they go live too.
---
https://youtu.be/DZmGIpL-DIo
---
Then play live and not classic.
---
Its been talked about, a lot.. People are concerned regarding the 30 minute afk-timer before you get disconnected again and are suggesting using remote controll etc.
---
Whitemane PvP (US) - The Officially Sponsored Server of Taco Bell
---
Sweet!
---
Yeah but what are you gonna eat the 2nd day though
---
But why can't we have them if we had it in vanilla is what I'm asking. What if the argument was for those addons, if you don't like it don't use it. Whats the harm in a healer being able to use those addons? does it stop you from playing the game you want?
---
Take my upvote,   
---
I feel your pain, i uploaded a pretty good meme that took 20mins of editing (and i do graphic design for a living) on another account and one mod removed it with 120 upvotes after 22minutes.... the posts above and below it were memes with 1 wow icon badly cropped on top and there still up.... and 3 of the 5 top posts on the front page at the time were memes with 0 wow content..  
---
Most inconsistent and badly moderated sub this ive ever seen on here, so i just don't post anymore. I don't mind my own removal... but it seems they only remove thing they don't personally find funny.
---
fuck em. I'm fucking pumped to play resto/ele shaman in classic just like I do in BFA. I never played back then, but even so you just need to play what you want to play. Play your CLASS and understand resto druid facilitates the druid class as a whole the best by far.
---
dude maybe focus on getting out of middle school before wasting all your life on wow
---
lol freaking exorcist. WoW possessed that kids soul.
---
It works fine, but with Classic I see a bunch of addons that are available other places that aren't on the Twitch app for some reason.
---
Maybe not thex but I could imagine the other 2 getting hit.
---
Rp names are highly criticized.
---
Bfa did give them money though . They have admitted though that most of their money daily isn't from subscription but from lvl boosts , transfers mounts and all those microtransactions
---
What's the deal with wow players overeating? Seems like a lot have a problem with weight gain while playing for a long time.
---
I've been defending chat parsing all day. This is the first time I heard about it using something other than a chat channel. That's def not in line with classic.
---
Shitting themselves in adult diapers hahah
---
But I guess it was a joke.
---
all of yall have the same response its crazy, get some new material to explain your delusion
---
We didn't have DC, back in the old days...
---
Cross faction collusion is going to get them all banned.
---
See? Like this.
---
Not to detract from other servers, but the newer ones need population ASAP so the servers can stabilize.
---
it's not just blizzard, it's commiefornia.
---
Maybe ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I had both a night elf warrior *and* druid, was Alliance 95% of the time, and am doing Horde this go 'round. I'll for sure miss the blues/purples/greens of Ashenvale and the surrounding area, the music for Ashenvale and Teldrassil...I guess I can sit my troll ass in the middle of the woods sometime and hope I can find a quiet moment to appreciate it without taking a hammer to the face for being in the territory. Hah.

&gt;me and everyone else will be forced to spam World Chat channels.

But yeah me too.

I think the hype waiting for WoW is more exciting than anything else! You get an extra day of waiting for an amazing game to be released, sounds pretty good to me!
---
This is randy with blockbuster referencing the shining
---
you'd best be truly skilled when you look to kill
---
You had auto inv lfg addon that worked just like lfg in vanilla? I never heard of such. Glad that shit is gone. They had heal bot add-ons in the beginning of vanilla as well, should we allow bots as well :p?
---
I feel this image.
---
Hundreds of days by WOTLK.
---
As if I actually *play* the games I bought in my Steam library
---
Correct. This shows everything that's available. It's up to you to pick which spells to buys and which ones to skip.
---
I just simply stated the fact that you are wrong. And that you miss the point entirely. Hardly screeching.
---
first of all it's been talked about for the last 3 or so days no stop
---
second of all you cannot log in "literally hours" beforehand and wait because you get auto disconnected 30mins at character screen.
---
fail
---
delete
---
They will get away with it for a period of time and then a huge ban wave will go out. That is the Blizzard way of doing things. Realistically they will be a problem in phase 1, maybe phase 2. Blizzard has an active interest in breaking addons and eliminating collusion to the extent that they are able. Obviously they can‚Äôt police discord.
---
HOLY SHIT. my junk just wiggled
---
I hope you're right brother.
---
Thankfully the devs seem to get it because this was my biggest fear.
---
I was afraid the ~~wrath~~ retail babies would cry for more convenience not realizing that the convenience is what ruined retail and then Jay Allen Brack would be all smug about it and have them add LFG to Classic.
---
He's trolling, k?
---
No, no, no I think it's saying "if you're alliance and you see horde, press this button"
---
I didn't say I agreed with it.
---
Yeah. I planned on spending most of the year playing custom games to wait for Classic -_-
---
Except this functionality literally just finds the first five people who are in the queue and dumps them into a group.  If you're into clearing dungeons with only DPS, have at it and good luck.
---
That's another part of it. When you're pulling from a pool of millions of players instead of thousands, reputation doesn't matter, manners don't matter, the faceless random person who got stuck in your group you will likely never see again. When you got blacklisted from raids on your Vanilla server for ninjaing an item or being a tool, you might as well go to a different server. Reputation matters, skill matters, relationships matter.
---
When these things matter, people work harder to get good groups and build those social relationships. Being a douchebag often got you gkicked and ostrcized, so people treated each other with at least a baseline of respect.
---
Well said.  To this day, I still remember a druid by the name of Vorshak from TBC.  I met him through the LFG tool looking for a Slave Pens group.  He insisted on tanking in Moonkin form.
---
Long story short, it was always such a pain in the ass to find a tank that we let the bastard slowly but surely tank the whole thing as a chicken, then promptly added him to the ignore list.
---
As long as you know your limits/ the risks and have tried it before.
---
I‚Äôm just afraid that some people not being aware of the risks or have trained their body for it ending up hurting themselves.
---
Are you going for world/server first or are you just really hyped?
---
Stay strong comrade, so long as one of us lives ‚Äî the fight goes on.
---
API and Engine are different things, but I get what you mean. 
---
Classic runs on a modified 7.3(?) client that is basically stripped to the bone and then put back together with the old assets and functionality, allowing the game to retain the engine upgrades that have happened over the past 15 years on top of being compatible with all their new tools for debugging, world building etc. 
---
Point being that everyone showing off ClassicLFG has been doing it on BFA since the addons are semi compatible, and retail long ago removed the point based talent trees so the addon can't grab that information from anywhere in the clip you showed.
---
You're not wrong, lots of gatekeepers that didn't even play vanilla. Sux out here.
---
Just to be clear you don't want to try to dispute anything I've said right?
---
I'm logging in before noon and will be fiddling in character creation once ever 30 min till launch.
---
Only 2 pack hot pockets? Those are rookie numbers
---
If the bigger Discord is to be considered a litmus, I'd say things will be pretty good. Lots of custom content, people seem friendly and are having a good time, and folks seem really dedicated towards doing end-game raiding. The pre-60 scene could be a little stronger, but again, only a small portion of the population.
---
Roll PVE server if that's a concern of yours
---
Torino‚Äôs? Can‚Äôt even get bagel bites like a winner.
---
Look through true source, it also sends messages over the addon channel.
---
They did promise that the minutes leading into launch you will be able to sit and wait for the enter world button to light up though
---
Nah, that only happened at the end of vanilla when we were going into TBC.
---
Okay... equally as must ignorance packed into your response... debating if you're a troll.
---
You do know that classic was built on a post WOTLK engine? As in Blizzards own LFG( the one that you use in retail right now) was there at the start of developing classic. They could of easily just left it in and disabled the feature of teleporting you into the dungeon. Just open the window select your roll and boop you're in a party. And as well as create customs groups.
---
But no... They chose to remove that. probably spending a very large chunk of change to do so.
---
So why would they allow a shit version of that to work?
---
That's the encouragement to join a guild and curate a friends list.
---
Thank god classic will be full of streamers with all their benefits of free gold and any item they want handed to them, just like it was in 2004.
---
Sadly Iceborne ...
---
or is this just fantasy
---
If you're ever on Bigglesworth let Merk know.
---
It depends on your spec, but yeah starting out of stealth is never great. That's what vanish is for though. See also: blind &amp; run away.
---
The raiding checks don‚Äôt make sense. Arcane nor frost are a good raiding spec alone, arcane Frost is. 
---
And for PvP it‚Äôs different per faction, Frost is better as alliance, arcane/x is better for horde.
---
I was alliance my whole life too, until i switched in BfA, was 120 in a week(from 55 because DK) and then i stopped playing BfA a month after.
---
This will not only be my real first time playing ad a horde, it will also be my first time playing on a pvp server, i'll roll druid and habe no idea what to expect in world pvp
---
Admittedly they can be decent, not as good as resto for a number of reason but decent. But I have 0 experience, 0 talent and 0 interest in healing yet the whisper will come
---
Looks like you guys are working hard, keep up the good work fellas! I‚Äôll see you guys on the battle field!
---
It's spelled "Cranius" :)
---
How about the fact that if a player leaves or you kick them a new player is teleported to your instance no wait or downtime?  You think that might play a part?
---
Monotonous tasks are just very vulnerable to the munchies.
---
They might actually put Murky in the BlizzCon virtual ticket. It would definitely make a lot of people mad.
---
No please dont advertise zandalar. The RP will be very strict.
---
Lol they actually made things worse
---
Fuck man. I envy you. My brain is in a civil war. I have nostalgia and I like looking back. But at the same time I also want to put WoW (and all video games) to bed. 
---
Screw it. Let‚Äôs have funüòé
---
got any links for that? would love to check them out and I'm bad at google search
---
And then how steep the fall-off once the servers finally open?
---
Yeahh fu\*k YEAH !!! :) i trust in Blizz again ! :)
---
shazzarah looks unbalanced as fuck
---
Will do, likewise if your on Grobbulous
---
You have to be some kind of mentally challenged bfa fella if you rather go to a website out of game and look there rather than just type in game chat.
---
Black belt keyboard warrior. I bow down to thee
---
In true spirit of #nochanges, yeah we *should* get them back.
---
I guess Blizzard decided it was too automated.
---
The ClassicLFG addon could have existed in Vanilla, was just that it was not mainstream at the time.
---
I mean if ur someone who's playing on Faerlina, you brought that on yourself.
---
DOOOPE ^(Canwehaveskellies?)
---
My friend and I wanted to play horde on Westfall, please bandwagon
---
They killed heal bot because it automated too much as well.
---
Then it will be vanilla like. 
---
I remember people screaming "Snape kills Dumbledore" in trade chat back in the day.
---
\#nochanges
---
I think the artist's name is Samiri, but I'm not quite sure - it's a cropped R34 image though.
---
I have a massive advantage over people that don't read up on the wealth of knowledge on websites like wowhead and icyveins. 
---
Guess I'm a cheat.
---
My guess would be that they're hoping they can take a surgical approach, which might be why they're saying they need several weeks.  But who knows, maybe they'll blow up all the addons or maybe they'll decide the collateral damage to other addons isn't worth it and give up.  We'll just have to wait and see I guess.
---
Pretty sure the entire video was supposed to be satire.
---
Remindme! 5 days
---
How do I look at the overall results?
---
While I agree they should definitely be dealt with, this 100% happened in vanilla, just not to this extent. There were guilds that owned devilsaur spawns on certain servers, and you just had to deal with it.
---
Pretty sure they mean the real world time between release of games.
---
Eh, by the time it matters we're going to have cross-realm BG's and I for one will gladly take the shorter queue time.
---
You broke the first rule. You are now banned.
---
It's called the Heart of the Wild spec (0/30/21). The beef is to put 30 points in feral and 21 in resto for key healing talents (Nature's swiftness most notably, and faster heals and mana regen).
---
Something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxGhscMdxVxfkco). Note that lots of points can be shuffled around to your liking.
---
Well the bar is set abysmally low. 
---
This community ***demands*** purity tests of #nochanges. 
---
So that's literally all Blizzard had to do was just not make changes to the game. 
---
The problem is that it shuts down discussion when that's how people approach things. So we don't get to improve upon or help make a system better, because purity above all else.
---
The best to pair with a shaman is probably a warrior for windfury, but man just play what class you want to, they all have benefits of pairing up together.
---
The best part is that no one knew about this system unless they clicked the damn stone.
---
So most people back in vanilla just thought it was a level range indicator.
---
Playing a game and talking to people vs. dead silence all of the time is actually quite enjoyable. If you consider that a waste of time then, well, stick to retail.
---
Are you still his superior as an Arthas though? That takes precedence over all.
---
They‚Äôre adding 4 new US servers (and probably more to other regions) on Monday and removing the 3 character limit as well on Monday. So they will probably add more on Tuesday depending on how that goes. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any secret at this point that there‚Äôs not enough servers
---
HAHA man I‚Äôm a nerd.
---
 All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
---
Literally only did it to record the new configuration stuff for WeaponSwingTimer.
---
I'd imagine Fairbanks (and the original creator) deserve better than a copy/paste effort, if that's what you mean. Very cute to downvote my post for post for pointing that out, by the way.
---
Yes... that's exactly what I was talking about.
---
No chips? Ramen noodles? And only 1 pack of hot pockets? Cmon brother! You can do better than that.
---
I'm fine with having a chat filter, I think that would be very handy, especially early on, because chat is probably going to be wild.  The part of this addon that I have an issue with is that you can search and form groups within the addon (basically only including other people that have the addon) - that eliminates a portion of the community from your pool of potential party members.  I fear that in order to effectively form groups you would HAVE to have this addon.  Now, if they wanted to put something similar to the premade group finder (which seems to be how this addon functions) into Classic that everyone would have access to (without having to have an addon) - I have no real problem with that.  Some people may be new to WoW, or coming back after a very long time, and may not be aware of the hot new addons.  I would just rather have something that includes everyone.
---
Are you serious? Ulduar heroic and mythic was the best raid ever released with an expansion to date.
---
It was twice as difficult as Emerald Nightmare. MoP and Draenor paled in comparison.
---
It seems almost all entertainment products are released on tuesdays. DVDs, Video games, etc. Just industry standard.
---
\#nochangesUnlessTheyDontLikeSomethingThenThatsADifferentStory
---
If chances are I will get longer use out of the drop than someone I dont know that I am rolling against, I'm sure going to roll on it.  For all I know these flaky pugs are selling their account or re-rolling or quitting.
---
The magic? It'll probably be something like "Hey Dave, the population numbers have reached our set thresholds - we good to add another server?" "Yep."
---
Yeah the devilsaur set is nice but totally not necessary
---
If it remains "just a chat parser" then I don't see Blizzard having a problem with it - primarily because most players aren't so lazy that they need a chat parser in the first place. The problem lies with the addon Devs having said their goal is to attempt to recreate some of the functionality of modern LFG tools, as well as the fact that people without the addon might be at a disadvantage when attempting to find a group.
---
Yeah its hard to say right now with the reddit survey being a small sample size in comparison to how many people will actually be playing
---
Yes it will
---
Great! Tyvm.
---
Beautiful story man. Thanks for sharing. Grandparents certainly are the best and it seems this strong community shares the same feelings about WoW. It means so much to all of us: the friends made, relationships forged, first Rag kill, late nights in AV trying to grind hard to Rank 14. I can‚Äôt wait to experience it all over again.
---
Watching my points being validated by Blizzard who banned the addon makes me feel so good though.
---
daily: couple hours to 3-4; varies depending on my class/work schedule
---
overall: until death do us part
---
Yup. It's all disposability that frees the player from any accountability to not be an asshole. Classic WoW is self policing.
---
THIS SO MUCH THIS. My bro posted a meme that took him 40 minutes to make (he cut out the orc face, pasted it on "no, I dont think I will" Captain American meme and even pasted a whirlwind axe). It got 45 upvotes in like 1 hour but got taken down while another meme that's been posted like 4 times (the one with the void elf looking back at WoW Classic instead of WoW BFA) got front page......
---
"interconnected social network of people using same addon"
---
Please make sure this will not break Mary Sue Protocol roleplayers use, those addons are crucial for us. Thanks &lt;3
---
What I miss the most is the feeling of everything being new and unknown. I feel like following all the guides and power leveling kinda takes it away. 
---
Journey before destination, my friends.
---
Well I'm very hyped but honestly the reason I'm pushing so hard is to hit 53 so I can farm the cindercloth cloak pattern with no competition then head over to the plaguelands and farm the crusader enchant with no competition. It's going to be infinitely more difficult to farm those patterns once people start getting mid to high 60's so I want to get there first.

Go back to BFA.

CDprojekt Red is pretty amazing. Besides that....

Yeah maybe it's cuz I've been out of online gaming for a while, but I've been surprised how normaliZed it is on this sub. Like, I did it too when I was a teenager and was a shit, but it should still be making way more ppl cringe than upvote.
---
The more the game is automated, the less people interact with each other. We're coming back to classic to reignite the old social elements lost in retail. 
---
Boycott LFG.
---
The odd title just means we can probably conscript him to the nolife crowd if he gets into it. Could always use another farmer for the guils
---
Hunter
---
the hunters get the best of us atleast once, have no shame sir
---
Now that's what I call quality!
---
You have epic or even legendary friends to make those. :)
---
How many versions of this damn survey do we need? And they still haven't put in the extra breakdown for Oceanic.
---
If you're tired it's good to take a walk outside. The best thing to do when you want to wake up imo.
---
Surely it costs more than 2 euros and 63 cents to power that giant bright billboard for a couple hours? How cheap is electricity in NL?
---
This is exactly it. I think people should be able to play the game how they want, as long as the controversial portions are optional community addons that fall within Blizzard's plan for the API.
---
Those are reagents that mages need. The first two are Runes for casting Teleports and Portals. The pile of dust is needed for casting Arcane Brilliance (party buff) and the feather is needed for casting Slow Fall.
---
Nobody is saying it to be special. We are saying it because its true. Its an "i told you so" situation and it has come full circle. Oh nooow its satire.... Ok gotcha ;)
---
You could go PvP to pve but not the opposite
---
Yes that would be bad and people could technically do that but why would they?  The whole point of the addon is chat parsing the addon communicating with others was just a bonus.   There's no reason for people using the addon to exclude people not using the addon because the ultimate point of the addon isn't to exclude them it's to make them easier to find. 
---
Either way that bit is what blizzard will be breaking.
---
You realise everyone has a different idea of what it's *supposed* to be?
---
So much misinformation... I lol'd when I read that supplementing protein shakes will make you fat and PWO will give you a heart attack!
---
While wearing a horde thong
---
I say leave it. if people want to use it let them. its an add-on not an in-game feature.
---
Clean and simple, I like it! :D
---
Nice lies from these people. People did not like it because it's just an unofficial version of what the lfg tool is in retail. This have 0 to do with streamers. Guess these people don't think people can think for them selfs.
---
The world quest group finder still exists. 
---
I'm saying this just to point out this - if whoever is developing a classic dungeon finder wants to, they will be able to find a way around it.
---
Blizzard stopped at a point with the world quest stuff after they had already limited the functionality of several other addons. It's annoying because there was one called premade group finder - it tracked premade groups that matched your settings and notified you. So with a BFA example, it would notify you when a rustfeather group formed. Can't do that now.
---
The worst part though as I mentioned - you can still form groups with the world quest group finder. Their goal that they set out to remove that didn't work. Sure, it's inconvenient now since you need to type the quest ID into a box and click through the list, but it still works. Blizzard are probably satisfied in this case because I think the goal with limiting that was to reduce server load honestly, but that's not the case with the classic LFG.
---
They sure did. 
---
Yeah I would consider Overwatch pretty much the gold standard.
---
Nope. It was always 30 days, and I only know this because I server hopped quite a bit back then.
---
Haters gon hate
---
We must continue the trend of taking a photo instead of pressing print screen. (Sorry no disrespect)
---
Why do you keep insisting that I am "moving the goalposts"? The whole fucking discussion is about LFG; and why do people want Classic so bad? One of the primary reasons: the sense of community and the social aspect. That's why people don't want it. Because with time, that addon (or something else entirely) will get so powerful and feature rich that not only will it become a must have, but it will also limit or reduce the social interaction aspect of Classic. I don't care what the "current generation" don't have time for, we didn't want to bring Classic back to cater to the current generation, that's what retail is for. We brought Classic back to go back to what the game once was. 
---
&gt; The people playing today are not the lonely new to internet and mmo crowd that my gen were when we got going originally.  
---
That's a load of bullshit. I'd argue today's generation are actually more lonely.  
---
Also, just to be clear here, I never said we didn't have LFG addons. I said "Vanilla didn't have group finder and so shouldn't Classic" - because with today's API and general coding capabilities these addons will sooner or later evolve into essentially a mini group finder tool that will become a "must have" and will interfere or severely limit the social aspect in comparison to what it was back in Vanilla. There's no doubt times have changed and the way we will interact won't magically go back to how it used to be, but to get the best possible experience we shouldn't start allowing addons that introduce current-gen quality of life changes, then we might as well just go back to retail. Without Blizzard preventing this people will basically start incorporating every single retail QoL change into Classic with addons. No one wants that, so I think it's great that Blizzard is doing everything they can to prevent that from happening.
---
Even typed out this line still gives me chills...
---
Same here, that box art was it.
---
That's exactly correct it was not mainstream at the time, but we now live in 2019. Retail players are used to LFG, they expect it, so when we have an addon which accomplishes even 30% of what that could accomplish you can bet your ass it's going to be more popular than it was than in vanilla. 
---
Herein lies the fear that the majority of the retail player base will use this addon and completely change the culture of classic wow from what it was. Can you see how this might change your experience with vanilla in which it wasn't popular?
---
They could probably just make it so add-ons can only auto whisper friends, party members, raid members and guild members.
---
You are thinking of the world channel, you can't do that in lfg channel.
---
WoW is actually how I got to a healthy weight. I was too busy to eat, so I lost 40 lbs of fat in like 8 months. üòÇ
---
Vanilla and TBC were my sweet spots, but as much as I like the idea of flying mounts, they really changed something that I wish had never changed.
---
Just make sure u don't skip potions class to play WoW
---
Cartman freezing of course being a reference to The Shining.
---
Come to die.
---
It was.
---
Here you go. 
---
You leave MadSeason outta this! 
---
I'm going in raw son, RAW
---
Very similar. I've tweaked it to my personal liking.
---
Looks like a good time!
---
Except they are changing it from the OG game but sure
---
Same here, I went with my brother and my bf at the time when we were leveling at the time (back in BC)... We were higher level than the place but we were 3 maning, it took HOURS!!
---
^ Didn‚Äôt play vanilla.
---
Lmao I think this sub has enough of a sense of humor to laugh at that. It's true, we don't deny it!
---
It's classic, print screen wasn't invented back then
---
I imagine feet of snow. The entire place is covered and never melts.
---
I could imagine.
---
Back then you‚Äôd be upset you didn‚Äôt get a nice upgrade now you‚Äôll be upset you didn‚Äôt get that upgrade you know for a fact is bis until xx level and your leveling path is all thrown off and your day is ruined.
---
Unfortunately blizzard can only address in game and add ons. Out of game communities will still exist and attempt to do these types of things.
---
it literally just filtered through chat to find possible groups
---
I am not, it would be pretty boring and I doubt I have the harddrive space to save all that footage to!
---
Very fun once you get it. I remember feeling bad for kiting, but i grew to love it.
---
SUCCEEDING YOU, GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GRANDSON
---
Hey so I downloaded retail WoW and I‚Äôve come to find out my original realm is now gone :/ and with it my characters. Is there anything I can do?
---
I use discord but I'm far from an expert, but can you explain how discord would be different from private and public ventrillos, teamspeak, guild forums, and server forums that we had in vanilla?
---
absolute top class
---
More like "if it becomes just a chat parser" since it is certainly more than that currently. I was mostly just saying that I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard attempted to specifically break the portions they had an issue with rather than break everything that the addon did. Because the nuke it all option would definitely impact other addons more in line with "presenting information".
---
Wanting organized information isn't lazy so I don't know why you had to throw that comment in there.
---
Devilsaur leather monopoly by keeping the mobs under guard by both factions coordinated by multiple guilds/people using presumably an addon or probably Discord.
---
Basically how real life resource exploitation works.
---
Looking forward to levelling my warrior and stance dancing my way to glory
---
I'm not for this stuff, but goodluck proving collusion for bans in the age of discord.  These guys do not need to communicate at all in game.  Proving collusions for bans is virtually impossible.
---
yeah but when pizzas on a bagel you can eat pizza any time
---
Skeram :/  Would have fun to have a rogue duo.
---
You're in for a rude awakening
---
There are probably logs that can be used to track this as well, probably no need to have people monitoring actions in real time.
---
Eh, they can't have a monopoly if we wipe them. I think you're underestimating the community on &lt;server shall not be named&gt;. We will organize regular raids to push them out and farm our mats. They might be able to keep soloers out of farming but they can't stop our guilds.
---
After a few nights of that treatment they'll break apart. This isn't a private server, they can't bully real players.
---
I actually would, if there was a single decent one, I am not even kidding.
---
Not wanting a retail LFG lite add-on is elitist? Ok. Retail boy mad.
---
I mean they could just randomise the spawn location of either to any mob spawn point location in the zone. That would significantly hamper any mafia controlling the market.
---
You know whats weird?
---
This is like the 100th salty post about blizz killing the LFG addon for classic.
---
But I didn't never saw anyone voicing a strong "pro" LFG addon opinion. Certainly not as many as the amount of salty posts would suggest. Most were against the addon or apathetic.
---
I bet it is the creator of the addon under different accounts. Upset because he thought he'd be able to find a way to make a buck.
---
Honestly, I could play with either and not care.
---
Ah, i see! Best of luck!
---
noice
---
Noggenfogger my dude!
---
Yeah.... I imagine that this is actually *more* work.
---
Exactly this. In Eve we call this 'delivering content'.
---
There were bossmod in vanilla.
---
I always thought the old saying "the only wow killer is wow killing itself" meant it was just going to become so bad it would die out. Had no idea it would be more of a younger, fit, better looking version of yourself traveling forward in time smother you with a pillow while you, sleeping and steal all of your friends, and living your life the way you should have. What a twist! 10/10
---
obesity starter pack
---
i subbed today to get my names and get the HYPE TRAIN GOIN BOOOOOOIIIS
---
lol, haven‚Äôt created a new character for years, so I didn‚Äôt even know that this was implemented xD
---
Dont wanna be a jerk, but just use the search funktion here. this has been answere like 10x? in the last 2 weeks
---
No, but perception is.
---
Nothing better than devs being pressured by uninformed masses into ruining the experience for others.
---
Sorry that I don‚Äôt enjoy spamming /2 for an hour when there was an addon created to filter the chat.
---
I was with you with these until this one man. It should have a *huge* disclaimer that arcane talent points are only to buff the other two specs. This is really misleading
---
Really, go back to retail. We really don‚Äôt want to play with you guys. I doubt you even last 2 weeks.
---
But wait, did you buy Joanas guide?!
---
I thought you only bought rank 1 of frost nova to save gold?
---
&gt; Isn't getting the group made quicker just making that interaction happen quicker and easier without having to sort through the spam?
---
In my opinion, no. I remember back in the day actually getting whispers from people who desperately needed a healer. Or someone from the party Hearthing back into Orgrimmar or a different zone to they could find someone. 
---
This may seem insanely tedious but it really adds to the magic of the game and the community of the server.
---
What boy king? Anduin isn't ruling anything!
---
I'm still confused.  What does the lfg addon have to do with assholes?  Anyone can use it asshole or not
---
Thank you guys!
---
Alliance = A bunch of Jerrys

Think you got the wrong flag on it. Its not red.

If it gets really bad, just try a less social game like retail.
---
Death before taxes

I would like to try to return to my secret beach in Teldrassil. &lt;3
---
"When looking for people it will periodically write in a public channel of your choice to make people without the Addon¬†aware of the group."
---
Rather have add-on spam
---
Casually playing I stopped for 10 months lol.  Only doing rep grind and mythic + apart from that the expansion is meh
---
&gt; And if it was gaining enough steam in Vanilla, they would have taken a hard look at it.
---
Where do you think the LFG system came from?
---
&gt;The reason they allowed it back then was because add ons weren't as popular as they were today.
---
This is one of those weird myths that people like to perpetuate.  Addons were just as popular, and required in any raiding guild as they are today.
---
Classic WoW populations are looking to be much higher. Herod is going to be a 10k+ concurrent player server.
---
Layering will help a lot for guys who speed level to 60, but Blizzard is looking to drop it in a month or two. After that, its back to 5 spawns and 10K+players trying to get Devilsaur gear.
---
In a non streamer guild? Whoever rolls, bids, blows the council best!
---
Wow classic experience should not be altered, good move on blizzard on restricting quality of life addons. The belt should be further tightened. If people are sad about this they can go back to the hell-hole known as bfa.
---
Wow you retail folk sure did get triggered
---
Holy god I understood (and have done) this reference...
---
Have I games too much?!
---
Looking for something specific?
---
ouch, seems like a lot of work
---
I hope they just take out the automation and leave the search/offer functionality but block information beyond what you get from shift-clicking a persons name.
---
Ahh relive the experience but not the experience that *other* people lived because that experience was "wrong" and not "in the spirit of vanilla."  
---
Get over yourself.
---
Well for a group that is so against changes to the classic version of the game you sure are a sensitive bunch when it comes to features and addons that were already in the game.
---
I'm healthy and games have the opposite effect.  I am always under my calorie count and don't drink nearly enough water.
---
Bears bare all though
---
I peep that breaking Benjamin üëçüèº I‚Äôm close to finishing my classic playlist too, might post it on here when I finish!
---
That's my firm belief but it's a 2 party system.
---
Hahahaha, the name cracked me up!  XD
---
What are your character names?
---
the only really visible change is the lighting system and the water
---
Wow friends
---
How much playtine at release are you planning?
---
Ye olde orgrimmar anus rattler.
---
Planted my main and his trusty tree frog in Moonglade for the last time.  Enjoy retirement old friend.  It's time to go home again.
---
No, I'm just talking from experience because unlike a lot of people whining about this mod incessantly I remember exactly what it was like trying to pug instances through the lfg channels and city spam.
---
- Mage Armor gives you mana regen, which is the best stat that will increase your leveling speed (don't get me started on spellpower, read the FAQ on my Google Doc)   
---
- Ice Armor gives you extra armor, which you're pretty much only gonna need in PvP.    
---
Thats basically it. If you're looking for leveling efficiency you need to use Mage Armor, if there are players from the opposite faction nearby though you might be better off using Ice Armor.
---
So you've moved from "Reeeee queues!" To "omg the amount of people!".  
---
How about just calm the F down.
---
Don't tell me what to play please, live and classic its not just lfg diffrence and if i use lfg why u should care, do world chat whitout my nick spamming that my group need tank for dungeon ruins your classic journey? Pls dont say like if everyone starts using it there will be empty chat and no social, and social is key in classic bla bla bla. LF x for y. Inv. What a big social part we lose.
---
I want to do soemthing similar. Aside from glue, is there any non-destructive way to make the discs stay in place?
---
Also I wanna get some artwork done for it. Or find some good ones anyways. I only have the OG stuff and don‚Äôt wanna buy a battlechest for Art (assuming I still can)

---
Discord is a significant efficiency improvement over the mediums you described. Essentially Discord has combined the four mediums.
---
But! Will the average player know to find a server Discord and be active in their LFG channel? I would suspect there are more players using addons than players participating in Discords for LFG purposes.
---
Didn't.... Didn't Blizzard add LFG to base WoW because people hated the system?
---
I'll be there right next to you. Free world PvP content just waiting? It's gonna be amazing.
---
it was basically a stone of mystery for a long time
---
My wife and I, along with three friends will also be on Fairbanks. I think it's going to be a comfortable server to be in. At least 20% more relaxing than the other servers.
---
Call In sick
---
You would want these people to leave. These visitors are not good for Classic. They just want the the game to their preferences.
---
How do you ban it?  You can't prove anything.  Blizzard going to monitor these guys on discord?  lol
---
Classic is pretty much exactly what I wanted. All the old textures rendered with new water and new light rays. It's the best of both worlds.
---
TAKE A SHOT FOR THE BOYS
---
Meeting stones didn't even work in vanilla.
---
My (pessimistic) guess is Herod will likely see 4~6 hours queues. Like - Blizz straight up said they've increased the queue threshold because people were overflowing the queue during name reservations. 
---
Queues are also one-out, one-in. And I don't imagine a lot of folks logging the first few hours... 
---
Hopefully the layering pays off and things function as expected. And hopefully the larger discords/streamers don't overload some layers and crash servers. 
---
Regardless though - a scuffed launch with rando discos and sudden client patches is about as #nochanges as it gets.
---
We had a guy in RFC during the stress test Beta who was trying to micromanage the whole group critiquing every last thing that everyone was doing.  Towards the end, he noted that i (a rogue) was top DPS but that i was a noob because it was mostly white damage.  
---
Yeah champ, it's true, at level 13 i'm going to get a lot more out of keeping slice and dice up than i am using baseline eviscerate on mobs that die before i can even generate 3 combo points.  
---
Decent players that think they know what they're talking about but don't can often be far worse than total noobs who are willing to play as a team and learn.
---
do you play on your old computer, use ventrilo etc, because if no, u are in same "quality of life" club my friend
---
And going
---
Valid point. I still prefer pizza rolls. But im a pleb.
---
I'm a supporter of new classic content, but only after all the old content has been out for quite a while
---
If you‚Äôre semi hardcore or a casual, then no, none of this min max shit matters at all. The majority of WoW players don‚Äôt give a shit about the potential whatever small % increase in dps you could have if you were human. Gnome rogues for life.
---
Been there done that but in other lines of work. When management turns into a bunch of tonerheads it's really hard to push good content. 
---
Steve Jobs spoke a lot about this in his interview for the documentary Triumph of the Nerds.
---
Just in case you forget wtf frostbolt does!
---
I have adapted to it.
---
Turn off all the chats and use a discord overly for my server that's moderated. 
---
It's what plenty of people are doing sonlools likenthat stopping social networking though addons people dont want to use. Just backfired since people are going out of game now to group up
---
*5:55 PM*? Must be nice!
---
Classes start in october at my university so i'm good to go
---
I feel like sleeping would increase efficiency far more than straight marathoning.
---
Lmao imagine getting mad about a classic wow add on that didn‚Äôt exist when classic was around and the developers said they want to make a true representation of what the game was.
---
In the beginning there was 4 CDs the fifth was added in later :)
---
Believe it or not, back in the day you're personal reputation mattered. I remember countless times where people wouldn't get invited to a dungeon or raid because they were known as trolls. 
---
That social dynamic made it so trolls didn't want to troll, at least not to a point where it made things difficult. It was a deterrent.
---
Penny Arcade, back when it was amazing. 
---
That‚Äôs PRE-DickWolves...the comic that started a big portion of PC shit in games culture and the immense decline in Penny Arcade and PAX Expos :(

Ive followed PA since they began. It helped get me through high school in a way and helped me make friends.
---
Then it went kinda downhill after the aforementioned incident attracted the wrong crowds attention.
---
I was already prepping my /dnd can't heal but if you need a bear hit me up
---
You do realize that this is less about being social in a game and more like those annoying peddlers on the streets coming up to you trying to sell you stuff you don't need right?
---
you know there is a LFG channel
---
r/iamverybadass
---
So for Blaumeux seems pretty chill. Barely see any drama around it so far. I'm pretty sure it'll fill up around launch time too.
---
Although I agree with everything you're saying, all the riff raff garbage was part of classic.
---
I said it once and I'll say it again, classic was great for its time, knowing what we know now it was a bad game though.
---
Beautiful.
---
Opinion-based arguments are never "unbeatable"
---
even while having full T2 I still needed it :p
---
I got some lols outa that.
---
Then it'll just be the classic Vanilla WoW experience.
---
Ventrillo and Teamspeak weren't used to find groups, they were used after a group was made to communicate with your group and functioned fundamentally different from Discord. Swing and a miss, good try though.
---
The point is if the main argument against this was dividing the community between those who used it and those who didn't, then Discord needs to be included or you're literally just talking out your ass.
---
Bliz axing it after launch
---
Discord is an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using it
---
I'm with you, the panicking is really premature.
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying here, but a rich man can still have the opinion of the poor. In other words, just because streamers may have certain luxuries doesn‚Äôt mean that they can‚Äôt feel that the LFG add-on is a bad idea.
---
Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be a streamer playing Classic. Part of the experience I want is to enjoy the world again with my old crew and make new friends along the way. Just like it used to be, warts and all.
---
Lol really? NA Draenor or EU ?
---
So excited to leave the toxicity of retail behind. Classic, you're the familiar feeling I never knew I needed so much.
---
It's really surprising to me how people can be oblivious to the business model they are employing with classic.  The difference in communication alone shows how different they view retail to classic
---
Sorry dad you missed it. Stress test was that opportunity.
---
Well lets just hope they didnt mess other stuff up!
---
Wait whaT? They dont allow LFG addon now?
---
Missed opportunity tbh, If it had of come out, I‚Äôd have bought it, instead I installed the original and played it, I‚Äôm in no rush to play this now, I‚Äôll pick it up when it eventually goes on sale.
---
Oh yeah its an evolution of what we had before, god, remember switching ventrillos? You'd have to type in the IP and password to get a new server, god forbid if you updated and it lost that data. Now its just click a fucking icon and you're in a new server.. 
---
Anywhoo, if anything I see the discord players would isolate themselves which isn't nessesarily a bad thing, its like a super-guild that they can advertise people to join here and other places, they can do w/e they want outside the game just like before, they can always re-join everyone else in the lookingforgroup channel if that doesn't work out for them.
---
this was amazing.
---
It's already being changed, this doesn't need another topic. Shut the fuck up.
---
I made all dwarves for my 3 name reservations. I've played humans and night elves for my vanilla and BC times, but my very first character ever was a dwarf, and I really loved it.. the lore.. what an awesome race.
---
In WotLK going into Cata, I had a male human warrior tank and female human priest healer. Their names were mirrored, I won't say what, but this whole concept was to emulate two *polar opposite* play styles.. that being class and gender, with their names literally being spelt backwards to eachother.. but fluent as in they were still readable and actually quite fitting to their class.
---
It was a cool unique idea I came up with that I'm doing again in this Classic release... Except this time time slightly different. Instead of trying to create two *polar opposite characters (minus race), I am doing the same thing except this time as dwarves because they are truly my favorite race. And this time, going for the idea that they are not 2 different people, but instead the same- almost like a spec change, like a split personality. I will eventually have 2 lvl 60 dwarves. A male dwarf warrior tank and a male dwarf priest healer, with striking resembling features (all same except tank has black hair and beard and healer has white).
---
You or everyone else might not care. But to me, I think it's a super interesting concept, and I can't wait to do it again.
---
Its not an opinion. Its a fact that is optional to share the group in world chat. It would split the community.
---
Maybe if someone made an addon for it
---
I plan to stock up on food and drinks Sunday night, then my 6 day vacation from work starts Monday, so I‚Äôll get to experience what all the launch has to offer. I plan to play for around 20 hours each day.
---
That's the point. I'm in a group with 3 other people who want to do a dungeon and one of them uses the LFG add-on to find a random. Rather than tapping social connections for people we already know from Guild or friends list, they get a random, unvetted person of an appropriate class. Maybe they're good, maybe they're not. Maybe they're an elitist asshole that yells at our healer and we lose a healer.
---
I've played modern WoW and I've ran into far too many of these types, so if there's a way to make it harder for them to join my groups, by all means. I'd rather play with backwards keybinds and a trackpad than a good amount of players on modern WoW.
---
I think that a LFG tool isn't that bad, honestly. But I would rather make the barriers to entry absolutely brutal for the modern player of WoW so that they come with a better mindset for the community.
---
&gt; Honestly don't know how that's possible
---
The post is super vague, and sounds like just a PR attempt to quell all the complaints on the forums until everyone forgets about it. 
---
They could block addons from inviting people (which would definitely go against "no changes"), but I seriously doubt they are going to block addons from accessing chat messages because that would break many other very popular addons.
---
I think they're really just saying they're going to watch how the addon is being used and if it starts doing anything else (e.g. gear/talent inspection) they might restrict those things. But I'm confident they aren't going to actually block the current functionality of the addon (other than MAYBE auto-inviting).
---
They came from the beginners guide inside a Battle Chest. They had sections for each race :)
---
Thanks!
---
I can‚Äôt wait to get back to the elvenforest.
---
Goldshire 1-10, then Stormwind 11-48, then Iron Forge 49-60. It also depends on server and meta. If there's three humans dancing on mailboxes in SW but none in GS, move to GS.
---
make it 2 if you are a warrior.

There WAS a way. Most people did that on last open stress test, it lasted several days. 
---
Anyways, setting key binds does not take too long and you certainly can live without addons for first few hours right?
---
Haribo makes the best gummy bears.
---
What does the future matter though? This is a classic server with no "future" guaranteed... You all wanted the "authentic" vanilla experience and that included addons.
---
you think you do.......
---
I didn't say anything about queues, I'm just a little pessimistic about the "playability" of the game on launch day.  That doesn't diminish my excitement even though you're apparently a professional wet blanket.
---
Nah, I played vanilla and xferred my priest to a different server not on the transfer list (as a paid transfer).  Transfers were definitely in game late vanilla
---
What about the rolling restarts they mentioned would happen sometime before release? did it already happen or something
---
ah, cremposting
---
It's too early to tell, but it seems like Blameux will be the most balanced server.
---
"Look at my name everyone!"
---
Some of the add-ons I wanted to use hadn't come out yet.
---
rogue main here, i'll definitely be a guinea pig for you for testing this addon.
---
Looks like someone didnt get on the front of the boat fast enough!
---
I'll take a potato chip..... AND EAT IT!!!!
---
Many people are confused as to "why"
---
And 2.0.1 added the lfg feature
---
I will when I have the time :)
---
IIRC it has some kind of diminishing return worked in where enemies have a chance to break it that gets increasingly higher the longer it lasts.
---
Anyone who chooses to only group with people using the addon is just limiting their own results and making it harder to find /fill a group lol.  It's literally the opposite of the intended purpose of the addon.
---
Either way that's what blizzard will be breaking so they can't talk to each other.  Guess you're okay with the lfg addon now
---
Depending on what aspects of the addOn they're trying to prohibit, I imagine it will be pretty easy to avoid conflicting with any existing or future ones, at least not in a way they wouldn't also want to block. Honestly though, this whole debacle has me thinking about life in Classic without any addOns at all, and to be honest, I'd be okay with it.
---
Dying in Elwynn Forest because of THOSE GODDAMN MURLOCKS!
---
no one‚Äôs actually going to use the ingame chat because it‚Äôs absolute horseshit.  Just because they removed 14 years of content doesn‚Äôt mean advertisements and scammers are going to go away. The moment the game releases, people will flock to discord channels.
---
if servers works right? cus if they crash they will stay up a total of 0 hours lul
---
small towns are exotic. you dont go to ironforge for a holiday. and avoid NE areas and forests, they have seen all what you got to offer already
---
So go post in the megathread.
---
If I said no, would you believe you?
---
Ok i asked this question before and was told the stone was little more than something to stand by while you wait for a group.
---
What happens when you click it???
---
Oh it's definitely dead. 70% of retail is China.
---
I think a lot of us are like that, I don't know how many times the guild I was in imploded, then the core group would start a new one and then most of the people from the old guild would rejoin because they were still friends and they cycle started again. 
---
Always found stratholme fun, fond memories, and yeah always a lot of work with, does everyone have their raid equipment, their potions, etc.
---
The less you have to talk with people, the more distant the game becomes. When you have to talk with people it bonds yourself with the game and the community.
---
Imo wow classic is just that.  It is what it is.  It didn't have any so it won't.
---
Nochanges
---
Complex reasons. But certainly one of them is that it has been proven that if you don't pay attention to your food, you will eat more (It takes longer to feel full). In other words, when you're out there grinding, or doing a dungeon, and just quickly shoving some stuff down your gob, you'll feel less full compared to if you sat down to that meal on its own.
---
It's a problem with TV as well, or even books. We're also social eaters, so we naturally adapt to the amount of food those around us eat. Distracted, eating alone - the typical state of the people you're talking about - we're far more likely to overeat.
---
TL;DR: The old no-phones-no-TV family dinner does a lot right by mere existence.
---
He doesn't know, pepehands.
---
hard to really tell what a class is going to be like till like 40-50's+
---
can't go wrong with mage tho. warlock is a bit more niche.
---
Thanks Classic Team! Can we have some more skeletons too? :)
---
[That‚Äôs the breaks](https://youtu.be/qzl-2g5HhaI)
---
the horde should leave and go to a new server. fixes realm population and balance!
---
oh crap i didnt know there was a megathread. sorry
---
"Side by side comparison"
---
Not a single side by side frame except for the intro
---
hmm
---
Can't levitate on lava. Always had to hop on brd lava runs. Renew and bubble would be fine though.
---
Good don't play Classic than easy.
---
So you believe the lfg channel should be removed then since it facilitates finding random people instead of searching your guild and friendlist?
---
Spirit gear is really nice to regenerate between fights, and shamans are pretty viable tanks while leveling. Shure, not in raids, but paladins are neither and druids only sometimes and in speedruns iirc
---
Hue hue hue
---
Guys, vanilla didn‚Äôt have guilds we need the LFG tool
---
I absolutely see where you're coming from, that's difficult to convey in this format with such a weird situation. Sorry for the hate, I know you get enough of it. Your guides have been great!
---
It was like that in the guide. Mainly due to children obtaining the guide and families. This game back in the day truly brought families together.
---
Trolls do exist! So funny haha
---
Ion has said in the past that they will be breaking addons that go against the spirit of Classic.
---
Even tho this is a crossover image but for this you can tell he's a human dog by the funco pops, the REAL HORDE! have authentic statues
---
Cast it back into the fires of My. Hyjal!
---
It's literally the first post that isn't stickied at the very top of the fucking list of topics.
---
Modern players, sure in 2005 computing was harder ... just being a PC gamer in that era meant you had a certain level of patience in almost all cases.
---
Got a link? Pm me if it‚Äôs not allowed!
---
DaE rEtAiL bAd ClAsSiC gOoD?!?
---
I really hope this sub stops talking about retail when classic comes out. Why can't we just enjoy classic without thinking about that dumpster fire?
---
Warriors tank with a shield. Theres no such thing as a 2handed tank until druids get all their BiS gear from AQ.
---
Hmm, so you're saying to use one character and respec?
---
I have a question about this that might be weird; why do some people i.e. Sodapoppin, Esfand play three of the same character then? Is it because they have the time available to maintain all 3?
---
Kinda funny that they're still needing a healer lol
---
Hi, /u/CodyMavrick

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuptkl/thumbs_up_lets_do_this/). 
---
ni hao
---
Sure, but a) that likely affects other addons and b) only creates barriers, doesn't stop it. 
---
Really, all you would do by forcing this into public/default chat channels is ensure that those channels are even less useful than they will already be due to the massively increased server population by adding a bunch of noise from addon chat messages.
---
Or say you restrict addons from sending messages at all - great, now the addon just generates a string for you to copy/paste into either chat or a macro, then it can still read that out of the channels.
---
I really don't think it's possible to stop this behavior without the solution being substantially worse than the "problem."
---
It was part of vanilla, lol
---
This
---
so retail is free if you get a subscription? You don't have to buy the game?
---
As I said to the other guy, I'd rather you be right about this than me.
---
Threat meters like KTM, parse the combat log and share information to others users through the API : SendChatMessage and SendAddonMessage, in that way everyone have same information. Of course data is processed with some sort functions, but basically it's that way you have accurate information.
---
The old KTM didn't share information, so you only see what your combat log shows you and nothing else, sometimes it give you the information of players there are near you, but that's it.
---
We want a shrubbery!
---
Fuckin' BFA baby /spit /spit /spit
---
bfa kids btfo forever
---
you hold alot of responsibility up on your shoulders
---
You can muck around in retail for a few days before Classic launch, you just can't go past level 110 or have access to any of the BFA content.
---
My name was "Stupidface" all during Vanilla and part of BC before being reported on Sentinels lol üòÖ
---
Just make sure he's playing on US West, it will be relatively playable if it's a PST server, if he's on an EST server you may suffer pretty badly.
---
Since you are failing at reading comprehension, let me put it onto simple bullet points for you, just like Blizzard has to change the dungeons and talent trees for your dumb ass:
---
1. In game channels are the primary way that players communicate and coordinate. Blizzard thinks these social channels are acceptable and do not need banned.
---
2. Blizzard wants to make you talk to people and not be an antisocial asshole like you currently are.
---
3. The LFG Add-on allows people to run dungeons without socializing, which Blizzard (see #2) doesn't like.
---
Therefore
---
4. The LFG Add-on does not adhere to the original ideals of the game, and as Blizzard has stated throughout the entire Classic WoW process, they are attempting to recreate that same experience.
---
I agree with Blizzard, having played hundreds of hours in Vanilla and other expansions before WoW became a loot vending machine with pretty colors.
---
Up to 110.
---
A goblin run town could double your audience.
---
Just call it WDH  Westfall Defias Hideout
---
This is what the addon should be. A easy way to see who is lfg sobwe can whisper them.
---
I can literally hear the guitar riff starting up
---
Imagine a time when teenagers could make a point without using the low-effort, low-IQ "imagine" meme.
---
Zoomers go home.
---
why are you still responding lol
---
BFA content is not free, but all content from level 110 and before are all "free with subscription"
---
It was part of vanilla, classic wow aims for, well, classic experience, how much explanation do you need.  
---
Some people perhaps found traveling the bad memory, but blizzard devs won‚Äôt add flying mounts just because of that.
---
I miss Winterspring.
---
My anecdote was relevant to my point that the LFD tool is not the culprit. It's an example that shows a limited player pool is what the foundation of the community is built on. That is why the original devs put server caps below their technical limitations (confirmed in recent dev interviews) and why the person driving those caps actually wanted them even smaller than they were.
---
Once again, the driving force of any community is repeated interactions, and that happens by limiting the player pool. No matter how you get into a group, if someone exhibits the undesirable behaviors you mentioned they will carry that reputation with them, but that only matters if you are in a position where you run into that player again. How does a LFG addon prevent that? The LFD tool (and certainly a LFG addon) isn't keeping a database of players you group with to avoid in future groups. Cross server queues (and the resulting expansion of the player pool) is why that happens in retail, but if you think that's incorrect then I'd love to hear your explanation.
---
Yeah, no.
---
We give you buffs now so that you can get huge and carry us in raids.
---
Incendius For the Horde!
---
I member prom, I played ne rogue Dagankster (lol) and I was in moonshade

I eas 9y when i started. Yet on my dads acc so he can check randomly my guild and friend lists.
---
Ofc, becouse iam playing alliance! :)
---
I just laughed way to hard
---
&gt;Did anyone REALLY truly like HoTs tho?
---
No, the answer is no
---
NICE thanks so much.
---
What the fuck
---
So spam fireball?
---
yeah guys everyone should go to sleep a few hours in. especially if your on whitemane :)
---
I'm gonna follow staysafes guide for solo leveling  -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc3advdw5RI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc3advdw5RI)
---
I am a stick.
---
Swing timers are great for kiting. Since Warriors love using slow weapons, it makes sense to hit a mob, run for like 3 seconds or however long your swing timer is, then come back in range to swing again since the mob you're fighting will most likely have a faster swing timer than you.
---
This allows you to go 1 to 1 with blows from mobs rather than you getting hit 2-3 times per 1 time you hit.
---
rep is 98% useless. you just need to know which ones the 2% are
---
Holy shit the level of pettiness and anger in this sub is ridiculous. Regardless of your stance why do people need to be gatekeeping assholes?
---
And... holy *shit* I am out of mana. Why does this spell cost 800 mana?!
---
I really hope that they add server transfers. Else it will be pain when I relocate across continents later.
---
People went out of game to group up in vanilla. Nothing new there.
---
I've never been on a progression raid in my life that wasn't in vent or ts discord etc.
---
it's not like using a voice chat client isn't the norm and hasn't been the norm for the last 15 years, it has.
---
Not true at all, it's extremely important to get if you're single target lvling. you're suppose to wand targets down by about 15-20% hp so you can let the 5 second rule kick in and have minimal downtime.
---
Theres a reason why almost every mage lvling guide recommends picking up this talent.
---
But this is exactly how you should set up a second monitor when your main monitor requires most of your focus.
---
Everyone makes mistakes, and sometimes people overreact to those mistakes. People will have more tolerance for mistakes, and potentially even offer suggestions and help each other when it aligns with there interest.
---
Unless I really misunderstand the tool. I am not sure why Blizzard is bothering to remove it. This seems closer to the LFG Interface that was added in 2.0.1 that was immensely unpopular and essentially not used during Burning Crusade. Eventually being replaced by the Dungeon Finder in Wrath of the Lich King
---
Aww thanks! No worries, you definetly aren't "hating", your giving valid feedback! 99% of people arent hating at all, usually its just people being VERY passionate about their favorite class (and often for the ones that are actually being angry/intentioanlly mean, they get downvoted super fast)
---
I just noticed at the start he says odd go left. Then when the whelp panic starts, he says left side, even side. So that's a 50 DKP minus right there.
---
I think the only way they could really consistently do it without breaking everything would be if they were talking about addons communicating with each other.  But that would break a lot of other addons that were part of vanilla like the gatherer addons and most database based addons.
---
i haven't played wow in like a year but my subsciption was still running which is good i guess :D
---
Plus better music
---
Really impressed by Blizzard attention to community opinion and their speed of reaction! Feels great!
---
Haha I walk you through holding your hand the whole way and you still get lost.  You're still pushing all the negativity about how retail lfg works onto an addon that doesnt have the things that make retail lfg bad.
---
Some people are hopeless
---
its equal poor as saying for guy to play bfa just because he wanna use addons or impoved water/light efects
---
It‚Äôs an older meme but it checks out.
---
God bless them. They jumped on this so fast. I absolutely love that this thing couldn't even make launch before getting eviscerated.
---
My hype is through the roof.
---
Same.    i only took hunters into instances if there was literally no other dps just to avoid their bullshit.
---
Got a link to that desktop background?
---
With all due respect, nobody cares about RP players. Something like the LFG add-on could potentially impact the millions of normal players. It won't garner much attention what the dozens of RP guys do as you lot play the game differently anyway
---
the horde are honorable people
---
Go back to BFA. You can LFG forever
---
I like retail still but I also hated the idea of the addon. I want to play both and have them both be separate experiences
---
I tried it, logged in on my monk. Ran around and managed to fall and die. Realized I didn't wanna run back to my corpse and took ress sickness and logged off
---
Can safely say I never used gearscore in wrath and always got into groups anyway.
---
I assumed he was European.
---
I think there's a fatboy mental state that is totally different to how a healthy weight individual's brain reacts to and gives signals for hunger.  I've been there where eating a 1,000 calorie meal I still had hunger pangs only 2 hours later.  Everyone's different but for me the inclusion of large amounts of green leafy veg in my diet was what fixed my brain, nowadays even on a 1200 calorie a day cut I sometimes have to remind myself to eat and snacking just feels alien to me.
---
If you've never been in both body states it's hard to comprehend, but the fatboy hunger pangs consume your mind till they're satisfied.
---
But also farm devilsaur... because if we're getting our mats their coalition falls apart. Remember, they want to turn this into RMT, selling devilsaur, black lotus, etc for real money. If nobody is buying their shit, they quit.

---
There it is again! Must be bouncing off the moon.

And warlocks! ^...kind ^^of ^^^not ^^^^really
---
Dou leveling as war+priest is quite effective, they say, almost no downtime between killin mobs!
---
His requirement is it giving me a massive advantage over people who don‚Äôt use it.
---
Thanks. If he was 13 I wouldn't have any doubts. IIRC a lot changes between 10 and 13, e.g "girls smell" becomes "hello laydeez".
---
Why? There were tons of add-on in vanilla.
---
Add-on for the bag, to save and switch your gear between spec, boss mod, lfg add-on, raid frame add-on...
---
some extra blue lights to make you blinder when you are 60
---
&gt; We're good people :-)
---
Swede here, can NOT confirm! üòâ
---
Im not really sure why people expect perfect launches for MMOs.
---
TIL they changed the race icons 
---
I don‚Äôt know how I never noticed....
---
Do devilsaurs always respawn exactly x seconds after dying?
---
I never said you cant use add-ons, that's just false. But allowing add-ons that automate lfg is another question.
---
But this *is* a change.
---
Blizzard protecting the integrity of classic, this is great!
---
Also it's kinda acknowledging  that these type of automated systems are what killed retail IMO. Very happy Blizz is not going to allow this garbage in classic!
---
GASP you will actually have to take time to talk to people in classic not just race to the end game asap, what a concept huh?
---
Discs of Norgannon they store history of Azeroth
---
I *lived* for world PVP in Vanilla.  If this mafia shit doesn't get the brakes put on by Blizzard, I might reroll onto Fairbanks just to fuck with these people.
---
If you have any idea how add-ons work I have a question for you, can add-ons communicate to apis outside of the game?
---
Absolutely not
---
Sweet. That may be the ticket! Thank you!
---
so you need to want to fuvk what you play? go to the alliance man it will be a pleasure
---
It will. At least for classic. Blizzard made a blue saying they don't want add-ons like these in classic.
---
But thats not true? Players asked for LFG systems, flying in azeroth etc. Players def have influence
---
I was gonna say what's for 2nd dinner
---
[There's some debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvcn7v/warlock_improved_drain_soul/epo4gvu/) but this is the last thing I read about it.
---
Won't work on pve servers.  You will still have some forms of griefing but its a lot harder to do.
---
Absolutely crucial for warrior, every mob you meet will swing faster than you if you two-hand your way to 60 (which you should be). Drop a hamstring on them, kite away until your auto attack is ready, then re-engage. Allows you to trade 1 for 1 instead of 1 for 2 or even 3. Single most important skill for leveling warrior.
---
Winterspring bay-bee! Every character I've ever leveled goes through Winterspring.

Same here, my hype just doubled for classic!!
---
2 days to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It doesn't matter what the developer intends. Someone else would come along and include all that.
---
Look on the old guild recruitment posts here. See who sounds fun/nice. Message em on discord/reddit and plan to roll on their realm!
---
Thalnos is going to be *fascinating*
---
Got 10 days off :)
---
Id be shocked if a good chunk of those people aren't literally subbed to retail.
---
Sorry for the monitor picture:) did make this a few months ago. I dont have an active sub at the moment.
---
I don't have nostalgia goggles blinding me from certain good retail content (ie Mythic raids). Playing retail and being realistic is much better than a delusional "I quit in Wrath" player who unironically thinks people won't make sites and addons to weed out bad players.
---
It's beyond hilarious how people think they'll relive their childhood. I've seen this delusion with Old school Runescape and now I'll see it again while enjoying both games because I'm not a nostalgia baby.
---
Seriously....so backwards.  :D  "I'm pro, just press 3 keys and the comp dose what I'm thinking."
---
* Angry Tourist that was gonna quit by level 30 anyway disliked this *
---
This, I'm hyped for Classic; but I am ecstatic just to witness how the drop is going to be. Seeing the queues, the people freaking out about issues, and the mass amount of people in the starting zone will be interesting to me in an apocalyptic scenario kind of way.
---
That‚Äôs such a fucking elitist thing for you to say. I played vanilla WoW at launch. Add ons like this existed. You‚Äôll be hitching about Discord or whatever outside the game system players eventually flock to.
---
Now we've gotten to the core of the issue: Why does anyone else's experience other than your own affect you so?
---
Might I suggest /leave 1, /leave 2?
---
Because even if you waste ALL of the GMs time wrangling all the tards for you, getting everyone's mouth's zipped up tight, etc, you're still going to have trolls. They don't even have to say anything bannable to get a rise out of people. 
---
If you're honestly just worried about what chat will devolve into, and not just too lazy and thin-skinned to address your own problems with the tools provided, you're fighting a losing battle. It's honestly like you haven't played WoW. I give it two minutes from launch until it's a spam of Thunderfury links, Anal [ability] links, old memes, people trolling people about quest givers and vendor locations, political rambling, guild recruitment spam, etc. Chat will never be sanitized, even if everyone is forced to super strict adherence to the rules. It is a lot more productive to handle it on your own end.
---
This is 100% me. Back in wrath, a shaman buddy and I would always get caught playing each other in peggle. It caused wipes and numerous delays. It became a running joke in my old guild. So much so that years later when I watched SAO Abridged, there is a quote from episode two that kills me every time. "Squad F, for fuck sake stop playing bejeweled!!!"

Spoken like someone who never played classic.  Having no functional way to find a group isn't a net positive no matter how you slice it.  Have fun begging your friends to run you through instances they have no interest in doing.

---
People are going to be looking for groups outside of the game in unofficial discord servers, instead of looking for groups in-game where everyone can see it. You can see how this destroys the community in other games, since people then tend to only interact inside the discord servers and guilds they Form via those servers, so new players coming in that don't know about them end up in an empty world where no one talks to them. Ofcourse reddit isn't the same thing, reddit doesn't provide a live chat that people can use instead of in-game systems. Discord does.
---
What I hope for is for them to change the fucking game.  Back to pre cata type gameplay.  No more fucking Talent bullshit which isn't really customizable no matter how much like to pretend.  No more of this 4 different levels of raiding bullshit.  More world activity.  Meaningful grinding of actual resources.  No more fucking flying everywhere and avoiding everything.

What server are you going to?
---
I wonder what other add-ons are gonna be broken because of this
---
It was easy as. You'd post LFG whatever and you'd instantly either get invited or maybe have someone whisper you with "can you tank?".
---
If you were having problems then I'm guessing you were a dps class.
---
The lfg addon never split the community.  It posted the group to the lfg channel and it parsed the lfg channel.  
---
Instead we're going to run into sites like raider.io and destinylfg or discord which will 100% split the community.
---
That's a bug they claimed to have fixed in the AMA
---
I absolutely loved the inconsistencies. I've watched that episode more than any other southpark episode and I love every minute of it. Live to Win baby
---
Yea, but then you need to macro pet to passive with your IDS keybind. Probably beyond the avg player. 
---
If it procs on any tick or pet kill when IDS is up then it‚Äôs worth it, definitely.
---
True. Classic doesn't need improvements or better systems. Classic just needs to be vanilla. If you want a game where you can give input on how to make it "better" BfA is there for you. A perfect example of how the game gets dumbed down because Blizzard listened to the community's "feedback" one too many times.
---
If I was this addon dev I'd just build a website that does this and add ad revenue.  Seems like a win for him if he wants to make money off it now.
---
Mine was the dwarf exploring ironforge
---
to be fair, whenever i dabbled into retail since MoP i felt like playing in a vacuum. i felt like playing a singleplayer game even while doing lfr. so, for people who never experienced WoW before that, or even before wrath, it doesnt surprise me that they don't seem to realize that. The world and how the game is played is such so vastly different.

---
You obviously never played retail if you think that people who are looking for challenge/improving themselves at the game do LFR, afk in a main city and only do easy daily stuff.
---
Like op said elsewhere here, unless blizzard stops addons from reading chat then the addon is quite easy to fix to work again.
---
If blizzard stops addons from reading chat, then this sub is gonna explode in all new ways :)
---
You think installing this add on is more accessible than Discord? That‚Äôs a stretch.
---
There‚Äôs literally no chance ‚Äúninja looters‚Äù would get away with anything thanks to this add on. This isn‚Äôt dungeon finder. This isn‚Äôt cross realm. People got all worked up over something that existed already in vanilla.
---
Song of Elune.
---
Wow, thats insane. The game isn't even out and people are already planning to skip the experience? We can only hope blizz does a good job banning the boosters.
---
Make monitor 2 your primary in Windows.
---
Still not having any luck getting the ichor out of this spider. Think i should try a new one?
---
I'd easily pay that. I was VERY heavily pushing for free to play gaming back when it was starting to become more popular. I very much regret it now. I think its been a bane on our gaming.
---
What is the drama going on? I am amped
---
Discord existed back in Vanilla, it was just called IRC. It won‚Äôt have that much of an impact, if anything it makes the community more accessible by interactions when you‚Äôre unable to play.
---
Me, I'm really not interested in retail wow and I'm not even pretending to be edgy and cool in this sub.
---
I really don't care.
---
What a coincidence. Also my favorite 2 games.
---
üòÇ Haha! He said "fuck you bitch" üòÇ haha I felt that üòÇüòÇ
---
Yay! Now the other people won't be using an add-on I don't like and I don't use!
---
A wow-pow-wow?
---
Yeah guys we're better than this, quit being such retards
---
Undead aren't supposed to be pretty though :)
---
Striker's Mark is worse than both Blackcrow and Carapace Spine Crossbow, so if you have a hunter needing on that shitty bow, then you know you're dealing with a huntard.
---
Many of us dont want it to be a finite game though. OSRS started as a finite game and then got original content and updates and is thriving 6 years later. That's what I want for classic
---
That‚Äôs gunna be a real issue in the first few weeks. Some high and mighty basement dweller telling everyone how to play.
---
Or they can click the button. Only way to get better is to make it a habit.
---
yeah, true
---
They will sing the praises of their holy piece of shit legion as a paradigm of the game. When all it was for the most part was a rebadged wod with legendary weapons.
---
FFXI had a looking for group function back before WoW even came out. That game had an incredible sense of community. I was never kicked from a group, and don‚Äôt recall ever kicking someone from a group. Replacing someone was a 20-30 minute ordeal. It was almost always better to teach your party member how to do something, or give them food, ammo etc. 
---
A simple LFG tool is not a big deal, and imo is good for improving gameplay, limiting chat spam etc. but it should have extremely limited functionality.
---
nah every community for the realm is like this, I didn't even mention discord
---
I did this with my characters years ago during the 'must put your real name on the forums' debacle. Then went and nuked the account.  Had to because having my name out there would have destroyed my work.
---
Still miss those characters.
---
The real joke here is that there's nothing to buy in Vanilla.  Epic mount(s), and raid consumables, and. . .that's it?  Hoard cloth stacks for the eventual AQ war effort?  The gold cap, while out of reach for most players, is a fraction of what it is in retail, too, so it's not even like their numbers are that big.
---
Imagine imagining.
---
Most of those are spot on except the mage
---
Have been using them for 9 years, they still shine on my TV. I have put a Chromecast music so now they work wireless, giving them a second life. Only downside is the lack of HDMI input. See you in nine years!
---
Lots of soilwork for sure. Linkin Park, Godsmack, Mudvayne, Crossfade, Sum 41. Honestly i discovered a lot of music back in those days because all the pvp videos.
---
Unless your computer was considered shitty in 2004 you'll be fine
---
Nice work!
---
I read Team-A guy's lines in the voice of Hank from HBO's Barry
---
Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll apply another patch before release. They are holding on to it to fix as much as possible before release! 
---
If this _isn‚Äôt_ fixed in three days, though....
---
Hmm. It seemed that way but after the QnA with the devs I'm not so sure anymore. It seems like it'll be in now even though it came out in patch 1.4.
---
lol
---
They will not remove DPS meter, did you even read the article?
---
One, reddit does provide live chat. Two using discord to find groups isn't going to usurp in game group forming.
---
It can't be extended by moving the cursor or clicking another character?
---
And now we have scaling with ilevel so...
---
Yikes. Sorry bud.  Just got off the phone with Mr. Alliance. Looks like no alliance are rolling on Stalagg. Real bummer.
---
Nah, this one relies entirely on SendAddonMessage() being able to send to global channels.  That's gonna be disabled.
---
üò©people are roasting me
---
I was gonna comment something positive until I read the last part of your post.. horde scum.
---
I'm of the opinion that retail isn't bad but the experience is so far removed from the early iterations of WoW that captured many of us here, on this sub. It has flaws, to be sure. But it's not trash. The whole carrot on a stick thing WoW does now is kinda killing it for me. It doesn't feel special to get anything because you are showered in random gear for doing trivial stuff. Also no deterministic gear from PvP is a head scratcher.
---
Depends on the fight. Depends on your gear. Depends on your playstyle. It's best to familiarize yourself with and master the basic prot playstyle before messing with 2h and stance dancing.
---
I've never used it, I was looking for a spreadsheet that lists basically all the enchants in vanilla, where you obtain them, and the drop rate if applicable.
---
Why would I need to convince the OP of something he already agrees with? You are the one that chose to respond with a dissenting opinion, the opinion I disagree with, and the one I am engaged in a dialogue with. You are the one that I'm trying to convince.
---
However, if you want this conversation to end, then simply stop responding. A dialogue requires 2 participants after all.
---
But this add-on was in vanilla...
---
#nochanges
---
I sure hope so. If I can't find my wife I'll be slightly concerned she is ignoring my group invites.
---
Because one is in game and something Blizzard can control the other is out of their hands.
---
I can't believe people actually buy this.  "Personal reputation" never mattered.  I was one of the biggest trolls on US Azjol-Nerub and it never once cost me anything.  The same goes for other well known trolls.  All of them were in guilds at the top of the server.
---
You guys are over exagerating the ammount of spam and how long you need to spam for a group.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/classiclfg/
---
Didn't they say at some point that they may leave the corrupted blood how it was for a few days/hours?
---
Auto inviting 4 dps is actually useless.
---
Also, I appreciate your enthusiasm it‚Äôs hard to be an asshole to you. Have fun on Stalagg. I might see you there. Horde warrior
---
His point is that gear design changes lead to the creation of gearscores. That gearscores aren‚Äôt needed for classic.
---
That was the thought I had. I love to transmog and ‚Äúdress up‚Äù my toons, but... man. I do miss wearing your skill level quite literally on your sleeve.
---
Having no context for this joke is pretty funny.
---
Hahahahaha thinking you‚Äôll play at launch time ü§£
---
Hard disagree. BFA is the first step down in raid quality. Yes it's still fine, but legion had some killer raids start to finish, BFA raids have had complaints start to finish. Fwiw, my guild disbanded because the raids were more frustrating than fun.
---
A raid on undercity actually. Went into heavy playlist rotation after that along with the Spawn soundtrack. üòà
---
No.
---
What you just described is basically one of the biggest "NEVER DO"s in programming unless you have a very specific use case and know the risks and how to mitigate them
---
This isn't just in add-ons, no program should ever break out of it's little box in a way that would permit potentially malicious agents access or control over unrelated programs and data.
---
So no, the add-on API does not extend outside the game. However OCR and the likes have gotten very good over the past few years and the most common way to bypass an enclosed system like that is to just use OCR to fake having access to the API by having it look at a specific part of the screen that contains the data output you want to capture
---
(Not-a-pro tip, you can use OCR to look at individual pixels. This can be used to bridge any gaps you may encounter by creating your own super tiny data-output "display" of like 5x5 pixels and use an add-on to "write" data to this output that then gets read by OCR)
---
I'm not a programmer though, so my terminology/specifics may be off.
---
Let the bodies hit the floor - drowning pool
---
I started playing in TBC too! Such a nice thing to see another guy from that era here. For the Horde!
---
LFG isn't going to usurp in-game group forming either by that logic.
---
Blizzard knows exactly how it works and decided to remove it, your point is moot.
---
ARK is as bad. The betrayal that goes on in that game is insane
---
100% right- I forgot that ‚Äúpre dire maul‚Äù MC loot tables on private servers were custom.
---
Either it‚Äôll be good to see the content that should‚Äôve been in from day 1 in day 1, I really hope we get those class quests.
---
When this is considered an older meme, I feel old. As I probably know memes 10 years or more older than this üòÖ
---
no
---
Duel them and curse of recklessness them, big plays.
---
Mmo mice are dumpster trash. Get a real mouse
---
It kinda is.
---
The idea is you tag the stone then go do some quests. If you're a group of 4 and click the stone, you'll be given a random person that tagged the stone, but it seemed to give you anything, dps tank or healer.
---
I play BFA thanks I do enjoy it Eternal Palace is an amazing raid. 
---
I'll be playing classic as well its also a fun game its just a different game. Since you are against this addon I assume you will also not be using any Discords that aid in finding groups right?
---
Check the Stalagg subreddit and discord
---
Jup think so
---
then in line with nochanges it should be the vanilla values , i forget tho i only used free transfers then
---
You could also queue from innkeepers, though.
---
Man if you honk by not typing it‚Äôs name that some howBlizzard and the community at large can‚Äôt find it is comical.
---
It actually could where as discords are going to do that.
---
I really want to go back to my roots and play horde again, but I also want an entirely new experience this time around, y‚Äôknow?
---
A website nobody will use lol.
---
I'd probably wait a couple of years to let her play if she's not really interested. But if she wants to and you and you are gonna be with her, I think it should be fine. I first played being 11 I think and had no traumas, all the contrary, I think I became mature earlier because I played with 40 y.o. people xD
---
Ya, just did it yesterday.
---
I am William Wallace and I want my (Blessing of) Freedom!
---
The TOS states they can ban you for *anything*. They *technically* do not even need a reason beyond "he typed the letter E once".
---
Cross-faction collusion isn't in the original TOS because it isn't relevant for Retail. In retail they've programmed/designed away such issues.   
---
However it was there back in classic. That's the crux of it.
---
GM: 
---
&gt; We need you to stop this.
---
Mafia:
---
*does not stop doing this*
---
GM:
---
&gt; Your account has been banned for doing this.
---
I would let my 2yr old farm consumables if he could manage the click rotation. Maybe have to wait till he‚Äôs 3, though.
---
On a serious note... 10 should be fine if she‚Äôs there to guide and explain things in the beginning. 1-2 hours a day max and not everyday would also help to let the kid focus on other things, too. After a couple of month she might want to loosen the leash and see what‚Äôs happening. Always keep an eye on the little ones and talk with them about the game and the people they‚Äôve met.
---
Kids should probably been tought to never tell anybody their age.
---
Why refresh bed linen when you're not going to sleep in your bed
---
Im serious. This is a game its tremendously unimportant in the grand scheme of your life. Grow up and become a better person. Learn to debate two sides of a situation without resorting to Schoolyard insults.
---
Haha. That's reddit! ü§Æü§ï
---
These websites are very similar to the addon in question. You apply for groups and wait for confirmation. During this time, players can do a plethora of content while waiting for an invite. This includes questing, grinding, and doing PVP. 
---
Yes, I do believe it will be quicker to use the website rather then chat. This is because it filters out all of the people looking for a group into a single place which makes it easier to apply and then alt tab back into the game until the leader whispers you.
---
It‚Äôs also important to remember that a lot of people have more then one monitor these days. That also makes it quicker because you can multitask. You don‚Äôt have to sit there doing nothing scrolling through a tiny box trying to find a group.
---
Like I said, you did no research.
---
Maybe dont have your chat as small as it fuckin gets LOOOOOOOL.
---
Ahahaha the Asmond layer getting in the way.
---
i don't think i'll ever replace rok/lok so yeah.
---
The gameplay is fine, its just a shitty cash shop which costs more then league which players though why would ileave all my league progress for something that costs more and with a less playerbase.
---
You write add-ons and can confirm?
---
Its at the end of the day a product, someone with vision needs to be strong if they dont break down and just flat out try and make the most bucks 
---
it would kill the game but im sure they could milk a bunch of money out of the sheep with a shop , im delighted they seem to be sticking to nochanges
---
Oh yeah, this for sure! From ‚ÄôAlliances most wanted‚Äô, yeah? 
---
‚ÄôPapa Roach - Blood  Brothers‚Äô is another one for me, from some pvp video with an UD Warrior.
---
Thalnos? Best of luck
---
I assume they will just remove the "CHANNEL" type from the C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage function.
---
It was added in WoD to make global addon communication possible.
---
Addons would then be limited to send messages in partys/raids an with whispers. But if there is a global LFG text chat the author could just change the addon to post a trigger string to that channel an receive all applications as whispers.
---
Blow it out your ass!
---
Just fyi, they come out they day of launch. I know it is confusing that their Classic page says August 27th in big text but the "Global Launch Schedule" map linked underneath it and the countdown timer at the bottom of the page both say North America is launching Monday Aug 26th at 6PM EST.

Planning to have mine farm me some herbs... and mine... she is 10 months old atm.
---
Got to get that done üë∂üèª /s
---
Does retail follow the classic design philopsophy? No? Not really relevant then is it?
---
It was a joke about long queue times.
---
You are the turd who acts like you played vanilla. Nobody used this aaddon back in vanilla   
---
\- An actual vanilla player
---
I'm fine with that.
---
No, you will still time out after 30 minutes.
---
Excuse me, but as a tank myself, this greatly offends me.. I'm still looking for that right healer for my heart.
---
That 6666 hp tho
---
Half the people complaining about it probably didn't even play vanilla and only know it as dungeon finder.
---
I'm pretty sure the dude just said he was laughing at people worried about that addon
---
I never played war3 as I loved Starcraft more and tbh I think it‚Äôs the best rts ever made and nothing will top it. And now I personally don‚Äôt think an updated version of war3 is worth 30 bucks, so .....
---
One of the absolute greatest machinima series.

U can try this: https://classicmaps.xyz/sandbox/

I realize that

Same just wait till it launches and then you should be golden

---
I'd imagine most of them being along the main roads.
---
Agreed. I'm not a graphics whore at all (I play a ton of old games) but D2 is a little hard on the eyes. It's hard to see what's going on sometimes.
---
Blizzard understands exactly how it works, they studied the addon and decided to remove it, whats your next argument buddy?
---
The main survey if you look at the data it shows percents for "casual, semi hard core and hardcore"
---
I did no research because I don‚Äôt agree with you. Great argument.
---
I don‚Äôt think you realize how fast groups will be found. And right you don‚Äôt have to sit there doing nothing scrolling a tiny box you can still multitask while reading the chat lol. 
---
Stop trying to act so high and mighty because you‚Äôre frustrated an addon you were going to use is gonna be shut down.
---
People are overexagerating the ammount of spam for dungeons. Besides at cap level there isnt many dungeons to run, so pretty much most people will search for a group to the very same dungeon. Some of you REALLY didnt play vanilla and make assumptions
---
Do you actually know thats how you got it? Its much more likely that the name you got was from somehow who decided with their friends to switch realms and released the name. No way for you ro tell unless you already personally talked to the person who had it before you
---
What add-ons will it break, exactly? I've seen arguments for DBM and other things like that but all they have to do is require you to be in a party or raid with someone to use those.
---
I can't think of an add-on that would require itself to be able to talk in general/trade chat and if there is an add-on like that, I am okay with those breaking too
---
I really appreciate the effort you go to but the usefulness of these is reminisced when you award ‚Äúexcels compared to other classes‚Äù to most things -not just with mages but across the board.
---
id have no idea i never fucked with them
---
Addons are a crutch, classic is basic enough that you dont need whatever dumb addons beyond a basic ui/actionbar.
---
It‚Äôs true that classic has more ‚Äúhard counters‚Äù in 1v1 than retail does. But it‚Äôs just an inevitable effect of having classes that are dissimilar from eachother. IMO it makes group pvp a lot more interesting, and even in 1v1 it can make things interesting because sometimes you are countered so hard that you try to play very bizarrely to give yourself a chance, or play like you‚Äôre a different spec than what you really are. For example a resto Druid might go ham trying to cat a warlock to death, because attempting to heal and outlast the warlock is a guaranteed loss.
---
The raw mechanical player skill comes down in part to trinkets and consumables. Things with a long cooldown or expensive mats, or complicated effects, are often used in a suboptimal way. Players show particular skill when they can use all these toys with the same skill that they have with baseline class abilities.
---
Will be easy to see by blizzcon.  If they shape the game back towards how classic works or if they continue on their current idiocy.  I am not talking end game.  I am talking the way classes work and social dynamics.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=Destiny+2+LFG

Yea but at least all the mouth breathers will get to spam for a group for 3 hours in org. Lmao

WHy would you play on an American PVP server instead of Australian?
---
Seems pretty silly
---
Holy crap. I had forgotten about this, but it was this and X-Play that got me into the game too.
---
&gt;big duck energy
---
I am dying.
---
Fair point. Still think the wife might appreciate it. Happy to hear suggestions on how to be more efficient though! ;)
---
Ok well you've just convinced me to roll ally for classic.
---
The issue is that they don‚Äôt. They only think of their own personal experience. They are not big picture people. I was going to engage but life‚Äôs too short. I‚Äôm going to enjoy this moment and not argue with silly people on the internet.
---
Great news for classic!
---
I‚Äôve only installed classic, not installing BFA.
---
Oh for sure, better raiding has been a trend for every expansion on average (obviously some failures here and there). It's just extremely disappointing to see every BFA raid be worse than antorus, and I can see why subs are dropping.
---
Figure out how long it'd take you to farm 200g and you'll have your answer (granted, that assumes you know what you're farming).
---
Real fullscreen hasn't been a thing in years for WoW. I'm afraid you are out of luck, it's just the way the game is, both classic and retail cannot be played in real fullscreen, only borderless windowed fullscreen.
---
Release is the first day of class. When that button lights up I'll be in Philosophy of Science 305 going over the syllabus I bet. 
---
Guess it's fitting my reserved character name is Philosophy
---
Are you really trying to argue as if Blizzard is infallible and doesnt get things wrong.
---
Really going to be this dumb?
---
I started when I was 11. I didn't play with a chat filter either, kids hear plenty at school lol.
---
On the current wow interface there is an option to select full screen, widowed etc... are you saying this button wasn‚Äôt working for you?
---
Thanks for putting this out! Classic looks great, I'm glad it looks better than vanilla.
---
SexyBack by Justin Timberlake.
---
We don't yet know what they will change with the API.
---
They may only prevent addons from auto-inviting, which wouldn't affect damage meters or others significantly
---
there will be a lot of rogues
---
Victory!!!!
---
Nah, that's a common mistake in modern creation of games and even remakes.. They get rushed because someone figures out a quick cash grab..
---
And milking the nostalgia factor just because of classic launch would've meant we would've had worse product in the end.
---
Just make it right Blizzard, don't let me down more than you already have in recent years.
---
You don't have to play a rare class, you just have to play better than other people who play your class.
---
We shouldn't be using demographics to create divisions. What's with humanity always having to find the differences rather than the common ground. Black white religion money rather than family food hearth
---
So the RP guys get the under the bus because you wanna be petty
---
"and attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely.‚Äù
---
That sentence allows ClassicLFG because it doesn't rely on other players using that same add-on. 
---
The important parts of ClassicLFG is the filtering and message sending to a global channel. As long as they allow access for addons to have these functionnality on global (either public or  customs) channels, LFG addons are possible. 
---
Blizz probably won't remove chat filtering altogether (lol), they could remove global filtering (heya traders, have fun :D).
---
Blizz probably won't remove chat message sending altogether (lol), they could remove global chat sending (Heya traders, have fun :D).
---
That's it, you don't have a choice here, these are the functionnalities core to a functionnal LFG addon. It doesn't need people to opt-in, it doesn't need GetTalentInfo, it doesn't need auto-invite (Heya RL, have fun inviting 40 peoples one by one :D), it doesn't need a pretty interface. It just need a way to communicate accross Azeroth and it can use the same ones you are.
---
And you know the worst part ? You won't even know it exists, it wouldn't change anything at all, because all it does, is filtering key words and send one message in one or multiple channels.
---
Justin Timberlake - My Love. No idea why but I remember listening to it a lot in Hillsbrad.
---
Have you just not been in there in a long time? There are boosts, skips, mounts, pets, dyes, costumes, and more...
---
-The self important 12 year old who wasn‚Äôt even alive when the game released
---
I'm gonna be at work for most of the first day so I'll likely try to log on that night.
---
Does anyone know if we can get ui addons?
---
You have my sword
---
I can link you 100 games that dont use a shitty website, whats your point mate
---
Just a little snack.
---
You can only run WoW in Windowed or Full Screen Windowed. It no longer supports true full screen mode. It has been this way since DX12 support was added. And yes, this includes the Classic version.
---
You haven't watched the video
---
XD ikr. Launch is midnight EU. My first class after summer start at 8.30am. So I hope que isn't too long, otherwise I won't get to play much before I gotta catch a train.
---
THATS IGNANT
---
Dont think they underestimate the interest, I think they have a good grasp on the amount of players incomming and launch Will be fine except for the insanely crowded server
---
In all honesty I could care less what faction you play. This game ment a lot to me growing up. I hope people find the same amazing experience I did. Not have a lfg feature made sure you had to talk with people and show your worth in a 5 man or finding a guild. In doing so you make friends that can last a life time.
---
Think XXL is DIN A3 right?
---
First time I see this not as a picture lol
---
So that bit about "I assume you didn't do M+s because I did" was a shot at me.
---
I wasn't speaking for myself when I answered the OP. I was explaining the popular sentiment. Now, if you're under the impression convincing me is going to convince everyone...well, good luck with that.
---
But if you want to go down this road, let's go down it.
---
Again, your point is limited and you're not willing to address other issues.
---
LFG mods mean replace-ability. When you always can just get another guy, you are less willing to spend time with your current guy. If he pulls aggro once, kick him and find another. 
---
If you're in UD Strat and lose a man, you've got to call in another guy from the guild or friends list.
---
So, if there's no LFG addon, taking a run is more of a commitment, with more to be gained if you succeed and more ill will generated if you fail. The game has more stakes and is more satisfying when you win.
---
Your LFG addon certainly does cheapen the experience, instead of an instance being a commitment, it's a casual dabble. 
---
**Why is this a good thing?**
---
Your "smaller communities are what matters" point misses the mark. I'm now much less likely to stick with and succeed with a guy I met with this mod because we can throw each other away at a moment's notice.
---
there should be an option for full screen. the resolution settings are weird, though, to use.   
---
Try to play on lower resolutions - it makes your Mac work a lot less.     
---
Classic is much, much, much more demanding than the old vanilla client. Private servers will always run better than Classic.  Classic is on a newer client.     
---
There are also a few console commands than can reduce graphics further.  But I think playing on lower resolution will benefit you the best.  I play WoW, retail, private servers, classic on Macs, Macbooks and MacBook Airs.
---
The other is in the hands of the community, which doesn't really seem to care about the very thing they were complaining about earlier.
---
No there is not. Real full screen is no longer an option.
---
My bet is that they're gonna kill the ability for SendAddonMessage() to communicate with global channels.  That functionality was added in WoD.  
---
Stuff like DBM and Luna Unitframes will still be able to communicate as normal over Party/Raid/BG addon channels (added in 1.12).  
---
Are there any innocent addons that need to communicate globally?
---
Nope. Or, none of the polls show that.
---
I don't truly see how Blizzard can break this AddOn, disabling AddOn Communication on Global/Custom Channels will only cause this kind of AddOn to send normal messages to a Custom Channel and just hide the message from the Player's view.
---
I assume that you tried creating a character and deleting it to extend the timer? (Just wondering if that works :-) )
---
I have two options: Windowed or Windowed (Fullscreen)
---
Do you have a third one like it used to be?
---
Texture packs will get you banned, and I‚Äôve never heard of a WoW reshade before but I guess it‚Äôs theoretically possible it exists? It‚Äôs probably still gonna get you banned though- Blizzard is extremely protective about anything interacting with WoW besides the addon API
---
I like you. Hope you aren't a gnome, or I'd feel dirty about it.
---
That those devs dont know shit lmao
---
They are gonna be just as shhit, and besides, just a tiny fraction of the players use discord, other than talking to friends.
---
oh my god you were in high school when wow came out originally, and you're unironically calling people you disagree with on the internet boomers? i honestly assumed you were in high school right *now*, at most. that's hilarious.
---
Fucking. Classic!
---
He's probably no older than 11
---
Ah, I had allmot exactly the same thing in word, looking messy af. Thank you for this fine work sir, will most def take advantage of it!
---
Warcraft Tonight with John Orciver
---
Yes. Addons "providing aesthetic customization" are allowed
---
Discord is fine as people will still have to communicate a minimum amount vs just clicking a button to accept. It gives a opportunity to have interactions with other players which is all what classic wow is about. You may think it's not much but it actually does a lot helping people to talk to each other. You will sometimes see people start talking a bit more just because they had that initial interaction. You can compare it to breaking the ice with someone. Of course this won't happen 100% of the time but it will be way more frequent. I'm one of those people who usually don't say much but if I have a interaction with some people I'm actually less shy and really friendly.
---
Anyone else annoyed that europe gets a midnight release?
---
Blizzard doesn't have to prove anything to ban someone. They can do it on suspicion.
---
Human Warrior w/ Tailoring/Leatherworking on an RP-PvP server. FML
---
And then it would do exactly what the feared it would do
---
There won't be 30% of any class. 
---
Pick what your want to play, not what others don't want to play.
---
sorry, man.  just know Classic will here for along time. Play it when you have some breaks.  It's not going anywhere.   
---
This was the soonest they could finish it for release.  Yeah, it sucks.
---
Jesus dude. Not one real food item. Thats not good.
---
Ill be on the Carnivore Diet. My brain will be running off of pure ketones. Dudes like you are gunna be easy.

For me Pepe has always been the symbol of people who hang out on 4chan. It's mutated into the relatable face of all the anonymous people of that community. And just like the masses of 4chan swing from one extreme of intellectual conversation to the other extreme of sarcastic childish outbursts of mass rage so does the meaning of Pepe. 
---
Personally I've never been a 4chan follower so I never felt nothing much about that frog, but this is the impression I've gotten from talking to friends and strangers who use Pepe all over the internet.
---
There's over 1600 people on the whitemane server *online* right now.  Once people realize that discords (or some other site) are how to find groups without dealing with the ridiculousness of the unmoderated chat channel it will beat 50% easily.
---
I remember seein it on Xplay before this, but I didn't really get what it was back then. And I didn't have internet so I didn't pay much mind to it. But after that cheat episode I was determined to get some internet amd I learned how to tether internet from my phone. The connection was awful and would diconnect all the time, but it was worth it.
---
Its*
---
Have they responded to the Fairbanks mafia video yet?
---
Yea but back then we didnt realize how much of a cancer it is. Besides nobody used it. I like how people who have never played vanilla spams about calltoarms when people who ACTUALLY played vanilla knows nobody used it.
---
I only see 4. What am I missing?
---
That sounds like a rough life.
---
No, I don't play characters that fit in most overhead storage bins.
---
I will probably play Alliance though...I envied humans' Diplomacy more than I envied any other racial in Classic, and boy, did I like Shadowmeld!
---
I assume you mean for leveling? Improved Drain soul is a noob trap, don't let people bait you into taking that talent. Nightfall is mainly a PVP talent, you won't be using it much on the leveling journey; shadowbolt(even an instant cast one) is just not mana efficient for the damage it does
---
As a Horde player I wish I could argue this point but... I can‚Äôt
---
My problem isn't lfg vs Discord, it's discord vs in-game chat. A lot of people won't know about the discord and will be locked out of that group finding community.
---
" This game is a marathon not a sprint. " best reddit/classic comment in days.
---
All modern gaming mice have 2 or 3 thumb buttons.
---
I'm using the model o but any of the popular ones are good like the logitech gpro or g403 even the death adder is good I've heard if you want to stick with razer.
---
I think its pretty clear what im implying, and your rambling and deflection when asked a simple question speak for themselves.
---
Blizz killed the dungeon finder addon and i find it calming to know that people with an attitude like yours will be less likely to bother with the game. Live well, and hopefully innever have to interact with many like you in-game.
---
The shop in FFXIV is way worse than WoW. There are a lot of things locked away in there.
---
Sorry then, if its really forms group for u its not god, u right. I was thinking about stuff, where mister x who wanna do dungeon and mister y who wanna do same dungeon, can fill form and find each other in a list that shows people looking same dungeon, instead scrolling chat where 100 other misters ctrl + c, ctrl +v same message every 20s and makes finding what u look near impossible unless u are well train in twich chat where kids spam pog or random faces
---
Exactly. Plus, people complain "I'll be spamming LFG for 45mins!"... Have you SEEN the amount of players on a realm? Seriously, there's going to be no issues getting groups.
---
I've go balls of steel!
---
Balls...Balls...Balls..
---
I'm sure Blizzard will find a way. They are much more experienced and knowledgeable about this than we are I am sure.
---
Lmao you forgot what the argument is even about and have started putting words into my mouth. I never said I wanted the dungeon finder addon, I said people will make websites and addons that show gearscore which is completely different to dungeon finder. You actually have an extra chromosome if you're not trolling at this point. And don't worry, the feeling is mutual. Just remember me when you can't get into groups to leech with bad gear and most importantly remember how wrong you were.
---
It wasnt gear. It was a friend. I was playing a feral spec druid and I was hunting gnomes in Stranglethorn Vale. I had a gnome mage cornered against a tree, as if protecting his back would be enough to stop me from taking his head from his shoulders. Enter one bald orc rogue. We team up and kill him and a few of his friends. We exchange pleasantries and then split up.
---
A full day later I find myself on the southern beaches of STV farming pirates and hunting Alliance players. I hone in on a Human Paladin when out of nowhere that same orc rogue from the day prior messages me and we decide to team up and go on a fucking rampage up and down the beaches of STV. That chance encounter turned into a great friendship that spanned the next couple years. I miss that friend greatly and he was one person I wish I had the fortune to keep in contact with as the years had passed us by.
---
So yes, that was the luckiest day in my original WoW Vanilla career. The best drop is friendship.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to him mate. The Razer naga trinity is a good mouse
---
lets also ban  weak auras , elvui , big wigs , target of target , dbm and all addons that didnt exist back then
---
WoD raiding was pretty solid that's why I stayed, but tbh I haven't stopped playing since tbc for more than a month until now.  I hardly login to retail.  I think theres just too many must do things to do in a week, and since I quit raiding full time I just dont have a huge reason to.  Loot changes are also just not fun, it's way too lottery style now.  I always raided to get BiS gear by the end of the tier, that just doesnt exist now with no master looter and random weekly rewards.  Hoping that the next expac is much better, but I worry with Ion at the helm.  Classic is going to be a nice breath of fresh air though so I'm going to no life this game.
---
That sucks...
---
Uh.. what?
---
A bunch of guys deciding to be dicks to everyone on their server isn't a huge gaming achievement.
---
You mean for modification of assets? I can‚Äôt really proof it, but I‚Äôm 99% certain if you checksum the wow.exe before and after the installation you will see that it has been modified. This most likely is a security mechanism to prevent wow to ‚Äúphone home‚Äù and also the reason your anti virus software throws a false positive.
---
I'll see if i can come up with something later üëç
---
He just released this statement. So no.
---
The bonus is their stuff is cheaper. But (afaik) they have more mounts, pets, cosmetic armor (wow has 3) and boosts (character and story)
---
Damn it took awhile to find an educated post about the situation. I guess a lot of these people didn't play vanilla or didn't use addons. 
---
I personally don't care either way; I can parse chat myself, use an addon to parse it, or have an addon autoinvite me. The true social experience starts once you're in the group, talking about making your way to the dungeon and actually running it. Literally nothing but "inv LVL ROLE" is said before that, addons or no addons.
---
definitely. Ally starting areas (especially redridge, so many memories there) are all fun and tempting me to roll an ally. but I also really like the old orgrimmar and barrens chat, sooo....
---
What? Horde has fantastic music. The whole game has great music overall. Honestly, BFA has some of the best music of the expansions.
---
 And with that skatman John
---
Yeah 10 ‚Ç¨ :D but it's pretty thick  so I think it's ok?
---
Blizzard never had to provide a reason for banning. Suspicion is good enough. Not like they have to show evidence or anything.
---
Sigh... redditors vomiting their opinions on classic is getting out of control. if you didnt play vanilla then please please stop regurgitating second-hand "knowledge". I'm targetting you specifically because your belief of "pve bad; pvp good" is flip flopped. Aka totally wrong. A resto druids biggest weakness is pvp group healingt. in pvp you're forced to regrowth spam because HT is too slow (rank 4 is too small in pvp).so you spam regrowth and go oom.by far the biggest inadequacy of the resto druid. Yes, they're the best flag runners. that's one bg (phase 3!). They're great in raids because they save people with their instant cast heals even though that doesn't get displayed on meters. Argh I'm so sick of Reddit where everyone wants to comment on every thread - if you don't know the topic, please don't just repeat unvalidated secondhand internet knowledge
---
Discord serverd are something the community, which has been whining about lfg, is creating.
---
I don't really feel like that's the solution, I think the solution is knowing your own limits and the limits of your friends if you're playing with them at launch, if someone is dumb enough to get themselves killed trying for a world/server first 60 then that's their fault, not blizzard's.
---
Yes #somechanges, we also had decursive which was literally a 1 button cleanse and healing addons which would actualy not only select the lowest health party/raid member but even downrank/uprank to the perfect heal for the situation. People don't seem to be clamoring for the return of those addons for some reason.
---
Read with your eyes then post
---
Yes shadow is one of the strongest pvp classes and priests are either 1 or 2 in raid healing.
---
Do you live in a cave? You do realize we play on a totally different client API? YOu do realize we have battlenet integration? You do realize the game starts with 1.12 as a base? There has been multiple changes already and changes should be made to create the perfect vanilla. Deal with it fam.
---
All I mainly seen was cosmetic wedding attire and clothes and pets and mounts. Oh and dyes. That sit really. 
---
I thought you could make dye in game from some crafting.
---
Timeframe, I played OG ff14 then it died. And then I played from first phase beta for 14 and release for like three months and all my friends left me alone and I got lonely and left.
---
My so called friends always leave me on games. They have gaming ADD like motherfuckers. Especially after what they did to me this past March when I went to Boston, DROVE ACROSS THE US TO HANG WITH THEM, and then they pull some shit and ditch me in down town Boston at PAX east. Asshole move. Especially since I have quite a few social anxiety issues...
---
Which is why I‚Äôm worried about classic. Kinda.
---
Almost no one should conside a marathon without sleep - more than one day.  Staying up all night once is about as much as anyone should do. Humans need sleep.  Missing two nights in a row is pretty bad.     
---
It makes much more sense to play all day and then try to get 7 hours or so of sleep, wake up and keep playing.
---
thats so cool! check others characthers too, maybe you will find some arrows in a hunter or something like that! Good Luck!
---
Wow shocking. Oh wait only idiots thought blizzard could break this addon
---
He can't quit at any time through? Lol
---
So, the AddOn will still work. They attempted for an entire expansion to kill Auto World Quest AddOns, only managing to make them less appealing by needing "User Input" because AddOns were unable to use specific functions on the API.
---
I don't see how they can truly break it.
---
26th, 5:50pm: Log in, wait out the queue.
---
26th, 9:00pm: Ding 2
---
26th, 10:30pm: Go to work
---
27th, 8:00am: Catch up to everyone who was forced to go to bed
---
Exclusively at devilsaur spawn points?
---
Blizzard is stroking my ding dong and it feels good
---
Uldir, lol.
---
Alliance capital cities feel like capital cities. Hordes cities feel like villages. Undercity is trash
---
Its gonna be really hard to take a break from Classic to play this and Cyberpunk 2077 :D
---
It says literally nothing that hasn't been repeated in that thread.
---
Me neither. I just think that they'll remove auto-invite and auto-communication. Which is fine.
---
Its just toxicity in general, not just from retail.
---
what a fucking prat
---
Imprisoned for 10,000 years....
---
Banished from my own homeland...
---
Yup it's time to go on a wc3/wow cinematic binge
---
Well that was them "taking a look at it," and they come up with the LFG system. You can either ban the add on, or employ your own system when it gets to that level. They eventually chose to employ their own system, but that isn't an option with Classic. They can't introduce their own Looking for Group system so they have to ban the add on.
---
And this doesn't apply to things like DBM because the encounters in retail are very much doable without it. Much harder, yes, but doable.
---
If they kill my healbot I‚Äôll just be bored and won‚Äôt play it for that long. I like healbot and I want to use it
---
The community is made by a lot of different people with different opinions. This LFG tool wouldn't exist I'd there wasn't a section of the community that wanted it.
---
The thing is with Classic is that it is being catered to a specific section of the community that wish to keep the spirit of vanilla as much as possible, so Blizzard is doing their best to make sure that that happens, but they can not control what goes on outside of their game and programs.
---
I have them and love them:l
---
I logged into BFA to get the exact looks of my legion main to use as my classic bank alt.
---
U dont say?
---
Destiny 2 and WoW are two games with similar problems when it comes to LFG. The point is that there will be a tool made to solve this problem just as there was for Destiny. 
---
You are the one who got all uptight about a simple prediction. I provided my argument, but you simply responded acting like you didn‚Äôt need to do research of your own.
---
Is it possible that my prediction doesn‚Äôt happen. Yes, but the evidence shows that it will more then likely happen.
---
Like I said numerous times, you are getting uptight and making yourself look like a moron. Acting as if you don‚Äôt need to do research also doesn‚Äôt help your case.
---
Go put more spikes on stuff edgelord.
---
Yea, tried lower resolution and all of that. Just a bit dissapointed that I have to lower my settings more than I thought I would need to. Thanks though!
---
They're illegals. Not undocumented servers.    
---
I've played on them a ton.
---
That sounds amazing, have fun, my plan is working, sleeping then next day play for a bit, sad I know :(
---
Oh it's my friendly neighborhood justdrop.  This makes a lot more sense now. Bye buddy
---
Fuck this, I aint resubbing to this shit.
---
I got really sad when I realized I wouldn't be able to get a winterspring Saber on my orc warlock.
---
Was the EU version somehow different? I bought my box in late 2006 and I'm sure I have 5 discs, I've checked a few day ago :D
---
123 summon
---
I didn't get the other ones
---
Sounds like what I experienced on garithos..
---
Later simp
---
You only need about 2500 people to have a healthy server in classic, none of the current servers will die off.
---
And then they start re-releasing all the expansions lol. 4d chess
---
I couldn't have asked a better response from them. I'm so happy!
---
Dude jump in, you'll have a ton of fun :)
---
Do some light research on classes and just hop on in  Monday!
---
Most people won't be able to play the first day before of the huge queue times anyway, you will not miss much tbh. You would probably just stare at that 2-3 hours queue time, if not more. So don't sweat it.
---
I miss g4 so much. Take me baaaaaaacckkkkkkkkk
---
Discord is far more ubiquitous now than Vent or Teamspeak ever were in 2006. I think it is you that is misunderstanding the situation. Near every guild that raids now is using Discord to do it.
---
Discord had like 150M registered users in 2018, I guarantee you it's more than that now.
---
If word gets out that people can do something on Discord to make their lives easier, they will do it. The average person is drawn to efficiency, just go look at the subreddit for the closest analogue to WoW Classic, which is OSRS - they are absolutely obsessed with maximizing efficiency.
---
If you think that won't be the case in this game you are fooling yourself.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not alone haha
---
You'll be fine.
---
Lore wise it's kinda light on big stories or anything, just a lot of little stories, it's kinda what you make of it. If you're looking to find some grand story like in FF you won't find it in Classic.
---
Now that you mention it I can see Rick and Summer as dirty, spawn camping, horde, Rogues. It would be glorious.
---
I don't know. My shaman always tended to eat them. Purge buffs/cooldowns. Grounding totem every 3rd spell. Ranged Interrupt every 5 seconds.
---
It is all about #MyClassic now, Team NoChanges is old news at this point. 
---
It is laughable how many of the guys are gloating over this. This just proves that the Classic Com will be just as bad as the Retail one
---
Damn, reading these comments, I may have been missing out.
---
I always had music/comedy in my headphones as I played. Drowned out all music except Stormwind and Ironforge. 
---
Awww yeah.... New experiences on Classic!
---
Oh I was not aware of that. Then I do not see why people are having such huge issues about the addon.
---
Do I think you're getting a hundred text-based messages from girls in your area, if that's what you're asking, no definitely not.
---
I'm saying this does the same thing as Tinder did to "Classic" dating. 
---
Let's Call retail Tinder and classic, well classic.
---
All I'm saying is that the application reduces the amount of effort you have to put in to create a group. Which also leads you to leave the group just as quick as you found it. 
---
If you put more effort into creating your group you are less likely to abandon them over a simple mistake. Listen turn creates friendships that were bonded over struggles to get Rewards.
---
Now I'm not saying it's an auto join button. I'm just saying the fact that it reduces the amount of effort that you as an individual have to put into finding a group will affect your performance.
---
I love eric andre, but it does get overused a bit too much even now.
---
Super cool! I like the idea! What realm are you rolling?
---
Yes, which means better addons. You guys seem to be the ones unable to deal with it. The Bliz post says they'll limit the addons functionality, it's not going anywhere.
---
Zugreat
---
Lol don't play on Asmon's server
---
It's almost like there are good and bad things about retail, just like in every other game ever made, including classic
---
nothing wrong with mmo mouse
---
Some do
---
Photobucket for me. I managed to get a few. Thankfully I saved everything from TBC and beyond. Though I took 10x more in vanilla.
---
Meal prep for 14 days, Chair toilet, 14 day supply of mountain dew.
---
It was a dumb back then and it took them way to many years to fix it.
---
I can imagine some of them being ok.  But never were my thing.  I think I used a dps meter for experimenting, one that made trinkets easier to switch, and ran a threat meter for a little bit.  I think the only one that I felt was kind of required tho was one to show the enemie's cast bar...maybe?  And one to let you move ai elements.
---
In your scenario, how does the LFG addon get you another player when you can't do so otherwise? This is where the disconnect lies. The addon can't magically make a player appear. It can't teleport them to the dungeon for you. You haven't offered any explanation as to why such an addon goes beyond what players can do themselves without the addon. Please explain why you can find a replacement in your UD strat with the addon when you wouldn't be able to without it?
---
But isn't Warcraft 3 based on wotlk?
---
Yes, we wanted something easier. But with the benefit of hindsight we now know that LFG and simplify this and simplify that are what brought us to Retail. The majority of people who want Classic accept that and are happy to see the game not make those same mistakes all over again.
---
People usually don't know their limits though, probably not until they hit em hard.
---
 
---
I can't fully agree it won't be Blizzard's fault. They probably should be more active promoting a healthier game approach will all that massive hype around. In a really bad scenario it's going to be hard to get the blame off the devs.
---
You mean Gonna miss *starting* here again?
---
There are 4 grammatical errors, then the premise itself. Language is and has always been constantly evolving. Invented words like selfie and loan words from other languages to describe new technologies have been around since the time when Thog taught Ook to tie a sharpened rock to a stick and make a "spear." The idea that a sudden influx of new words should make a fundamental change in lingual conventions is ludicrous.
---
Have you tried LFB?
---
I watched that waaaaaay longer than I should have.
---
This addon literally existed in Vanilla by the name of Call to Arms and you could queue for dungeons at inn keepers and stones.
---
You didnt play vanilla lol.
---
I start work as the game launches.  I'll play when I get home.  I took off Thursday and Friday for a 5 day weekend
---
You did good! Thanks a lot for your effort!
---
Hahahahahah, high level of delusion
---
And people laughed when I told them I learned my vocabulary from wow.
---
Kind of oddly lacking in lots of quite important stuff like rotation guides and what spells to use at each level. But a book produced with love and care. The Dungeon Guide is also great. Just been flicking through this morning.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=mage+profession&amp;restrict_sr=on
---
Yes! Thank you! There is nothing tangible in their reply, so that you can analyze and understand. To me, a chat parser is nothing special, and should've been allowed. But their explanation does not change my mind, since there is no actual explanation.
---
To me, it seems the purists have pressured blizz into this with their whining, and are too short sighted. Once they see how much of a time waster looking for players was, they'll whine then.
---
Seems as stupid as the mOAhR SKelEtOnS crowd.
---
There's a nice wand at the end of the beast killing quest chain in Barrens, I think (if you like to look at orange all day.)
---
What, I love my Razer Naga. Have 12 keys for my thumb to use is something I've integrated into every single thing I do on a computer, from gaming to programming I got macros bound for all kinds of shit.
---
For anyone who wants to stay updated on the decisions, there's a Discord community for this addon:
---
[https://discord.gg/xXx2xHa](https://discord.gg/xXx2xHa)
---
mage
---
that's 6.1
---
Still want to give it a go! I have loved every blizzard game I‚Äôve ever played. Can‚Äôt see why this would be an exception.
---
Within 10% and people havent even logged in yet. Differences tend to be exaggerated over time, that's how you end up with 95/5 servers down the track
---
I didn‚Äôt realise these were a thing?
---
I‚Äôd say mage because you have CC and the ability to kite mobs. I‚Äôd recommend a hunter or warlock though if you‚Äôre willing to consider other classes.
---
You think once it's live there will be less people *online* on the server?
---
You just proved his point.
---
Everyone just needs to get the addon so they can see who is using it and blacklist those players on your realm. Thats what blacklists are for, not for someone who killed a streamer but people that ruin the aspects of classic.
---
I regularly play with oce players while in the us east coast.  I average between 140 and 200 ping when I join an oce group.
---
Mages will have a hard time against hunters.  It's gg if hunters get the open.  Most of the time it's who sees who first with most duels.
---
Mage or rogue
---
Classic doesn't have DX12.
---
Congratulations, I hope you get everything you deservefl for championing blizzards fall from grace before Classic even launched.
---
You managed to talk them in to substituting their retail-wow-dev judgment to change decisions the origional vanilla team made.
---
This will never ever be a problem and can only result in classic being made better and better exactly like origional wow.
---
You deserve every minute of it.
---
And it's not even close
---
Top quality shit post
---
Okay I'm ALL for the hype train of classic. Super excited. I'm gonna play it a ton. But all of the people acting like they're abandoning retail for life are lying to themselves in a huge majority. Like classic is only so much content. Is there a lot to do? Yeah. Do I think it will have a good community in a year or 2? Yeah probably. But the new xpac is gonna come out for retail. Or a new cool patch with something interesting. And most classic people that play retail now are GOING to play it. It just all seems super dramatized. It's not the end of retail. Just a way to bump sub numbers and give people some more stuff to do for a while
---
I mean they could break it, but it would break like 1/3 of the other addons in the game.
---
What monitor are you rocking kind sir or maam?
---
as long as everyone has the same lack of addons who even cares. It'll be equally as easy or as hard for everyone so it's not a big deal.
---
Depends on which of the four. They're general anywhere between 13 and 17 minutes
---
you think they cant actually create an addon that does what they want, or you just think no one will join their coalition and it will be pointless?
---
I remember this shit. I was a young boy of 14 and just did death mines for the first time (mostly got carried cause holy shit i had no clue about video games but my guild was kind). So we came back to stormwind after the succesfull run at 2am and this shit kicks in...so many memories.
---
I doubt it was different, they added the fifth CD pretty fast though IIRC :)
---
Haha don't worry üòÇ
---
Cavemoss was my first ever horde capped toon in wrath. He‚Äôs a Druid and I still have him today :)
---
Is that a back seat from a car?
---
I mean if your not gonna minmax then i dont see why it matters? Go with w/e Enchanting is pretty garbage if you cant get the good raid recipe's. If doing dungeons isnt appealing to do flasks alchemy is out, so just do herb and tailoring then
---
I just printed it on A3
---
Damn feel the same bro, my friends decided on horde, but i guess i have to swallow my pride and knowledge in the master faction haha
---
Gonna be interesting though
---
How young is too young to be called a cock loving retard? Because you know how people are
---
Just loop the damn music if you like it and unbox the Music volume.. hard
---
I'm also wondering this. How far before launch are they restarting the servers?
---
Gotta love how self-righteous idiots are like "omg what a grammar nazi", but totally ok with someone asking for a free carry, in a 0 effort way at that. :D
---
This. I got into Tool because of Meandros rogue pvp videos. What's cool is I just saw Tool live for the first time back in June, and a couple of months later, classic is releasing (alongside Tools first album since 2005). It's a pretty magic time. Shame I'm working stupid hours all week.
---
Keyboard is usually far left, must have moved it for the pic
---
You have my axe
---
Very likely. Which would make it an information tool, like other LFG addons in vanilla. Problem solved
---
For me personally it captures the magic moments of gaming.
---
When I go to bed at 11pm and set the alarm for 5am again, the weekend feels spent well.
---
If I play to 4 in the morning on saturday, sleep until 10am and I feel sluggish and can't really focus as well.
---
You were saying, chum?
---
If I were you, I'd learn the basics of your class and classic wow before launch, and then play with no guide, and learn more along the way. There's a tonne of YouTube class videos and stuff on this subreddit that can help you with the basics, and after that you will pick up loads in game :)
---
From the addon itself by the author, not from API
---
WoW without damage meters and boss mods? Sign me up!
---
listening to in-game music WeirdChamp
---
Hmm. See I know there is a shit ton of story locked behind story progression on there from what friends have told me. 
---
Like I heard you have to completely do the main game story before any of the new stuff opens. And there is so much cool shit I saw in the new stuff. Like I heard a gun blade was coming out soon? And some kinda flying car? 
---
I think it was from 15 (I got 15 and couldn‚Äôt play it cause I hate the targeting and controls. Unplayable.)
---
Thatll be interesting. I dunno all the things that affects it,  ut when I used to play CS on some local servers hosted by my ISP company, I usually had 3-4 ms ping, which I remember was funny since LAN defaulted to 5ms, atleast thats what it showed.
---
No no they are appealing. Someone said it was a specific dungeon that you had to go to in order to craft the flasks.
---
I definitely plan on raiding.
---
Is that it? A 30 min AFK timer? Not that they are restarting the servers 30 min ahead of launch?
---
I appreciate the heads up, I'm not a super social person so Discord servers full of hundreds of strangers don't appeal to me. But if that's the overall impression you've gotten then I'm hopeful. Maybe there is a post I missed, but where might I find the link for Whitemane Discord?
---
I leveled a bear tank near the end of vanilla for the challenge. Everyone said bears were laughable and worthless, but that just forced me to try really hard to prove everybody wrong, which was fun and rewarding. 
---
Every Druid form in Vanilla is definitely just a crappy off-brand version of the real class they're aping, sure, but that was intentional because it's offset by the increased utility. It's 4 classes in one! When you just compare the survivability to some of the purer classes, it's pretty worth it. Leveling (especially soloing) in vanilla involves a LOT of dying, and having self-heal/roots/travel form/etc is amazing.
---
Yeah I considered moving to the new pve realm but honestly cba, this is The only pve realm I can get maugrim so I‚Äôm staying put.  For me the name is just as important as the look/race.
---
You're getting Fort and a HoT.
---
Unless you took a tag from me. Then you get the fattest PW:S I can manage because fuck your rage generation.
---
I was thinking about gloating but I'll just settle for a I told you so.
---
I'm a mage and thinking skinning and tailoring. Tailoring for bags and I'll be able to get the robes quicker. Skinning because it'll be easy and I don't have to go out of my way to get node's or compete with the masses.
---
Considering taking herbalism over tailoring though, and just leveling tailoring later.
---
The Bush next to that Stone also has flaws
---
Don't worry, they have +10 frost resistance
---
Old X-Play was phenomenal. They changed the format near the end of G4 and it was actually pretty shitty.
---
You know what split the community as well ? Factions.
---
I guess wow will ruin classic because there will be horde players on a side and alliance players on the other.
---
Tool - The Pot
---
The most friction is experienced in the army was when people were 70hours in with 4hours of sleep.
---
The amount of needless bickering, insults and near assaults is endless and really tears you down.
---
I can't imagine the dungeon groups going 40hours straight. I probably would want to kill them or just mute until the next play session.
---
Unpopular opinion: It‚Äôs 2019 and if addon is illegal people will be using web equivalent anyway. I dont see anything wrong with addon premise and it‚Äôs not at all like dungeon finder as it doesn‚Äôt teleport or match with people from different server. And now because of boomer man child outrage we are back to spamming trade chat
---
Sheep arcane power pyro pom pyro fireblast.
---
I hope you got that macro done :-D
---
The difference is that in Discord it doesn't autogroup you. If you write in Discord LFM then you will get buried under other ads. This addon makes one group complete, fill next, one group complete, fill next - all automated. Basically LFG tool without teleport. And it is a problem in social dynamics. This addon simply removes all contact from players and makes all content singel player with two more clicks just like modern WoW.
---
Yeah totally the same, I‚Äôve hated the changes to the game over the years but have stuck with it (to some degree) due to habit more than anything.
---
Wait. So the stones cant be used to summon in vanilla?
---
Not even close to how easy the streamers will have it. I'll have friends and even a guild but that doesn't meant they're at my disposal whenever I beckon them.
---
Whenever the steamers want something all they have to do is summon their cult followers and they'll be taken care of.
---
They won't have to take time to form groups or farm gold or do anything remotely close to the Classic experience.
---
So once again I'm very happy that only the streamers get to cheat the classic hurdles. Everyone else will have to earn eveything they get the hard way.
---
The story is linear yeah, you have to finish the base game + all of the patch quests before you can play Heavensward. Newer classes are locked behind level limits (Gunbreaker starts at 60, so you need to be 60 to be one). Doing ARR patch quests is by far the biggest hurdle for new players.
---
BC is free, they'll want more then sub money
---
Yikes just because yall a crazy crybaby cult and Blizzard rather submit than deal with your bullshit doesn't make any of your craziness right.

---
Thanks, my bad
---
Looks like blizzard agreed with me, not so delusional now huh?
---
well it's certainly not a dom.
---
Did you also do it on rotating shifts repeating that same behavior to people you probably never saw before because it's now their shift on the opposite faction?
---
Yes ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Willing to bet the many WoW purists never played pre-BC.
---
Gearing up my undead mage fantasy by watching Overlord. On launch day its gonna be the warcraft movie - about mages again. And somewhere in there i'll squeeze in the southpark episode.
---
I see you're a man of culture aswell
---
I don‚Äôt do twitch / streamers really, so would of never of guessed D:
---
[lol ok kiddo](https://i.redd.it/habtz8j8lci31.png)
---
It wasn't a release schedule that made they bring out TBC, they literally just had so many plans for the game that they needed room to expand, so an EXPANSION PACK was the perfect solution! TBC was just a good excuse to revamp stuff in the game, and it worked out brilliantly! Some things....more than others, however...
---
Hold on just let me savour the moment, oh yes victory is sweet.
---
Salt mining in here. Classic is classic wouldn't really be classic with some of those features retail has would it? Don't like it? IDK don't play I guess. I don't care for retail so I don't play it.  
---
It's that easy. I'd like the classic experience and if it's not there I won't be playing it.
---
I mean we all want #nochanges right.. oh no wait this is just more evidence that #nochanges was never a thing and it was always #WhatIWant 
---
In vanilla you could 1 button heal an entire raid, they already removed that, now healing via ui Mouseover, clique, etc thats too much? 
---
How about no name plates, no moveable debuffs, limited casting bar for enemies, no CD numbers, etc . 
---
All of that isn't Vanilla like but why stop with anyone preferences. If the Goal is no addons do it.
---
Reading and writing standard "LFM WC need heals" posts in /1 clearly isn't the functionality Blizz takes issue with, so I imagine they just don't.  
---
Worst case, they restrict addons from writing to custom chat channels, I guess.
---
5:50pm have a wee.
---
I plan to finally decide the class I am going to play. Still bouncing back and forth between Tauren Shaman and Undead Priest.
---
Have you hear about the magic thats called a screenshot? -_-
---
Damn
---
HYPE!!
---
To be fair, a meme is old after a week :p And hey I used a meme from the original Star Wars and that‚Äôs way older
---
"mortal coil"
---
How rude.
---
Sorry to hear that bud. That sucks. People do what makes sense to them, so it probably didn‚Äôt mean to them what it meant to you in the moment. 
---
Still, don‚Äôt worry about Classic, man. There are going to be thousands of people who used to play with friends 15 years ago and now don‚Äôt have the same circle, so will be looking for new friends. 
---
I‚Äôm always blown away by some of the irl friendships I‚Äôve seen and heard of being formed over Vanilla. We get to do it all again as fully fledged adults now. So, log in, talk to folks, and make some chums üëç
---
Haha class, epic film too.
---
Not as bad as you might expect
---
Yass, Blizzard! Classic gets more exciting every day!
---
It's one option. I'm guessing people would flip their shit and shun the addon of it started spamming public chat channels with gibberish. The ability for addons to communicate via hidden channels was added in 1.12, a lot was possible before then.
---
I think I'd personally prefer an addon that literally does just parse chat, make a nice easy UI list, and posts to chat a human legible formula every X minutes for you. ("LFG SM cath, need tank" or w/e).
---
I'm sure there's other things Blizzard could do, my idea was just an off the cuff thought/option since I dabble with programming &amp; scripting.
---
Will be interesting to see how things go, no matter what.
---
Tip: Remember to take all things in moderation (even World of Warcraft!)
---
But Call to arms existed in vanilla.
---
I hope you get a good lfg macro to spam in trade, your gonna have a classic experience!
---
  #noCHan... NM #changeswheniwantthem .
---
Except for a myriad of compatibility issues on modern systems
---
Your old man has good taste!
---
It wouldn't effect his addon.
---
¬†Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it.
---
They're not taking it away at release and they're adding restrictions it's not going away.
---
They already targeted addons like yeah it. In early vanilla it even selected your target to heal and the correct rank of spell. They changed to to no longer work and now we have what we have. 
---
All you are essentially doing with it is keybindings and mouse over target selection. 
---
The other addon has also been around for a long time. Pallypower was its predecessor and it did the same as you are discbribing, it was also around since vanilla. 
---
I don‚Äôt think Blizzard will have any issue with either of these.
---
If I was in that meeting
---
**Activision:** we see classic is more popular than expected , sales has run the numbers on selling level 40 and 60 mounts and it looks like a massive untapped market
---
**Me: U FUCKIN WOT M8!?**
---
I wouldn't care if I get fired for talking down to one of Bobby Kotick's lackeys. After all, they're the kind of people that pull support for a game and a league at the last second because of shareholder price drops.
---
Mage
---
+ You don't make friends with salad
---
+ You sure can though with whatever Mages conjure out of nothing
---
That's why they simply haven't nuked the addon yet. They're really trying to come at it with a scalpel approach to make it so the addon is broken without breaking chat, they know other addons use chat.
---
FUck never realised how shitty the current Night Elves look :D
---
That last little comment about dress... Now I need to go listen to that song again!
---
thank you!
---
My most vivid memories of vanilla were guild drama and moving to new guilds. My foest big guild had just one day where everyone was at each others' throats and it caused a split. A few big names and close friends left so I jumped ship with them. Turned out that we weren't the same guild without everyone else.
---
You can find any guild ready for raiding or pvp but the process of trial and error to find a guild that's right for you is part of the experience. It's like friends groups. Sometimes they're forever, sometimes you gotta drop a few, sometimes you gotta find a new group.
---
No i love it. Less Plebs that block my way
---
Yeah, 14 years ago.
---
Zoomers getting absolutely dabbed on
---
Ofc, just like there will be less people on reddit?
---
Huh, mb some patch data was there

If you using a wand as a mage you doing something WRONG.   If you are using wand to gain passive regen then you are a moron, its still more efficient to blow a couple of instants and finish the mob off and DRINK
---
I can't tell anymore if this is sarcasm or not. 
---
This timeline screws me over!
---
I'm personally considering a mage for my solo leveling experience, so that's what I would reccomend. I may end up going hunter though.
---
Granted a lot of this information was very basic and anyone who played the game could figure out the "tips and tricks" they tried giving you, but damn it was still so much fun to watch!
---
Twitch client is among other things a mod manager where you can search for, install and automatically update your addons. It is a very useful app for this purpose.
---
Yeah but you‚Äôll most definitely get our bid at the last second
---
Pretty sure, yeah.  ClassicLFG doesn't rely on that, so it's main functionality will still work.  The addon you linked (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dungeon-finder-classic) does.
---
Cool name
---
Grab some daggers spec into imp ambush and gank people half health fighting a mob.  Make sure to not kill them yourself.   Just get them low and let the mob kill them so they take durability damage for the full on scumbag.  Oh and dont forget to buy flint and tinder for campfires and get your squats in.  Teabagging all day can be taxing on your quads if you dont exercise enough.
---
Guy's asking for what abilities to use so he can gank people. Really want to educate them?
---
Hahaha love this wishful thinking :D
---
I liked the idea of this add-on, but didn't like some of the aspects it had, such as auto invite.
---
I'd love a tool that would give me information on a person whispering me for an invite, such as spec and if other players have had issues with them before, without boiling it down to their iLvl.
---
ok
---
Hey now, some people stay in their mom's attics as well
---
Yes. People who like the current state of the game strategized and coordinated efforts to systematically ruin a different version of the game for wow version supremacy. Also, Classic becomes retail in a few days
---
Which means this addons will be needed even MORE than it was before. Before those without the addon would be seen by it and read its requests for groups. Now only those with it would see it.. which is the opposite of what Blizzard stated they wanted to occur. 
---
Thus Most your data collection addons will have to be killed. RP ones, DPS, DBM (many functions), etc.
---
Imagine playing 16 hours a day for 8 months and still have t0 lol
---
Hm thats huge i Think ill have to look for it :) thx mate
---
NICE
---
they already removed the auto  invite, they'll have to break parser to remove it
---
I think hunters will be the kings of 1-60.
---
I was hoping to play with my older friends now that we're all more mature but a lot of people are adopting the no changes mentality
---
... taking a screenshot is too difficult for you?
---
You said this stuff was in classic but you gotta understand this time around addons are much different and more advanced , people are also much better at coding them now. 
---
The idea that this time around it could be a big issue without blizzard taking action is not invalid.

Early on before they noticed creating a character with your name your transferring with would not only make you have to change names but also put you into the race selection screen letting you redo your looks n what not.

Omg I did the same :D

I dont...
---
No problem boo
---
Rogues are like the 4th or 5th most picked class. You're fine.
---
Go to bed? I've slept long enough waiting for this.
---
Except they don't.  They go the other way and are extremely careful with their bans, they don't do them unless they have overwhelming evidence.  No one has ever been banned from WOW for "suspicion" of something.
---
For a solo Player i feel like Hunter and Warlock are the go to classes.
---
Those were the good old days. These videos are hilarious
---
I wont perma bind anything, it will be 100% removable and I doubt it would destroy the CDs :)
---
You could buy the CDs cheap online if you want t to do a project like this and still keep the OG CDs safe :)
---
A complete box here in Sweden is like 100kr ~ $10
---
People want to play classic because it is a time before all these one-button-convenience features, and people try to bring them to classic anyway. Why even PLAY classic if that's what they want? Just go to fucking retail for instant LFG queues. The whole POINT was to go back to a community that communicates. They need to ban the addon indeed.
---
This is great. Weed out the noobs before the game has even launched.
---
Tbh I‚Äôve struggled to play any game that wasn‚Äôt wow over the years, have saved so much money haha
---
I played a paladin on a pserver recently, I gave every caster I ran passed blessing of might and everyone without mana blessing of wisdom. Paladins I gave nothing to because they could bless themselves.

2-5 hours, depending on how fast you go, what class you are, how much trouble you are having completing quests, how much sightseeing you do.

Shit I met them in high school on wow and halo2. Turned into irl friends.
---
As of now it seems like some never grew up.
---
Now I dunno if I wanna do ally or horde on Herod or Bigglesworth...I‚Äôve already said if I have to I‚Äôll make new friends but it sucks cause a lot of people already gonna have their friends with them or communities and cliques and it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs gonna be easy to recruit to guilds thet aReNt already planned.
---
Find a guild of friendly people early on.  It will help a ton and there will be plenty of casual social guilds that will help you.  Avoid the semi hardcore and up guilds until you are ready for that kind if thing.
---
Please note that fire PvP is a gimmick build and not seen as a particulary good one...

Tailoring and enchanting to start with 50 linen cloth you can make yourself wands make them all into bolts of cloth then Make 9\~ brown linen robes the green quality DE them and boom easy wand at the start of release.

no new content

FFXI, FFXIV and WoW are also the only MMORPGs I played (also Ultima Online but I waa like 8-9 and had no idea what I was doing).

Let's you see a list of Bis from best to least. Also let's you filter by phase.
---
We're talking about *addon channels* here.  Those are hidden "channels" specifically for addons to communicate with each other.  
---
Luna Unitframes, for example, uses the "Party" addon channel to show other players when a healer is casting a heal onto a party member.  That doesn't show up in party chat; it's a separate hidden thing.
---
ClassicLFG will still be able to post in the regular general, trade, LookingForGroup channels.
---
ever? the game will die eventually.
---
Im going to start streaming at 5:45, then sit in que and talk to chat until I get in. I'm hoping to play as much as possible before I have to leave for dragon con. I'll have 3 days.
---
Well it does launch at 8am but even then 2hrs is a bit excessive.
---
Oh nice. So how did you secure the discs you said? Blue tack? Is that like a glue or tape?
---
They will never stop.
---
We'll see who's laughing in a month. I got a 5-man premade of friends so regardless I think I'll survive. Good luck to you and everyone else complaining when you're navigating the twitch chat that will be /2 and /lfg. This filter add-on is gonna start looking real nice then.

I've lost over 30 lbs in the last 3 months, but not for wow... But I WILL be putting a few back on.

I live in Bangkok and the best Ping for me is the Taiwan server (it's located in Taipei and I have 90 ping). The advantages are, that compared to the Chinese Client TW Client is uncensored and server is hosted by Blizzard and there is no censoring ragrding "harmonious chat". If you are interested to play there join the biggest English speaking guild &lt;Divine&gt; [https://discord.gg/mggDuWh](https://discord.gg/mggDuWh). See you in Classic!
---
I just want an addon that shows other players that want to do the same content.
---
As a shadow priest mages will be running from me.
---
Here, ladies and gentlemen, we have your run of the mill Mouth Breather, aka, Basement Dweller. They often strike out without warning without reading the full comment tree to learn that someone has already told the person they are talking about, that they were wrong.
---
Seriously. Continue school. Get better at reading and learning to finish the chapter before writing the report. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs good info for the coming school year.
---
ok you are right then. don't think we ever used them in mc/bwl, guess we were too poor
---
I think this gave me a headache
---
Sorry, I edited my last response a bit late when I realized the real issue here is confusion about how the addon works. My understanding of the addon is that it just reads chat and puts it in a convenient interface. That's what the addon page says it does and what the code I looked at does. Is there another addon that works differently and can bypass that functionality to show you available players?
---
As my previous comments have stated, if my duo partner goes hunter then she will be taking LW and skinning

---
The [original WoW tavern music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXdqWmp9FA4).
---
Even up until *at least* the end of Wrath (not sure about Cata as I stopped playing) there was still Decursive, though it was a small raidframe-esque addon that you played whackamole on rather than just being able to spam your cleanse macro key 500 times in a row until it broke. Not a joke, my friend's paladin class lead broke the key he used for decursive on his keyboard mid-raid in MC from spamming it so much.
---
Honestly, this was probably actually a better implementation because it let you prioritize cleansing important targets like tanks and healers first rather than randomly cleansing Johnny Chucklefuck that you brought along as a warm body to get closer to 40 people in the raid.
---
That‚Äôs one good looking Orc.

Seeing that was always amazing. It felt like a fucking Godzilla fight and you getting in the way meant your immediate death
---
We've already experienced layering, and when it got too full, they moved us to a new one. A lot of people got stuck on the defias thing but I think that was more because they had no idea where the pathing for it went to.
---
Yea I know, the roation isn't complex but that isn't what I mean. I mean informations like class quests, wand progression, skills by lvl, useful items and other helpful ifnormation on a picture like this just in priest
---
It is stupid, people will simply make a website or software for it. By removing the possibility to make it with the API they will hurt the community, they will it so that new players or not hardcore ones will not be able to reach some content and will miss a good chunck of the game. LFG add-on are healthy social dynamics because it promote quick, easy meeting of people looking for the same thing. At this point the dev team could simply make all servers RP since it seems they don't want people to actually play the game.
---
Yeah, calm down bro.
---
I don't know. I'm not here because I know how it works, I'm here to explain why people hate it.
---
Not everyone playing Classic has purchased BfA (the other expansions are free now), though.
---
the 30/0/21 warlock spec is widely considered as an affliction spec while still only using shadow bolt. I don't se how it should be any different for mages, 31/0/20 is clearly arcane and is very much utilizing the premier arcane spell unlike "affliction" warlocks which is not really doing that much with any affliction spels other then the very occasional corruption.
---

---
Is there one for a priest?
---
Yes, I know, I use Grail and Wholly combination in retail for years to check to track quest completion and i know tht addon also gives warning when breadcrumbs are left behind.
---
But I think the Classic version of the addon is not ready yet, the author has not completed yet the database of quest for Classic. Until Grail is ready this small list could be used
---
And the same group is also much poorer, and thus less educated, which increases probability of committing crime.

It's just pretentious to claim they are bad. You are hating, because you want to hate, not because they are bad.
---
Sub'd and installed classic yesterday, I haven't been in retail since the end of MoP.
---
Now you're just digging to prove him wrong. The man played the game a way that person seemed to claim was invalid, and his anecdote just proves it isn't.
---
I get the sentiment behind the argument though.
---
My job is implementing a new shift system, and I happened to pick the one where I work 3/12s with 4 days off in a row...... with my first day off being launch day.

It wasnt intentional but god, I lucked out.

You can't be serious.
---
This pretty much sums it up, it was appropriated by 4chan and while it often has extremist right-wing political connotations many who have re-approriated its use are not aware of that. I simply abstain from using or upvoting any content with it.
---
I would disagree that any content on 4chan's /b/ board is intellectual though, it does not rely on citation or expertise in a given field but rather on the ephemeral nature of the board.

Yes but every expansion up to BFA just requires a sub so it's still the same thing.

You can start "immediately", it's mostly a question of how long it will take to get there. Orc/Troll share starting zone, Undead can fly to Orgrimmar, Tauren can walk there. Similar deal for Alliance, Dwarf/Gnome share zone, Humans can get there through the underground fairly quickly but Night Elves have quite a long trek to get there. It also depends a little on what class you play, not all classes have trainers conveniently placed if you're not in your own starting zone.
---
Sure mage dominates! Except against a hunter of course...and a druid... and a warlock, an spriest and a shaman.  Anything else?
---
He‚Äôs basically alluding to the fact that most people where like level 50 before they had their first trinket or a neck piece worth a dick.
---
I'm sorry but this is nonsense.
---
I started playing in TBC, and every single dungeon group me and my mates/guild ever found was through trade chat. No one ever told me that there was a LFG tool that people were using to find groups.
---
I have the day off on launch day (total coincidence, wasn't planned), so I'm gonna wake up a little earlier to log in and get ready for the 8am launch.

G600 is a good cheaper option. The laser sensor kind of sucks though. Wish Logitech would update it with an optical and make it lighter.
---
Yeah i know that feeling with baby shoes but for me it's my mother who started playing on my Account  when i was 13 years old :D Still have her first character on my account.
---
Summer would obviously be a night elf.
---
Rick probably wouldn't play at all.

But imagine playing The Frozen Throne as a prequel to WotLK when and if it comes out
---
Dude you have a fiance, just make her cook for you.
---
Also only finger foods that aren't messy. That way you can eat while you game.
---
it is not impossible. i did it on the beta. what i recommend is to just let him attack you until he uses his stun and only then use tame beast and hope that you can finish the cast before he uses his stun again.
---
Nice and clean!

Amazing, you have a really smooth vocabulary friend. I hope you speak differently when meeting people out in the real world, you seem to have a lot of pent up anger and frustration &lt;3

Ammo for guns, it made tonnes of money in early blacksmithing, or was it engineering? (I'm a paladin player thru and thru, able to heal, smash with spells as well as use the biggest two hander you can find whilst being in armour, all classes have their fans, I just love a spell caster that can use a big ass two hander, I'm a simple creature I know, but not having a ranged weapon for pulling sucked).
---
Levels for weapons, it made every choice important, and even unarmed had to be leveled for when that damn chain didn't work and you were disarmed.
---
Okay that sounds good
---
And where does that stuff go after the guild has crafted their own gear?
---
I know I look like I'm shilling here in this comment string, however I want to proclaim my adoration for the Logitech G600.

That and I‚Äôve always liked final fantasy. There is a pretty shitty event in my life as a kid where i was introduced to a certain part of final fantasy 7 and even to this day when I get to red xiiis home it always triggers that memory.
---
So since then final fantasy has kinda been a soothing game series for me.
---
care to share? i am expressing my opinion and millions of others... LFG  ruined WoW the moment it was implemented and took the whole MMO experience away from the game...

if you dont think this then you clearly never played before cata.

Mages are good but they do not faceroll their way to success, and almost any kind of extra complication to a fight makes it harder for them. No way to sheep and drink if a mob is aggroed. Likely not enough time to sheep and drink even without mobs before something shows up to aggro/attack you.

God I hate that little mermaid zone.

I tried playing a lock with heirlooms, could literally pull an infinite number of mobs by tagging everything with corruption and never die

I had the idea warlocks were some kinda melee class because of the shadowy stuff around their hands in the pictures. I pictured myself as an orc melee warlock with a big black wolf as a pet. It took me 2 years till I finally was able to get a laptop and a copy of WoW. 2 years of imagining what the game was like; watching everything I could as someone with no internet, that was a VHS recorded episode of Cheat, and the Original WoW vs Everquest episode of X-Play, in which Everquest got a 4 out of 5 and WoW got a 5 out of 5. I finally got my chance in the summer of 06, and after all the hype I had personally built up... the game was honestly not as amazing as I thought it would be but it was still one of the best games I've ever played and still do this day I'm playing WoW.
---
Ah okay. Pvp trinket from AB ~30, Carrot on a Stick from 1k Needles -&gt; Zul'Farrak, and if you're horde, Revantusk token from Hinterlands. You'll probably be running the trinket from Plaguelands for token/rep farming too.

You really think that? Well we will all miss you in classic. But I guess you have to play what ever you think is better. :D

Herb and tailoring then Mage is the best class at gathering Black lotus in AV when that comes out plus its just great money in general farming herbs out in the world. Tailoring for the Bop Robes + bloodvine when it releases.

&gt; Even if Blizzard disables Global/Custom Channel AddOn Communication, all AddOns can simply send normal chat messages to a Custom Channel and hide that chat from the Player's view.
---
I'm actually totally fine with this because that means I don't have to see it. If there are people out there who want to use an addon to LFG, I say let them go for it. I just don't want the official LFG channel flooded with addon spam.

Is it a French server?
---
AB is not in the game for a long time.
---
I'm not sure what your play is here, but I'm fairly certain its this:
---
Yes. Technically, you are 100% correct. There's nothing explicitly banning cross-faction collusion.
---
However, if you go from there to "these mafias will be able to function unimpeded", that is where you go from *technically correct* to *almost guaranteed to be proven wrong*.
---
With everything we've heard from Blizzard these last weeks/days, it's very obvious things like mafias will be shut down one way or the other. I wouldn't be surprised if we have a blue post about it soon.
---
After all the downvotes trying to get the point across that this addon would be toxic, it's a bittersweet victory but i will take my minuses as  a battlescar I will tell the younglings about.
---
But they would say they are from Sweden. So you would know on a by country basis that they spoke Swedish/Norwegian/danish.
---
 Now we only know where people are from and not what language they prefer in game.

Some Spanish people might have the intention to speak English. How would we k ow with these statistics?

Honestly, this is purely my opinion but the servers have now reached the point where the amount of them negates this kind of worry. Unless you‚Äôre like allergic to a language.
---
I won't download it and it may sound selfish but i think this type of addon musn't exist at all because it may impact the relation between all the players.

While the others addon like UI/raid/quest addons are "fine".

These addons existed and could exist back then. By changing the api you actually bring change to vanilla.

yep. and thankfully blizzard sees things the same way i do! thanks for listening to the true fans, blizzard!
---
Back when it came out I didn't see a connection between  wc3 and wow. The latter focused more on the game world instead of the characters introduced in wc3. Once  TBC got announced I became interested and quickly joined my friends to prepare for it. The game world depicted in wc3 was also a bit different then wow, it felt like an early draft as far as I remember.
---
If I wanted to get hyped for TBC and wotlk again, I would totally play wc3 beforehand.
---
misrepresented. I as a horde warrior will carry a battle shout with my guildies across all lands, we are bigot defeaters and liar defiars. the corrupt and evil soul-takers of this world will FEAR our name.
---
Man i do not know. i just turned this on to get the nostalic and thought why not give it to reddit :) But i feel you that music puts you in the right mode.
---
&gt; Having to look through 10000 people spamming in LFG chat is going to become frustrating really quickly
---
Thanks a ton for the details!
---
You got everything you need :)
---
Play a tank or healer and then people will look for you :)
---
There are a lot of addons that reduce player interaction that no one has gone after. It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs under the term LFG they go wild. 
---
I would argue that questhelper addons reduce player interactions more so than the LFG addon because there are far more instances of people needing to ask for help with a confusing quest than a dungeon and quest helper addons completely halt the need to even ask in the first place. The fact you can gather a pug group quicker doesn‚Äôt stop players from forming bonds and chatting while playing the dungeon either.
---

No, I MUST top the meters, I MUST get that one extra Shadowbolt.

If you're not pushing the meters: Threat &amp; DPS. You're a wasted raid slot.

Damn im freaking craving that food rn, didnt even bother paying attention to the meme anymore, im hungry
---
They'll likely just break the automated invites part of it.
---
I'm sober now so I may actually need more.
---
I had the same reaction, like this can't be real. But there were people actually defending it on the grounds of immersion.
---
I am sure those are just some kids who don't really know what classic was, and want to play the game as "analog" as possible. To them it seems like the more they torture themselves the more fun it is. Nah man, that's just torture.
---
/rantover
---
If they limit chat interaction, gold and boost sellers will say a huge "thanks" as their spam cannot be filtered and addons like "unlimited ignore list" will stop working alse
---
Then go back to Retail scrub?
---
Thats how classic used to be.
---
If you had an outside third party tool to lfg, then you'll have to contact people in game and talk to them and make the group. It'll be the same thing as a simple add-on that parse the chat to just make a list of people.

Why clean twice when you clean right the first time? Checkmate Alliance.

---
Not at all, if someone is creating a group for a dungeon you want to do just /w them. It will probably also increase your chances of an invite if you tell them upfront your level/class/spec etc. 
---
Encouraging social interactions and building relationships with people is very important, and fulfilling when you come across or group with the same people over and over again.
---
I fired up a little pserver of my own for the 1.12 client just to make a gm char and remember how to navigate in blackrock spires and depths so I wont look like a total noob, just a regular noob
---
discord replaces vent and guildlaunch.com
---
I prefer TBC's system as well because spamming /world with "lf1m tank scholo" isn't social interaction, it's, well, spam. But this is supposed to be classic and not classic, *but* so I'm not going to cry after them trying to break an addon that goes against the design philosophy.
---
Once you get in it'll be okay but the character select boots you after 30 minutes regardless of key presses or anything you do. If you aren't there right when the queue counts down you have 30 minutes and then you have to requeue even with auto hotkey.  
---
Now once you get in game that's a different story can AHK and not get booted.
---
Thanks for sharing, wish I had my old wow screenies from way back then

I understand. The climate here is so dry that any increase in humidity is very welcome to me, even when it shoots way up briefly during/after rainstorms.
---
This is correct  One must backflip to get on top of a mailbox.
---
But there‚Äôs going to be loads of people who don‚Äôt have pre-made guilds and friends lists. 
---
I‚Äôve purposely not joined or even searched for a guild, and won‚Äôt be meeting up with old guild mates because I want to go in on the deep end and meet people in-game. Just like when I started Vanilla.
---
There will be thousands of people like you, looking for new people to play with.
---
&gt; They do involve having to participate with other players so I guess you'll have to figure out how to do that.
---
Why would you assume I don't know how to do that? It still means spending 20 minutes finding a group, versus spending 1 minute finding a group. It's such a minor change with such a massive benefit.
---
But then again I should probably wait and see how it turns out, instead of being frustrated in advance.
---
No matter what class you play, if you are raiding you are hitting about 4 buttons
---
There will be more bad players than good players.
---
Go druid, get engineering up and prowl until your little heart is content.
---
Great community btw.
---
There's still a monetary barrier between us playing Classic and playing BfA, which probably makes most people not even bother downloading the retail client let alone log into old characters.
---
It would be a pretty shit change to kill off 2 useful features just to appease some QQing. Auto invites is even more useful in Vanilla with 40 man raids (i.e. addons that auto invite guildies, or allow people to message a keyword and receive an invite). Auto communication is super useful for dungeon/raid mechanics on event trigger. Those are horrible changes IMO.
---
Here is a secret brothers. Mute the in game music and play Alliance music on Youtube when in Durotar.
---

---
Hey you copied mine
---
Its not frustrating. First of all, not all 10k ppl will be online nor will they be looking for group at the same time. 
---
It will be evenly spread out accross all dungeons and level spaces.
---
You have to read, thats true. And watch if your desired dungeon is been looked for. 
---
 But so do most, there isnt just spamming over and over again. Write your lfg once a minute and you are fine. 
---
This is how it was back then, and it worked perfectly fine. It also needs and improves your social skill and a lot of ppl you find that way will end on your friendslist which makes lfg even easier.
---
This is how i remember it from vanilla back then and experienced it on pservers
---
retail had Openraid (an external website) before the improved LFG tool was introduced same will most likely happen in classic and once its external blizz cant do much about it other than ask the providers to shut it down.
---
Decursive, and a lot of these "No addons" types should heal molten core.
---

---

---
&gt; I know I know, I can just play retail, but retail sucks, classic is dope.
---
I doubt so - as they said they have no clear cut rule about this. Which means they rule it appropriate or not in each case.  
---
TRP is a well known RP addon that existed for a very very long time (I think Lich King ? Perhaps even BC ?).   
---
The vendor add-on though I think it's going to be different. It's gonna be harder to rule.  
---
As for going against the AH I'm currently working on a site for EU-Zandalar Tribe to showcase profession crafters. I intend to roleplay and be a crafter in Classic. The idea would be to provide a small and efficient site where you can compare the rates between various players offering various professions and also proposing a sell tab where you can list what you have for sale. Basically circumventing the AH by trading outside of it.
---
Exactly why "auto inv" is not an issue and wouldnt even be used. The addon dev already removed it from every category in the addon except custom anyway. People screeching over nothing.
---
I think a simple tool that parse the chat is okay. Auto-grouping and auto-checking specs is not okay.

---
Never play on release day. Your mistake will be a blessing in disguise.
---
I'm expecting the LFG addon to be more of a filter. than what it does today.
---
People lets be real. Servers are gonna be like x3-4 times the size they were back then and that means x3-4 times the spam in lfg.
---
People need some way to filter. Maybe an addon that helps by creating channels around the instance you are looking for.
---
Shazzrah and Morgraine will be the biggest realms
---
I have played multiple MMORPGs without an automated group finder .. never had an issue.  May be just two different types of people though.  I personally 90% of the time just keep an eye on LFG/guild channel and if they are looking for my class send a tell with my class/lvl and ask for invite if possible.  The other 10% I will make the group and usually fill it up with guild/friends first and any empty space grab people at random.  Not too complicated or time consuming(you can do this while killing stuff/running/tradeskills/etc).
---
nope! i just enjoy the game and know that the type of people who would want lfd won't enjoy classic :) i would tell someone looking for an mmo to stay away from singleplayer rts games as well
---
It works like a chat filter if you don't enable auto invite. Auto invite has been removed from the addon recently, too.
---
Yeah...Classic community is super toxic too. I think it has less to do with the version of the game and more the timeframe of release.
---
Then grow up quickly and stop bring butthurt over small things.
---
this method isnt only viable at the lvl 40-46 bracket its viable even at lvl 60 \^\^, and as a caster you could easily do this at lvl 40 perhaps even 39. sadly the only character i had to do it on was lvl 46 i do not have a character at every single lvl available to me but thx for your input \^\^
---
So you hate when people communicate with you. Why do you play an MMO? Plenty of single player games where those "ransoms"won't ever bother you.

"Call to Arms" was at the very end of Vanilla, just listed people by parsing the chat and didn't had auto-invite.
---
&gt;It's such a minor change with such a massive benefit.
---
This is where most frustration between retail players and vanilla players comes from.
---
It doesn't matter if it's more efficient, convenient, "fun" - classic isn't meant to be like retail. 
---
The best part is - if you really don't like the classic way of things - thebsame subscription that gives you classic also gives you access to retail.
---
Ya.

So you would rather have the game die than it being played ?

You can use mouse over on any raid frame, macros can do it too. I don‚Äôt see why blizzard would have an issue with healbots raid frame in particular.
---
anime avatar =\_=
---
Through most of classic, im sorry to say mage pve is insanely boring. They for sure stand out as one of the most active and twitch based classes in the game but in raid content and 5 mans your looking at hitting a few buttons on repeat. you dont even have the luxury of bouncing and spazzing around like melee dps do to spice it up. And when your not in combat you'll be conjuring food and water. If you want balanced fun in both types of content mage might not be for you
---
This is a good thing.  Driving these kind of things out of the game only causes them to be created outside of the game, ultimately creating splits in the community.  The add on only facilitates group assembly through already established and well used chat channels. You still have to do the real interaction to get everyone there and coordinate effectively to accomplish the goal of your grouping.
---
Good on Blizz for realizing this and working with the addon team.
---
So what stops that same exact scenario from happening without a LFG addon?
---
/who [add class + lvl range] and ask them if they want to join the dungeon group. Thats your tool.
---
That would be cool too, keeping the experience true to Classic.

So you admit that you haven't even tried the addon yourself or even read what it does, then. Why do you even have an opinion on it if you don't even bother to do your research first?
---
So was the LFG add-ons back in vanilla the bad hindsight you're wanting to prevent now?

other sniper addons existed back in the day iirc

Literally read the post. They did the exact thing you're saying won't happen. This addon worked in vanilla, now it doesn't, because the community asked for it to go because removing it would improve the game.

Why do you care about what the streamers are doing. It doesn't affect you or your game play.
---
Pretty obvious if everyone except one or two people from the same guild gets camped. Watch them for a couple of days, baby you got a pattern goin'!
---
Druids can pick their battles.  Dont make it fair.  Also they did fine in dungeons as dps or tank.
---
Actually you could launch the game in a sandbox and fix em there ;) u/unbrokenflower posted a link in the thread
---
The "boomer" meme is more in reference to the boomer mentality, not so much age. Stuff like technological ineptitude, appeal to authority, being unreasonable and blind due to nostalgia are key boomer traits.
---
Back to skeletons?
---
Ty! I was hoping to do my first-ever playthrough before Classic launches but time has not permitted, so hopefully I can at least watch all of the cinematics!
---
I actually typically wrote out my LFGs in full back in Vanilla, but then I played on an RP realm. "We are seeking two more fearless adventurers to venture into ruined city of Dire Maul. Excitement and rare treasures await! Survival not guaranteed." Granted, there were also plenty of people using "LF2M DM PST" on RP realms. My main worry is that the ad echo will be set too low and we'd just get a lot of repetitions.
---
GL whit manualy sniping info about who wanna go for inst in chat whit ~~~5000 ppl. GL whit that when it moves like 20 lines per sec.

---
With some editing this could work.
---
Oh, not the God-Damned Hardly boys again!
---
Did you never play vanilla?
---
Very easily 20+ minutes.
---
Have you ever played WoW before the first iterations of the LFG system?
---
What you need to understand is that running dungeons and group quests were never meant to be the absurd joke they are now.  You're not meant to level by spamming dungeons.  You're not meant to have an easy time finding a group for them, or hell, even just *travelling to them.*  If you find Classic dungeons to be too inconvenient to enjoy, then I don't think you really understand what Classic is for.
---
This community can finally reclaim something that has been long lost in WoW's universe.  It used to feel way more immersive and alive because you had to deal with constant hardships and it made every small victory sweeter than you could imagine.  Accomplishing anything in Vanilla required one's continual cooperation with the community around them.   Completing a dungeon is a challenging, time-consuming endeavor, and it'll truly be an achievement to walk out of one wearing gear dropped from the last boss or being able to say that you completed it.  
---
Remember, it's not just inconvenient for you; **Everyone** will have the same difficulty level forced on them by Classic.  When you raise the bar across the board like that, it isn't a personal nerf.  It just ads more to the game.  Look at flying, for example.  It's not really much better for the individual, since everyone else has flying.  It's not like you're getting ahead.  You essentially **have to** use flying mounts in retail because you **can**, and if you don't, you're putting yourself at a massive disadvantage in the game.  Adding convenience only serves to remove character from the game in most cases, which is a damn shame, because this game was meant to be taken in many, many small steps.  Not just teleport from your safe city into a similarly safe dungeon with people who don't talk to kill mobs that pose no threat to you to collect gear that you're just going to vendor so you can have a couple extra drops of gold to add to the overinflated bucket.
---
It's my honest opinion that if you don't like it, you really just don't understand it.
---
LEVELN UND SCHEFFELN BITTE SCH√ñN JA.
---
Not a fan but if we must, only if it's disabled in Contested territory
---
I have repeatedly explained why you are wrong. The addon parses a chat channel. If you have to go back to a city to use General Chat in order to find a group/replacement then so does someone with the addon. If this person can leave your group and "quickly find a new one" then that means there is an abundance of players looking to do that dungeon, and it should likewise be just as quick for you to find a replacement.
---
You both have to go back to the city to see General chat, and you both have to either post a message in General chat and wait for a response or message someone else that has advertised in General chat. The fact that you choose to do it manually and he does it by clicking a button with a preconfigured message doesn't matter. You could literally make a macro and put it on your hotbar to do the same thing. No where have you explained how LFG makes people replaceable - you just keep saying it does, and then you admit you don't even understand how the addon works or think it matters when that is the main part that matters.
---
Damn u OP
---
&gt; because once those waves of 60s hit and they have to go back into the pack they so desperately wanted to get ahead of, they're going to be competing amongst themselves and lowbies again for resources
---
They will have a gear advantage and farming trash mobs at 60 is much easier than doing it in your 30s. Another problem with this is that they can effectively say no and farm it quicker themselves completely cutting out the middle man, but hey, if you feel you can set the market value of an item go for it.
---
Indeed!
---
If it plays vanilla it should run classic too. Why don't you just try it?
---
This guy is a real piece of shit. 
---
How many fucking people have fought for this true Classic WoW experience and this entitled twat has the audacity to think it's okay to potentially fuck up a critical community driven aspect of the game all because it's his precious fucking addon. 
---
Blizzard needs to outright ban anyone using this addon, problem solved. 
---
Fuck breaking the addon if it breaks other, none impactful qol add-ons that utilize similar parts of the games code or however the hell it works...  Just ban anyone who is going to use it. 
---
I can't stand seeing shit like this and that other borderline ah bot Addon that was posted here last week that basically plays the auction house for you automaticlly.
---
It's \*not\* enough that they promise to disable it soon. This addon should be DOA. If it's there on day 1 and too many people start using it, it'll become the gold standard. I'm not usually one for slippery-slope argument, but I've seen it happen over a decade and change of playing WoW. You don't want Classic quest areas and dungeons to look like BFA's, where it's dead silence, no chatting, and you end up not knowing anyone you play with.
---
_Guys, let's not fuck this up. Cereal._
---
Hope they don't break the poker addon
---
here are the minimum and recommended specs for classic:
---
[Classic Specs](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/243159)
---
hopefully that'll help. it's tricky to find lol
---
theres no better or worse on a matter of opinion like which of the models you like best.
---
But if it comes to which one is better designed of course the new ones will win, they are more detailed, have more expression, the extra polygons make them look smother, etc, etc.
---
Wait wait back up. Exlain the "cost less than a cup of coffee" part. Why ? How? Where? Am geniuenly interested in knowingüòÖ
---
To some extend yes, you have to technically talk to that person once you find them..
---
But let me give you an example.. I want to go to instance as a DPS, but I don't want to sit in town reading the trade chat, world chat, LFG chat, etc.. I want to actually do something in the meantime while waiting so I just put myself to queue for that instance and go grind monsters while talking to my guild.
---
I don't know about you, but I'd rather actually do something in the game while waiting instead of just reading chat for hours while copy paste spamming "LFG x-DUNGEON". If I want to read, I rather read a book or discord channels, not ANAL [Dirge]
---
Oh and from what I understand, you could also filter out people you don't like in the said addon like ninja looters without having to remember their name.. That was supposed to be a feature too.
---
If you're not trolling:
---
**[spoilers ahead]** WC3 tells the story of how young Thrall frees his people from internment camps set up by the Alliance, some time after what you see in the Warcraft movie. They sail to Kalimdor, meet up with Cairne Bloodhoof (father of Baine) and Vol'Jin. Basically, the beginning story of the Horde. There's also Cenarius getting slain by Grom Hellscream thing, which makes Night Elves join the Alliance. Eventually, Thrall and Jaina team up to stop defeat Burning Legion in the battle of Mount Hyjal (which we go back in time to participate in, in the TBC raid). And, most importantly, it features the origin story of Arthas, the first contact with the plague, the culling of Stratholme, the murder of Uther, the expedition to Northrend, sacking of Quel'Thalas and using the Sunwell to rise Kel'Thuzad and turning Sylvanas into a Banshee, which sets up The Frozen Throne campaing.
---
In TFT, on Durotar you're basically have the story of Thrall, Rexxar and Rokhan building the Orgrimmar and expending the kingdom. Then, Daelin Proudmoore leads an expedition to Theramore and dies there. There's also Illidan fleeing from Maiev, banding up with the Naga and obtaining the Eye of Sargeras. Then, Kil'Jaeden sends him on a misson to end The Lich King. In the Eastern Kingdoms, we get the story of how Garithos causes High Elves to split from the Alliance and how Kael'Thas becomes one of the bad guys. Arthas ends the rule of the Nathrezim, "purges" Lordaeron, leave Sylvanas in command, while he goes back to Northrend, because his powers are waning for some reason. There he meets Anub'arak, who aids in fighting off Illidan's forces and becoming the Lich King. The defeated Illidan flees back to Outland, where he realizes that the Burning Legion is the more immediate threat and starts setting up for a war against the Burning Legion. Everyone who played TBC and Legion knows how it ends. Meanwhile, Arthas takes control of all Northrend, but loses his grip on his forces over in Lordaeron, which gives a start to the Forsaken. He keeps building his stronghold in the Icecrown, where we go after the events of TBC.
---
So play it how you want to, we're getting a second chance here, we dont have to do it the same way again ( says the guy playing dwarf paladin with exact same name as last time)
---
Miranda is the ultimate giffy then ?
---
At the moment whatever has the lowest population EU.
---
If my 2012 laptop can run it, yours can run it. Also it's kind of a stupid question if you are able to run vanilla on private servers, and WotLK. 
---
If you can handle retail wow, you can handle classic. (assuming you have sub time, try running retail)
---
This kind of stuff isnt for me but I love seeing others getting excited about stuff like this.  Hope you find what you are looking for wow brother!
---
Depending on your hype level when the game is in your hands - you'll go into auto pilot and ignore any aches and pains :)

---
Wait till the 26 when they open the new realms.  Far lass q times that way and chance of getting your old name if you fast
---
No - only copy paste would be to tbc servers
---
If such an addon establishes itself inside the community you wont find groups of you exclude yohrself from it.
---
Try finding groups in Retailwow without the LFG Tool, its hard as hell.
---
DAM FUCKING STRAIGHT
---
You're right I had forgotten that bit for a sec. Man I can be stupid when I just wake up, sorry XD.
---
Well here's hoping TRP won't get nuked too much. But I don't see the very core functionalities disabled. Like showing a RP tooltip when mousing over a player (showing RP Name, and the quick info that's apparent about it). 
---
Custom items and player tracking could get nuked though but that ain't that big a loss I think.
---
If you're tanking in your dungeon group it's not really that important, if you're dps it's gonna be pretty bad.
---
And for PVP druids can be aggressive but not really in animal form. You're gonna get more mileage out of applying moonfire and insect swarm and using animal forms for their utility rather than damage (bear charge, stun, demo shout etc.). Don't think yourself as a rogue if you're in cat form because you will be disappointed. It's more for whittling them down while your dots tick than bursting them down in a pounce or w/e.
---
There's a few questions you can ask yourself that'll help narrow it down. Do you like to heal? Do you like to lead/tank? Do you prefer pve or pvp?
---
I"ll try to help as best as I can. :)
---
You don't need vanish. You bear and bash and heal.
---
yup.
---
Personally I'd love it if it only changed for me haha.  I love it in retail and will miss it.  I get how it impacts pvp though so I really wouldnt want it in game. But if I had to pick something that's what it would be.
---
All time classic right there
---
As long as you aren't a hunter.
---
horde mages will die trying
---
I still have things to do during the day after launch, but my preparation is basically just prepairing food. Im gonna make some slow-cooked stew, some kind of pasta sauce and something that you can eat even if its cold like meatballs(swedish version) or minced meat patties. A huge salad bowl to go along with it for those sweet vitamins aswell.
---
LFG-tools as addons existed in vanilla, such as Call to arms.
---
Strange that people are applauding blizzard for changing vanilla.
---
If there is one thing I've learned so far while working on my Mage Google Doc it's that you NEED alternative items to your pre raid bis lists.

Still can't decide between (mainly for pvp):

priest (never played before)
---
rogue (played and loved -&gt; Grim)
---
warlock (played an loved -&gt; Drakedog)

Launch is 11pm here. Not gonna go crazy. Maybe 2-3am I shall crash.

You have a great talent that must be nurtured

every single one of your comments the past few days is you defending this addon. when you say "they" are you talking about yourself? i'm sorry they nerfed your addon lol.
---
I remember listening to so much linkin park back in the Vanilla days, Fat Lip by Sum 41 is an all time great, metal was the go to that‚Äôs for sure
---
He asked fellow adults if he should call in sick to work to play WoW a day early when he already asked for the following day off and there really isn't a point because if there are problems to be encountered then they will be encountered on day one. Seems pretty obvious to me.
---
I prefer classic but BFA is a decent/good game in its own right. Can't say that here without being crucified though
---
Which real money?
---
There are particular areas where this style of grinding works, part of the process is to single out any ranged units and kill them before the pull. you most certainly dont need a mount to do it though. the real problem will be that you need to be alone or in a group. other players easily can ruin a grinding spot and thats going to be very common around launch
---
Apparently the poor guy was only trying to help (make classic worse).
---
Enjoy your ban here. Can I be in the deleted thread?
---
"significantly limit this add-on" aka they're not removing the core of it anyway
---
He was at Gamescon a few years ago if I recall correctly. But I don't know if he still makes new music.
---
Part of Classic was to go look for groups yourself, even if it took an hour or two to find one. It's just part of the experience and I support the decision to limit the addon, even if it had added lots of convenience.
---
Careful, (s)he's a hero.
---
Mr sir, if you could be so kind and include some Warlock related one you would be my hero.
---
what a cringefest
---
Of course not. This has to be one of the worst ideas ever posted on this sub.
---
Play hunter or warlock if you want EZ mode leveling and feeling powerful
---
FotF is one that usually goes to hunters first - they don't replace it until naxx, and other daggers are better for rogues. As for the others, it's a shitfight!

---
So that's how it works?
---
Okay, let's go back to the scenario when I'm at Rivendare and need one more guy. It's late and I've only got one guildie on:
---
* Me: Hey Scheisskopf, wanna do the last boss in UD strat?
---
* Scheisskopf: no, fuck that place. 
---
* Me: Ok, you're in IF. Can you say "LF1M UD strat, at baron rivendare" in trade chat? When the LFG mod guys answer, tell them to whisper me.
---
* Scheisskopf: K.
---
In 90 seconds I have five strangers to choose from. And when we're done, they're going to leave and that'll be that.
---
&gt;You both have to go back to the city to see General chat, and you both have to either post a message in General chat or message someone that is advertising in General chat. 
---
I guess that just isn't true, now is it? 
---
So, now people can go into and out of groups whenever they want. That kind of makes people...I don't know...*replaceable*? Is that the word?
---
&gt;No where have you explained how LFG makes people replaceable 
---
I didn't have to, I was talking to someone else entirely. My first vote's got plenty of upvotes, I think I explained public opinion rather well to the guy who asked about public opinion. You're the guy over here butting in, asking "do you ~~have a moment to talk about the lord~~ realize that the lfg mod isn't important?
---
But now I have.
---
So, take a walk, son.
---
So much talk about end game. I just wanna play my 30/21 druid again and enjoy being decent at heals or tanking for simple dungeons. Though I can't remember how to build it...
---
Wait, is Worf from Star Trek the voice actor for some humans?
---
Ok, nice. This means the cast bar addons should get restricted as well. 
---
\&gt; "if a streamlined group-finding system was something we considered compatible with Classic, we would have kept the modern Premade Group Finder tool rather than choosing to remove it from the Classic client.‚Äù 
---
If a cast bar was considered they would've added one themselves
---
\&gt;  ‚Äúwhen an add-on goes beyond presenting information or providing aesthetic customization...  that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely.‚Äù
---
It goes beyong presenting information and providing aesthetic customization. And it relies on other players having it if they want an equal footing in PvP.
---
To comfort you even more, the amount of responses is only a fraction of this subs total amount of members. There's tons of people who just lurk and don't even fill this stuff out. It really is just a subset of a subset of the overall population.
---
Things like that are special because they are rare.
---
Once those things are no longer rare they aren't as cool.
---
It would spoil what makes having those things so great. You'll still have those things in classic if you earn them which is enough.
---
"No Changes" ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

It's not a meme, it's a pun on the defintiion of the part of millenials who are "echo boomers", which is an actual thing. I suppose it's just more effective to use as a meme than calling people millennials.

---
well kinda... not really.. we'll have to see
---
&gt;you cant aoe grind.
---
Ok dude. Says all the aoe grinders on the beta and stress tests lol
---
&gt;I think the only way they could really consistently do it without breaking everything would be if they were talking about addons communicating with each other.  But that would break a lot of other addons that were part of vanilla like the gatherer addons and most database based addons.
---
I hope they won't do anything about it. My bet is that nobody¬†will use these LFG addons. I'm a huge fan of Role Playing and I'm counting a lot on Total RP 3 to find players willing to RP. If they restrict the communication, it will essentially break these addons..
---
No because Classic isn't using the original vanilla client, it's using the current retail client.
---
People here don't even know what really killed the social aspect in WoW. It was instantly teleporting to the instance, cross realm queues, and the current class/dungeon designs where you don't even need to say a word to complete them. But they think the LFM spam in chat is pinnacle socializing, not the you know, getting to the dungeon and communicating on how to clear it.
---
Tho, they can't really prevent a "gearscore" addon as long as it doesn't match people or something like that. All such an addon has to do is reading the gear a character has equipped and then offer the result on an external site.
---
The first answer to a google request is quite comprehensive. Since your google must be broken (otherwise you'd surely have used it), let me copy/paste it.

---
Combat logging and actually working damage meters didn't exist in Vanilla either.. Just saying..
---
I kinda agree with the guy. Not Perolex. Was he "too much"? Maybe, but I don't think so. This convo took place in Wrath or after...not in Vanilla. Perolex wouldn't have made it in Vanilla. It is also the last sentence that mentions the LFD.
---
Probably I would have done the same, just to get back at Blizzard fanbois that brought LFD into the game.
---
And yes, the LFG addons should always be broken for Classic. This convo doesn't change my mind, it actually reinforces my view, because THIS convo took place in a game that had LFD in the game already, hence, a player base that wants everything, wants it fast, and if someone else can actually do it for them is perfect.
---
Like asking for a dungeon boost. Wanna be lazy? Go to Retail. Wanna have people boost you in a dungeon in Classic? Have friends. Be in a guild. If not, ASK POLITELY, using proper wording ( man, so many retail babies will be fucked in Classic for using the "modern" internet talk) and be sure that you have the gold to pay for their time.
---

---
This arcane mage thing makes me very unhappy.
---
Arcane was pretty much only pvp
---
Below my keyboard there I can put them on the stool
---
Well worth it, RP addons in retail wow are using the same thing this LFG addon is using,
---
they are making a social network and anybody who don't uses the popular RP addon is basically an outcast
---
Does anybody know of a Dutch version of this? xD probably not
---
I think he's talking about abandoning lv60 content. BWL, Naxx etc was hardly relevant content in TBC. There's a lot of talk going around about Classic+ implementing TBC raids and Outland in general, while retaining other lv60 content.
---
Between the two, which class is more difficult? Hunters have a tough rotation, whereas warlocks have a ton of spells...
---
No that‚Äôs because I express my feelings with actions and not words.. 
---
People are unhappy about something but all the do is bitch and complain and nothing happens. 
---
‚ÄúVote with your wallet‚Äù is what I go by. Have done all my life. Did with retail due to Rio. Anthem, TD2... the list goes on. 
---
Too many people play games and just bend over and gets fucked rather than actually making a stand. That‚Äôs why we have games like we do these days.
---
I played the stress tests on my Surface Pro 6, pretty sure your Laptop can manage
---
I'm real tired of it, tbh
---
Pick anything at all about retail - make post saying it sucks - collect upvotes
---
Those that can afford it, yeah. And they'll have the gold, but they'll also set the market and understand exactly how valuable their time is. If you price shit so high that their time is better spent farming, they're not going to buy it.

Lol. And how will they have all this gold at lvl 60?
---
There will be a decent amount of people I'm sure. Still, it's different getting it now with all of the knowledge we have today than getting it back then when not too many people really knew what to do or what the quest entailed.
---
A lot of the "cool factor" from it is just lost if you get it in classic and transfer it over rather than original vanilla
---
&gt;Fuck yeah! Fuck off LFG twat kids.
---
Spoken like an adult.
---
What personal gain exactly? Making addons is mostly giving time and receiving angry feedback in return.
---
You're right.  The horde are not to be trusted.
---
Looking forward to playing with you and our Norwegian bros
---
I don't want to rain on your or anyone else's parade, but most of the soundtrack is generic and shared across zones. Eg. Westfall/Mulgore/Durotar play the same tracks (titled "Plains"), and Elwynn plays the same music as eg. Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
+1 to g600. 3 years and working like new. Even got another Logitech to play destiny. Great mice, comfy as hell
---
I wonder who's going to be better at PVP this time around. Or has it been already decided?
---
You haven‚Äôt played much wow recently have you, they now hand out 8 to 24 hours bans like they are confetti. Are you a dick in chat? 8 hour ban here you come. Annoyed a multiboxer? 24 hour ban is yours.
---
Do you miss out on anything important if you instantly go to another starting zone and level from there?
---
100% Also swapping to Morgraine with a couple of Brits and Scandinavians.
---
Wastes people‚Äôs time even after you had 59 levels to learn you class 
---
They get upset..
---
They aren‚Äôt the toxic ones here bud
---
I haven't played wow for a number of years, can someone please explain the lfg add-on issue. Why is the old one bad? Is the new one better?
---
TIA
---
He's asking a question
---
Imagine that.. I wonder how would it be like.......... Oh wait, that's the addon they were making. Yes, it was designed to skip the whisper part, but it was supposed to have filters so you could choose what you were looking for and filter out the people you don't like like ninja looters or people rolling for same item type as you.. (which people are going to do anyway by just not answering your whispers)
---
Mograine is absolute bait, give the servers "cool" names and watch kids flock
---
Blizz might as well rename Shazzrah to Poopoopeepeepants
---
I agree entirely about feeling weak and lacking. Somewhere in the patches they were buffed enough to make them viable tanks but that was not my experience at all. The current meta of farming a gnomregon mace for cat dps is interesting but not something I want to do. I think both war and rogue were more satisfying to level because I felt so much stronger with the abilities feral will never get. Or sl lock to never lose in pvp if thats your style.
---
Hey engineering for the stealth trinket ! Then be the one to lure the alliance somewhere, boom your friends jump em
---
I'm just going to take my time cause it's an endurance race not a sprint.
---
I never felt the need to rush.  I'm even gonna fish some all throughout, do my cooking, etc.  Like it was meant to be done.
---
Just send your wife to go fetch your horse.

I call shenanigans!

For me BFA is just a worse Legion, since both have esse basically the same features. And I loved Legion, as well as the guild I was in from the start of it until we killed mythic G'huun in Uldir. While I quit there, the guild fell apart while working on Blockade and since then only 4 members keep logging into battlenet. Everyone else quit, which really shows since I had raided with 11 of those guys since we started progress in Legion and none of us even thought of qutting when BFA launched.
---
Legion had massive flaws in the RNG and gear inflation departments but aside from that I loved almost every part of it. Yes, even freaking Mistress Sass'zine (as an arms warrior) and Kil'jaeden in Tomb of Sargeras. It was the first version of the game that offered me something to do for almost every day of the expac's lifetime. And yet every piece of Legion-equivalent content in BFA feels watered down (AP system) or worsened (M+). 
---
Ultimately, I look forward to taking a more relaxed approach with Classic and I can't wait to work towards a proper BIS list again.
---
And it does not rely on anyone else using the addon which was another requirement. 
---
Anyway they said they would look at addons that do that, not ban them all. For all we know a review of many different addons has already happened years ago. 
---
Stop trying to to spread FUD.
---
They will set the prices, not the sellers. Sellers will be just as desperate to sell, so there will be a ton of undercutting.  
---
This isn‚Äôt theory, it‚Äôs literally what happened in this 15 year old game and is what happens on private servers of said 15 year old game and is what will happen in this version of the 15 year old game. There are no surprises or secrets anymore, people have this game mastered
---
Take that twitch zoomer talk somewhere else..
---
I guess I don't get this one. If you don't want to use lfg, then don't. But damn, sometimes getting into a group as a dps is about fucking impossible. Especially in off hours. Thursday night isn't really rush hour for raiding. If that's the only day you have, you might be kind of fucked. 
---
The reason lfg isn't more social is because there is no audio. Make joining a party automatically connect you to a group audio channel, and watch how fast that shit changes.
---
I‚Äôm not very tech savvy so got a mate coming to look at it. Should end up better setup than before so will be ‚Äúready for action!‚Äù üòÇ
---
LFG-tools such as call to arms existed in vanilla. And you could join groups with automatic invitatopns from the meeting stones or innkeepers.
---
how is raider.io gonna tell you that lol....just because people havnt done something doesnt automatically mean they are shit lol...you guys are just proving my point on why addons like raider.io and gearscore shouldnt be allowed because it alienates people from getting into groups just because they havnt done something
---
Which is why Blizzard should limit those addons as well.
---
oof.
---
I logged in. Saw something called mount equipment and realized it's a shop thing then noped out.
---
Hm. Maybe pets/mounts being in a menu rather than in bags? Not necessarily acct bound maybe wotlk style (I'm answering this hypothetically I'm not actually desperate for this but out of anything it would be useful. I'm a pet hoarder)
---
REAL. Really not sure if this excitement is wholesome healthy excitement or addiction brain  binge anticipation. Prob BOTH
---
its fine.
---
support DPS.. like a warlock.
---
Yup... Always take the offer you can't refuse.
---
I have the feeling people who never played pre-LFG have seen a few people mention LFG addons existed, and these are the people parroting it all over the subreddit.
---
I‚Äòve been playing since 2006, I genuinely never heard of anyone who ever used these addons, I‚Äôve asked my friends and neither have they. These LFG addons were not even slightly common. 
---
Meeting stone and innkeeper LFG features pretty much got no use either, I tried using them 2 or 3 times when I was new to the game and NEVER had them match me with a single person. LFG was practically non-existent.
---
MT is arguably more important than the guild master or anyone else after he core team is recruited he is the star quarterback
---
Wasn't there a demon hunter NPC in Blasted Lands all the way back in Vanilla?
---
Well *obviously* the lowbie won't brag about this. Not sharing this with the world would have been a mistake tho.
---
If the $, is good it'll keep happening
---
not gonna queue. gonna play the game like stress test, just drink in the gameplay on new characters whereever i can roll them.
---
I'm more worried about diminishing returns. They weren't there in the original game or in the first patch with the honor system.
---
I had a friend playing a mage in the mid 40s leveling in Tanaris. A level 50 warrior decided to give him a hard time. After two deaths, my friend just sheeped him. And before the cooldown expired, he did it again. And again. 
---
And again.
---
For about 90 minutes.
---
When he was done, the warrior bowed, mounted up, and left.
---
Doubt
---
Not really because I‚Äôd probably be playing it more than WoW considering we won‚Äôt get real PvP for quite a while
---
So only Jerry's play alliance. Noted
---
Ah I really don't know if  u can get it in other languages but maybe something will come out idk :o
---
My expectation is firstly not everyone is getting in on this on day one, people are expecting a ton of issues and when they're sure of stability, they'll subscribe. Yes, population will be in flux as soon as retailers decide it isn't for them, but there is a large population that will stick with it and should bring more, potentially brand new people who weren't convinced by retail to start, into the fold.
---
If you can't tell the difference between this and LFD, I'm pretty sure you're the one who needs to go to retail.
---
Can't wait man, I may not be able to raid with it but my Dwarf lady Paladin will be a PvP beast, full plate, stoneform those Rogues and Warriors,  they shall fear the light
---
The anime profile pic really says everything you need to know about this person.
---
Afaik trying to circumvent the language barrier of both factions is forbidden to avoid exactly these issues (and we'll, also insults in PvP). Blizzard never cared about the yell macros that translate properly, but they could go against groups organizing stuff with the opposing faction.
---
Blizz also said in the same post that presenting information is fine, so having it only check /LFG would be fine.
---
Yeah, they call people who disagree with them "bfa kids" while acting like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cune3w/1_for_the_classic_team/exxj7cq/).
---
Truly the language of a mature person.
---
LFG too
---
Will be fine after the first hour or two. 
---
Blizzard isn't a new company
---
Makes me happy to see they are sticking to their words at BlizzCon.
---
This add on is gateway drug.  I underastand it but i do not want it to become the "norm" Some aspects of it are nice, the highlighting of people looking for people. But that's ALL it should do. 
---
Won't really need this myself, as I'll join a group and make friends with people i randomly do stuff with and make sure they add me.
---
If you need a tank on Golemagg EU - Add Holdmyaxe :)
---
I would rather have those as collateral damage than having the offending Addons. It‚Äôs not ideal but better than having some of these intrusive Addons.
---
Those SFX were so good back then. I remember feeling complete immersion.
---
drop the BEAT
---
This has to be the single largest collective case of Christmas Eve jitters in the history of gaming
---
I'm managing to kill time with dwarf fortress and weed but it's getting pretty rough. 
---
You can only get so high and stare at tiny pixel dwarves for so long.
---
I have an sub.
---
They already broke castbars to the same level it was in vanilla. 
---
In vanilla there were enemy castbar addons but they relied of guesswork which is how they will work in classic as the same API hooks are available now as then.
---
If you like arena shooters, Warfork on steam is free with no microtransactions and it's a great arena shooter. It's been helping me pass the time with no commitment needed.
---
so no auto and talent check, which there isn't any in the github, so nothing will change without breaking every addon that uses chat
---
Yes, I am ready to report you.
---
The way that Destiny does it, then ;) . I agree, though.
---
I feel you i wanted the classic world and everything that came with it,minus the downgrade in animations and models. Woild of loved if it was classic remastered. Not gonna ruin it for me but thats just how i would have wanted it.
---
Half of classic will be warriors, I doubt you'll ever need a tank
---
Is there a class in classic wow that does not play like shit?
---
No one I know even uses that site anymore. I doubt it will interesting or accurate.
---
horde dilf.. I MEAN FILTH
---
You are hillariously naive
---
I prefer a long cooldown, but would not say no to a paid transfer.
---
and those ones haven't been updated, which i keep telling you and you're ignoring it
---
It goes against the spirit of classic and you know it, don't act dumb.
---
That's an eye? Holy shit I'm blind
---
Did you select the live version in the client?
---
i'm sorry your favorite addon was gutted. thankfully the game has inbuilt chat channels for group finding, so you're not totally out of luck.
---
And this addon is not even remotely close to LFD, but good job not knowing what you're talking about
---
Sincerely someone who has literal years worth of playtime on vanilla.
---
One of the best parts of classic is I dont have to inspect you. I can see what you are wearing from my spot on the claw on top of Orgrimmar bank.
---
Is there a class in classic wow that is not boring as fuck?
---
But you could be fire
---
Playing it? I've struggled finding groups in Vanilla, I know how it is.. I've been waiting inside a dungeon 2 hours waiting for replacement for the final boss that I really want to kill.
---
Do you think most of these people spamming #NoChanges played 15 years ago? I had to endure through many of these inconveniences that people call features now because they weren't fixed before year 2007.
---
I don't care if they add LFG feature or not, as an old vanilla players I would've liked that bit of QoL, but I can live without it.. What I hate is when people vote for features that they're not even using yet, and because of that force **changes** to the game in the name of #NoChanges.. Changing the addon API might've destroyed all group finding addons forever for classic and for TBC (and this addon already existed in TBC before Blizzard made their own for WotLK since there was demand for it for a reason).
---
&gt; no changes
---
That doesn't matter as an argument, since there are already changes across the board.
---
It‚Äôs also a poor video I‚Äôll admit.
---
Takeaway + energy drinks for the first 48 hours.
---
I think you misunderstood what they meant by "relies on other players also using the same add-on". The LFG tool relies on others using the addOn to work at all, because you can't group with other players unless they are also using the addon. Castbar addons does not require other players using the same addon in order to work.
---
don't be a fool and underestimate wands
---
Those are all great. I'd add pepperoni to the list.

Whats the point of the realm discord while im leveling? As a matter of fact, i dont see ANY use for real discords, they are cesspools
---
&gt;What is hate speech? What is negative messages?
---
If you don't know what a word means you should look it up.
---
Nobody minds or cares about multiboxers in dungeons doing everything themselves for their own gain.  It's only when people see multiboxers in public places that they resent it.  But sensible multiboxers try not to make themselves too visible and annoying because player outcries often lead to changes (cough LFG addon).  So be nice or your arrogance could be your undoing.
---
I am having trouble understanding why you'd do the same just to get back at Blizzard of LFG.   
---
I mean sure - you can tell the guy to ask properly - that's totally something I could do before accepting to run the guy through his dungeon.   
---
But why would you do that just because some people asked for the functionality ? I have no issue with saying no and explaining why, but playing with the guy for 2 minutes is just being an ass in my opinion.

the addon is totally fine guys stop complaining!
---
The "logging in to server" and "enough mobs" are to completely different things. If the number of layers is high the player density is low. The number of layers on a server has nothing to do with how long you will be in queue for the server.
---
Yes one day off per a week. I‚Äôm really addicted to overtime pay tbh haha
---
I'm a stick.
---
Yeah, the Westfall music is actually titled Shimmering Flats on the official soundtrack.
---
The bit right below about spamming invitations also deserves its own post.
---
it's highly irresponsible to stay up with no sleep. just so stupid, and if you're not still quite young it's also extremely more difficult and more detrimental.  
---
Me at 35, trying to make up for lost time when I was just too stupid and had no ideas or worthwhile pursuits in my whole youth, I cultivated a sleep efficiency routine which is DEEPLY superior to pushing your health into the garbage of sleep debt.
---
I did this using a few rest enhancing supplements. Magnesium, Reishi mushrom, lemon balm, and zinc.  
---
I can now take 2-4 hour sleep, usually at the end of the night and some times an additional one in the middle of a day to reboot my productivity focus (usually the daytime one is auto- bounded by daylight and doesn't exceed 90 minutes or 2 full cycles\~).
---
There are great apps, I've always used the one called Sleep Cycle, to help augment this process.
---
The key is consistency and good use of the day/night cycle, blue light awareness, and simple tricks like drinking water/meal at the right time relative to the rest hours you are keeping.
---
The LFG addon that existed in vanilla literally was a chat scan, it scanned the chat for players using "LFM" or "LFG" keywords and then added that text to a list with the character name, it basically did nothing else, you still had to write to that player yourself and do everything else on your own. The current iteration of the LFG addon basically automates everything about the making of a group, even tells you other players specs etc. Quite a difference, the castbar addon is pretty much the same as it was back then.

Sounds like you never were part of a community in WoW and have to rely on randoms for validation, I'm sorry :/
---
Remember nobble87 ! Good lore videos... with a somewhat thick dutch accent on top of it.
---
Same, I've got everything in order in the house, big pile of ironing to get through on Sunday night then that's the place spotless for a week hopefully so I can play and forget the world.
---
&gt; it wasn't. it automatically placed you in groups with 0 interaction required. 
---
No it didn't.
---
&gt; it could even group ONLY with other people using the addon, ending
---
And no sensible person would ever use it like that.
---
&gt;Addons can't do that.
---
Not now, but you could do that in vanilla. Where's the #nochanges spam when it comes to this?
---
I want my old addon API back so I can automate everything, #nochanges.
---
Actual truth
---
I don't think that's it. I think it's just telling the guy to go tag LFG instead after two minutes ... I mean I can understand given the poor wording on the request but come on, that's kinda being an ass.
---
Ah, ok. Thanks a bunch!
---
r/iamverysmart much?
---
Alright fair enough ! Thanks a lot for that work mate.
---
Okay then, let's make sure we get 100k people to respond to this one so it results in good data. Or you can just keep being a negative prick, that works too.
---
please view these clips before you share misinformation.
---
Classic is based on 1.12 mechanics, so yes DR will be in.
---
I hope blizzard continues to limit the automation of forming groups of the add-on as that is detrimental, but seriously there's little need for this LFG add-on and is the pure mindset of the toxicity of retail players trying to influence how classic should be played.If you don't want to communicate with players when doing group content, head back to retail as vanilla isn't for you.
---
There's simply not enough calcium in classic wow.
---
&gt;Do you even think about these little scenarios you come up with and how they would play out without an addon? Everyone single example you've used can be done in the exact same way without any addons. Wow.
---
Except, the point is, and always has been, that people don't like it. And here you are, trying to come at me with "logic and facts", despite the fact that if you've ever actually interacted with a human being before, you'd know that their opinions aren't logical. That's why the addon is unpopular. 
---
And it's a moot point anyway, Blizzard's came out and said they'll prevent it from happening. Even they seem to agree with me that the addons will cause more harm than good. 
---
Maybe you're right. Maybe there's literally nothing that this addon actually does and it has literally no effect on anyone's behavior whatsoever.
---
Now go try to convince the public of that.
---
Unfortunately I refuse to purchase hotpockets because they're owned by Nestle and Nestle can suck shit *directly* out of my ass 
---
So instead I've decided to cook mini-meals and put them in my mini fridge. Stuff like sandwiches or soup I enjoy cold (dont judge me).
---
Im a shitty NEET so I don't have much money, but the mini meal thing is actually pretty gentle with your budged.
---
Done, Done, Nope, Don't have a poster but I may print one, Need to do this, No lawn to mow, Done, Done, Done and Done

And toxic, don't forget toxic.
---
I swear, this sub is the worst I've been part of in all the years I've  been on reddit. The most elitist shitheads are here to DICTATE how everyone should behave and play? Now that is not in spirit of classic. 
---
How dare people wish to find people to play with??? We're not in 2004, you'll never have this offline online MMO you dream of that only exists in this bubble. Look at Runescape, it's classic game remade. Should blizzard limit your internet speed and make you lag and disconnect too? Some things cannot be recreated. I want to experience the content. You can say spamming trade chat all day to get 40 people was part of the experience, but it's not a positive one. I have limited time as many others, I became an adult with work and family. Does that mean I should give up all hope to experience the end game?
---
Overall, people are seriously too eager to jump from one extreme to another. If you think it's bad, don't use it. Oh you're missing out? There you go, you have your Vanilla experience.
---
If that's all you will say when trying to get into a group, don't be surprised when you get ignored lol
---
I'm taking a week off work to push 60 with my guild. With that in mind...
---
Water (LOTS) and then unsweetened iced tea for caffeine. I'm making a slow cooker chili for 7 meals for the first week. Deli sliced turkey or roast beef wrapped in a slices of swiss cheese for quick meals (little sandwiches minus the bread). I'll pre-make a bunch of baby spinach and tomato salads with bleu cheese as well. Baby carrots, hummus, and nuts for snacks.
---
 Classic team is the A team!

It's funny because i wrote this that wow can only be killed by wow

I bought a Titanwolf Gauntlet mouse, also known as Utechsmart Venus. This is a fine quality mouse for a small price (30‚Ç¨, so that'd be ~35$). Found it on Amazon.
---
Hi guys!  I am thinking of playing as Tauren Feral Druid or ench Shaman.  At 60lvl will I be able to find raid positions?  That is the only thought that keeps me back from these wonderful classes.
---
&gt; Do you have a list of what mechanics that were added in classic's lifetime will be included and when? If so, can you point me to it?
---
I was really hoping for a link.
---
The LFG addon fully automates making a group (bad). It's essentially a port of the "modern Premade Group Finder tool." This is an addon replacing something they *specifically* chose to omit.
---
If you know anything about 1.12 cast bar addons, you know they don't AT ALL replace what an in-game, Blizzard quality cast bar would do. They're clunky and rely on "[a lot of guess work](https://youtu.be/fREa-rfs8aU?t=1794)." This is an addon using limited information in a limited way they have deemed not advantageous enough to squash. 
---
They're in the game now, they were in the game then.
---
What do you mean?
---
Me!!!
---
Wish there was some sort of chat for people sitting in queue
---
Curved, Swords!
---
You have gear priority. And Thunderfury priority.
---
Bros before hoes.
---
Holy is fine for leveling and perfectly acceptable for tanking and healing dungeons. Just need a couple of sets of gear.
---
Yes. Case closed.
---
A female dwarf? I haven‚Äôt seen them in forever
---
Icic! I'm stoked to try these dungeons for the first time.
---
Im pretty sure rhe author of the addon said it wouldnt have auto invites. Anyway back in the day there wasnt discord. I looked for groups in game all the time but now im probably just gonna ask in discord

You didnt play vanilla clearly.

4 more PVP, 1 more PVE on launch
---
I'm not complaining? Lmao, I'm explaining why there's a difference between how LFG worked back then and how it was supposed to work now, saying "There was LFG addons in vanilla" is not a valid argument because they're not at all the same thing. I don't think there woulld be even close to the same riot if they were to bring back the old Call To Arms addon.
---
What streamer? That's somebody I could see myself watching at times I can't play myself
---
I believe they are releasing new servers right before launch on Monday/Tuesday (depending on your location)
---
I still play WC3 almost every day. The map Island Defense is really fun.
---
You are kinda being a debbie downer tbh. Fair enough if u dont want to partake in the survey, but jeez.
---
Retail is more like a mobile game, and already makes 80% of it's income from the cash shop sales. Whales are keeping Retail afloat. They can lose 90% of the Retail player base...but they will still make 80% of the income.
---
They won't change Retail...they will move it to mobile. All it needs is one more expansion or two with more class pruning, to make it simple enough for Mobile.
---
It is already full of mobile-like features...not to see that Retail is going mobile in 1 or 2 expansions max is to be utterly blind to reality.
---
Warrior. You'll find dungeons groups almost instantly and as long as you aren't trying to do quests with mobs your level or above the solo stuff is fine.
---
Pleb

Ha, Classic is too good to be true honestly. I've waited like 270 days for this! And it's here next week! So I'm not going to take this for granted. Hope I stick to it. Will be posting updates to this thread for sure! 
---
Current weight: 97kg
---
They also need enough people who don't mind camping the area, but the more people there are the more spread out the resources become.
---
Also Horde races have lower base INT than any Alliance race.
---
Is that for EU?
---
enjoy 4 days of queue ! :)
---
Brave comment. Can someone gild this man?
---
Honestly the solo players who will be sat in 3+ hour ques and start to notice the newer servers get to medium, they will swap.
---
A rogue with trinkets is a bitch too yes.
---
I've only played WoW very casually. Only ever got a character to max level back during Mists of Pandaria and I'm planning on playing Vanilla for the first time
---
Good idea, thanks :)
---
Kek neck still can't fry an egg on my leg tho
---
Yooouuuuu need something?
---
I am thinking about this too. Sounds good to me... just deposit all the flowers somewhere ;)
---
Would you prefer it didn't so people would raid it manually or with bots?
---
Hate speech is when someone gets annoyed by your words so much that they make him hate you. Instead of attacking your words or right click ignoring you he will call the mods to ban you. This won‚Äôt stop him from hating you.
---
Wow is infected with sjw culture and classic will be too. It spreads like a computer virus and you can‚Äôt stop it as long as people have internet.
---
Try to hide your thoughts and not express them publicly or you will be the target of hate.
---
The dev said there wouldnt be anything automated days ago, before Blizzard's answer.
---
Thanks, it was a lot of hard work
---
I like that description!
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the freezing trap work?
---
Did a +15 Shrine today. It was terrible.
---
Are you talking about Pre or Post layer merging?! Because those are quite different situations.
---
A lot of people neglected other responsibilities, I have heard too many stories of people dropping out of university when it was first released.
---
You do realize that "whisp inv for raid" was the main way guilds formed their own groups back in the day. Yes the communication of who would be in the raid  was done prior to that but the actual action of forming the group was done in a very similar fashion
---
You're dense. He wasn't complaining, he was shutting down your post because it's nonsense
---
I am rolling in the RP PvP server. Its more even in favor of alliance
---
What consequence are you talking about ?
---
Nope, changing a few characters in the source would prevent it being blacklisted.
---
*"Every"*
---
yes
---
I don't have the energy for that. Will probably just keep browsing YouTube watching vanilla raids.
---
I'm sorry you need to draw assumptions about who i am and what I think in order to make a fallacious argument.
---
But if you can't tell the difference between this addon and automatic grouping, you really wont get far in classic.
---
Slowed down so much.
---
I thought it was added late vanilla?
---
No one's congratulating you on something you haven't done.
---
Wow, next Tuesday will be my first day and looking at others, like you, who stuck with it for a decade is just wow! (NPI)  I'm in need of a pointer. What do you tell yourselves to not rush in a gym?  Classic will make it worse I can feel it.
---
1440p is a huuuge leap from 1600x900.
---
Hd4000 will easily get you 60+/vsync in classic because it uses the older models and textures, but even so you're essentially octupuling the number of pixels it has to fill
---
My for real opinion is that you should cancel your order asap and instead get a 1920x1080 monitor, or even a 1920x1200(16:10 masterrace)
---
The truth is that priest is somehow unique-ish in that playing "normally" is pretty much the optimal way of playing priest. I don't think it's a bad idea to rank up all spells as they all have their uses, wand progression are all over the internet already as for useful items I have to admit that is missing but I'm not sure it's really necessary either.
---
Also priests can play very differently based on how they intend to play the game, if you play in a group for example you can play with radically different builds and gear than if you play solo.
---
I actually did, without addons. You probably didn't play Vanilla.
---
please view these clips before you spread misinformation.
---
SpAM iNViTaTiOnS
---
Why? AH addons did exist back in vanilla. If you're too dumb to figure out how they work it's not everyone else's fault.
---
MAGA is a campaign slogan for the president so it can not be hate or negative speech. 
---
Calling someone fat is not hate speech though it's can offend because being fat is not healthy and no amount of fat acceptance can change it.
---
People think that fighting against speeches is meaningful but in reality it's probably amongst the least of our problems.
---
Conspiracy theorist me sometimes thinks that the political movements of the west are just carrots on sticks to avoid focusing on solutions to real problems which would lessen the profits of big firms.
---
What was the point in being in vent while leveling back in 2005?
---
Group forming, inviting players.
---
Any reference to the Shining deserves an upvote.
---
no idea why you're so hostile towards me
---
Mine was a guide on cooking on a fansite.
---
Which one of them grouped him up without interaction?
---
Bye, Felicia.
---
Wow that is a lot if viable specs
---
if they're a feral dps with a manual crowd pummeler, they're almost certainly a tryhard.
---
On the flip side, the MSQ gives FF14 a more cohesive feeling story while putting lore to side stuff.
---
Also had a LAN recently (July) and had similar issues. Was frustrating that the patching they've done to it has broken it so severely.
---
And Classic isn't even live yet...
---
Curious as well
---
not really, ether they break most/all addons with it and people go 3rd party to LFG automaticaly or it basically does nothing and it remains the same
---
Your comment really says everything you need to know about you too love
---
Yep, that was what I was afraid of
---
Just wishing good luck to everyone agreeing with OP and cross path with asshole elitist as little as possible. It's not as bad as it sounds, they are a minority, but they still exist. Please don't fall in that mentality.

And to the actual asshole elitists, play with others of your kind and leave other people alone. Thanks.

I'm almost positive that there was a vid of a stress test lock showing it dose proc from pet kills on this version.  I'll see if I can find it tmarrow if someone else hasn't by then.
---
Dosn't work if someone else gets the last hit tho.
---
I'm hoping Blizzard learn from the success of Classic and implement some of what they've learnt in making the new xpac. If they come up with a new xpac towards the end of Classic content that promises to stick to the spirit of vanilla I can see myself going back to it and enjoying it
---
No need to panic when we don't even know the restrictions Blizzard will place on the AddonMsgChannel API calls to combat this.
---
It may well be that the only thing they will limit, are the globals sends, e.g. by disallowing more than N messages sent with the same prefix within T seconds.
---
That would already suffice to curbstomp garbage like ClassicLFG, and leave addons like the vendor-addon, which uses targeted AddonMessages (think of an addon-addon-whisper) completely untouched.
---
What misinformation have I spread?
---
sweety..... you might need glasses if you can't see it, lol..... it's clear as day
---
That's WOTLK :D As a warlock player in WOTLK it was glorious.

The realm survey from this reddit done a couple days ago had 36k responses counted with almost 46k in total.
---
i have seen far too much malware in hacked 365 accounts this year to trust links that ask for sign in, and i am not giving a complete stranger on the internet my real name along with my hobby habits.
---
That's what you should be doing. These other people are going to be disgusting messes by day three.
---
I think it‚Äòs funny that you write ‚Äûretail players trying to influence how classic should be played‚Äú while obviously supporting the side that really does that.
---
&gt;You've completely missed why they've done this. I would probably expect most if not all the addons you listed to be available as they only display information on the UI where this LFG tool changes the way the game is intended to be played. I would expect them to break addons such as decursive and healbot too. It's worth watching the classicast with two of the lead developers on the subject to get a feel for what they deem to be acceptable.
---
They've done this because the community whined at them. Nothing more or less.
---
People seem to think banning this will make the game more social, as if banning this will stop people from instantly inviting people anyway, will stop people from putting stupid prerequisites for groups, or stop people being assholes.
---
so you didn't watch the video? it happens within a minute of the timestamp
---
Unpopular opinion, dualbox 2 priests or maybe 2 priests and a mage/hunter for farming.
---
To stagger the amount of players trickling in.
---
That's like saying because you're not lagging, nobody else should be lagging. I'm sure there were exceptions but in most cases your own rep mattered. 
---
If you're really think it never did then you either didn't go dungeons/raids, you never played back then, or your version of hardcore trolling is making a couple of jokes.
---
Back on Nagrand-Oceanic, and even during wrath when I was on Garrosh-US pre-lfg, I remember seeing it in-game and even in vent. They saw they name and you'd be an instant removal.
---
Quite a business model it would be. Then a WoW2 with Unreal 4 style graphics, and then a WC4 with even better graphics, and you can just keep recycling the different franchise one by one every few decades :D
---
Not trolling assholes down vote lol, thanks for the explanation so what's 1 &amp; 2 based on then?
---
I agree. This isn't caving to crying, this is them trying their best to stick with their original intentions as far as I'm concerned. I seem to recall somewhere in that video they say something along the lines of "just being able to not use LFG isn't enough".
---
I keep looking at my characters lol.
---
It looks kinda bad shitting on someone for being young while simultaneously acting like the most immature person in the thread...
---
Well, shit. I was hoping for a smooth launch on our baguette servers
---
My plan is to get to level 20 as quickly as possible. Should be able to leave most of the population behind once you get to level 20
---
oh yeah I'll be doing the /join world, like people did during TBC before the addons came..
---
It's just a lot of spam when I'm not looking for a group
---
So they can work all week at normal office hours.
---
30 minutes\*
---
I don't hate people who use addons, I hate people who cherry pick addons they don't like out of the game. Addons do make the game better, like the LFG addon would.
---
I understand what hate speech is but you seem to be working it out fine. Don't be offensive, if it offends someone dont spam it in trade. Its pretty simple.
---
I‚Äôm rolling on thalnos because at the time there wasn‚Äôt much choice as the others were full or was a streamer server. But I don‚Äôt regret it at all, this server is going to be home to a lot of French Canadian and I believe some from Brazil which the guilds say they all speak English. I love meeting new people so I imagine it‚Äôs going to be fun. 
---
But the server itself doesn‚Äôt tell much besides the population, it depends how the community on those realms shape it. If you decide on thalnos hit me up for a fun guild.
---
just wait for them to complain about that in a month or two
---
This isn't a court of law. Blizzard can ban whoever they want for whatever reason they see fit and there's nothing those people can do about it because they all agreed to the ToS.
---
So yeah, I expect these fuckers to get banned real quick. Even if only on a suspicion.
---
Thanks so what about 1 &amp; 2?
---
Yeah, exactly.
---
And its the section at 42:42
---
Can you enjoy the game? You tell us.
---
Will people exclude you for being human? Absolutely not.
---
Do be aware that shadow isn't very wanted into decent premade PvP though. Runs oom far too hard.
---
Just stay home. Don't go to work or school, ^(fuck) THAT **SHIT** and shirk any and all responsibilities to play your videogame that will be around for quite a while.
---
Yea but need time to go to the toilet, fill up water containers and get more energy drinks too
---
But who has in-game music on when they get to 60 and just chilling in capitals?
---
It automatically parses chat and still has autoinvite? Everything featured in that clip. How delusional are you?
---
This. I really considered going Alliance in Classic just for the music and capital cities because they are so much better than the Horde ones. I would love to hang out in Ironforge because it's easily my favorite. But ended up going Horde anyway because I've always been Horde in WoW and I really wanted to be an Orc. Might just make an Alliance character on another realm just to chill in the capitals with this amazing music. :)
---
No surprise
---
I believe enemy cast bars might not be a thing in Classic, don't exactly remember when they came and I haven't been looking much of beta footage if people had them or not.
---
The best thing they could do:
---
1. Disable global addon communication.
---
2. Disable addon posting to global channels.
---
3. Disable addon access to chat.
---
4. Treat chat window as Minimap object, something opaque that you can decorate with addon, move, etc, but you can't really access its content.
---
5. Add chat filter API. So addon can install some code snippet which can filter messages, but can't really communicate anything back to the main addon code. So chat filters will still work, but you can't parse and get any information from chat.
---
But I don't think that they'll do that. At least before 9.0. It sounds like a big subsystem rework. Definitely not for few weeks.
---
I expect some quick band-aid solution, something like InviteUnit works only for characters in your guild or in your friend list. Should be enough to calm down mob.
---
Yeah, I can't wait to look at the back of my boyfriends head for the next 2 weeks straight.
---

Not trolling never played it so what's 1 &amp; 2?
---
Go fury warrior
---
&gt;"LFM SM LIB" and someone answering "inv".
---
Not losing any meaningful social interaction at all.
---
So you want a mod to make it so you dont have to post to find groups and they dont have to respond lol. So where is the social interaction again?
---
Idk I plan on using the quest addon that shows where the quests are picked up at. Not showing you the location of where to go and how to do them though.
---
What is that human supposed to be then?
---
ill show you my stunden, you freak
---
I don't know what to tell you man, someone manually requesting to join a group is not "zero player interacting"
---
I only got to do ony and MC back in the day since I was still a kid, my parents did not like paying a subscription for a video game that kept me indoors most of the time lol but MC and ony is what made me fall in love with the game
---
It is :(
---
And here I am, just sitting by the PC and just looking at the countdown for the whole day.
---
so stoked
---
there isn't really any story based content in wow that people would forego doing because they already know the story. there are quests and dungeons, basically, which do tell their own little stories, but are both their own rewards due to experience and loot, so everyone's going to be doing them anyway (except for the odd quest here or there that might be a bit more trouble than it's worth)
---
Why do you care if people use this addon? It doesn't affect your gameplay
---
*shrugs* I'm happy with the decision they made. If you want dungeon finder you know where to go....
---
Wow, that's the best reason to play Alliance? FOR THE HORDE!!
---
Wasn't there also an option to get in the same queue through innkeepers, or was that added later on?
---
I don‚Äôt think the mafia will be a thing, blizzard probably reading this and will make Devilsaurse instant respawn in phase 2
---
Still gotta grab the need for speed
---
See you next tuesday
---
Not the one you asked, but I hate transmog with a passion so I will answer. One problem that arises with the introduction of transmog is that everyone naturally gravitates towards one style of gear, nobody wants to look like a clown. So now everyone walks around looking epic which devalues looking epic. Then you can't recognize the gear anymore, I can still tell you how someone is geared in Classic from a cursory glance, nowadays you don't know if someone is in full greens looking like a badass or he actually has gear that deserves to look awesome, because it is.
---
Now I'm not saying it shouldn't exist in retail, because retail is basically a collectors game at this point and it fits in well with the established meta there. But introducing it brought a whole host of problems that still plague the game today. 
---
Also on the cosmetic argument, what would you rather have standing in front of your house, a Ferrari that has the capabilities of just an average car or a car that has the capabilities of a Ferrari but it looks like the average car? I'm not speaking about usability here, I'm speaking about projected status, because we're talking cosmetics here.

"Mage vs Warrior, 1896, colorized"
---
I would recommend to start without addons, atleast for first 10 levels, to see what you really need or not.
---
That's more of a philosophical argument but ya having misleading info is usually worse than no info.
---
I agree with their values too, but this addon is not in opposition with them.
---
ok so at this point you're trolling then. i've posted video evidence, if that isn't enough i don't know what is lol. thankfully blizzard has a brain and gutted it. good day :)
---
You clearly didn't read the screenshot of the dev of the addon or that even before launch the new version will no longer feature the auto-invites.
---
Also if you are referring to the demonic witchcraft that replaces a click of a button with a /w inv than I weap for you and your mindset
---
What about the cannon door being a different color in Classic, huh!? You forget about that you casual!? /s
---
Even people who haven't wanted to watch it are aware of it and the popculture surrounding it.
---
Its not like zoomers are gonna go "GODFATHER? IS THAT THE NEW MARVEL MOVIE?!!" Everyone knows the Godfather.
---
It benefits Hunters more than it hurts them and it is a really overblown issue (considering the circumstances).
---
Hunter 'dead-zone' is the distance in between their melee attack distance and their ranged attack distance where they could use neither (hence, dead-zone).
---
+ 'Leeway' (in the sense that people are freaking out about nothing) takes effect when you're trying to melee and characters are moving
---
+ It essentially 'extends' the melee distance (hence, your own misconceptions about Africa)
---
+ It doesn't alter the minimum distance required for your to use your ranged weapon, or increase the distance of things like Warstomp (etc.).
---
Putting aside the specific triggering conditions for leeway
---
+ The further your opponent remains from you, the easier it is for you to hit them with your ranged attacks (because ranged has a minimum distance which isn't modified by leeway)
---
+ If your opponents have 'extendo' melee range, you do as well (because it applies equally, as long as you're actually trying to melee)
---
+ The 'deadzone' where Hunters cannot land melee or ranged attacks is thus smaller (because your ranged attack minimum is the same and your melee attack distance is increased, just like your opponents).
---
Whether you have enough 'flexibity'/keybinds/co-ordination to be able to take advantage of the leeway buff to Hunters is on you. Your attacks don't automatically switch between melee/ranged attacks.
---
If a Mage used frost-nova and then stood in your dead-zone (e.g. 6 - 7 yards, which is beyond the standard 5 yard melee and before the minimum 8 yard ranged attack) they could free-cast on you and not do jack. That's why it's a dead-zone. Leeway works by extending melee range when movement is involved (including the Hunters), so it should be obvious why the 'dead-zone' distance actually decreases (thus a buff).
---
West fall. Through all the changes to wow, I have always made it a habit to level in westfall.
---
So whats your point? 
---
So since the people who were the dominant and imperialistic also were white so the other races should get to dominate and be imperialistic now?
---
Are you really trying to hold white people today accountavle for actions of white people in the past? Pretty racist logic if you ask me.
---
Yes, i suppose there is a difference between dumb and retarded.

It's not possible to inspect someone's talents. And you can't break gear inspect, because default UI allows you to inspect gear, that would be very inconsistent.

lol depends what types of games you normally play.
---
I think Rouge, Warlock, Hunter are all fun. I found warrior, pally, anything that heals boring as fuck.
---
That said, Classic wow is grindy. There will be some boring parts for sure.
---
I just hope healbots survive tbh, I fucking love healbot
---
Lock counters mage in pvp... Just saying if you end up choosing mage and meet locks in pvp a part of you will be thinking "damn he destroyed me i shoulda picked warlock :("
---
It for sure is lol
---
Well done. I'm not making a lot of progress this morning. :)
---
Happy I could help :)
---
I don't, but I'm also very aware of the differences between this addon and a dungeon finder.
---
This is the first time I ever noticed the transparent shrub in front of the boulder in the bottom right. Thought it might be just a small bug in the Classic rebuild, but [http://i66.tinypic.com/9is2yt.jpg](nope)! Just never spent this long on the login screen to notice it haha
---
You have it entirely backwards.  If my case were the exception, it wouldn't have been the same case with both vanilla servers I played on.  People that well known were treated essentially like local celebrities because it's "hey look, we all recognize that name!"  I wish the old forums were still accessible, but it's limited.  I'm digging through the wayback machine now to see what I can still find.
---
Rule 1
---
That would have a negative impact on one of the core principals of what classic was. So no it would make the game worse.
---
i WANT to play a hunter but i am worried xD
---
The old settings are ALL it's going to be able to run. Intel HD graphics are bottom barrel. It's going to default you to the original look.
---
Je peux te sauvegarder les pseudos sur mon autre compte si tu veux, j'ai d√©j√† tous les miens :)

So I can have a guilt free launch day I am spending my time getting all the chores I have been slack about done. Also picked up some weekend OT so that helps.

i laugh hahaha the chat parser will stay :

---
From the Dev of Classiclfg:
---
"Yesterday I was in contact with the community managers and they already informed me ahead of time about their plans.
---
From what they could tell me now most likely not the whole addon will be broken, just some functionality restricted.
---
They are still discussion exactly which changes they want to do in the API, but most likely I will still be able to provide most of the functionality it does now. Once we know more about the extend of the changes I will lost another update here.
---
For now the Addon is going to work as is for the first week(s) of classic. Like I already said, on Sunday there is going to be another update with some changes !
---
Like I said my guess is that they disable the invite function of the api.
---
So probably most of the Addon is still going to work.
---
Once we get new information I will post another update on which functionality is going to be not working anymore.
---
The core functionality of chat parsing is hopefully going to stay intact."
---
So manually writing "inv for QuestXY" and then not saying anything else is different? How does the addon influence your communication while doing the content?
---
My character name feels offended
---
You as well. There are 2 of us that played in vanilla but the other 3 played later expansions. There will be lots of nostalgia talk and laughing at the ones that play retail missing all their conveniences
---
It already has more functionality than what's conform with the spirit of classic in my opinion. And yes, "invite please, i'm lvl 52 prot warri" is a social interaction. What else is it if not a social interaction?
---
A herd of walkers running out of a tomb
---
Well blizzard and alooooooot of others disagree so deal with it i guess.
---
Please go outside
---
I wanna do swords and maces bad but nilla ambush and stabby ....soooo goood.
---
It costs 7 talent points to get it. At low levels, those are better spent in the Frost tree, which is frankly far and away the best leveling spec for mages. The only real question is if you want to go aoe farm spec (w/ permafrost and imp blizzard), or if you want to do a regular single-target leveling spec (which is what I'm going to do, as I despise aoe farming, particularly on pvp servers).
---
For 7 talent points, the +6% hit, at least +0.2s off frostbolt cast, and really any of the next frost tier talents are much better than 25% wand damage (and -10 target resist). Not to mention the utility of the later frost talents, *especially* on a pvp server (you can't get xp if you're dead).
---
I used the WoW to kill the WoW
---
My character feels offended for the second time.
---
No, this isn't some slippery slope BS. THEY identified an addon which is contrary to the spirit of the original game and THEY decided to take it out. Simple as that.
---
and having a server discord just became even more profitable
---
and who is this guy ? 
---
Medivh ?
---
It was (and I believe still is for live) $25.
---
That's awesome. Too bad it will take weeks for them to break it. They know it's going to be in from day one. Why not break it asap?
---
you're correct wow devs said that in the ama: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome_to_the_rclassicwow_subreddit_ama_with_the/exi4tyq/
---
&gt;could be said for basically every other addon in the game, doesn't really work.
---
So how come Blizzard can use that argument?
---
Yeah I reckon it is because they wall want to be available for the launch.
---
Guessing it must of started in TBC. I do remember the extra agility from skinning.
---
Logitech G502 Hero, I really like it!
---
I wont be able to cope with changes that could possibly destroy the game that we've waited so long for just because people are crying.

If you're talking about this addon then I couldn't give fewer shits as i wasn't intending on using it anyway.
---
Mass hysteria!
---
Unavailable
---
Fire is also less mana efficient, which means you'll spend more time drinking.
---
missing on that list: sit in queue
---
Banish this add-on to the nether!
---
Yet you support stuff like Azeroth Auto Pilot which automates the quest-choices for you.
---
Didnt blizzard address this? I seen an asmon video and they said they do not want this in the game.
---
Not everyone who is avoiding coming back is doing so because other free time activities are supposedly superior or more acceptable. Some people are staying away because they know actual responsibilities will suffer in favor of making more free time. Acknowledging when you struggle with time management isn‚Äôt an arbitrary societal standard, it‚Äôs just being a responsible adult. To those who aren‚Äôt adults or aren‚Äôt currently burdened by much responsibility, get it! Have fun! There‚Äôs nothing wrong with playing online games, as long as it doesn‚Äôt seriously interfere with the rest of your life. 
---
I fully intent to play and build a social group in the game again. I‚Äôve missed the more socially-oriented era of MMO‚Äôs. I‚Äôll be playing an hour or two a night once the kids are in bed, but if I feel a real temptation to take time away from what matters to get more WoW time, I will not stick around. It isn‚Äôt as important as taking care of my family.

Ooo yeah I miss that org bank :)

Only two profs have prof-only perks and that's tailoring with bop robes and a tailor only bonus for the bloodvine set and engineering with engi only items. Wrath was the first expansion to have (more or less) properly balanced perks for all professions.

Additionally, before 60 ... stop carrying the healing set.  ‚ÄúHey, Druid, we need you to heal.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSorry, no gear for that.  Want me to drop party and you can look for another tank?‚Äù

also curious as well.

Guess I'll have to stick to autohotkey and macros to spam trade and global chat every 15 seconds.

Undercity is my favourite :)

I'm rolling there from Perth, 210ms with spellbatching shouldn't be a problem.

Man I'm with you. Listened to the series on audibook twice over the years. A month ago I started listening to it again. One of the greatest series ever written. Currently at Wolves of the Calla, not my favorite but still good. An Audiobook also adds so much when it's a good narrator.
---
Not much of a looker huh
---
&gt;no more than polls here on reddit at least.
---
Exactly they are both misleading and inaccurate.
---
Standing around in a main city spamming chat Vs being able to actually go and do something else? Yes there is a massive difference.
---
To be honest, the word 'mistakes' would have worked just fine.
---
It's awful. Nobody used it. And that's why most don't even realize it was added to the game.
---
you are really not fit or knowledgeable enough to make these tbh.

If you want an authentic wow classic experience that everyone faced back then, you won‚Äôt put on a single add on till about level 40-51 lol. You wanted to figure something out, you asked in general or you hit up thottbot (RIP) but you can google instead
---
I like the starting zones. Elwynn Forest and Westfall brings back some good memories.
---
Because they DGAF, that is why. If you cannot play monday evening, sucks to suck.
---
What we don't need is people with another set of values entirely brigade a game for those who wanted Vanilla, introducing and advocating for changes that are in line with the modern game, but antithetical to the "Vanilla" values
---
Go back to BFA
---
Sleep deprivation definitely affects people differently, after 48 hours i start seeing the shadow people, by day 7 i was completely insane, ready for sectioning, note this was under the influence of speed and other stimulants so maybe that has something to do with the visual and auditory hallucinations.
---
If you haven't stayed awake for long periods of time before i would edge on the side of caution, everyone is different, some people just trip out a bit but some people can actually die, so be careful. Keep yourself hydrated and eat properly.
---
Sort by controversial if you want to see the BFA kids rage at having to play Classic like Vanilla, and not BFA. 
---
Right now it's extremely telling who's going to quit Classic within the first month.
---
Lmao not once did he say he was going to set the market value.
---
He's suggesting saving up low level mats to sell to fresh 60s that don't want to go back. 
---
Reading comprehension is tough.
---
But they didn't do it until people started crying about it. The addon has been available for literally months and no one has said a word, people start crying about it and poof, gone it is.
---
Also I don't see how an addon that assist people in socializing goes against the spirit of the game, but apparently I'm alone in that view.
---
&gt; But how would it devalue epics? 
---
Epics were devalued in the sense that their looks stopped mattering after transmog collections were filled. It doesn't devalue the items stats, but it devalues the looks of special or high-end gear because you can always just wait out an expansion and then go and get it, then you look awesome all the time. It's removing the incentive to improve your gear because of looks, which was present in classic, you basically looked like a clown until you got raidgear, and arguably still then if you're following most BiS lists. 
---
Yes in Classic you (mostly) can gauge the powerlevel of gear through looks alone. When you see someone from the opposite faction in the high-end PvP gear and weapon you're probably going to turn tail if you're looking like a clown, nowadays you don't really know what the other player is actually wearing. In my opinion it's the second worst feature they've implemented without thinking about the consequence of it, the first being flying.
---
People did totally fine with the limitations then, and I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôll do totally fine with them now, also. 
---
I‚Äôd just go for it. 
---
You can always just reroll at level ~15 if you hate it.
---
Short answer: This is a "dungeon finder" tool for Classic WoW. Classic WoW did *not* have a "dungeon finder" tool.  
---
Adding one now would go against one of the main reasons behind bringing Classic WoW back in the first place: Community.  
---
Not having this addon in the game forces players to engage with each other and helps build a community. Like it did back when "Classic" was current, and is a major part of why people look back at Classic with nostalgia.
---
IMAGINE releasing a game in 2019 with graphics like this...leave it to blizz though.  
---
typical.
---
Blergh, I hate the 'play what you want' mentality; everybody knows the NE female has the facials and animations advantage, don't try to deny it. I have this spreadsheet [https://google.docs/BiS_list_mailboxes.xlsx/](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) which has all the data, you casual. If you want to minmax you better know what's right and wrong.
---
#The above comment likely contains a rick roll!
---
^(Beep boop: downvote to delete)
---
Obv answer but takes too much common sense anymore to put this reasoning together for some.
---
As a priest you will heal in high-end PvP, if you like healing, priest is probably best since it's the only horde class with friendly magic dispels.
---
&gt;The social interaction is in the dungeon.
---
Whats social about spamming a macro?
---
Interacting with the players. That's the part a group creating addon does for you. That's the bad part of the addon. I'd be fine with it if it couldn't interact with chat or players.
---
The bigger your resolution the worse fps you'll get. I would estimate that on lowest settings with 1920x1080 you'd be getting 60. Mine specs aren't much better and I ran 60fps on max settings in the stress test1
---
Or maybe, you know, people want to enjoy the game how they like it?
---
Yep pretty much, and the names reservation didn't even matter as I'll be rolling on one of the new servers
---
See you on Firemaw man :)
---
I would have prefered more detail on what they are breaking to do this. LFG addons have been on vanilla private servers for years, they are not automated though, they just grab chat messages and post your own once every minute, its up to you to invite people who whisper you back.
---
I played a warrior on a pvp realm. So charge probably the biggest one.
---
&gt; What else is it if not a social interaction?
---
For lack of a better word: business proposal.
---
Off topic, but if I were to RP I‚Äôd RP as a lazy peon. Anytime someone asks me to tank I‚Äôd tell them Me not that kind of orc.
---
That's actually really encouraging
---
I straight up don't care about BfA
---
A lot of people aren't subscribed and won't until 26th for release. 
---
I just hope I get in first
---
They have already added alot of the small quality of life stuff from retail such as raidframes, allowing you to move frames etc. You really wont need any addons if your not planning to min/max, if you dont mind reading quests I would advice you to not download questie since you miss so much of the game, going and killing those 15 boars actually makes sence if you read the quests.
---
harsh but true
---
Druids are actually pretty good at tanking dungeons. You have to have proper gear, which can be some pretty odd items to gather up.
---
this guy thinks all addons are being removed LOL
---
So you never stepped into Darnassus and witness it's glory?
---
Depends, you can always run to each other at level 1. Like Undead can take zeppeliner to Org and meet up in Razor Hill.
---
Usually it's worth doing the starting area and then meet up at lvl 6. Also there is an option to just do each starting zones and then meet in Barrens at around lvl  12.
---
Yeah, this realization hit me the other day.  Hard.
---
In their last interview (Classicast) the devs said they have servers ready, in case of high queues ect... wait and see i guess
---
Haha true. Applies to literally every Avenue of life. I'm guilty of it at times, but I usually try to get some understanding of something before I start bitching
---
 Feral is in my opinion SUPERIOR to warriors for tanking dungeons until a warrior gets geared up at end game. 
---
 Without any gear you can so easily hold AoE threat and have good mitigation. Also you can cast regrowth and rejuvenation on yourself before hard pulls. Making the healer not even have to heal quite often. Also you have CC against beasts you can open up a pull with. Sure are not that many beasts in dungeons but they do exists. It's a pleasure doing something like Wailing Caverns on a druid. Just owns.
---
IMO healing is anything but boring, especially in raiding. It can seem that way, you don't really have any interesting rotation or combos to keep the act of pressing buttons interesting, BUT, you're constantly assessing how much damage your group is taking, how much threat you have, you do a lot more thinking than the other classes if you ask me. And your ability to stabilize your group after some bad crits or somebody drops the ball separates the best from the rest. I'm not godlike by any means, but doing nothing different except player healer instead of DPS, and my group/raid wipes went way down.
---
Druids are good tanks for dungeons. I wouldnt think for a second not to invite a druid for a dungeon. I can't speak for the whole community.
---
Filthy heathens the mighty alliance will cleanse the once pure lands of this scum. We will purify the lands and by the holy light we will be victorious.
---
Classic Warlock discord has some great lists of you are a lock.
---
Maybe. It all depends on the other feral druids in the game. If there are a lot of bad feral druids on your server then probably yes. Same thing happens in retail with classes that aren't as strong. If people have bad experiences with Druid tanks they'll probably avoid them in the future.
---
Like you should, love these vanilla veteran no changes croud but they wanna speed through everything and be done next week. Yeah the real vanilla experience right there!
---
Says the "classic player wanting to play the way it was intended to be played". Okay.
---
There were several dozen people who each did over a hundred aggressive and overzealous posts in 24 hours defending this crap.
---
So either the mod author paid one of those astroturfing companies to do his advertisement and sway opinion in his favor or he did exactly that. Whatever it is, fuck em.
---
What do you mean based on? They were their own stories.
---
Seems it would be relatively trivial to add delays to some part of the process that parses lfg chat surely?
---
A vicious circle
---
if you log on at 5:55 youre not gonna play, maybe log in at like noon
---
I like how you just bundled Polish (~50m speakers globally) with all other languages within 'eastern european countries'.
---
shit its really that bad now huh
---
Thats one of the changes that lessened my enjoyment. Having to rely on other professions for components bring so much enjoyment via social interaction. Supply and demand and all that
---
you are one of those people.....
---
Druids are maybe the best in dungeons for tanking imo.
---
So... you're concerned they'll make changes... because they listened to the community say they want no changes? Your logic confuses me
---
There are plenty of other reasons to transfer. You would probably be less upset about the idea of people transferring if you weren't just assuming they were up to something nefarious.
---
Nobody would auto-invite. As for 'not even needing to leave the dungeon to find new players' we don't even do that on private servers. There'll be a global LFG channel and we can even just log an alt and look in trade. QBlizz won't touch the basic functionality either. They'll probably block the auto-invite option (which will   break popular raid management addons) and may block add-ons from being able to communicate on a global channel (which will break loads of other addons I believe) but they will not block an addon from parsing chat.
---
Even if they crazily block addons from parsing chat we'll have discord anyway. It's not 2005 any more.
---
How can a character looking around effect gameplay? 
---
No I think its fine. And there are no guarantees that the private server is right.
---
Doesnt take much for somebody to make an external website..... If the demand is there people will force it. Especially the semi-hardcore.
---
Can just restrict auto inviting to members of the same guild only for example.
---
Literally unplayable am I right guys? 
---
^^GRAB THE ^^PITCH FORKS!
---
Go find another subreddit to troll.  Nobody cares about your opinions.
---
No problem found myself in a similar predicament the other day.
---
Why would they want that ? these tools existed in vanilla ?
---
I remember needing lots of shards before raids because at the time you only got a soul-shard from a mob if you got the killing blow on it with your drain-soul. 
---
It was hard to get them in a raid with things dying so quickly.
---
I think a LFG addon is really important but as has been pointed out the classicLFG addon did more than just parse chat and make groups/auto invite.  
---
It had code in it that broadcasted your spec to other users of the addon, sort of like a weak version of gearscore.  It had a group of users who only used the addon rather than the LFG channel to create a group. 
---
It is too far and definitely goes past their "opposed to addons that create social networks that you need to use the addon to be a part of." 
---
If it was just LFG chat parsing like the older Call to Arms addon, along with triggered invites, then it would be a different story imo.  
---
The annoying thing is that very few people are making this distinction and most people are basing their outrage over how mrgm filled a group without being at his desk.  Which seems like pointless outrage to me.
---
Thanks you for your surveys it helps a lot to choose faction and server. I wish to play a faction balanced server. Greeting from France.
---
&gt;	you can always wait out an expansion
---
Will classic get more expansions though?  
---
I see how it can be considered bad in retail.  
---
But having BiS gear in classic and still looking like a clown is kind of a downer.
---
Oh mate its not about the money but my gaming room is becoming my baby room so dont have a real place anymore üòÇ
---
So when WOTLK came out we were going back in time or what?
---
So manually typing out "invite plz" is going to increase my incentive to talk to the people I wish to group with, as opposed to having the add-on type it for me?
---
You may like demon hunter on retail because it‚Äôs already mostly leveled for you, therefore not boring.
---
So many good spells at 20
---
Speaking of wowtime
---
is there an expiry date for gamecards? like if I got one when is the last moment I can use it?
---
Yea I missed the old night elf models
---
And LFG tool isn't the dungeon finder.
---
This only works if it works.  Can you imagine just saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt download‚Äù gearscore in wrath?
---
This is part of what kept me from ever even leveling horde-side. I'm looking forward to running a forsaken through silverpine, though.
---
Banning? Hmmm, look up the blue post again. Reading comprehension mate, it's your friend.
---
then i wouldn't play classic if it did came out before
---
I play fps and mmo so naga trinity is great
---
*supply
---
the dev of the addon said that they talked to the CMs beforehand and they only need to make some minor changes, but it's basically going to remain the same https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuqd1j/classiclfg_dev_speaks_up_in_regards_to_the/
---
I'm not angry, just blunt.
---
These people are idiots plain and simple, this was a chat parsing addon that missed the vast majority of functionality that LFD on retail has that ruin the whole experience but these people are too fucking stupid to look at that with any kind of critical thinking and understand the difference.
---
Are you an idiot?
---
Idk why I asked you, would an idiot know they're an idiot? Or are they too stupid to tell?
---
these are pretty cool, I like the fact that it doesnt scream I PLAY WOW all over it but someone who plays wow might understand it if they see the shirt
---
&gt; I have a feeling they'll get bored within a month or so.
---
Of all the outcomes, this is the least likely.
---
You obviously care enough to respond. Twice.
---
My friends and I are currently arguing over the choosing horde or alliance debate.  I finally said, ‚Äúyou spent the last 15 years playing alliance, but you can spend one playing horde with me‚Äù and they finally switched over :)
---
People are forgetting that layering and dynamic respawns are very much a thing. Launch is gonna be totally fine after like an hour. 
---
It's the *getting in* that's the hard bit.
---
A Druid can tank a dungeon specced resto
---
No, they listened to the community say they want changes and I'm predicting this is just the first of many.
---
The feel when launch is at midnight in EU. And I've been sick these last few days so it would be weird if I got "sick" again on tuesday. Probably only gonna sit in queue for an hour then go to bed. Go home early next day and hope the queues are better then (when everyones at work / school)
---
Is that the only response your anti-addon guys have?
---
the mental gymnastics required to frame this situation in that manner is extraordinary 8/10
---
&gt;pretty much nobody
---
Reading a full sentence is apparently difficult! ü§≠
---
Because animations completely affect the feel and aesthetic of the game. That's like saying it doesn't matter if the skybox was completely black because it doesn't technically affect any of the major game systems. Yeah that's true, but it looks like shit. People don't play WoW just for the overarching game systems.
---
Also yes there are guarantees that the "private server" is right since it's using the original 1.12.1 client and none of the game files are modified at all.
---
I guess I could run 1920x1080 on the 1440p monitor just fine, or?  
---
Sorry for the dumb questions.
---
Same, in the last one % english speakers was like 80+% on english EU Servers and now all of a sudden with v4 it's down to 20% on all of them. Seems like these surveys are just being trolled tbh.
---
These will be extremely confusing for people who read braille.
---
&gt;First of all back then we didnt know how bad LFG is for the game
---
LFG isn't bad for the game you fucking trog.
---
Cross realm grouping, instant teleportation to dungeons, nerfed mechanics for randomized groups to be able to beat the dungeon are what was bad for the game.
---
There is so much more fucking nuance to why LFG is bad that you fucking pretend dont exist in the equation and thats where it exposes how fucking dumb you really are.
---
You'll never be able to draw a "consistent" line. Neither law nor reality works this way, and the best you can really do is "we want to avoid phenomena X, therefore we will define, to the best of our abilities, a set of guidelines and rules so this phenomena is something that won't occur"
---
In actual Vanilla, you could make bots with scripted macros, and Blizz, for obvious reasons, removed this function. In hindsight, everyone probably agrees that this was for the better, but back then you could literally use the same argument that people use now in favour of the LFG addon
---
In conclusion, just because you find a loophole in the current system, doesn't mean this doesn't warrant change. If I, hypothetically am able to make a bot with the current API, you can be damn sure it's gonna get removed, and for good reason, just like this addon. Instead of thinking in technicalities, ask what this addon did; it made a system that a large majority of the games' initial support absolutely \*detests\*. Loophole or not, this could have been made into reality
---
Amazing, thank you so much for your help!!
---
My client isn't recognising anything from my Classic install - only my retail folder? Any configuration needed?
---
it is...
---
So the new purist philosophy is '#nochanges apart from changes which force people to play the game exactly as I do'?
---
You can share everything besides class/racial quests, in this case class. I still recommend getting to 10 and doing yours before either of you decide on an area to go to and meet up for questing.
---
.... wut? Seems like it's time for v5 without this pointless change.
---
It would be mega cancer
---
this is pretty impressive, I don't know if you could have made a post that made you look like more of a pedantic asshole than this one. Quite the achievement, really.
---
Dude they've modified a ton of files lol. And no youre probably apart of the 0.01% that actually cares about this. Look at the rest of the comments. You're making yourself look bad.
---
mage is probably the most solid class for beginners
---
there is not much to fuck up with compared to pet classes
---
low skill floor
---
not a healer or tank
---
not a melee which is more punishing for raid mechanics I think
---
Night Elf zones have the best music.
---
Well yes but I mean you can't really say you got to relearn a class after getting to 60. Forgetting to farm shards before a raid is just not being prepared for a raid, it's the same as not getting flasks if your officers demand you have them.
---
Blizzard will put 2k online cap after they drop layering. There won't be megaservers. Herod players will be forced to pay to transfer, that's why developers are urging players to transfer now, when it's relatively painless.
---
"Should be", but that's not how it works legally.  It depends on the EULA and whatever the company's lawyers decide.
---
I don't know why people downvoted my comment, it's accurate information even if you don't like the reality of it.
---
Why not make it easier? Why do I have to make macros to spam chat? Why do I need to make an auto hotkey script to spam every 30 seconds?
---
What's the difference between that and using thotbot or Joana's guide back in the day to tell you where to go for quests? It only affects the personal gameplay experience, if you want to read the quests and find your way around then go ahead. Addons such as LFG on the otherhand sets a precedent for everyone to be using them if it's automating the group creation process.
---
Better delete your account homie, Blizzard put down the law you pathetic worm
---
Heya,
---
It'll be my first time playing classic (leveled to max in legion once before) and I'm going into it quite raw having only watched some Asmongold and Sodappopin.
---
I can't decide what class I want to pick, currently my picks are either warrior (seems to be the highest dps but people say its quite boring to play) a rogue (also rated high in dps and people say its a fun class to play) and mage (the class I leveled in legion).
---
Also I can't decide between a pvp and a pve server, I will be playing on a mac book air 2017 for around a month or two which should run the game fine on lowest settings but not well enough to constantly get ganked while questing so idk.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Some of those are hunter prio.
---
What a fucking spaz you are...
---
&gt; frame except for the intro
---
What?
---
Side by side means to pictures next to eachother. He had them show after eachother with a transition.
---
I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs really going to depend on queue times and lag (if there is any) and possible over population in zones (hopefully layering works as good as they say).‚Äù If it‚Äôs looking bleak, I expect the servers to be pretty even as I believe most players will get frustrated waiting and go play retail for things to die down a bit. Ultimately, I think retail is going to have record low numbers. For next few months
---
A video about [Thrall](https://youtu.be/5aqd1qoB1Ls), now I want to play as an Orc Shaman. :&gt;
---
How is the quality? Ive thought about buying that one aswell?
---
Do you feel like it'll break easily?
---
Thanks for your super fast reply! This is what i needed to know + some good advise. Have a nice weekend friend!
---
IF music is even more majestic!
---
More players than entirety of Oceania lmao
---
Which has essentially the same API as the classic client.
---
Not if you're on Gandling!
---
Yeah, just do 5 seconds research on how private servers are run. I'm not going to bother educating someone this confused who refuses to listen even though I've already explained you're wrong.
---
Yup, would be entertaining as fuck though. Living the hype alongside everybody else waiting
---
People literally are going to be farming devilsaur leather on launch week, that's when there will be the least competition.
---
I haven't logged in since February.
---
thank you. it ended up working out. Turns out, there was an option to automatically refund it with no problems, didn't even actually need a ticket.
---
Traumatic memories as a priest main! Every time I hear the stealth animation, even if it's just a mob like those panthers in STV, my heart drops.
---
Glad to see that dev is fighting the good fight. Custom events as a grouping category is a wonderful addition to the game and a gateway into obscure communities.
---
Ashkandi is unironically a hunter weapon. Useless in pve for warriors.
---
I got a binding as a hunter and they found out what it is for afterwards. Needless to say i did not get the next one, and i am still salty about it, I needed that 5 agi goddamnit!
---
It‚Äôs going to depend on how good the layering is, otherwise it shouldn‚Äôt be that big of an issue at the start of endgame gathering.
---
Love it, time to school the kids.
---
Yeah, that would break a ton of addons as well
---
according to https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classiclfg-addon/263761/10?u=nukecrater-illidan it's gonna me limited at least.
---
Thing is, it won't be possible to completely disable it. The AddOns will change but they won't be completely banned whatsoever.
---
So you're taking PR statements towards investors to mean something about the direction of the company?  Essentially they're reassuring investors that losing subscribers isn't a big deal because they don't want people dumping shares.. I doubt that Blizzard now suddenly doesn't care about subscribers.  Subscribers give monthly, reliable income streams.. the kinds of things any company absolutely loves.  I don't take it to mean Blizzard wants everything to be MTX.
---
yeah but for reals go look how at how you write to a person. whats up with that? "fucking dumbass"? For having a different opinion? i dunno man. you be your blunt self. i hope you enjoy classic when it comes out, add-ons or not! :)
---
Because when people login and are in queue for 5 hours, they gonna have to make a choice lol
---
&gt; You have to have proper gear, which can be some pretty odd items to gather up.
---
Pretty much any leather gear would work.
---
i think recount has an optional threat addon. it's not with the main one, and you have to download it seperately. might be worth a try
---
&gt; Swap your movement keys to TFGH (instead of WASD).

Jeez, I thought I had long fingers, but even on my laptop I can't reach the modifier keys from there.
---
Depends how young you are.  I did 80 hours back in uni when I was 22 to finish off my final dissertation.  Did it just on red bull and water.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone over 25 but I honestly feel like when you‚Äôre younger, especially in your teens l, staying up for multiple days is no big deal.  At 30+ I would only contemplate staying up for 24 hours max and even then I would def prefer not to.
---
I really try to play alliance on vanilla, got even a rank 10 human warlock in 2006. Try again on some pservers elyseum, kronos 3 BUT i really love horde too much, my best toons belong to this faction. And above all i can't stand playing along nelfs and gnomes.
---
lmao i loved just clicking all the flames at once and pretend i was oblivious to what was about to happen. The whole group went like "Okay so, be careful, we gotta press one torch at a ti- WAIT WTF! DEAR LORD YOU SPAWNED THEM ALL!!". 
---
Then usually a massive AOE fest where the tank tries to tank em all, healer cant keep up, tank dies, everyone runs, in the end usually everyone died.
---
!remindme 13 days
---
It was meant to mock the parent post ridiculous statement as you can see it is a word for word copy of the original post. I understand the value of stat sticks unlike him.
---
Not against tos.
---
Thank you  for your answer. I dont have the source right now but ive read leeway is not active while a slow is active (or walking is turned on -&gt; slower movement, or standing in place) on any of the 2 targets fighting each other. 
---
If this is true a warrior for example has a superior range on my while i kite but i dont have any effective use of leeway the moment i stand still du shoot.
---
If you're heart lies with the Alliance (silly fool), then go there. You can always create an alt to explore Horde I'd you want. But you gotta go with your gut feeling. For The Horde!
---
In a spellcleave dungeon group you could go into arcane for imp arcane explosion and arcane meditation.
---
I got a character to level 10 so I could shitpost on the forums.
---
Yea, back in the day most people didn't know what was BiS and just went with the awesome looking raidgear. Nowadays that mostly happens in the early stages, and I can't speak for other classes but at least as a mage/warlock you're going to look somewhat clowny because most gear that's actually BiS comes from various sources that are better than early MC and even BWL gear. 
---
We don't really know what's going to happen to Classic after it's first cycle, the most likely route imo is that they're going to bring out TBC. Personally I hope they're just going to expand on Classic itself because flying made the world far too big, and even when they tried to remove it in WoD the community wouldn't let it go until they compromised to the current system.
---
Where is L70ETC?
---
Was available in 1.12.
---
OP for sure got a few of the "meh, just gonna read every second word or so...." who instantly jump on everything seemingly negative.
---
Good job OP, welcome home!
---
agreed, but frost survivability comes online later 30 or 31 and then finishes at 40. also frost comes online damage wise at lvl 33. meanwhile fire is ramping up with each talent the whole way thru. so sure, before you go to STV, re-spec into pvp talents. 
---
But the guide has separated leveling and pvp. So fire should definitely have the check and not arcane.
---
90% of the players won't be affected this.   
---
These mafia jokers are paying with time. the amount of time they will waste on controlling these spawns is very large. If we really really insist on having our devilsaur set, we can farm gold and pay their outrageous prices and still have less time wasted then them.  Or we can just find alternative gear, that is slightly worse and go for the raid upgrade. We will survive the 2% drop in efficiency.
---
Did it exist in classic? I can tell you with certainty that it did not. The entire point of this re-release is to stay dedicated to what made classic, classic. Yeah you may find manually typing out "LFG" tedius...  but it is things like that which made the game what it was. I'm not trying to gatekeep... the game was just very legitimately not for the lazy. You had to actively choose to do something... which is the entire spirit and core of the experience.
---
Aslong the addon is just a chat parser i think its fine, but the thing is that untill i see the complete released addon and it holds up to whats hes saying then i wouldnt trust his words at all..
---
Currently in his github page.. which is semi active he does have code snippset like this one
---
https://github.com/DomenikIrrgang/ClassicLFG/blob/master/src/util/classes.lua
---
That could be use to automate the "auto-invite" feature to a point where it can take 3 dps, 1 tank and 1 healer.. 
---
There is also other features i think should be removed/restricted and thats the fact that right now it can also show you groups with out you even seeing the chat message in your chat.. this falls under the line of "undermine aspects of the social dynamics" which is one of the things wow classic devs want to curb...
---
Like i said, at the start i wouldnt have any problem with this addon if it was like CallOfArms, or a pure chat parser for LFG.. but at its currently stand its heading in to automation of creating groups aswell exluding other people not using the addon by communicating with out chat.
---
Those numbers are not really good.
---
A "low" Classic server has more people on it than a "full" Vanilla server. Which was around 10k people. (We are talking about people playing on the server, not necessarily all at the same time. That's the "concurrent population cap" and is another question.)
---
A "medium" Classic server has more people on it than the largest Vanilla servers (so more than 20k). And it goes from there. A "full" server is at least 40-50k people (can be a lot more).
---
I feel my in limbo pretty much every day. It's a habit.
---
no changes baby
---
Hunter pet tank sap sap poly poly burn. 
---
Seems like it would work on most leveling dungeons.
---
Druids are by far better tanks through at least MC. And will always do more TPS and have a smoother healing profile through all content than prot warriors.
---
Except for the fact he posted it to Reddit.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be too bad. And I thought they added in layering instead of sharing.
---
&gt;Be patient with the hunter who forgot they need to buy ammo.
---
yeah, that's a realm ban type of mistake right there /s
---
It was on WoW too..
---
As long as you have trained bear form... you can tank dungeons.
---
Im social in the group, no one is being social while looking for the group.
---
Spamming "LFM" and whispering every warrior online to come tank is not social, its just spam.
---
You're literally just being a tool to this guy.  Leave the man be.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it release Tuesday?
---
It‚Äôs a quote. Whoosh.
---
That maybe the entirety of the add campaign for wow classic
---
It‚Äôs not really a huge issue, people can manage threat without a threat meter
---
Fair point. To be honest, I can't see why anyone would want to automatically invite PuGs, since it would likely end up in about as glorious success than just randomly inviting the first four people you see spamming "LFG Strat"... =P
---
Alot of things were happy accidents in Classic.
---
When did they put space squids in classic
---
&gt;and going into some discord is much more trouble than just using an in game addon
---
No, especially not if you planned on using voice chat anyway. Have you ever played Destiny 2 on PC?
---
There's a huge discord (tens of thousands of people with hundreds of channels) to find groups for EVERY single activity in the game because the official group finder sucks balls. Everyone uses it, from people who're first timing this or that to big streamers/"pros".
---
Are you sure he doesn't play? He definitely looks like the kind of guy to order 10 pizzas, roll a gnome rogue and camp low level horde whilst tea-bagging their corpse with 1 hand and eating a slice of pizza with the other.
---
It's only going to affect those who properly no life it to 60.
---
Within a week or two of servers going live, most addons will be up to speed, so it's only those that get to 50+ in that timeframe that are going to be affected.  And despite all the big talk, it's not going to be many players levelling that quickly.
---
The only files that Blizzard allows you to add/replace are UI files (addons, icon packs) and sound files (mostly used for muting annoying stuff, although you could also replace Classic sounds with newer ones.) Don't mess with models or textures, that'll get you banned.
---
Reshade works but doesn't do much because WoW already natively implements almost all the useful functions, and it's a surprisingly big performance hit for what little it does. DoF for screenshots is about all it's good for.
---
I guess people will have to play the game instead of looking at a meter
---
 You don't need a threat addon for leveling and dungeons. For raiding yes but I'm sure someone will have made a working one by then.
---
 Also unless I remember wrong using a threatmeter wasn't even possible in dungeons. For it to be working all the members in the group had to use one and most of the time people didn't, they just used it for raiding. Basing this on playing on private servers. Played vanilla back in the day but don't remember it that well.
---
Welcome to classic.
---
The best race in the entire game!
---
Back in vanilla when leveling my priest, I made a hybrid character of dps and healing, since I also played solo. It wasn‚Äôt too bad, but finding a hybrid build for pally should be easy
---
For me it's more like: 
---
7pm: Put kid to bed
---
8pm: Log on and look at queues
---
801pm: Find a low pop realm and log in there to fuck around until main realm is playable.
---
3 days later: Attempt to log into main realm finally.
---
i'll give you most of that. I take issue with "where frost heavily shines" that should be fire. frost shines at survivabilty and control. reduced CD on frost nova (fire can still use frost nova), ice block, ice barrier, increased slow, chance on hit to snare. While fire focuses in just heavy damage output.
---
What change? That they don't want the lfg addon?
---
Skada worked for me
---
Anal \[Dirge\]
---
Yes but unless you just want to do it to do I'd wait till 12 and start the barrens together. Just when it makes the most sense
---
But they use the same communication channels that ClassicLFG does, so if those were to be disabled those addons would be affected as well.
---
agreed, these people crusading around the lfg remind me of an old cat lady
---
Why are you even here? Go back to retail.
---
As far as the lighting differences you mentioned go, have you messed around with the shadow setting and such? Because that may be making a difference Classic has a lot more options and higher settings.
---
Yeah, he should stop being a douche and learn to spell and use correct grammar.
---
I never grind anything , so can't help here.
---
I just quest and dungeon and don't care about my level speed too much. As for resources, I am better in auction housing, so I just make money and buy the stuff I need.
---
Airsick lowlanders!
---
What? No. I'm talking about addon communications channels. https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage
---
As the changelog on that page shows, global addon chat channels were added in patch 6.0.2. Before that channels only existed for party, raid, guild, battleground and whisper‚Äîand of these, whisper didn't exist until 2.1.0.
---
I expect they'll be disabling the functionality to create global custom addon channels, which will limit this LFG addon quite severely.
---
I put it on classic mode (which is what it's on in this video) and ultra completely maxed and neither really made any difference at all.
---
&gt; Did it exist in classic? I can tell you with certainty that it did not
---
Did this addon specifically exist in classic? No, did similar addons exist? Yes
---
I think this is a silly metric to use TBH, should we remove DBM since that didn't exist?
---
&gt; You had to actively choose to do something... which is the entire spirit and core of the experience.
---
And this addon does not impact that at all.
---
thanks blizzard!
---
fair enough
---
We all watched the video. That's why we're making fun of you
---
Barber
---
I know right. The nerve of that guy asking for help to run a dungeon when there's a perfectly good dungeon finder tool.
---
Lmao they gonna rub your shirt?
---
You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and  believe whatever you want to believe.
---
You take the red pill, you stay in  wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
---
It was not 100g in Retail vanilla.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/NuQdpUk.gif](https://i.imgur.com/NuQdpUk.gif)
---
What's the inspect range? It will probably be fast to look up someone's armory and judge them based on that.
---
One could almost believe this, considering the amount of campaigning and ads Blizzard have done for Classic
---
using twitch emotes on reddit WeirdChamp enjoy faerlina
---
I think LFG tool makes sense to remove, But when mages start whining about how cast addons shouldn't be in PvP i draw the line. Those things literally existed in vanilla.
---
they won't break it, dev discussed it with CMs beforehand, it's going to remain the same outside of some minor changes
---
Yes! Yes! Yes! My liege? Yes!
---
Removing that alone will not fix any of the reasons people are crying about this addon, it will continue to function very well as long as it can read from chat.
---
Dude did nothing but cry about how bad retail WoW is and how hard and skillfull Vanilla was. Looking forward to see him eat all of his own bullshit when people slice through Naxx in a few hours. 
---
But the dots the dots did like 30% hp ticking damage!!
---
My blind cousin sure did, and she'd appreciate the joke I was making also
---
Amazing the things that appear to be possible when A CERTAIN COMPANY, DOES NOT force devs to make everything about profit instead of an actual good game.
---
Blizz: you absolutely ruined an awesum game into retail. Stop being stubborn bitches, admit that fact and make azeroth great again.
---
Becoming an NPC quest giver was one of my favorite things to do at 60 in vanilla. And after someone WOULD bring me 12 melted candles or whatever, i'd tell them that if they do the same thing but for the dudes with exclamation points over there head, they can get money AND gear AAANNNDD keep the vendor trash to sell. Sometimes it clicked for people, sometimes it didn't.
---
I got revitalizing scroll during .. uhh I guess it was legion. I got few levels in the wod content and didn't like it.
---
Cast bars have nothing to do with the social aspect of the game.
---
Hoolllly fuck, I think reading this just single handedly gave me cancer and stopped me from subbing to this game.
---
And I thought Siege had pretentious assholes!
---
Someone might get the impression you're chasing a fart
---
Some old nostalgia here for all you durid's out there.
---
Nice. Let's  if they keep their word.
---
Just focus on your goal. Every hit moves you towards next step. Every killed npc brings you to next level. Each level brings your final goal closer. I never needed anything else beside this self fueling hype. But music can help ofc ;-)
---
If you ever get tired just watch short part of any old wow lvl 60 video that you consider interesting and think of what of this cool stuff you going to do at 60?
---
gl&amp;hf:)
---
The Orgrimmar music plays on some bosses, [this part](https://youtu.be/DZmGIpL-DIo?t=108) plays on SM Herod for example.
---
How dare you suggest people pay attention to actual game.
---
We can't possibly survive without our precious addons to do and tell us literally everything instead of thinking for ourselves.
---
If only it were possible to see when the target had several sunders on it or if people just waited several seconds before opening up on said target. But nah, dps needs to start asap so they get those big numbers on the meter.
---
Can't believe someone took their time to make this...
---
The russians are behind the LFG Add-on. And theyre trying to hack our election thru it.
---
The look of them for the time was amazing. But entertaining cutscenes they were not.
---
He's a voice actor for some of the tauren, and apparently almost every Stormwind guard is VA'd by him.
---
When did they cave to crying I‚Äôm BFA? The game still sucks hot monkey balls.
---
We should ban the add-on and this idiot from playing classic
---
Bros before hoes
---
You and me both brother üòÅ
---
for mobile.
---
Imagine playing as dps, you attack boss and he doesn't give a **** about you. You are weak, you are not any threat to big bad angry boss. He treats you as a pesky worm. 
---
Imagine playing as tank, you not simply attack the boss, you challenge him, you exchange blows, you are the biggest threat to him. He decided to kill you first as most dangerous person from all raid. 
---
Now tell me, who you want to be? Pesky dps vermin ? Or person who actually fights the boss, takes his attacks as nothing and at the end be the first to spit on his dying corpse ? 
---
Be a tank and make history, not be a part of it. 
---
PS.1: My alt is going to be a tank :D 
---
PS.2: I'm on a horse :P
---
I'm trying to say that I'd rather watch someone who generally plays games in his free time. A gamer, you know...
---
Bear: ‚Äúsquare up punk‚Äù
---
Oh man! I hope I still have my guide! These were golden, especially the tank trying to take on a dozen murlocs!
---
I was expecting the Alliance in music tbh
---
I just installed WoW without subscribing because I'm waiting  to the first day, how do I even set it to Classic?
---
And yeah I'm not going anywhere near retail, the RPG elements are all dead there and that's the main appeal for me.
---
Strangely, there is actually a chance that things will be better this time. The team who made Vanilla had many of the same people who would go on to change the game in TBC and WotLK so you know that there was something of an issue within the team about the value of the world. This Classic team actually seems extremely mindful of maintaining integrity (layering notwithstanding) and, very likely, would be more open to adapting their plans to prevent things like this from happening than the original crew.
---
I, personally, don't really care, as I'm expecting to have some healthy list of friends and, hopefully, some like-minded guild, and there's always Server Discord which already is alive and has LFG channel. But the fact that they'll break other addons, especially RP ones, makes me sad.
---
&gt; I'd rather them raise the subscription price by a couple dollars than add a cash shop. 
---
It HAS been raised.  WE're paying them $180 a year for no patches.  That alone is a HUGE increase in revenues.
---
There is a serious health risk of playing that long without sleep and sat down. Having content makers talk like this is irresponsible.
---
Every one of the models in the new pictures are naked lol, the classic ones have hoods and armors on
---
Some say they do still exist.  
---
I remember my grandpa used to brag about having sex with one when he was with the Army outside of Aachen in '44, but most of the family secretly thought it was just a sheep with some lipstick on.
---
Not in vanilla it isn't. It's only available in capital cities. It didn't become global until patch 6.1.
---
Weakauras, Questie, Leatrix, a unit frame addon of some kind, a swing timer of some kind.
---
They left lmao
---
Where did you buy that map on the wall?
---
I think the main issue for me at least is parsing out your talent distribution, creator said it wasn't that specific just how many points in which tree..but if it can do that problematic elitist behavior is not far behinds
---
Oh man that is some tasty nightmare fuel. I love it.
---
Hunters and warlocks are among the fastest/easiest classes to level solo, So of the three you listed, assuming you're equally interested in all of them, I'd go with the rogue.
---
 But if you have any interest in playing a warrior, this is a golden opportunity for you to do that. Warrior solo leveling is *horrendous* and a shaman is the ideal leveling partner.
---
Orc
---
Collusion is bannable. It shouldnt happen
---
It is good quality. It doesn't feel cheap, rather study I'd say and I have the idea it will not break easily. I haven't had it that long so I cannot give you good feedback on that. However, I've read a ton of reviews when I bought it and I have almost exclusively seen good ones.
---
How dare you suggest people on Reddit use common sense.
---
Nah its $15 a month
---
Yeah, its poor timing. I just replayed the original and got my fix for the coming years at least.
---
Every single day. Then hover over "Enter world" and smile as I see the timer has gone down just slightly
---
They you're 100% safe to be chill, right? You will get what you want without needing to be an asshole on the internet.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
I've spent 2 days trying to get people to tell me why this addon is bad and you're literally the first person to mention this.
---
Thank you, suddenly I get it.
---
I hear that
---
You could have had the same on diablo or counterstrike
---
I'm in a similar boat. I like Druid gameplay but I dont like their itemization &amp; progression, whereas a Warrior is more limited gameplay wise but your progress is much stronger.
---
I can't recall any add-ons I used in vanilla that had that functionality tbh.  What are you worried about?
---
 So last survey had "which language are you gonna use" which as for me, a swede is always english. But in this poll, how the questions were asked, it expects me to be speaking swedish.
---
Just a big fuck you to the LFG add-on users and I love it.
---
If your class can play orc, orc is the best race.
---
OCD much ?
---
&gt;as I won't have much time to play.
---
As you don't have time to play, you do not deserve the same experience or rewards as someone who does have time to play.
---
This is a fundamental flaw in retail wow's philosophy.
---
&gt;They're not going to threaten this new cash cow they've created 
---
People have forgotten BFA so quickly now...
---
Youve probably deserved it! My stomach hates any kind of junk food otherwise I would also indulge. Cant you pooping every 10 mins when there is monsters literally swarming the world!
---
will not work if no one use it xD
---
That's incredibly misleading and constantly spouted by people who seem to only play FFXIV casually. FFXIV party finder groups are often incredibly toxic and impatient with people being kicked for an honest mistake or two. If you're doing poorly on DPS then you'll often be kicked, it's rare people will try to help you improve over just replacing you because it's so fast.  
---
If you join a group for difficult content then people will probably research your character and if your DPS isn't way above average (people can see your damage on all the content you've previously done to a degree) there's a good chance you're getting kicked too.
---
call to arms, vQueue, and GroupFinder were all a thing/addons in vanilla wow.  I don't really get why some things are done for authenticity and other things are done for the "spirit of the game" even if they directly contradict what was actually possible with vanilla addons.
---
also, LFG wasn't harmful to the game because it made a group for you.  It was a bad idea because it pulled players cross realm, so you had no way to form any connection with the players you did the dungeon with, and it just teleported you to the dungeon, which is a waste of this giant interconnected world with no load times, which is a huge part of the draw of the game in the first place.  
---
kind of worrying that people can freak out about something that was 100% already a thing that existed, and blizzard actually changes the API over it.  I dunno.
---
you don't need a threat addon when your main tank is warlock, you know they're top threat by the largest margin
---
Haha happy cake day!!
---
This is great news, thanks Blizz!
---
Bigwigs and Prat.
---
If someone tells you that, just ignore them. Btw, I never encountered such an attitude while playing on a PS as a bear druid.
---
I've had endless discussions about this and having this image to send to people who's been insulting me because I've said this addon has a negative impact on the community really made my day.
---
Just play your favorite race dude it is not going to matter that much
---

I have been using the [Wow Classic Addon Manager](https://github.com/erikabp123/ClassicAddonManager) to fantastic success. Supports Github, Curseforge, and WoW Interface. Additionally, it is very, very lightweight and not filled with ads and crap I do not care about. Bonus points for being open source.
---
Guys! WA didn‚Äôt exist in vanilla.          
---
It ruins my immersion if an old game receives quality of life improvements.           
---
Please ban every addon that isn‚Äôt a direct 1-to-1 port of some broken 15 year old shit.        
---
Thotbot was also way worse than wowhead is, can you ban this website? I don‚Äôt want any hints about how to play the game :).         
---
Modern monitors are immersion breaking, can you manually replace every display in the world with CRT monitors?           
---
Not being able to fully bot gameplay with ingame macros isn‚Äôt what vanilla was like. Come on Blizzard, give us the true vanilla experience!
---
addons are essential. anybody who tells you different is lying to themselves and/or you
---
things like bag addons, chat addons, unit frames, enemy cast bars, cc timers, maps/quest addons, swing/shoot timer, nameplate, vendorprice, raid helpers, various class specific addons, auction house, and a lot more addons that I'm not even remembering to mention are very useful at making you better and more efficient at the game
---
 For raiding yes it will be an issue but for dungeons? I played a tank on the last private server I was on and I never experienced any problem with people acting like idiots and pulling threat so often that it became an issue in dungeons. If targets are marked it will be fine. People will pull aggro here and there but unless it happens non stop you as a tank have the tools to grab it back.
---
  I guess there might be a different crowd in classic compared to private servers but it's 2019 people should know the basics of how an MMO works.
---
What garbage.
---
Fortunately people are innovative, and I expect we'll be able to create a way to do this easily even without an addon.
---
Undercity is such an underrated city
---
Why is there a paladin in the left picture? They don't even share any gear with hunters.
---
Masterrace
---
Don‚Äôt use any for a better experience
---
Holesome
---
They wrote the will change the API a few weeks after launch so it will work at launch. Maybe they check how much impact it has and which API functions they can take out without breaking a lot of other stuff.
---
There is no sane argument in favor of making it harder to assemble groups for the sake of making it tedious and time consuming.
---
Ya'll motherfuckers are objectively wrong.
---
There's no reason to pick a race based on PvE unless you're an alliance priest, just so that you know. PvE is very easy in vanilla and your race certainly won't be the reason you're doing well or poorly.
---
If you don't care about PvP at all, pick the race you'll enjoy looking at the most.
---
If you care a little bit about PvP, orc is best but undead is good too.
---
Hey weird question but I've been wondering about how the people who are completely new to wow feel about all of this and what made you choose to play classic?
---
I have a suspicion that most new players are being coerced into playing by friends and would love if you proved me wrong
---
thanks, is there a specific website that is most recommended? I am looking them up on curseforge but some comments say not everything works
---
&gt; (unless you keep track somewhere)
---
Ignore list, dude
---
thank you daddy
---
That will only last you to the character screen
---
You kick him out of the group when the last boss is about to die.
---
Now you know what to do next time.
---
Don't let the pvp hype get you down, the community is typically very friendly and general chat will point you in the right direction
---
It was useless
---
Nothing wrong with that, people will find work arounds for both just like they do in other games even if they require external tools.
---
In the form of an addon in game?
---
So how does the game indicate threat? Irl animals and humans have signs that indicate how angry they are at you and how likely to attack and a threat meter simulates that.
---
They probably promoted camel because everyone else on the team was fired.

yes and yes

Hey. I've played in Vanilla and even then I could never commit to one char, always making alts. Now I really want to dedicate to one char as I don't have as much time. I want to be able to raid but also definitely do pvp. I also really like a mix of melee, ranged and support. I am contemplating these classes:
---
Rogue: I never really played rogue much in all these years. I don't really know what to expect from them. But I really loved stealth with feral on retail and I guess it was really interactive. I don't like the idea of playing in a very squishy way tho.
---
Hunter: Really like hunter but am afraid it's a bit too easy leveling and general experience not enough depth. It is nice that it is good in pve and pvp tho. Just feel like I'm more killing something with melee. 
---
Shaman: I actually really like the concept of enhancement. I wanted to play this for vanilla for a long time. What sets me off is the low chance of getting into groups as enh, in pvp very squishy and a one-trick pony.
---
Druid: Really interested in this class to play as feral as in retail it is way more about swapping forms so I can change to whatever the situation brings which sounds super fun in pvp. So for pvp I'm down for it. But pve wise im pretty afraid that it is not gonna be very fun, lvling and pve. A bit simple rotation etc. Although for raiding a feral never exists right? I do like the idea that I can heal or tank in groups if needed. And do other support acts.
---
Can you give me a booming last shot advice? I'm desperate, ha.
---
I think we could copy paste this ENTIER comment, except for: 
---
SC2 
---
or
---
D3
---
and it would be *every bit as accurate.*
---
I hope this is satire because if it isn‚Äôt then Classic is clearly not the game for you LMAO
---
Sup mellow
---
Why is the mage holding Benediction?.. a priest exclusive staff... Thats also on its healing Version...
---
Straw-man detected.
---
True, all the content was there, but they had to re-implement a ton of stuff that was probably ripped out.
---
Talent trees are an easy example. They don't exist in the current retail client. They had to port them back into the retail client for classic.
---
I started reading the way of Kings 4 days ago. God dam does Reddit have perfect timing.
---
It looks different or slightly off
---
You'll have to raid for BiS no matter which class you play, pretty much. As for playing solo, Warlocks are actually MUCH better at that than Rogues, due to the pet. Warlocks have decent sustain in the world with Drain Life and Improved Soul Drain.
---
As for the social stuff, that's kind of beyond the scope of this thread. I'll say that Classic was so loved for its feeling of progression and the social bonds it helped forge. You're going to cheat yourself from a lot of the fun if you choose to eschew social interaction.
---
Naxx is also a long way off, and it's more of an effort than a lot of people on this sub seem to realize, so I'd be a little careful planning or reckoning much with it. It's good to have as a goal, just realize that there's a lot of slog to get through first. You're only going to get through that if you at least somewhat like your class, and have bonds to the people you're doing it with. In my opinion.
---
It will probably depend on how your provider handles routing. check the us-oceania and eu forums for how to ping their servers, and try out which is quicker.
---
OMAR OMAR OMAR

I played a game called aion for a few years. You could make a shop in that game with your character. People would leave their characters online as shops when afk or asleep. It didn't fully brutalize their auction house but it did mean looking in a lot of places for items instead of one place.
---
Sounds like me but your a hour ahead.
---
&gt; It was in vanilla
---
No, it was not, circumventing the barriers blizzard set up for *ingame* communication between the factions were against the rules, i.e. you were not allowed to make tools that could translate yell/say/emotes.
---
The TOS didn't say anything about using 3rd party tools to communicate.
---
And what about the reverse? Can a russian client access normal servers? Are there any solutions, data file changes, patches, etc
---
Anyone who is even semi-serious about PvP is going to have free-action-potions. You either kite from outside of Intercept range, or you're never kiting at all, with or without leeway, making the whole 'warrior superior range' fear redundant
---
+ If they closed into actual melee range you'd never be able to shoot them
---
+ If they want to stay at their max melee (leeway) range you have a better opportunity to shoot them
---
+ If you just run whilst they try to close distance they'll never catch you (unless they use closers like intercept) meaning leeway is irrelevant.
---
Hunter pets will have faster attack speed and will cause more spell pushback because of it. However I would say that the Fel Hunter is still the best pet overall against casters.
---
It would be groups not attacking each other except when someone not in the group shows up.
---
I believe you are then 0.1% who will find this very very wrong. I mean I would spend a maximum 1 minute at character selection screen before entering. Why would I care about it?
---
You click the healing touch button on people who don‚Äôt have full health and sometimes you press the mark of the wild button.
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted for asking a relevant question. The answer for you though is yes.
---
What was it called? And it auto invited and everything i assume.
---
We are just going to have to agree to disagree. Myself and everyone I played with never used or knew of an addon that would auto group us for dungeons. Maybe we left too early, who knows. Regardless, I sincerely believe that these "trivial" automatons are what slowly eroded what made the game good.
---
Careful now. Turns out it's toxic to expect anything more than the bare minimum.
---
Nnnnoooooo maaaaatiiiinggggg
---
And from my perspective it's the people who dont want this addon thatbare wrong
---
Yea would have been nice if it came out a few months ago to setup classic.
---
It works as a backup plan now though i guess if Classic isnt your thing.
---
Have fun! Warcraft 3 is what got me into wow originally :-)
---
No Shaman trainers in Under City.  Not aware of any at all in Eastern Kingdoms off the top of my head now that I‚Äôm thinking of it...
---
I suspect there won't be nearly that many layers by the time players are hitting 60. The biggest reason for having layers is because everybody will be in the 1-20 zones at the start (*especially* the 1-5 zones).
---
I mean bro, classic wow is nice and all but this is the game that truly made it all possible, I mean it‚Äôs a game that stood the test of time for years, still has a loyal fanbase and I can‚Äôt think of anything else but WC3 when I reminisce about my childhood. I think I am who I am today because of this game &lt;3.
---
To be fair, those are actual good hunter weapons.
---
And that's not bannable at all, nor should and will it be enough evidence. How the fuck do you think that's going to happen on a PvP server? - Obviously, people choose their fights and usually only choose fights they can win. On top of that, there's nothing wrong with having guilds, players, friends or whatever which avoid each other but will jump at any other person. That itself is not against the rules and it happens all the time on PvP servers.
---
I logged in to retail.
---
To spend retail gold on wow tokens.
---
Of course I don't mean leveling. Who the hell would pick a race based on leveling?
---
felhunter has a spell interrupter, best demon against casters (succy is best pvp overall imo since charm works on anyone). warlock pets do cause push back when they attack, but I believe some hunter pets are faster (and therefore cause more pushback).
---
It‚Äôs alright OP.
---
Anyone who claims to have a clean keyboard is either a liar or OCD beyond belief.
---
100% joking
---
Oh, that weapon has intellect on it? Hunters have mana = Hunter Weapon.
---
Spirit? Hunter Weapon.
---
Strength? Hunters have some melee abilities, obvious hunter weapon!
---
I think most of them will go tbc now
---
It would have been a great tbh.
---
I wanna know the same thing but vice versa
---
Are the jedi wrong too?
---
Yes, day 1 retail players are absolutely bfa babys.
---
Guilds were using master loot to funnel all gear to one char in multiple raids so they ended up with characters much more geared than otherwise possible. That was their reason, I have no opinion on it myself.
---
My b. Enjoy your morning and see you Monday in barrens chat!
---
From what I've read. Dagger weapon progression  depends mostly on drops from dungeons.
---
I'm not at home right now to verify, but the process on Windows 10 would go something like this:
---
1. Close all unnecessary programs and open WoW in a region you would like to test, logging on trial account.
---
2. Open task manager and check your wow.exe process ID (PID)
---
3. Open command line and use network statistics to find out WoW server IP:
---
    netstat -0 | findstr PID
---
Where PID is the number of your wow process ID, like "28503"
---
4. Ping the IP:
---
     ping 192.xxx.xxx
---
5. Compare the different pings to find out optimal region for you.
---
dO YOUR coffees actually cost less than $3,000?

Hi, /u/Qzounz
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cus5zh/classic_wow_challenge_pushups_while_you_are_on_a/). 
---
Exactly. The only thing Blizzard would worry about is the backlash from banning them. But I doubt the community will shed many tears.
---
Oh, I was done with you. You don't know anything.
---
CallToArms
---
Some of them (lights hope) are smart and have decided to shut down on the 27th or shortly after. Because they know it will just slowly burn money.
---
How ever a lot of them think they will be able to to online even after classic releases. I‚Äôm not too sure about that.
---
yes you can.
---
Probably the dungeon I have ran the least times during all the years of vanilla and pservers, competing only with RFK/RFD and Stockades
---
Only thing that could ever get me to play a private server again is if they don‚Äôt move on to TBC in about 2 years.  Seems like the logical thing to do though, so I think we‚Äôre good.
---
Because theres no gameplay.
---
No it doesn't, you misunderstood the post, RP add-ons have always existed and they in no way interfere in sociaization (in fact, improve it for those who care).
---
With the base 5% chance to resist stuns, it goes to 30%
---
You‚Äôll be able to take the quests no problem. I guess the only down side is the long trip. Also, from what I remember questing from the Orc stating location is easier/faster. Just a heads up.
---
 Going Alliance in classic after playing horde on private servers as well as on retail BC and WotLK. 
---
 The one saving grace Alliance has are dwarfs and gnomes. Elves and humans are just meh and boring. Dwarfs and gnomes the complete opposite. Looking forward to play my ugly little gnome!
---
Im not a doctor but fucking with your brain like that while its still developing sounds like a horrible idea.
---
He thinks its more interesting to have several useless abilities and being forced into a 2-button rotation for a vast majority of the game
---
iirc, Fire has to drink more because it's not as mana efficient.  By two-shotting, I assume you don't mean w/ the six-second cast Pyro, right?
---
"Classic needs to be as authentic as possible." Also "I don't want to sit in IF/Org and say &lt;Role&gt; LFG &lt;Dungeon&gt; for anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour."
---
Thanks for humoring me!
---
Pretty sure tree form is a talent. Just gives a increase to armor and healing done.
---
[https://i.imgflip.com/38rxnr.jpg](https://i.imgflip.com/38rxnr.jpg)
---
I have no idea about tanking as Enhancement, but I guess you can do it with friends. I have difficulty imagining a PuG would take you, Classic or not.
---
As for PvP, Druids do indeed make excellent flag carriers, but they typically rely a lot on wearing down opponents, which is more of an open world/dueling type deal than BGs, where others might well interfere. If you're going to focus on BGs, Shaman is probably better, but that doesn't mean Druid isn't viable or can't be fun.
---
Lastly, Horde raids will often want TONS of Shaman. One for every melee group, certainly, for Windfury. Chain Heal is also an excellent group heal in an environment where not much of that is going on. Shaman just do that whole group support thing very well, with totems and heals. Druids, on the other hand, mostly spam Healing Touch. That doesn't mean they're boring, there's still ranks and the occasional HoT to throw out. Their support is more occasional, with battle res and Innervate.
---
It's not strictly relevant to you, I suppose, but I'm playing Druid in Classic, personally. I'd play Shaman if they were available to Alliance in a heartbeat, though. No doubt.
---
Arugal, oceee
---
that pve holy priest is more for alliance side as horde has shamans doing the aoe
---
In awe of Facebook, Blizzard has a vision of the future where they make money off the social connections in their games. In pursuit of this goal they run roughshod over everything that's good about WoW.
---
Group finder has been stale after it was introduced, and was inferior to the LFG addon at the start. Guild chat over the wow app is so bad it's unusable (90 seconds to open it, wtf?) Chatting in [battle.net](https://battle.net) is awkward. The clearest example is perhaps RealID, which would help advertising revenue at the cost of community, and which Blizzard pursued with an almost religious zeal.
---
Instead of innovating in Social, they ban the competition. It's hard to see how this is a good thing for WoW.
---
Can you summarize everything the child said for me? It‚Äôs deleted now. I‚Äôm imaging a pretty big hissy fit
---
I checked the talent tree for classic in wowhead, it's not there. Afaik the earliest it appears as talent is in TBC. So I dont know why guides mention this for Classic WoW?
---
Those are guides from towards the end of classic they got tree form in patch 2.0 before tbc
---
Except it won't work in classic.  Blizzard has already stated (ironically enough in this thread) that anything that goes against the social aspect of their game is going to be "scrutinized" (read: assfucked and banned).
---
The only reason devilsaur mafia shit even remotely worked on private servers were for a few key reasons:
---
1) They were private servers being funded with player donations.  GMs and admins didn't give a fuck, and were usually ones benefitting from such cross-class collusions.
---
2) They were cross-class collusions.  In order for it to work you had to have BOTH factions in the mafia working together,  they would essentially gank opposing members of the faction that weren't in the mafia.
---
3) It ONLY worked for the 3rd main reason: 99% of private servers were PvP for \*reasons\*.  In a PvE envrionment this 100% would not work and would fall apart.
---
4) YOU DON'T NEED IT.  Sure devilsaur gear is decent, and BiS during phase 1, but that's about it.  "oh boo hoo, I  don't have my devilsaur pants" get over it, find something decently similar, and move on.  If you find that somehow a mafia is on your new classic server and they haven't been banned yet, DO NOT BUY THE LEATHER.  It's that simple.
---
But you can‚Äôt trade in wow if you aren‚Äôt online.
---
I second this and I'd mention that the soul shard farming can be rather annoying as well when playing a warlock
---
I'm so sorry to hear that. Much  sadness
---
*Overheard in battleground queues many months later*
---
‚ÄúI know what you're thinking, 'cause right now I'm thinking the same thing. Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here: Why oh why didn't I take the BLUE pill?‚Äù
---
This is really the definition of sticking your head in the sand and complaining about the taste
---
You've actually inspired me to tidy up and meal prep before I get to the point where I'd rather play classic than do anything. You got a recipe on that stew?
---
I love the horde one. Always used to listen to it.
---
So we can expect healbot?
---
But that is the bare minimum. lol
---
I enjoyed both of your comments. But I cried a little inside when I thought this could happen.
---
For the price, it was probably in iraq.
---
yeah that warrior set was some hideous shit lol
---
These are new guides I'm seeing though, preparing for the current Classic launch. I guess they're all just mistaken about the tree form?
---
mmm I never rate warrior for dps across PVE. They also are pretty rubbish in PVP without a healbot. Though with a healbot (or something to cleanse CC's), they can rip through most classes pretty well lol.
---
I would probably just advise playing rogue though. Solid pvp, solid pve dps. Not great for BG's, but those don't come out on release anyway.
---
Oh shit lmao
---
You mean you wasted 4 hours of sleep trying to figure out how photo shop works?
---
I agree, I personally think (and hope) we‚Äôll see dedicated servers for tbc and wotlk. They know now different people like playing the game in all 3 states and know where people stopped liking the game.
---
but I like addons and classic! [https://i.imgflip.com/38rxnr.jpg](https://i.imgflip.com/38rxnr.jpg)
---
uldir was a shit raid but ghuun was a good boss in a guild
---
BoD was really really fun and proberbly the best raid in a while
---
eternal palace has fun boss designs but questionable difficulty, heroic is a joke up to za'qul and the first 3 bosses of mythic are just free loot while the 4th boss is such a huge wall compared to them
---
That's almost every spec in raiding
---
Well I only use reddit on mobile so...I guess it‚Äôs just a habit. Didn‚Äôt even think about honestly. Meh deal with it.
---
Well, they're not going to break addons we've been using since the early days of wow to get rid of this, so that in and of itself is a major change to how the game plays.
---
You have 5% as any race so orc nets you the 25%
---
Ah ok. My mistake.
---
My mind is telling me try to go 24+ hours straight the first night but my now aging body might object 15 or so hours in.
---
Nothing a few *ahem* performance enhancements can‚Äôt fix.
---
You‚Äôll run into a couple of idiots along the way no matter what you do.  Play a Feral Druid if that‚Äôs what you want to do.  The majority of people aren‚Äôt going to care if you‚Äôre a bear tank for 5 mans.  They‚Äôll just be thrilled they finally found a tank.
---
Enjoy the adventure! It‚Äôs a great book.
---
We are going to run all dungeons together, as being a dagger sub - I will not compete for gear with my war/combat rogue friends and being a mainly melee group, Hemo will be a nice addition for everyone in terms of 7dps increase and good threat generation for my prot war pal. :)
---
I mean they honestly don‚Äôt even need to create a bunch of new content. Private servers are pretty good evidence people want to play their game in various older states.
---
female dwarf is actually only model you can animation cancel with. its really strong for rogues and warriors to spam crit opponent and drop them in few seconds
---
You take the blue pill, this journey ends and you wake up in the grassy fields of Northshire Abbey, and believe whatever you want to believe when female characters flirt with you in Goldshire.
---
You take the red pill, and I show you how deep your Deathknell tomb is as you awake from undeath to fight against your former masters that enslaved you.
---
Right, because only you are the one that has constructive feedback.
---
All hail u/ZqTvvn! How could we not be as cool. I am very shame. Please forgive my liege
---
I've just crossed a terrible threshold, Uther.
---
Classic devs are incredible
---
Barrens has enough xp to go from 10-33
---
A day 1 retail player wouldn't be enough of a spastic to assume that theyll change Ret and boomkin because of Reddit posts
---
Lol all solid choices really.
---
I would say this;
---
If you care about BG's when they come along, go Warlock, they are stupidly fun in BG's.
---
IF you are more interested in ganking / small world pvp skirmishes, go rogue. Rogue can bail as soon as the heat is on. Makes it so much more fun vs getting served justice as another class.
---
Honestly The wolves of the Calla and The Gunslinger is my personal favorite, and a good narrator can turn a mediocre book awesome while a mediocre narrator can turn an awesome book barely listenable.
---
My favorite narrators would be George Guidall and Frank Muller.
---
Oh boy, if someone is going to play Classic while expecting to have the same type of user friendliness as retail, they will have a bad wake up call.
---
Good on the devs for not letting themselves be pressured to change things.
---
Keep the game as it was. If someone doesn‚Äôt like it, they can play retail instead.
---
Looks like the fatty has fun
---
Worth it
---
Just used this for my friend that's playing on a different server than me. Hope he falls in reason
---
lots of druids and hunters do
---
Lol what an epic troll
---
Can't disagree more, I haven't played retail in years and I don't plan on playing it whenever a new expansion packs comes out. The game I loved died a long time ago so there's literally no reason for me to go back to retail. 
---
Obviously retail won't die because of Classic but for many, many people Classic will replace retail.
---
Also the overly dramatic stuff is just for fun, because so many of us have been waiting for this moment. Cheer up buddy, only 2 days left.
---
#ZORDON IS A MIX BETWEEN BLUE MAN GROUP AND PLANET OF THE APES!!!!!!
---
Why would I be crying? What part of "most of the functionality of the addon will still work" don't you understand?
---
I just rewatched that after years and was in tears
---
You might get above the 'special' cap as a dual wielder, you're not getting above the white-hit cap. The benefits are that (obviously) a higher % of your attacks will land.
---
Sell the iMac
---
Then you shouldn't have a problem. Unless you are really unlucky and the daggers just don't drop. But then your friends can carry you a little.
---
I always do solid black too ahaha. And I do the tall curved down horn always. Hehe
---
It's Infinity War.
---
How can I prove to you that I'm a day 1 player?
---
I can't seem to find my history on battle.net
---
Yeah I just can‚Äôt muster the strength to roll short arse Dwarf or Gnome. Night elves are awesome but have weak racials, and Humans are too boring :(
---
I quit every night before bed when I was that age, it's easy.
---

---
Classic wow is supposed to be inconvenient. It's the inconvenience of finding groups in server chat channels that forces people to make friends and join guilds. What looks like an arbitrary obstacle is actually a key component in the social experience that is vanilla wow.
---
Good Luck and Have Fun friend.
---
Would have to see the guide your referring too. But any guide talking about tree form will be the pre tbc patch which is not 1.12.
---
What part of the 0 interest did you not see? Or is it perhaps that having more than 3 points to a logical assumptions is too much for you to handle?
---
Multiboxing has never been removed from battlegrounds.
---
If someone has aggro (so you can get behind mobs) then yes, backstab is perfectly fine. That's pretty much how PvP works as well on a dagger build (you're screwed without someone distracting for you).
---
You, sir, are a gentleman.
---
I appreciate everything you wrote and agree wholeheartedly. If they aren't willing to compromise and give you space to do the things you love then it's not going to end well. Good effort ending it, because that takes courage.
---
It's hard with something like WoW when many of us (me) had a toxic, dependent relationship with the game....so to bring the game back means to raise up that which was once inside you. I value my partner because she is my mirror and shows me how I am even when I am blind to it. I hope this time around I can maintain a happy life balance and get the best of both worlds.
---
You are good people. *tips wizard hat*
---
Until they move on to BC servers and implement paid mounts, because it was "part of the BC experience".
---
I have the ssme shirt!!
---
Ranked in order of terribleness
---
1.) Sunken Temple2.) Blackrock Depths3.) Lower Blackrock Spire4.) Maraudon5.) Scholomance  
---
 The best designed dungeons in the game were Scarlet Monastery and Dire Maul.
---
I am thinking of playing as enchantment shaman but the whole reddit says that they suck a 60lvl raids.  Is this true?  Enchantment shammy was my main character since TBC.
---
How old is this iMac that it won‚Äôt run WoW? I have one from 2013, the lowest model, and even I can run it. Shit I am going to run it from a mid-2012 MacBook Pro.
---
I try to keep it fresh my dude.
---
Thats what you get for owning apple products, op. I hope you learn your lesson
---
Classic will have the Dismount at next stop feature
---
Back in my day we had to summon players via mobile horse, UP AND DOWNHILL!!!! 
---
Fucking kids have it so easy these days....
---
In my opinion it‚Äôs fine cause it‚Äôs the best war set ever.
---
Fire is efficient because you open with pyroblast, increasing your spirit based regeneration while opening on a mob. And pyroblast itself is super mana efficient.
---
You won‚Äôt last very long on that
---
We were going to roll horde, but I kept being disappointed that I couldn‚Äôt play dwarf hunter. So now we roll Alliance :D good bunch of friends.
---
How do you mutibox without follow?
---
Yup I will get wrecked
---
People are going too far with this, lol. Enjoy all the unhealthy food
---
It‚Äôs too much for me to handle
---
Thank you friend.
---
It was a lot of fun to multibox when leveling alts. 
---
I never used it much to PvP with, but helping so level a warrior with a druid/priest rolling hots to reduce downtime to zero was insanely useful!
---
Gamers are so responsible and well adjusted these days. ;)
---
One error: "grammars" is not a verb. However, you conjugated it correctly so I'll give you a bonus point.
---
Holy shit when was that REMOVED?  I dont ever remember that.
---
I'm honestly baffled this wasn't ready to go at the begging of the summer.
---
Nah, getting that 6pm release gives me more game time in the middle of a work week.
---
Hey I‚Äôve seen this one before
---
Edit: put a shirt on!
---
Logged in BfA to vendor everything I had left in the bags and banks on 14 characters.
---
Ducksworth!!!!
---
That's okay. There are plenty of people who don't care about Classic either or the other WoW expansions.
---
northdale shuts down on launch day. pservers realize the dream has become real and no need for them anymore
---
there will still be servers for autistic euroneets/russians/chinks who refuse to pay $15 a month. also tbc/wotlk pservers.
---
That is one thing I'm missing in my WoW journey, I have never been able to immerse myself into the lore or the quests themselves, I wont be doing it on my main, but perhaps there is an alt in my future that will take it a bit slower and allow me to immerse myself into the game.
---
Would that I could. It was gifted to me with the promise I wouldn't sell it.
---
There will always be those looking to play the game for free.
---
RFK may be a forgotten one. SM just ends up outshining it. BFD is one of my favorites.
---
I‚Äôve never played retail Vanilla, so I‚Äôm interested in seeing how popular Sunken Temple is.
---
It doesn't have to be hard. While it isn't the fastest leveling spec, you can absolutely use a shield and a 1h (with Windfury) for leveling. You facetank mobs, as opposed to 2h stuff where you're supposed to earthbind kite and the like.
---
Shaman definitely has a lot of tools (buttons), but for any given bit of content, you will be using a small subset of them. For leveling, probably something like Searing Totem, Lightning Shield (If gone), Flame Shock, auto attack mob to death. You set up more totems if you're going to be able to fight mobs in that area for a bit.
---
boomer confirmed
---
No, Frozen Throne happens and Arthas and Nerzhul merge to form the Lich King at the climax. Four years pass, events of Classic WoW happen, events of Burning Crusade happens, then the Lich King wakes up and Wrath of the Lich King happens.
---
Repulsive? Repulsa? Or was it really rapunzel, lol. (or reference to hair)
---
I'm going to be rocking a pala/war combo while leveling I think should make life easier
---
Diminishing returns
---
Yep, but they had the same impact on guilds.
---
BFA and Classic are so vastly different I see them as completely different games, not even related to WoW. There's nothing about retail BFA that excites me so it hasn't even crossed my mind to install it. Classic is literally the only thing I care about and retail will never be installed.
---
But what color horns go with the black skin best?
---
My wowfriends HATE Gnomer. Other than that, LBRS always seemed like the worst and least rewarding level 60 dungeon. Maraudon was so out of the way and at such an awkward level range that it never seemed worth it. Uldaman stretched over so many levels that you couldn't do it all in one run when level appropriate.
---
&gt; will be forced to pay to transfer

They've said they're willing to offer free transfers if big servers are still scuffed around the phase 2 point, I believe.
---
drinking water and eating healthy will make you feel better and therefore allow you to enjoy longer sessions of classic
---
don't fall for the junk food meme
---
It's crazy how iconic gear from vanilla is compared to basically every other expansion.
---
Yup, you can literally have epics that are downgrades for level 50-something blues in classic.
---
Not super much, i was very young at that time. But yeah im gonna grind mobs in addition to the quests in eastern kingdoms zones like arathi.
---
When I was feeling magnanimous I'd even occasionally hit mobs engaged by Horde players with Judgement of Light or Wisdom
---
I do believe (correct me if I am wrong), that the ‚Äòsuperinspect‚Äô addon caches someones gear when you are around them, so if you try to inspect them halfway around the world you have the latest saved version of their gear.  It may otherwise interact with others who have the addon to pull an inspect if someone is in range of the other player.
---
The castbar addons work the same way they did in vanilla, by parsing combat log events and using their best estimation. Blizzard already removed the API calls that tell you exactly what is being cast for classic.
---
Probably my fav armor set in vanilla if not for one thing  I always hated the legplates, thought there should be a proper pants model here
---
Your talking out your arse, go read any forum post about that video you linked they will all say exactly the same thing as I am.
---
Hes using 3rd party software which is against the ToS because mutiboxing in bgs was broken back in 2013 with the removal of follow
---
I have a hard time understanding why they wouldn't just pop in a new Discord server for this. Free unlimited text and voice chat...
---
His arteries will blot out the sun
---
If you don¬¥t want the extra social interaction classic offers, don¬¥t play it.
---
Which is all that's actually needed, it was obvious from the start, that any decent player with half a brain wouldn't have used the auto invite feature anyway.
---
...the ‚Äújourney‚Äù being AFK in Orgrimmar for two hours spamming global chat trying to get a group together? How engaging.
---
This is the part I can agree with. 60 second spams can be annoying, but 5 minute timers I could live with. Instead of trying to fully break this addon and all the other addons that use the same api's we need to find ways to live around them. They'll always exist, but we can make them classic centric.
---
With 4 people I‚Äôd get one more person and just spam dungeons. It‚Äôs been proven to be the fastest leveling method.
---
12 hours a day. It's expecting me to turn 60 in 5 months on a warrior.
---
It's expecting me to take 3 months to get to 60 if i power level the fastest way possible.
---
Kinda feels like this thing is taking information from private servers and not Classic.
---
Came in checking before I said the same thing.
---
&gt; But some people just want to suffer intentionally so I guess we'll just have to let them.
---
&gt; 
---
let them *force everyone else to suffer*, because they clearly walked up-hill-in-a-blizzard-both-ways back in the day, and anyone who doesn't do exactly what they have in mind are unacceptable.  
---
Boggles the mind, really.
---
&gt;Your pserver experience is isolated to people that can actually figure out how to access a pserver.
---
Yeah it's a fair point.
---
That's really nice, hope you have a great time
---
I love you
---
Why are you reposting this?
---
No, the only time it‚Äôs bad is if you aren‚Äôt on the same page.
---
You are in a room together, just play together don‚Äôt overthink this.
---
Success doesn't always have to be fun, and failure not always enjoyable. But I get what you are saying.
---
And I absolutely don't want to debate, especially because, from experience, the people I'd end up debatingthis topic with are not interested in good points and are stuck in a mindset that's impossible to change.
---
Sadly, so far noone replied why it's fun to tank as a warrior ("you get the best loot" isn't a good point - the moment I start playing for the loot is usually the moment i should stop playing).
---
Am I the only one who enjoys tanking?
---
Boy you're gonna shit for days
---
I love my QoL add-ons, auctioneer, bagnon, custom UI, etc, but yes, would be entertaining to see raid progression slow without DBM'ish add-ons.
---
what do you work as?
---
if you can find the gear, shadow priest is the strongest out of the three classes mentioned.
---
hunters can wreck if they have slight peel helping them (otherwise a good rogue or mage will eat you alive)
---
shamans are better elemental because mages are so common in pvp and shamans really mess them up through earthshock purge and grounding (purge and totems if used well are almost as powerful as paladin healers in pvp group setting)
---
the broken pet mechanics comments are misleading. people are expecting something that was never there in the first place. if anything pets used to be even more buggy. Ironically though hunters are great at soloing pve content, they struggle by themselves in pvp context.
---
Absolutely!
---
If they created a character to reserve their name Yes. Otherwise no, you cannot create a new char on a full server if you don't already have one on it
---
nope
---
They mentioned ui modification and giving information beyond that they will be strict. It's in the recent blue post based on the lfg addons. Also all addons like retail must be 1 to 1 click. Meaning 1 button can't do your whole rotation.
---
There was a video in the BC era i believe that played out this scenario. does anyone know what i'm talking about, it's incredibly old ofcourse.
---
Auto-invite was already on the way out. Auto-communication may be difficult, because it's needed for other addons as well. Unless they remove just the whisper channel from the api.
---
The hype is not going to grow lol. There‚Äôs gong to be a colossal drop off rate in the first few weeks. I‚Äôll be very surprised if there‚Äôs still a queue on any realm after 3 weeks.
---
I didn't know that BFD existed until WOTLK when dungeon finder put me in it.
---
I thought it was subpar to a solo hunter for example or a warr, priest
---

Crap spawn rates and drop rate plus the reduced xp makes it slower with 3+ in the group.
---
Friendship ended with Druid. Now warrior is my best friend
---
What level is it not worth using Fireball anymore if you're speccing into frost?
---
after classic releases blizzard will put more effort into shutting them down
---
Well damn. Very clever.
---
I remember you. I was also in Drama On Shattered Hand in classic for a while. I was a rogue by the name of Bakset. What server are you rolling this time arouns? Do you have plans for end game?
---
#\#UNSUBBED wow fuck blizz this shit is it
---
The hype is not going to grow. There‚Äôs going to be a colossal drop off rate in the first few weeks. I‚Äôll be very surprised if there‚Äôs still a queue on any realm after 3 weeks.
---
Hard to judge how the launch will be and what's best. If you are purely looking for xp/hour then going into RFC at level 12-13 is the way to go.
---
Do as many quests in Barrens as you can and if you lack quests then go to Silverpine forests. There's some elite quests there where 4 people is ideal.
---
That warrior just got his Ashkandi stolen.
---
Classic is gonna kill retail for sure. Come back in 6 months when classic has at least double the player base of retail.
---
&gt; except for underestimating the amount of interest
---
Quite famously, WoW devs underestimated how popular their game would be at launch.
---
‚Ä¶ soooooooo‚Ä¶
---
How hard is it to understand that the majority of this community does not want the addon? Classic forces you to be social and it is rewarding in the end. This addon prevents that. As someone said earlier, if someone sucks in a group, this addon will allow you to kick them and find a replacement quicker than teaching them. That is not how we want the community to be. Teaching someone how to play better was a small nuisance that this addon will destroy and ends up building better friendships. Finding someone new because you kicked someone sucks, and it shall remain to suck.
---
This is what the addon was basically becoming 4 days ago from the latest release and discord notes. The streamers who shared the retail version of the addon and clipped a 15 second video are the ones who started the hysteria. EVEN THOUGH the developer was well on his way to remove those features from classic.
---
We goin home bois
---
&gt; Crap spawn rates
---
Have been increased, at least they were in the beta.
---
No. They can join you and you can all enjoy the queue together
---
WoW addict. Badder than meth...
---
I don't see how it impacts relations between all players. If you don't have the addon and you whisper someone who does for invite, they will invite you just as many group leaders would without the addon. It's indistinguishable from a world in which the addon does not exist.
---
Those cute little gnomes.
---
Should be a picture of Overpower. :D Rogue dodges 1 fucking attack and WHAM!
---
Looks the opposite ....
---
Not true. That's only the case with 'locked' servers.
---
Wow, people are not upset that he is monetizing his own work. Obviously he has that right. People are upset because they were led to believe it would be free, some even donated to him through other means to show their appreciation only to have this paywall come up a week before launch. People are upset because they feel they were misled and lied to, they are not upset over 5 fucking dollars.
---
PVE: Orc, Human.
---
PVP: Orc, Gnome. 
---
Though Dwarf and Undead are both decent, just more niche. Undead can counter Locks, which can be a pain in Vanilla. Dwarfs can immune bleed, poison and disease, which are used to stop rogues from restealthing. NELF gain stealth bonus, but its really only useful in rogue vs rogue fights. Its not great.
---
Ty my friend. Was waiting for the mage one.
---
Bringing my pull up bar and weights into where my pc is, trying to work out a schedule to do exercises alongside playing. E.g. Full 5 minute body set every couple hours or levels. Still not worked It out. If I don't do this I'll find it hard to sit still for too long.
---
Watched How to Get Away with Murder and spotted Tinkaballa, took a while to place her.
---
Also the Guild Leader in Brooklyn 99.
---
LFG channel will be flooded with spam regardless of this addon. It really doesn't change as much as you think.
---
There's actually a planned out 5-man route out there, if you really care about efficiency, I recommend you look into it. Supposedly it's even faster than soloing. But honestly, just enjoy yourselves. There's no rush to hit the level cap unless you're in a hurry to hit end game. Leveling in classic is a ton of fun, enjoy the ride!
---
I start a new job next week :(
---
You can buy a pc with a graphics card able to run wow for around $200 or so. Let me know if u need help
---
Best South Park episode! It would have been great if Comedy Central aired it all day tomorrow up until launch
---
It‚Äôs not. They tested 1 to 40 dungeon leveling on the beta and it‚Äôs faster pace than Joana‚Äôs world record time.
---
Yeah that is how I remember it.  They were janky as heck since they were estimating from the combat log across the party/raid, but they did eventually exist in vanilla.  Here's an old Rag screenshot from my folder showing KTM threat meter.  It only worked for the people in the raid that had it installed (which for a guild run was everyone).  Create date is Aug 27, 2006 (Aug 27, cool!) so way before the BC pre-patch.
---

---
not really unless you‚Äôre also streaming music/video. Wow has really low bandwidth usage so 11mbps should do fine.
---
The entire think was a joke from the beginning. The developer already removed private channels 4 days ago and confirmed auto-invites were on the way out via discord. Streamers created hysteria for nothing other than views.
---
There was cast bar and aura addons in classic.
---
I've been playing with the same guild for 12 years. People come and go and come back again, but the guild lives on. I met my fiance and my best friend in it. As much as I might like to play a paladin, I can't imagine ditching them.
---
Based on this sub, I'm not confident, but let's hope.
---
I‚Äôve been scammed
---
Follow is only disabeld in combat so you can follow until combat then one shot then move on
---
some will shut down, some will move to tbc
---
some will survive a bit longer because no bg's till p3.... ZING
---
You probably want to login 2hrs early :p
---
Fun &gt; Rest
---
So if you are having more fun playing with 4 people, just do so!
---
Arggh a cast of narrators is the bane of my audiobook experience, but I agree with you and I can definitely see how Wizard and Glass is a favorite (I'm a nerd and also have a neckless with a raven skull, my lookout).
---
Yay :D
---
You can beat it into submission and sedate it, but no matter how much you train it, it's always gonna be a wild animal.
---
Been playing since launch, vanilla the whole time, mage is my main.  Wanding "may" have favorable dps comparison pre-level 10 but after that you are literally saving no time, you want to stack SPI for regen instead of Int for mana pool and crit then be my guest.
---
so funny this guy is australian. ACA is such a dogshit show.
---
hello ladies and gentlemen of the youtube, this is boogie 2988 coming at you through the power of the internet
---
I think its the same. Blizzards isnt going to like you changing game files. And also no patch afaik
---
Well, "summer 2019" technically ends on September 23rd if we talk Astronomical seasons
---
Druids are a particularly good example here. How do you weight a level 29  and a level 40 item that is bis all game?
---
Do you weight them high and have groups only invite Druids in P1 because they have by far the highest gearscore out of every class, or do you weight them low, and Druids wont get invited because they have by far the lowest gearscore in the Naxx patch?
---
wait for sunder
---
I can't remember where I read it, but /follow will not work. It's removed in the current engine (base code) that Classic runs on now.
---
Gives your chill effects a chance to freeze the target in place.   Get that talent.   And don‚Äôt get improved blizzard.    There‚Äôs your guide

and gnomer god damn do u get lost in these if u dont have 1 dude to shepherd all  us idiots
---
Or....it's Vael and you have to juggle 3 tanks and multiple DPS threat simultaneously.
---
I mean, yeah threat meters aren't huge on most fights,bI would say there are some fights where it is the main problem though
---
loot sux
---
I'm going to beat 80% of yall to 60 with this strat. Dont even know my add ons or hotkeys yet.
---
That sounds really fun and like good RP. Nothing wrong with that imo.
---
Alright, thanks for this answer, you put it very clear and logical.
---
My next question would be does Holy and Shadow require me to get two different sets of gear and change them as I change the spec? :)
---
Yes, but good gear can be had through PvP as well, though the higher tier stuff takes dedication. If you find an organized guild, most can progress raids and Blackrock Spire with some success and a lot of fun. Casual guilds can still raid for about 10-15 hours over the course of a week with some of the time usually spent helping others guildies, making money, farming materials for potions, etc. Whatever time you can spare, you can contribute, and many guilds do not mind that.
---
Yes, so it currently doesn‚Äôt exist in that form, making OP correct and you a d-bag.
---
I made 5 pounds of beef jerky.
---
Find a guild that raids on weekends.
---
No one knows about servers but I will say that not everyone has made a character yet so I'd think at first it'll go up.
---
Layering is an entire instance of the world, like azeroth 2 server or azeroth 3 server that should only stay for a short period while people spread out to reduce  load on the servers. It really won't effect gameplay unless your friend Invites you and is on another layer.
---
I too am going enchanting tailor so my suggestion is to make and sell wands and bags as you level because you will be lacking alot of gold for your level 40 mount and Disenchanting greens instead of selling them.
---
wut
---
I don't RP, but I've played on RP servers. It's usually charming to stumble across people role playing in the wild. They don't try to involve you generally, and it adds to the immersion more than the looped NPC interactions.
---
I already am a human IRL, why would I log on to play one? Lok'tar.
---
Is that a joke? Every streamer and their friends got beta.
---
*ahem* - robes, not dress. The only dress wearers round these parts are those dirty pallies!!
---
It didn't exist in that form before Blizzard either. Making OP wrong.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons
---
I‚Äôm worried about what will happen when streamers eventually quit classic, I assume most of faerlina is there for the streamers so when they leave most of the pop might and the server will be left pretty desolate.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ
---
I'll consider this! :)
---
Yeah you can play the game at your own place, most people who are rushing are only doing so because they played the original vanilla and took their time then and now want to expierence the parts of the game they missed (hardcore raids etc) but you can do plenty as a casual and thats how most of the community will be playing.
---
Have fun man!
---
No I'm not at all, just got me thinking that's all! :)
---
I noticed because I was stealing it for myself :p
---
What made you use the term 'kid' about a person you have no prior knowledge about?
---
Alliance Pill me fam.
---
Downvote for poor title grammer.
---
everything you said + now ppl will be busy/content with WoW already when it comes out. 
---
really terrible move by blizzard. also feel a bit scammed with how early we could prepurchase. bought it for my brothers bday for him LAST YEAR.
---
Thank god.
---
Hahaha this is so good
---
IMO scratch that curiosity itch with an alt on a different server.  If something feels like "home".... then by all means, go home man.
---
Maybe stick to retail, guy.
---
Which dungeons take 3 hours and what is the 6 hour dungeon?
---
Yeah, its like people forget that original Healbot literally playing the game for you and macros that support if/when and targeting functionality with actual logic didn't exist.
---
Just that I understand it right: Banning Addons that dont exactly follow the strict line of what the devs wanted addons to be was a thing in Vanilla?
---
I never knew that this was such a issue back then, but you want those restricrions now to recreate the experience so I guess Blizzard banning addons here and there was a thing they did.
---
I always thought making such restrictions was more a thing of BC and beyond WoW and ppl were like #nochanges all the time, but I might be wrong, never was a addon dev.
---
(Im not pro or contra this topic, but it seems all kinda double standards to me)
---
That's totally fine to camp spawns as a guild. What's not fine is colluding with the other faction to keep out anyone not in the mafia from being there.
---
But if your cocky ass guild wants to hold some spawns and alliance can't kick you out, oh well.
---
these are amazeballs, Combat Dagger please!
---
BiS - Gushers + Uncrustables
---
All players have a base chance of 5%, add hardiness and it's 30%.  
---
Rogues are a bane for rogues, resisting 30% of their stuns is insane.
---
Yeah, lol. "Level 15 is so easy! This game is garbage."
---
Nice. I will have fun. I hope you do too
---
Pretty sure Blizzard's entire staff is human as well, which is just wrong imo
---
Hi, completely new player here.  
---
I know i will get shit on but i got interested in wow because of hearthstone.   
---
I started a few years ago playing hearthstone, then i started reading books about the wow universe but i never got into the actual game because you had to pay a monthly fee.  
---
Now i have a job, so i can afford the game and i decided to give it a shot.
---
My classes start monday.. and ofcourse classic does too. Coming out summer btw.
---
I have three kids. I can barely figure out which server, faction, and class I want, so my list is much the same.
---
I'm sure we will see some videos of it once people are 60 :) think I've seen discussion on it in some discords as well!
---
That kid is a unit for his age group. Jeez. Pacific islander obviously. Boys are stout.
---
Pink ranger Kreygasm
---
Why do you think layering is a thing? This conversation was well and truly had months ago.
---
Me and my hubby are the same. Apparently I‚Äôm too bossy!!!
---
why i keep seeing this same comment
---
I would say twitch app for addons, pretty easy to use
---
Classic Threat Meter
---
[https://github.com/EsreverWoW/ClassicThreatMeter](https://github.com/EsreverWoW/ClassicThreatMeter)
---
Hopefully all the way to Kara. Whether that'd be TBC or Classic+
---
Pretty much the urge of progressing as fast as I can or moving forward at the speed I've become accustomed to, not a good argument I know, but it's mine.
---
Stunlock build? If you're not stunned against a rogue he's probably doing it wrong. Rogues are basically the essence of stun
---
Orb of deception style! 
---
That's what I had in the beginning :)
---
please provide a link.
---
Cursed_shaman.jpg
---
I'm just happy a kid like you gets to experience vanilla.
---
I like that !
---
I like the default gui, but I'll still be getting at least a swing timer.
---
Good stuff!  
---
Most of my macros tend to be quite close to the character limit due to multiple modifiers and conditionals.  If I setup a few separate macros with the run script you use is there is a short macro button click command or similar I could add at the end of my ability macro to call/click one of yours for the emotes?
---
I used to use an add-on during Wrath that allowed one to setup multiple chat blurbs, emotes and sounds for different abilities along with setting the proc chance for these events.  I can't recall the name of the add-on but it was great once setup, especially on RP servers. IIRC it stopped getting updated from Cata onwards.  
---
Not to burden you with additional extra work but if you were willing and able to package your script functionality into an add-on I'm sure it would price popular!  I know I'm anticipating using all available macro slots across my planned characters for abilities and wouldn't have extra macro slots available for your scripts.
---
Thanks for posting them though! I'll be giving them a bash early on when leveling while I'll still have the macro slots available.
---
It's not on top. Both Classic and retail are included in your sub.
---
Asmongold won‚Äôt quit Classic and he‚Äôs the most impactful streamer by large.
---
It should be fine.
---
I plan to use a few, namely bagnon and maybe a swing timer but I guess if I want to raid it will be required to have a threat meter minimum.
---
talking about twitter my m8
---
Sorry mate not me. I need a basic ui addon to at least move it around and a click-cast addon i have used Luna in the past as it would do both but will have to wait till release to see what‚Äôs out there. Things like titan bar and ktm I‚Äôll be using aswell. (Healing does create threat)
---
Oh right, I did love getting those rewards for quests :D
---
What the frick?
---
Worldwide simultaneous release.
---
Alliance has more beautiful cities and outposts.  Horde really only has 1 pretty city (TB).  If I had not played horde first, I wouldnt like any of their zones except mulgore probably.  Undercity is ugly, Org is ugly... everything is orc construction which is kinda cool looking but not easy on the eyes.  Tauren buildings are really nice, I like them .... but there's a lot more orc/undead stuff out there.
---
Yes, first battle won, on to the rest of the war
---
It could but worse case if it does they just make you change it. You o ly get banned usually if you start spouting racial slurs and act like adolf.
---
I'm 30, I've never seen it, I know the reference.
---
It's the quests and convenience that make stockades good.
---
I‚Äôll be extremely surprised if you make it past level 10.
---
Huh, funny ducks.
---
Someone will report it. People are petty like that.
---
nut ;)
---
ok, that's what I thought, so I guess I'm safe.
---
Funny enough. I'm going to be using ClassicLFG, because I want something to organize all of the LFG spam.
---
He will have those female mages create/summon water so fast, us normal mortals won't have a chance...
---
Since everyone else is logging out their main character in a favorite location, I decided I'd do the same and log my original character in a location I remember best.  
---
Seems angrier than usual.
---
Removing auto-invite just means that the addon will make a macro for you and ask to press it.
---
The pressure... I still don‚Äôt know if I want to play male or female night elf hunter .. or maybe go troll hunter what I played back during vanilla / TBC
---
Is this still a thing lol
---
Nah, east coast us with that time to log on
---
Shadowmeld, the NE racial that requires you be out of combat to be used in classic... Did you mean fade?
---
I plan on playing without addons for the first week or two, mainly because I don't want to get buggy addons that haven't sorted out their kinks, and I want to stick to addons that are mostly mainstream. 
---
Take Questie, for example. It's a decent addon for quests and a good improvement over having nothing. But it's also a bug-ridden and cluttered mess and doesn't even come close to the brilliance of QuestHelper. I'd rather just wait for Questie to get its shit together or for QuestHelper to return (or a third, better alternative) than play with that thing.
---
They implement layering for that.
---
I'm a Hunter main and in no way shape or form will I be needing Hand of Justice. No idea why Hunters even want that. They are never going to be in melee range for a raid unless they got Nightfall or some shit.
---
This image was on the inside of the fold out on the original vanilla box will all the CDs.
---
great thanks for the help!
---
Dont know where this idea comes from, I leveled a priest in under 2 months back then. I did have help from a friend who did it before me, in all fairness.
---
I ran WOD on a $250 ASUS laptop I bought in 2014.  It was gawd awful in raids but did just fine out in the world for the most part.  Classic, although it runs on the modern 8.2 client - is a lot less resource intensive.  
---
I now play on a similarly cheap laptop that I bought last year.  It takes about 10 minutes to load retail up from the time I click on the blizzard launcher to the time I'm in-game in Zul'Dazar.  On this exact same computer, when loading the classic stress test, It only took maybe 4 minutes to load up and get in game.  It is MUCH faster and smoother in classic - even though it runs on the same client.
---
It has yet to be seen how 40 man raid performance will be - but If I was in your situation I'd at least try it out.  If there's something you can't do - like run groups or PvP, just change your habits.  Sometimes it's fun just to run around and gather.
---
They have not told us.numbers for the servers but medium pop today would be high pop in 2004. You have to remember that not everyone has reserved a name and there will be a big wave of new toons on Monday/Tuesday. There will also be a crash of people who don't like classic and will quit fast.
---
So layering from my understanding is that let's say you have a server will 10,000 people on it. Those 10,000 people will be spread out between 6 starting areas that's way to many people in each area so once about 100 people are in a zone a new layer will be created for more people. (These are not real numbers I'm just trying to give an example) once those 10,000 people have spread out from the starting zones they will reduce the amount of layers from 100 people to 200, to 400 etc. A layer is a copy of the entire world so when you move from zone to zone you will be in the same layer. Layers are not cross realm like retail is with sharding.
---
Your professions will be fine as mage. Enchanting is a huge money maker if you get those rare enchants and tailoring will be big in the early game for those resistance cloaks. Don't forget about first aid, fishing and cooking. Not as important for a mage since you make your own food, but still some money to be made there.
---
Sorry for the poorly structure answers hope I helped
---
Honestly this list might just help me a shit ton
---
Ive reserved Nagapls... Some people might report it, but hopefully it wont be removed. I like it :(
---
I‚Äôve thought about this too. Since before they were offing something blizzard weren‚Äôt there was kinda an argument for it. How ever now they are basically directly taking revenue from blizzard.
---
Did I win? ;)
---
They tanked the launch sales of it by waiting.
---
FFXIV is the ultimate casual game with automatic duty finder and a party finder that works like the lfg addon. 
---
Yet people make friends everyday in this game, both inside the server and outside the server. 
---
It is the nature of the game that makes you socialize, not the grouping tools available.
---
i figured he meant the next morning, cause maybe then you'll stand a chance.
---
I feel like if I do this it‚Äôll be the opposite outcome.
---
Thanks for arguing on the players' behalf! It's worth it.
---
Bad guides. Tree form was the 41 point talent brought out in tbc
---
Trackpad*
---
I mean I understand that people are like that, but the real question is if Blizzard accepts those reports or overturn them
---
you are a brave man posting asmon on this sub, the official streamer hate sub. Im praying for your karma
---
Not every class has a sleep/charm/fear as well. Stuns are more ubiquitous. Especially since it helps a lot dealing with rogues. Horde also has to face paladins and their 5 second hammer of justice. Tidal charm trinkets will also be very sought after and resilience will help against that.
---
Wotf mostly helps in the mirror (fear/charm) but against other WLs  you are on an even playing field anways and it is better to chose a race that helps cover your weakness.
---
Additionally, the warlock insignia already breaks fears/charms and polymorphs but doesn't break stuns. 
---
Stuns are a big weakness of WLs and Orcs really help with that.
---
Every other rogue will be missing their CS or kidney on you which will help you out a lot.
---
Most horde WLs who plan to get more into PvP choose WL actually.
---
A whole new meaning to Peter Tingle
---
No one would translate leader of the wind to windfuhrer lol. Andy any glorification of him is very stupid and evil
---
Rip. I want to be on a low population server. I hope he doesn't end up on my server with his viewers. At the very least I hope they all roll alliance.
---
I mean if it said Dwarven music I'd have chosen something else
---
That's literally not a problem. Discord, guild, etc. is about making a community. No addon is going to auto invite people into discord, then auto invite them into your party via discord after filtering by class, role etc.
---
You have to talk to people on discord to do it.
---
r/classicwow wants to know your location!
---
Holy shit this really is a fucking cult. You elitist purist retards will kill the game faster than any fucking addon.
---
Still not sure I believe the people that didn't fall for the shit they pulled with the reservations 3 weeks before launch just to get extra money are still waiting till it's about to go live or atleast by the 25th.
---
Still supports them, which you shouldn't
---
You need to get prepped for a colonoscopy because you're going to need one after that garbage goes into your body.
---
Yea. I was getting confused and wondered if my memory was playing tricks on me once these guides mentioned tree form for classic wow. As mentioned the 2.0 pre-patch did have it, but technically that was TBC already.
---
Calls him kid, behaves like one himself.  Classic. No, you are the baby! No, you are the baby! No, you! Love it, kepp on the trolling.
---
Firemaw went high pop yesterday.
---
As a Mage I would level tailoring with your cloth and make bags. Then you can disenchant stuff and level that while still being hopefully being able to afford a mount at 40.
---
look up Nobbel87 on youtube, he makes a shit ton of videos about WoW lore. I'm not sure how much specifically classic stuff there is, but it's worth a shot
---
That's fair. :)
---
Stay salty. I posted facts you posted a spongebob video. Can you quote a blue post saying the LFG addons will all be abolished?
---
Please don't advertise shit like G2A
---
I'm just happy you get to experience vanilla too kid.
---
Is this a MeMe?
---
WeirdChamp
---
It is not botting, you still have to manually perform the trade and talk with the customer to agree on prices etc.
---
Like maybe look up the addon and how it works before making assumptions lol
---
Maybe I misunderstood your comment, it sounded like you were saying there was nothing wrong with using 'could of'.
---
Say I won‚Äôt
---
This will be my second time playing vanilla on launch day.
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôll finally get to experience it outside of a private server, you‚Äôll find people are less d-baggy, but that might be a detracting feature for you.
---
It's not a simple "reskin". They are modelling everything from the ground up, add new CGI and cutscenes and also remake the structure of most known singeplayer-maps.  
---
It's much more than just a cheap 4k upscale remaster.
---
Laintime streams on twitch he plays retail
---
So I suppose you have more insight on the development plans than the dev, hm?
---
I think he and a few might stay there for a while but the population will probably plummet quite a lot but the other servers should stabilize at a good amount of players for the next few months atleast.
---
Still enough time to play through War 3 RoC campaign for a refresher course
---
Edit your comments above to reflect this/ you admitting it so you stop spreading misinformation please
---
&gt; Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an **additional 25%**
---
For single target I would recommend deep fire scorch spec
---
I'll probably need to finally get one as a warlock.  I hear they have threat issues and I know early tanks are gonna have it hard.
---
i‚Äôll see you there.
---
damn those wind nazis and their fuhrer
---
Minutes and seconds.
---
BFA wasn't vanilla kid.
---
Perhaps youre reich, but just say nein to these people.
---
MORTAL STRIKE!
---
My guess would the xD
---
Unless it‚Äôs wpvp because they just kill you in the stun opener and if you survive they gouge/blind or vanish and do it again.
---
i guess this would be a benefit to know on the spot who to attack and who to not attack, cant you do this with power aura's or sth just add a star next to specific enemy player names when you encounter them or sth. i know there are addons that show enemy gankers.   
---
but this would help at the first 2-3 weeks, after that i bet the "security" teams would know the players that they wont be attacking by the name alone. blizzard should take measures if opponent faction guilds cooperate.
---
No. Discord is - at the end of the day - only an additional chat channel and voice chat addon. We had stuff like Ventrilo, ICQ, TeamSpeak and xfire back in the day. All of those offered either VoIP/Voice Chat or instant messaging.
---
Discord is just a more convenient and well designed version of that. We could already tab out and communicate cross-faction over ICQ or sit in another guild's TeamSpeak.
---
If this addon was only another chat channel and replaced trade chat, that would be fine. If it was only an instant messenger, it'd be great. But the addon creators are already talking about involving stuff like "gear scores" and "dungeon clears" in the interface. That is a functionality none of those programs had.
---
We've had instant messengers for nearly two decades now.
---
Alexandros Mograine is the Ashbringer. A paladin that found a dark crystal in the second war, believed it could be purified, and went on to find a way to o make it into a sword of holy justice that he used against undead. It was so powerful that there was nothing but Ash at the end of the fight, hence the name ashbringer.
---
There's a comic series about it and everything. Look up Ashbringer comics! Highly recommended
---
We don't want people to not form communities. This does it automatically and had room for filtering by talent etc. Just go look at the addon code.
---
why not actually just play on a low pop server? if people did that they wouldn't be low pop anymore and we could have all med/high servers instead of only having servers at the two bad ends of the spectrum.
---
Then people would just make a macro or copy-paste the LFG-text and spam it every few seconds. Wouldn't change it for the better imho :/
---
Highly transferable skill set, makes sense!

---
The good thing about warlocks is that they have no real de-aggro, so if your dots ramp too hard you just die and wipe threat that way.
---
Curseword
---
I mostly focused on tanking and wasn't pushing content as a hardcore raider.  Both 2hand and dual wield deal acceptable damage in raids from everything I saw so at that point it will be your personal preference about which rotation you like better, (and which weapons drop for you).  The Arcanite reaper is a craftable 2 hand axe that has exceptional damage pre raids.
---
Best of luck and happy hunting.
---
You‚Äôre not very smart, are you?

I have no idea, because I am not an RP player.  
---
The above statements are not based on RP experience, but on my experience with the WoW API.
---
See my hands? They on fire you can't stop me.
---
Yeah more people are subbing every day, but both Blizzard and the Classic community expect a massive drop off in the first couple of weeks because a lot of people will lose interest in the game very quickly. They just want to see what the hype is about but they have no interesting in leveling for multiple months.
---
It ages same as Dwarven's Goat milk.
---
Yeh but its also a unique experience
---
Nice 10/10
---
 f√ºhrer is kinda 100% associated with Hitler all around the globe. Everyone is gonna think you are Windhitler basically.
---
I'm predicting people will report you, Because they can.
---
&gt;Hearthstones dev communication unfortunately died with Ben Brode 
---
Man, that could not be more wrong.  Donais is right up there with Papa Jeff.  He's active on Reddit, he streams in twitch and answers design questions, and the game gets frequent blue posts that explain developer intent.
---
Ben Brode is an awesome larger than life guy, but hearthstone under Donais is undoubtedly better off.  Since Brode left we've had more updates, better balance, more frequent balance, more events and more sales.
---
Any pet class which can taunt is an issue if the tank isn't prepared. At the very least I remember how to tank in vanilla with tsunder / taunt / shield. Unfortuantely with a lot of new players there is going to be people who easily forget attacking the off tank mob will quickly result in threat loss for the tank.
---
Soooo... Badly?
---
If enough people report it, then Blizz will make you change it. One or two? Probably not. I had a name back in Wrath for a twink that was testicle related and I got reported enough to change the name.
---
The most important of the ideals.
---
Well this aged well :)
---
Please no. If you want the QoL it already exists IN THE REAL GAME RIGHT NOW.
---
Why do you want to even play Classic then? Just go play the game that has these QoLs built int for you! FFS.
---
Why are you trying to bring your "QoL" into Classic?
---
Gaming doesn't use a lot of bandwitdth. Your main concern is ping times. As u/zauru193 stated, you should be fine unless everyone is streaming or downloading large files.
---
My undead just keeps sleeping in his coffin I guess.
---
I thought monkeyquest was only a tracker and not a legit database with minimap / map icons etc.
---
How is that glorification of him? I honestly couldn't care less about him. I just like the word in reference to windfury.
---
It's okay kid. Classic is coming out soon!
---
A man of culture I see.
---
Most people wont even understand the reference. And imo, in the grand scheme of things, there will be thousands of names more tasteless than that. I give your name a 3/10 on the tasteless scale.
---
I will remember those who have been forgotten.
---
Actually Light's Hope is shutting down today. I guess they want to give the players one day off of WoW to regenerate or something :D
---
We are talking about an rp server here. The addon would be used by a  couple of people at least which would then lead to AH prices being higher due to a part of the supply being offered by backyard vendors
---
Thank you for your service
---
At what level can you do this quest/ where is it?
---
Yes, we only want to kill the demonblood-infused, blood-thirsty, genocidal invaders from another world because we don't understand them. Poor babies are just misunderstood.
---
Kim Kardashian edition
---
There will be people who have never played the game or haven't played in how many years and never played hunter. Get over yourself, mistakes will be made.
---
I went one step further.
---
Shift-Del the folder. No uninstall. No backups. Was a very cathartic way to break up.
---
This addon auto invites people based on role and talents. It's literally modern LFG. No talking involved.
---
Nothing about being "analog".
---
I've said it before, but if they agd but as much effort into WoD as they did MoP, WoD could've been the best expansion to ever be released.
---
I am in the same situation. I had a short trial during the end of classic, and then started playing around the end of BC (was level 62 when wotlk launched), so I never got to experience Vanilla. Watching videos by Punkrat, MadSeasonShow, WillE and Asmongold got me super hyped up for the game, since it has the MOST content in the game, which you don't experience in the expansions.
---
I am totally expecting them to roll on Skeram and Incendius if there is a queue longer than 30 minutes.
---
I don't at present have the time to mess around with dominos, especially get this specific look with the XP bar and gryphons.
---
&gt;it‚Äôs different when the addon color is blue, yellow, or green, no?   
---
Then I say no, and address the core issue. Replace raider.io with gearscore and my point doesn‚Äôt change and it still has nothing to do with cross realm, scaling difficulty, or timers.  
---
It‚Äôs about an addon changing the landscape of how groups are formed in vanilla. It changes the experience, and even if you don‚Äôt use it, it will still affect people if it becomes the social norm, JUST LIKE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST.
---
it would be cool if they finished the vanilla zones that were meant to be in the game. like Hyjal and Grim Batol. or spin off the game with new content branching from wow classic. there was alot of unused content like Emerald Dream as well.
---
New icons: Sitting at least topless in a dark caf√©, brooding, having perfectly coiffed hair.
---
Old icons: Just woke up in their armor in camp, staring at the one across, "I'M GONNA FUCK YOU UP!", except the Dwarf who doesn't care, and the creepy-ass Gnome.
---
Yea I pre-ordered it months ago, but as i'll be playing Classic I probably won't touch Reforged for a bit after it comes out :(
---
I upvoted you, because he talks about moving servers. I feel like that needs to be discussed. I'm not a streamer hater, but his followers can destroy the chat channels. I'm all for Blizzard giving the major streamers priority access into a server if it keeps them on one.
---
Damn I dont think I ever upvoted a post that fast before.
---
Probably because we're all older than 20 and understand how biology works. We don't eat like we're 13 anymore.
---
But it was part if classic
---
Niger is the name of a country and isnt allowed. So much so that when i was playing heroes of the storm (had the game in english not sure if that matters), before i turned the profanity filter off not only couldnt you say the name of a real country (i didnt try no, i was not trying to bypass the filter),but i couldnt say the german word for "less" which is "weniger" without it getting censored.
---
Could you link the strip you bought? I was looking at getting a strip from walmart also.
---
People are like eww gross disgusting you need fruits and veggies...looks like any other person I‚Äôve checked out at my job üôÑüôÑ practice what you preach or don‚Äôt bother preaching it. Honestly this was probably a weeks worth of groceries for his family and he just posted it...I mean he‚Äôs got Hydrogen Peroxide ü§î
---
Pok√©mon... you‚Äôll have to wait this time, old friend.
---
You may have the numbers but we are fighting for our home
---
Blizzard banned for collusion? I made a bunch of friends A-side back on Darkspear during tbc through the forums. We had Merciless Midgets who would camp the bridge in STV and if you were horde and didn't pay the horde character or alliance and didn't pay MM the toll, you'd get camped. 
---
We all hung out in vent and chatted on msn messenger. I had no idea that teaming up with the other faction was against the TOS
---
I would always heal my fellow horde player no matter what .... HORDE motto "FUK a Fair Fight, For the HORDE"
---
It takes like 5 minutes, the point is you just have to figure it out because it won‚Äôt be what it looks like when you launch with dominos but that it is achievable, but if you want to pay someone because you can‚Äôt figure it out I‚Äôm not going to stop you.
---
Just please. Go buy an apple, or a cantelope and cut it up to snack on. 
---
Please, for your health
---
imagine french pvp, everyone trying to surrender first
---
New slogan. Hungry for battle.
---
That's true, but the Twitch viewers/culture seems to think that you're a Boomer if you dont like their platform and maymays.
---
I have no doubt that there is a natural difference of interest between the generations.
---
devilsaur gauntlets level 53
---
Well done!
---
Most quest helpers show all available quests on your map so you shouldn‚Äôt miss out on any quests. But you‚Äôll still have to grind mobs at certain points. Even leveling guides have you grind mobs at one point or another.
---
I don't trust Blizzard to keep the great visuals which D2 has - the atmosphere is second to none.
---
 I'm already not too big a fan of WC3:R. I can't place my finger on what's exactly the problem, it just looks really weird, like characters are made out of playdough.. but they're realistic, too?
---
I‚Äôm a full time working adult who is friends with countless other full time working adults. Most of us are depressed! You can do it my guy
---
&gt; That kinda proves the point though. Basically any class can "tank" if you already have gear gold and some pro players to let you meme. But shaman and rogues aren't real tanks and it's not going to really work on a fresh server.
---
I've been at this for 4years, so I am quite familiar with the limitations. It takes 2-3 weeks after world first has been claimed on a boss for rogues tanks to tank. It takes progressively more time after that, which depends on the player/guilds experience.
---
Well as long as the auto-invite and auto-communication function is disabled, I don't mind. I personally won't be touching the addon either way.
---
They should have released it on a Friday ...... Or a Saturday. ... Why MONDAY
---
More likely they they never played vanilla
---
Barber Shop
---
They still have only 24 hours in a day.
---
Well in case a GM messages you tell them it's a normal word without any relation to Hitler other than that he had this 'title'.
---
Nobody would get banned for being named something with 'Leader' in their name.
---
Taking out social features of the game has been the primary complaint against retail for people who wanted Vanilla again. This addon does exactly that.
---
So you net the 25. Thanks.
---
pretty sure majority of the world knows fuhrer means leader in german which they might know bcuz of hitler history but doesn‚Äôt change the fact a word is a word.
---
The difference is that everyone can see what is written in a chanel but the addon kind of forces other people to use it
---
I plan to level to 60 without ad ons. Might pick up a DPS meter and agro meter when I try to start raiding but that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve always hated add ons in WoW. One of the reasons I find it so hard to watch on twitch is because I can never recognize anything on the screen cause they have 50+ add ons lol.
---
So what
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBCvGiGIYQ
---
White attacks actually account for the highest portion of your DPS. It's why hit is still a decent stat to get in general. But when you're getting hit up to 9% it affects 100% of your damage output. Hit is not a bad stat after 9%. There is usually gear that just has better stats. I think at one point in Vanilla I had 12% hit just because my gear ended up there.
---
True
---
The opposite it gives you rested bonus.
---
Great concept and well executed. 
---
Sadly I'm not able to overlook the misalignment of the CDs. Even though it's just millimeters :D
---
Incendius was the one I was going to pick... Guess I may have to pick another one. That queue time is definitely going to be longer than 30 minutes on their server. I feel like Blizzard should give them priority access to a server so they stay on one.
---
Hi, /u/Beastlyyyyy
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cusuib/twinks/). 
---
But auto-invite is the whole reason why people got worked up over this addon in the first place. Even though the dev said before the whole debacle that this feature won't be included once Classic launches.
---
Fam delet this
---
An addon can't make a macro for u
---
Serious question, is the Warcraft movie not an accurate account of the lore before Classic? I'm a vanilla vet but never paid attention to lore. Seeing the movie and then the vanilla cinematic seemed like they fit.
---
1 copper has been deposited to your account
---
I was thinking the same... you can tell where he got his addon inspiration from, considering that so many weebs play retail WoW.
---
I love all of you haha
---
Jeeez, that thing looks small. I hope that's the s size. 
---
Typical gaming companies, always selling trash to goodboys like meself. 
---
Also, were's the holder for me goodboy tendies?
---
Shed a tear
---
Screw this.  I‚Äôm ready for the full classic experience of having my mother be insulted and called various racial insults because I accidentally pull the wrong group of mobs first in SM
---
Yeah #nochanges people are hypocrites when it comes to addons.
---
Fine, you don't want this API? Give us the classic one back, where you could do a lot more game play related changes. Imagine a heal addon for which you have to press a single button. It chooses the best spell and target, it never overheals. And with time it could analyze the bosses and even predict incoming damage. That would be a real classic experience.
---
And then the complains would start that this type of addon didn't exist back then. Point is they could have (and some basic versions existed iirc) and you can't simply undo the experience of the last 10+ years. Now we do know all the Bis-items, including that lvl27 blue weapon from gnomeregan for ferals. Now we do know all boss mechanics. Now we already know our online friends and I'd argue this alone will make this classic a very different experience.
---
Multiboxers in PvP are free kills. They're so easy to distrupt and pick apart.
---
The cirque du soleil will be wanting to hire me if I successfully juggle classic wow, uni, and my gf at the same time.
---
Please dont. Fanart chokes all other content out, it kills subreddits.
---
Lol calm down bud. I'm not even playing on that server.
---
I've had to replace it twice for pet reasons but each time it was so cheap. I had thought of maybe getting a different one but the price is hard to beat for such a good mouse.
---
I got Staff of Jordan and I just about sharted with excitement
---
Yeaaaah, the first time I heard of this guy I just had a feeling I wouldn't like him.  Just another shit player from retail trying to act like they were one of the OGs of Classic...really weird tbh.
---
And don't even get me started on the hypocritical hippopotamus that is Esfand.
---
Alliance, so they both lose.
---
no, they originally didn‚Äôt do anything...just a place to meet. eventually they became grouping up tools but that was 1.12 patch or somewhere along there.
---
The other guy touched on it a bit, but playing that many hours per week you will never run out of things to do.  It will take you at least 6 months to just hit max level.  I wish I could be you and go back and experience it for the first time.
---
100% agree with you. I want addons like this banned one way or another but nothing he/she did was wrong.
---
I count three polygons.
---
War/Priest or War/Druid is better.
---
You will be fighting over gear as a War/Paladin.
---
So guys we did it
---
On the behave of every other multiboxer - sorry for the ignorence and attitude of this guy. He does not represent the majority of us.
---
I'd rather just know when to pull back than count on dying all the time...
---
I make a pretty good warlock.
---
I almost downvoted
---
Yeah, I never understood this. Why do people think that because they‚Äôre at a healthy-range weight (not overweight or obese) they can just shovel garbage into their body? Shitty food gives detriments to the body beyond composition, ya dumbasses.
---
Super, super cool, but at first I had a hard time differentiating between the selected and non-selected talents. Wondering if A. Would it benefit from removing the non-selected talents all together? Or B. Would it help if the non-selected talents were a darker grey?
---
Both said, maybe it looks closer on my phone than your computer and you don‚Äôt see it as an issue.
---
The result of banning this add-on is that players will go to third party websites and discords to create groups. The LFG channel on most servers is going to be 100% unusable due to the number of players.
---
So instead of an add-on making this work in game, transparently where it's a benefit both for players who use it and those who don't, it instead pushes the community out of the game to a place where people who know what's up easily find groups and play with better players, while those who don't languish and never get to make any connections at all.
---
I think there's a group of people here who are short-sighted, but I don't think it's the people.defending an add-on that existed in Classic.
---
lmao was that a real npc?
---
Boys we did it, classicLFG is no more
---
We're WoW players, dude. We got no stones to throw, here.

---
Hopefully if they go with that plan they. Spin off the servers so those that wanna stay in Vanilla can stay in Vanilla and those that wanna move on can (either migrating their character or cloning it).
---
Good on them then if they have the money to waste on this just for the meme

Depends if you‚Äôre talking about pve or pvp

How would this trouble present message? No signal coming through to the monitor at all?

Is it shutting down today?

And we can order one how?
---
Wow, mind your language young boy.

There's literally a spec parser function built into the addon.

Hopefully...Hopefully...
---
You get banned.

Fuck yeah, Blizzard! Thank you so much.

love it when people say literal, and it based on personal opinion haha... now get off my d
---
Playing Classic IS living dude. We live in a time where a 15 year old MMO offers more social interactions than I can get from home. That's one of the biggest reasons that we're all playing, right?
---
That retarted horse was in Wrath so when the game evolves into the trilogy it might happen in Wrath.
---
Keep your armchair psychology to yourself.
---
Because of their ignorance. They just think that ClassicLFG relyes on a specific API function which isn't used anywhere else.
---
It‚Äôs true lol. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs dying &amp; blizzard is bringing back classic.
---
You'll have to delete the toon to change the appearance. Just do it early morning or late night and do it quickly. Or just stick with what you have.
---
Then don't play... Why are you trying to break the game?
---
Yes their shutting down tonight!
---
It is known
---
probably older then u
---
But that would mean that the whole argument was pointless. You can't say that here. :P
---
Best for what? I assume you mean pure damage output, since you chose Trolls as the best horde class. If that's the case, then it's a matter of:  
---
Trolls: Berserking (10% to 30% attack speed "trinket" (usually 10%)) &amp; +5 Bow skill.  
---
Night Elf: 3 more agility at level 60 than a Troll Hunter  
---
It's very clearly Troll if we're talking damage output.
---
this set is amazing even if i have never played paladin and i ve Always played horde
---
Good. Hopefully the changes to the addon API disables any further malicious addons that could pop up over time.
---
Probably hunter. Warlocks have a ton of spells but they really don‚Äôt use them all in their rotation.
---
No, you really are. Now fuck off.
---
what the fuck is wrong with your YT profile pic?
---
For me it was deadmines. I thought the elites that were outside of the dungeon *was* the dungeons. I couldn‚Äôt believe that after all that we didn‚Äôt even start yet.
---
I expect Firemaw will change to Full status before/at release.

Dude, wrong group of nerds.

I always wanted the corrupted ashbringer :( hoping to eventually get the chance in classic
---
I think the biggest issue is the addiction. I have a hard time imagining any age before they are an adult to really let them play without restriction. It seems like a dick move since I loved it so much at 17 but I also know how addicting it was.
---
And if everyone is using quest helper addons and levelling 10 times faster than in Vanilla, doesn't it affect YOUR gameplay when you are behind in levelling and getting ganked? Doesn't it affect your gameplay when you are the last in your guild to 60, and so miss out on a raid spot? All because they are using optimal XP routes given to them by addons and you aren't? The existence of those addons ABSOLUTELY affects other people's gameplay experience. You want to control the mooncloth market? Better have a levelling addon to get there before the other tryhards. 
---
Saying getting to 60 before other players "only affects the personal gameplay experience" is flat wrong.
---
Sounds like you're a BFA player who's upset they're being called bfa babies
---
While also defending a really REALLY poor addon that even the devs agree shouldn't be in the game. 
---
Yes, it is easy to make straw men out of people you disagree with, so your personal opinion of "fucking laughable" is nothing but that, personal. Damn.
---
By deleting him yeah, but I don‚Äôt wanna risk it!
---
If I recall correctly it was """journalists"""/social media people trying to get a "good" shot relating to some sort of protest or so that was otherwise not worth reporting. They were just scrambling to get *anything* remotely worth posting.
---
How is Fuhrer even remotely a pun to Frost? You clearly missed the point :(
---
You should aswell add more revealant words such as the name of the last raid, bosses or BfA items, etc.
---
Literally none types "battle for azeroth" to get raid / class guides.
---
hows it funny... its not even a funny occasion.. it has potential to ruin something for him, and in itself not funny...
---
If u dont like his videos just stay off his youtube channel... are u a goofy or sum?
---
No vegetables were harmed during the production of this.
---
It's only like 1 server they'll do this on.
---
A favorite of mine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Bs6-XwiPs
---
A simple chat parser will exist actually, or something of the sort, that lacks all the bells and whistles. It's not like Blizzard is removing the addon API. They will just break this addon and others like it and for good reason.
---
Gotta delete and remake. Just figure out what look you want first and do it real quick, shouldn't take make than 10 seconds. Would also suggest not doing it at peak hours, try during the middle of the night so there is less chance it gets stolen.
---
And again someone stealing content for their random trailer (hurricanes) content
---
Hope you enjoy being unhealthy and feeling like shit then.
---
Well that kinda sucks, ahh well.
---
Burn it to the ground.....
---
Wanna know the worst part? You were most likely topping damage done along with the tank. Both tanks and healers are superstrong during leveling, probably to make people want to play it. When I leveled my Shaman I was easily top damage even against other heirloom geared dps..
---
What about the twig to the right? How could they leave that out. THATS AN HERBALISTS LIVELY HOOD! Blizzard is just setting Classic up to fail..
---
I saw people here a few days ago saying that streamers *were* getting priority access. They might have just been talking out their asses, though.
---
Big streamers usually have prio.
---
Small streamers. Who cares?
---
Hmm first turn off the chat.... Second I think when ever you as a parent make an adult desision and stop going to a group of random people to parent your child ....
---
Race changes were not in vanilla.
---
Actually now most of us will probably just use in game chat channels
---
nah its ur opinion, and this how i know u are a goofy irl haha.... ü§£ üòÇ  internet ass lil boy
---
For a smoother launch, obviously
---
Just your friendly neighborhood paladin.
---
Me too! Actually took a huge renovation project that will be completed as of Sunday to make sure I wouldn't have to do it once the game came out. Go us haha.
---
How do they even make money? Just ad sales from their website? After the initial config I never went back tho..
---
No, vqueue was made on private servers, calltoarms was made in vanilla.
---
I've tried to put WoW to bed with every expansion but I always come crawling back. Almost made it through all of BFA without resubbing but the classic stress tests got me. Didn't want my money to feel like a waste so I played a bit of retail. It'll all be worth it on Monday though!
---
Blizzard used to prop up Swifty's server in such a way. I suspect they will do the same for Faerlina, and make sure the streamers stay there.
---
I didn't, I just think it's a weak pun and if I saw someone in game with "fuhrer" in their name, I'd assume that they're at best an edgy basement dweller, at worst a neo nazi.
---
Which is kinda sad. I wish they had given the option to pick between those 2.
---
People and their problems.
---
Yea. It‚Äôs comparable. I was doing well in school, had friends, and was healthy but they didn‚Äôt want me spending more than 2 hours a day on it. 
---
I don‚Äôt still hold any anger towards them but it‚Äôs kinda fucked that I got an addiction and instead of addressing it and help me they just set the limit where it would boot me from the game. I was pretty mad at the time.
---
And I‚Äôm still an addict to this day; just to different things. I try to channel it towards healthy things but moderation is still really hard for me
---
Blizz: No no no, we don't want you to have fun playing the game. We want you to play it in a very specific way, even if it isn't the most fun. 
---
This is some petty shit right here, but idk why I expected anything different.
---
I understand what you're saying
---
But we were seeing comments exactly like yours hours before you replied that said similar but also pretended autoinvite wasn't there and it was a necessary addon for the game. It's so peculiar how people change their arguments entirely when they get caught out. 
---
Seems to me, the devs agreed and it also seems to me that although you clearly want to use said addon, it'd be a mighty fine day if they stopped you entirely ;)
---
There's nothing wrong with people using discord channels etc. That's all community building. 
---
This addon auto invites people based on role and talents. It's literally modern LFG. No talking involved. 
---
That's what Blizz flagged and will break for this addon and others.
---
&gt; Succ is waay lower skill than fel.
---
That's literally what i just said.
---
Have you heard how people talk lately? There are loads of people with such a small vocabulary, that the are barely able to say full sentences. And this applies to more countries. # you know, like, i can't even when chad was like, you know. Literally i don't even know. #
---
And I see the same in my own mothertongue. Flemish is becoming so basic. I'm 30, the conversations I have with elders are so much more vocabulary colourfull. Than the conversations I have with my own generation. And the younger generation is even worse. What you call evolution, I'd rather name it bastardizing a language.
---
I find it hilarious when comments like these pop up in this sub. One of the criticisms of WOW even back in vanilla was the game was on rails and didn't take much skill. Just time.
---
Now thats some funny shit right there
---
Great quote! I'm about to re watch that episode now!
---
Must‚Äôve just been sheer luck the times it worked then! - That would make sense though.
---
Damn that's cringe. 
---
God damn god damn god damn, read what you just typed you creeper.
---
It's not specifically just here. Only because this sub is called ClassicWoW it doesn't stop them coming here and shittalking that version, and it also doesn't stop the more toxic parts of the Classic community to go over to the main WoW sub and shittalk their versions. And again:
---
It's all a giant circlejerk that has existed ever since expansions and private servers started popping up.
---
How many people are macro spamming Thex 24/7
---
Just shoot me a PM :)
---
There's always one.
---
If you have a friend who also plays WoW you can have him occupy thr name as soon as you delete it and then he will delete the toon again once you are ready.
---
spec parser is being removed,  no roles are selected  in the add on , auto invite was same an any other auto invite add on that invited anyone that whispered invite. No one would use this auto invite unless they wanted 5 dps in there group lol.
---
These are the kind of posts this sub needs right now.
---
AOE looting
---
The funny part is how triggered you are
---
Wouldn't have me on board. Paid server transfers are poison.
---
I do generally agree with you but at the same time I'd like to see them do it still because the game deserves that level of effort put into it. As for the models on WC3:R; they look like HOTS, which looks like it belongs in Starcraft to me. I dunno if it's a lighting thing, or the more complex textures (probably) but IMO it should head more in the direction of Overwatch (but not completely) if they are wanting to "evolve" the look of it.
---
Reese's... FOR BREAKFAST? NO! IT'S REESE'S PUFF CEREAL (tm)!
---
Yes. Rescan games. Select wow. Drop box will appear on your right
---
I thought this was a vanilla screenshot.
---
No, you just can't complete a quest unless it's marked as (Raid)
---
I definitely do. It's actually one of the primary reasons, why I don't want to use a guide, because they mostly all skip them or make them optional.
---
That‚Äôs a shame people are doing that to him. He makes quality classic videos on YouTube. They‚Äôve been getting me through the wait. Hate to see him banned on account of trolls.
---
high quality content
---
is that hydrogen peroxide on the end by the powerade lol? in case you need to puke it all up after you eat it!
---
Prairie dog, prairie dog, gib me big amounts of gold
---
Should be WoW Classic as red pill and literally anything else as blue pill.
---
Hopefully. I don't want them migrating to low population servers. The general/trade/lfg channels will be a toxic mess.
---
I have this same problem but am using Relay, and it opened without a rate limiter this time. Odd.
---
Dive rhymes with five.
---
This praire lacks real hair. 
---
Jesus has hair. 
---
Dog is God backwards.
---
Illuminati confirmed.

he'll be fine

The OP has a lower life expectancy than lvl 13 warrior who pulls 3 defias pillagers.
---
Hey man, Idaho is kind of like it's own world.  Don't lump everyone else in with it.
---
Tipsout stated on his stream last night that they discussed this issue (by they he meant a few larger streamers) and it was decided that it was Faerlina come hell or high water. He didnt think it would be fair to the playerbase to switch servers suddenly on launch, and he said that was the general agreement as well.
---
I do know the answer and its not ‚Äúself segregation‚Äù, it‚Äôs to give the opportunity for people who want to play with like minded individuals to do so. They‚Äôre not going around telling every one, they will just have their established guilds. It applies to nationality too, how would you know if someone is Brazilian unless they told you? 
---
Additionally, no one is forcing neither LGBT+ players onto one server, they can go wherever they‚Äôd like. Just think of it as any other community listed in the post.
---
I mean with 0% hit, every percent of hit you get applies to 100% of your damage because it is helping both your white and yellow hits. After 9% you're mostly only helping the white portion of your damage so hit becomes less important.
---
There are significant problems with server transfers. They should not be in the game.
---
That's the thing that's wrong and that's what Blizz will break.
---
They're 2 different things, so I don't see how one can be superior to the other.
---
This subreddit is turning into garbage.
---
Blizzard is absolutely not going to step in and do anything.
---
You think Blizz is gonna pay GMs to watch an area for hours? How is it even against the TOS? It's players organizing on Discords.
---
I wonder how all the idiots parroting "but it was in vanilla" feel now
---
You are a fucking downer man. How often does Classic launch? Let them eat cake!
---
The original decursive is gone. Where you click a button and it decursive someone. You can still mouse over and cast decurse. 
---
Healbot won‚Äôt auto down rank. 
---
But other mouse over/click addons will work.
---
It's a bariatric office chair.
---
That's like my favourite set in the whole game, but to get it in classic means I'd have to play Paladin in classic................ I dunno about that one.
---
Those addons existed in vanilla and will exist in classic
---
aah go on
---
If you‚Äôre desperate you should be able to install windows on it. The hardware will be capable of running classic, but under Mac OS you need your hardware to support Metal. Windows won‚Äôt have this issue.
---
Same, though I will play Alliance on Shazzrah in secret :)
---
Working 6 days next week 5pm-1am shifts but the one day I managed to get off is Monday! So pumped.
---
The part of it posting LFG in chat channel will stay. It's not like Blizz is banning it. They will break the problematic parts.
---
But he literally destroyed wow and created what we know now as BFA
---
waste of money, he can just poop in socks.
---
Asmongold recently released a video where he talked about moving to a low population server depending on queue time.
---
Hard isnt the word your looking for
---
Okay, I won't be unfair here and say they all have unhealthy mental states, but over the years from playing games such as BnS, OSRS, Tera, WoW and online in general, weebs always come across to me as awkward people who don't have much life experience, you know, outside in reality. Saying that though, nobody is perfect in this world.
---
Lol imagine thinking this guy actually thinks he owns the server
---
Just install questie, shows all quests and where to collect/kill mobs. No specific route or anything so you can just do everything in whatever order you like, and you wont miss quests that are hard to spot.
---
This would be the only way I could play the ugly bastards. I had a Druid named Moonshaen (Moonshine, Moonkin, Shane) that did all the dungeon runs drunk on Firewater. I would make sure I was always smashed like it was a buff or something and I had a blurry blast.
---
Exactly this, I only downloaded what I needed to buy tokens then uninstalled.
---
i've scanned for games but its not registering for me
---
Doesn't this just make *you* the dickhead?
---
&gt;But what's it to you if someone doesn't want to talk to you?
---
Makes the game feel like a singleplayer one instead of an mmorpg?
---
since you dont know how to read a graph. The only thing you should be comparing is the tippy top of the blue line and the tippy top of the red line. Those are called "peaks". The bigger peak means more.
---
you sound like a suu dick rider
---
How the hell
---
THAT IS ONLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR ONE DAY!
---
You will starve on day 2!
---
Planned a couple of days vacation later in the week (when hopefully the queues have calmed down).
---
Anyone that decides to take a sick day instead of vacation....wow....
---
You literally do not need an addon to create a mafia. And the only way they would hamper the addon if there were one is by crippling the API even more which could have unintended impacts on other addons.
---
I have an alt problem, I have all mine listed in a spreadsheet for class/professions/race to organize them all.
---
You would think a grammar nazi would refrain from ending a sentence with a preposition.
---
As a lifetime Horde player, I have to agree with your first claim.  However, Undercity feels like a Tim Burton set.  It‚Äôs phenomenal.
---
For the rest I am insanely jealous: Ironforge, Stormwind and even Darnasus are amazing in their own ways.
---
It feels like feral Druids would almost be better or just as good gankers given all this information? They have far more options to work with when things go wrong at least it seems. I‚Äôm still deciding between rogue and Druid and while world pvp won‚Äôt be everything I do, I will do a lot of it.
---
Art demand is real and takes time regardless of the amount of devs working on the game.
---
Power trips by high levels was one of my first negative experiences in WoW. Started late and nobody wanted to help or if they did it was only if you played their bitch.
---
I'm doing my part!
---
That's just it, they're not removing skeletons! They're making it so one player can't fill an entire battlefield by getting camped! 
---
Not only is it an obvious choice stability wise, it makes finding a battlefield *****truly******* spooky
---
Wow that's amazing. Is it made by Google themselves or is this third party?
---
False. This addon allows auto invites to people based on role and talents. It's literally modern LFG. No talking involved.
---
Actually there is about to be 4 of them
---
For raiding it will be Edgemasters Handguards actually
---
It seems they are using mainly raid boss names for PvP servers where as names for PvE servers tend to be based on open world stuff, characters, factions etc.
---
Whoa. with the conclusions people jump to about this topic you'd think they were talking about politics.
---
Prairie dog be dumbie thick
---
They were. Did you play vanilla? Dps meters were huge also.
---
Mmm, from what I am gathering it seems like it's 2-fold, if I want to be optimal and go to end game with a bunch of other fellow nerds I need to stick to 1h/shield and prot for tanking, but it is also viable to a certain extent to go 2h Arms with some points in prot and swap out my 2h with a 1h/shield when necessary.
---
How does it do compared to ap ret with the slower and more bursty damage?
---
Yes you can play with Retail Graphics. (Models will still be old school).
---
But there is a 'Classic' graphics option, which is what I am choosing to use.
---
Dumb people do*
---
Druids and hunters are already good levelers regardless of race lmao
---
If it's just a chat parser, it's fine. All that means is it scans chat for LFG ads and makes a nice list of them so you don't have to sift through anal thunderfury spam.
---
It requires more work than you can imagine, there are costs to this.
---
What is that stand you are using for the keyboard?
---
I love when they show how "angry" he is, if they saw me playing pvp in classic while being sheeped and sapped for 3 minutes they probably think I was a potential mass murderer
---
He has a carton of fruit punch.
---
That should keep scurvy at bay for a day or two.
---
Most healing classes will not be viable as dps in classic and we will NOT get any patches fixing this. Now the meta might shift for classes that bring there own buffs like spriest and druids. But shamans and paladins will still be really bad at raid dps. So if you want to raid as damage chose another class or be content whit never beating the tank in dps
---
YES! You did it!!
---
I tried this once and felt so lost lol...had no idea where anything was in the cities or where to go.
---
Apparently they're still parroting it lol. Had 2 people comment on my post saying it was and downvoted me.
---
Night Elves have the worst look in game, but that shadow meld is hard to beat.
---
I always loved it in world PvP myself. By the time I was big into BGs I was Disc and somehow liked that even more than melting faces.
---
This addon allows auto invites to people based on role and talents. It's literally modern LFG. No talking involved. It could in the future even integrate gear.
---
So glad they are going to break these parts of it.
---
yes ive watched a bunch of his too.   I've found that the lore is so much that I have to read/hear/watch it from multiple sources for me to soak it all in
---
UH NICE, what addons are u using for the CharacterScreen Skin?
---
For the world/grinding? Troll by a mile. The bow spec and beast slaying alone will do the trick. You will use bows more often than guns, and at least 50% of your mobs will be beasts. On top of that you have beserking which benefits hunters, its not great but NE's other big racial, shadowmeld, is QOL in the world (in pvp it can be used quite well if practiced). So troll, for looks and racials (yes I said it, props to my two toed brethren).
---
That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about Hollywood or horticulture to dispute it.
---
Some of you guys are ridiculous. You wanted classic so bad, you got it now you‚Äôre not happy that WC3 wasn‚Äôt remastered and rereleased first. Nothing will ever satisfy this community
---
Everyone will be experiencing a queue lol
---
I login daily to kill Rustfeather.
---
...then i go back to re-creating the Northshire Abby in Minecraft &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt; I mean he‚Äôs got Hydrogen Peroxide
---
That is for the sores he will get on his ass for sitting in one place for too long.
---
I'll be completely new and just wanted to know this before I start, does the endgame content mostly focus on pvp/raiding? I'm usually just playing alone at all times in onlines games, and was wondering if I will eventually have to either not have much to do or be social. I'm asking because whenever I see posts from people who played before it's all focused on pvp and raiding
---
The big draw from the talent tree is rather Omen of Clarity than Natural Weapons.  
---
Personally I would just go all in on the feral tree in your situation.
---
Back to retail with ye, vile demon!
---
nope he was right, the changes aren't released yet
---
&gt;author has not completed yet the database of quest for Classic
---
That's true.
---
Ally here. üòá
---
These people saying it wasn't hard at all will be the first people to cry when they wipe on the pats in deadmines lol. No it's not "hard" per se.. but CC is generally required, mana conservation is equally important.. you can't just spam spells forever or you will be OOM before bosses are 1/2 a health bar.
---
I guess it's kinda hard to name different builds by only one talent tree. A lot of specs have points spread across 2 or 3 trees.
---
You seem like a really fun guy to talk to :)
---
Stupidest post I've seen in a long time
---
They've always had amazing cinematic quality in their games.  Go back to Diablo / Starcraft and you'll see.
---
That doesn't even make sense.
---
Addons can just have a database of item levels if they really needed to.
---
And that's irrelevant. Gear score can be (and is) calculated from stats - which is why the people complaining about gear score not "working" in vanilla/classic are wrong. They just use different weights than the stat budget for an item.
---
The only way to break it would be to prevent addons from ever being able to access what items you have equipped (or what items a player you're inspecting has equipped). They won't do that. It would break soooo many regular addons.
---
Lol don't understand it..I played through it. LFG was welcomed with open arms, because at the time nobody had any rose tinted goggles about what finding a dungeon group was like. It was a half hour of spamming trade chat, so yeah technically we talked less, but it wasn't any meaningful talking. Don't worry in a few weeks you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.
---
Also, nobody is right in saying that, because it's just community dividing toxicity. People with different opinions can play the same game. You're trying to treat Classic WoW like a safe space where nobody will ever disagree with you. It's unrealistic.
---
You are completely miss reading or missing the point.
---
If you use it like that its a direct reference to him - not just a normal word. We say anf√ºhrer if we want to use the word fur a normal sentence
---
Shape kills Dumbledore
---
Ill trade you.  My normal schedule has me waking up around 10pm so a midnight release would be perfect(also way less people).  Instead I am trying to sleep/wakeup about 7-8 hours earlier than usual.  Gonna be a nightmaree RIP PST.
---
https://youtu.be/yAmXZPuS7L0 - found it!
---
I'm just happy most of the shitheads will gravitate towards pvp servers. Hoping for a more mature and wholesome community on pve.
---
still, the main goal with word fuhrer is the sound which is a pun to "fury", leader aspect is an extra angle that just makes it better
---
Yeah those 3 BGs are in classic. Phase 2 I believe.
---
I played a lot of wow with barebones or no addons.  I already have some installed but I will probably keep them off until Im ready to raid.  Bagnon is pretty much my main go to.
---
There‚Äôs slight discrepancies like how fel works and the some interactions like the romance with Garona but it had the major points down.
---
Technically two more days.
---
Hello darkness my old friend
---
Go rogue. Supposedly they‚Äôre very strong in PVP
---
There's nothing famous about this? People try to trick streamers into putting porn up all of the time.
---
Thanks for sharing this. This is exactly what I've been looking for. If I wasn't so broke I'd give you gold.
---
Early dungeons yea but 40+ they get longer...you gotta remember no aoe pulling is back and now ya gotta do cc and single pulls ...also wipes in certain ones can add a decent amount of extra time. Reasonably they can get up to 1-1 1/2 hours but it also depends on your group, most people will know what they are doing at that point
---
&gt; if you're not die hard against it and willing to lie about what the tos says about doing it that must mean you're a part of it
---
\- You
---
Ion literally mentioned the fight for resouces of one of the important things in vanilla during his "no sharding" speech.
---
I don't plan on being part of any mafia, but if I were and blizz banned me for it, I would be done with this game, banning players for playing the game in the intended way is not a good precedent to set.
---
Hmm, here are a few things I can think of:
---
* No harbour in Stormwind
---
* Dalaran is under a big purple shield in Hillsbrad Foothills (it moved in WotLK and left a massive crater in Hillsbrad)
---
* No "champion" system which allowed you to gain rep in dungeons by equipping faction tabards.
---
* No heroic versions of dungeons.
---
* Onyxia's Lair raid is only 40-man (was 10 and 25 player at level 80 in WotLK).
---
* No open world PvP zones with objectives
---
* No inscription or jewelcrafting professions.
---
* Obviously no flying.
---
Yeah just wait until next week. Then people have forgotten the whole ClassicLFG-thing and will rant about the leveling-/quest-helpers.
---
But I agree in the sense that restricting only one kind of addon, but allowing others that also work against the whole Vanilla-spirit is kinda ridiculous.
---
Vanilla is an incomplete game. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot of problems with it that were fixed later. 
---
One of those was the grouping system and how you do dungeons in general.
---
we are far away from #nochanges already. And I think thats clear for everyone. Layering, crazy big server, different interface options etc.
---
Because he‚Äôs chillin in his own house !
---
I know back in TBC (or wrath?) I used some sort of program that ran rotation simulations for my class to calculate weightings. There's nothing stopping someone from building a similar tool for classic. Hell, it's probably easier for many classes. As a frost mage, for example, my raid single-target rotation is just one spell with some cooldowns thrown in.
---
Wow the over reactions are off the chart. You really think this addon would break the game? Addons like this literally existed during Vanilla. Everything you guys don't like is a game breaker. I've seen people make the same claim about the fucking skeletons. It's unreal.
---
What is your ingame name?
---
I saw people going through his github and trying to report him. That guy could have serious work in private repos and people were willing to have him lose everything over an addon.
---
Its Thanos from Endgame.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard druids are essentially useless. Part of me still wants to roll one because Druid was my favorite class when I started, but I want to be productive in groups so I‚Äôll probably choose warlock, priest, rogue, or mage
---
No one would ever translate like that. If you read it as a german it is a clear hitler reference.
---
Nope, they had the code.  I think that was either a dodge by the devs or a meme.
---
Hi, /u/lewishoodmusic
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cutbp2/for_the_first_time_i_want_the_weekend_to_go_past/). 
---
I‚Äôll be using discord communities to find groups anyways.
---
almost sad to see a server as long standing as that shut down...   
---
It is nice though to see them go out on their terms, with one last hurrah. Rest easy LH, you guys did excellent to provide the content many of us wanted!
---
No one cares
---
True I guess. Retail raiding is ALOT harder than raiding in classic though. Both mechanics and rotations(talking about mythic raiding). Most pve rotations in classic wow is 1-3 buttons. 
---
I would say the only "hard" thing in classic wow is as you said, knowing your limits. You cant overpull and get away with it most of the times. But overall classic wow is very easy.
---
I'm tired, I thought it said "LATENIGHT SHAZZRAH PORN RAIDING GUILD"
---
After classic releases, they won't have to.  Only people that weren't going to spend any money anyways, or can't act right are going to be there.
---
The best looking set in wow, period. The judgement set!
---
&gt; used to refer to a point at which the level of profits or benefits gained is less than the amount of money or energy invested.
---
Please tell me how that relates to ops question.

this tbh
---
I‚Äôm gonna take my orc to muglore, personally
---
Luckily for him, the servers seem to be more populated than vanilla servers were. 
---
On top of that, my guild back in the day was notorious for ninja looting and shit like that. 
---
We even had people get in chat telling others not to join our groups. 
---
Didn‚Äôt do shit lol. 
---
So no, it won‚Äôt have an effect.
---
What, have you seen the matrix? It's the reverse.
---
Blue pill: WoW Classic, A literal recreation of the world as it used to be (before the machines in this context) that is comfortable to live in and many (Cypher) wish to return to.
---
Red pill: WoW retail, a hostile place where you have to face the reality that the world has changed (forced underground, in constant war with the machines, etc.)
---
I've have seen this album before. Posted by someone else I think.
---
it's like Harrydotter for a warlock or Britneyfears. 
---
Bradcrit etc.. tons of these.
---
As much as they under estimate interest, you youserlf overestimate it
---
Ah dwarf hunter, I see you too are a man of culture!
---
Actually seemed pretty genuine. Definitely made him a bit more watchable for me
---
Damn all these conversations and stories, my lil guy only 8 months, but after my dad having cancel and triple heart bypass in the last few years makes me think I'll sub an account for him.
---
They don't know he's Medivh, they take him for a madman. Medivh knew they would be overtaken by the scourge soon after he left as well, that's why he's not bothering.
---
Are there two types of people?  Ones that overeat and ones who basically forget all bodily functions including the need for food when binge gaming?  I feel like the later as I usually eat at most twice a day when gaming hard (and portion size is basically the same as normal).  Eat when I wake up and then eat when I go "oh crap its already that late?"
---
This sub has taught me that horde players are loud. I chose correctly my chill brothers.
---
Druids are awesome at tanking Dungeons and the early Raids (UBRS, MC)
---
IMHO theres nothing wrong with a lfg tool, that makes creating the group a bit easier. Like in WOTLK where you joined the group, but still had to travel.
---
It made things easier, a bit faster, but didn't break the game.
---
Underrated buff.
---
I am defending it but this is a bad defense. In a multiplayer game, the options available to other players affect you.
---
The best defense is that addons like Call to Arms existed in 1.12.
---
I don't think it's difficult to imagine that this guy got asked for gold and carries on a semi-regular basis and decided to have some fun with it.
---
The conversation also stats that Night Elfs are best. Which implies a respons om behalf of dwarfs. As I believe OP statement on this to be false.
---
This is great news
---
You're right, this was a real knee slapper
---
All they have to do is say, #nochanges, and they‚Äôll be right as far as this community is concerned. That‚Äôs not hard. 
---
If you have any questions about retail or any changes made to the game in general, I‚Äôd be happy to explain it for you.
---
nope, just correct, that's an outdated version of it
---
Yea but have you ever been to the Undercity.... ON WEED?!
---
The normal word is "anf√ºhrer" for leader. If you use it like that its a direct reference
---
You don't need to do CC or single pulls in dungeons.
---
PLZ Tell US your ingame name.
---
Good luck my dude ! :)
---
What about us Norwegians? :( See you around!
---
Weak. He did bad shit. It‚Äôs over. Stop being afraid of it.
---
Lmao he who should not be named.
---
I'm playing Alliance, but only because i'm a Paladin main, and cows couldn't retake the Holy Land in vanilla.
---
I have come back to BfA four times now (curiosity), and each time, I log out within 10-15 mins and uninstall. I know plenty of friends who have done the same
---
ITT; 
---
People think that 
---
"LF Heals WC""
---
"Inv pls"
---
Is social interaction
---
Bruh how come you‚Äôve never joined in on me and /u/HugoEmbossed chatting wow in that other subreddit?!
---
Also wtf you doing with an alliance flair! Can I assume you‚Äôll be rolling on Arugal? Throw me a PM if you like I‚Äôd love to catch up in game!
---
I wouldn't use Disney as a good example of providing nostalgia, the new live action remakes are almost universally considered uninspired cash grabs

2 days for half the world.
---
I'm sure everyone here complaining about grammar nazis will have very helpful and level-headed responses if they are constantly asked for gold and carry runs through instances.
---
Chances are, you will most likely join a pug. If you like the players and they like you, I think you found a home
---
Dunno - turned out pretty OK ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
well he basically plays a character for his streams
---
It‚Äôs actually a different addon that functions different than the one you‚Äôre talking about in vanilla. 
---
That is because the bones of classic has bfa tech in it.
---
The elf has no hands though
---
Thanks for the buff, friend.
---
Don't underestimate that movement speed when dead, if that night elf is like me it'll probably save him a full day of leveling.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Never thought we could relive the glory days. So hyped! Have an awesome launch week
---
I‚Äôve never seen a community upvote comments less.
---
Why would I want to talk to you in game? You're annoying enough on fucking reddit.
---
Loved it but the streamers felt out of place.
---
Oh okay.  I just want those shoulders...!

Like others have said GS in vanilla doesnt really work but if we get tbc classic some day then ill be worried about GS. I also dont think blizz can even do anything about it since it just averages ilvl, you could do that yourself in 10 seconds
---
NO ZOOMER SPEAK ON MY VIDYA GAME BOARD
---
BBoomer
---
Cheers man. Doesn't sound too hard indeed. Glad you reminded me to do proper prep for launch week.
---
Just because there might be problems doesn't mean you should skip launch day. If you fall behind on leveling you're going to have similar crowding issues all the way to 60.
---
At least they made it an afternoon/evening release here in the US.
---
Funny not found
---
I‚Äôll start off without addons, but I‚Äôll grab some here and there as I go.
---
Sure , but as i said no one ever (exept op) would translate windleader to windfuhrer
---
I did pserver for a brief time and I made an entire new email address just for that login, no way was I trusting a place that thrives on stolen content with a legit email
---
press the cog wheel thing on the right and click add game, direct it to the _classic_ folder in your wow directory and then choose it from the drop down menu. all the addons that appear will be ones that are for classic :)
---
And here I am looking at my subscription expiring in 58 hours....
---
I‚Äôd just play Druid tbh
---
Probably it's a PS thing.
---
Ah, yeah my bad. I've fallen pretty hard off the hearthstone kick so I kinda figured my info on that was outdated.
---
Thanks for the correction!
---
Will that mean the pieces from MC and Ony will only start dropping once phase 3 starts?
---
Arteries still clog whether you're 130 lbs or 400 lbs
---
the addon is still going to be in, just with minor changes
---
Dps Meters has communication threads the same as the addon.  It normalizes based on that communication because you can not always see the dps of others if you are too far away, etc.  So if they remove the communication, they will essentially break dps meters as everyone will be different unless in the same room with in distance to see others attacks.
---
Paging u/sanguinica

lmfao
---
Roll the druid tank! Needs more examples of how it's done!
---
Missed opportunity for sure. Even larger missed opportunity if you don‚Äôt just go play the originals wc3 before Tuesday! It still holds up. Gameplay and graphics alike.
---
The dev team in charge of classic WoW have done an amazing job thus far. It might not be perfect but they definitely given us the best they could. 
---
I think it's fine for people to dislike the changes that were implemented but the team seems really dedicated to giving us a memorable experience, especially given last night's decision to disable group-finding addons.
---
I‚Äôm not anti add on.
---
I have to admit I haven‚Äôt had a chance to catch /u/HugoEmbossed on his plans! But I‚Äôll be there (when I‚Äôm not getting railed by SOPA adjudications et al)!
---
Totally fair enough about pvp and the horde this time around - maybe I‚Äôll have to settle for organising an auslaw bnet group!
---
Irrelevant.
---
This is a hypothetical question that i want to know.
---
Streamers are fine. There's plenty of good ones.. Asmond is just too far up his own ass, he'll need more of his daddies money to get out of it.
---
He could've ignored the person anytime.
---
*Laughs in FFXI*
---
It‚Äôs not different at all. Because the scenario could still be that 2 guilds/groups of players respect each other and choose not to fight each other.
---
It was a grey area in Vanilla because they would have to communicate cross faction and/or straight up talk about the monoply for it to be against the rules. Sure they can ban without evidence. My point is that history have shown us they don‚Äôt.
---
The part that will be interesting is when they turn layers off. Surely they can't cap at 3000 total per server, as I'd like to believe Classic will be more popular than that.
---
Assuming that's the case, do they have one layer with a higher population cap? Do they open even more servers?
---
So freaking true! And when they start shooting everything or aggro things the tank doesn't even have in his/her viewing angle! Then a group wipes... Its all because tank and healer SUCK! Not because the kiddo's don't know how to stay the fuck behind the tank, let him gather what he's going to gather and then begin attacking... while also doing your best to avoid pulling aggro on something that you aren't killing ATM. And Ret pallies! My god! Just because their DPS wasn't sub-par when compared to other classes they thought that gave them freedom to hit the mod 15 times before you even got to it! Thus putting themselves higher on aggro... and then wonder why its taking you a little longer to get past them on aggro! When your standing there tanking in a spec that isn't even a tanking spec to begin with.... specifically because his/her DPS is so low that you have to be able to put out more DPS to compensate
---

Someone copy pasted the same string of relevant code from the current version in this thread already.
---
You mean 6 months straight, right?
---
No they will drop in phase 1
---
Dude I'm with you. A lot of people think because classic is back we can go back to the teenage edgelords we used to be. Just a matter of time until general chat is filled with people trying to avoid the profanity chat and shout things similar to the n word.
---
They went with bpark chicken&amp;pork. I don‚Äôt think they care about how their dogs taste. Personally I‚Äôm a Nathan‚Äôs kind of guy but I‚Äôve never had a Hebrew national or sabretts.

I actually got some foot long Nathan‚Äôs in the fridge rn lmao.

None of those affect the core gameplay though.

Thanks man! The main thing I‚Äôm looking forward to: having conversations and banter while in groups with other people. That is entirely missing from retail wow (even in higher level mythic plus, nobody talks). I‚Äôm just excited to experience a sense of community again. That was the biggest draw to the game for me in the first place.
---
Aww Sebudai, will be yelling at us once again. Can't wait to stand in fire till we die and make him yell at us. He really is a good guy though, love him.
---
What does any of this fucking "copy paste fanboy response #573836" have to do with my comment?
---
I would honestly love to try if there is a trial again like back then. But I never played any MMO , so I dont want to pay if I hate it.
---
WoW BFA is to WoW Vanilla. What WoW Vanilla was to EQ/DAOC/UO/AC.
---
I'm an interested in what you think Blizzard was "bullied" into. 
---
Are you salty about the LFG add-on being broken?
---
Retail has LFG built in, no add-on required, go check that out.
---
Pepperoni / Cold Cuts! Totally agree ! Forgot to add sandwiches but they count as meal prep I guess!
---
All of these attempts by blizzard are going to fail. You think you're going to stop people from using discord and things likes that to form groups ? It's not 2006. You can't bring back classic exactly as it was, and trying to is honestly not worth it.
---
Gold will be devalued, resources that become required later on but isn't (very) useful at the start will have a much more gradual price increase than back then.
---
Yeah, see I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs too busy in my relationship and I took time off so that I could actually enjoy classic, so it would have ruined my day if she sprung a trip during this one off-limits week. I hear ya though, WoW is secondary 100%.
---
You are about to repeat the same life altering mistakes we made in 2005
---
I'm gonna wait until the game is released and then try a few add-ons.
---
Alliance propaganda runs deep.

Inspect element much

Of you‚Äôre eating food for ease, just drink lots of water and snack on fruit. These kinds of things are ok once in a while. Also you could make a batch of something a bit healthier that you can microwave.

Shit I want to offer a rebuttal.....but I got nothing
---
I live in Michigan so this happens every year no matter what
---
Hold on a minute, don't you have a smart phone?
---
please dont discourage people to ask questions on threads like these mate
---
This, but replace 'Nonononono' with 'Hahahahaha'.
---
That's my suspicion as well. I think this could affect more than just idle animations in the character select screen.
---
&gt; anyone can fork the addon to implement it back if there is still a way to do so in the API
---
...which there won't be, because Blizzard have explicitly said that this is not a behaviour they are going to allow on the Classic API.
---
Put down your pitchfork, there is no need to be angry all of the time, it's not healthy.
---
Wut
---
I think one of the biggest "registered" communities is the Scandinavian group and from what I hear that's still only about 600 people?
---
The servers at launch are estimated to hold about 50,000 people. So even with that entire community going to one server they won't have much of an impact.
---
The whole "The Spanish are talking over Shazzrah" is just a meme, just like all the other communities. The majority of people who're going to play WoW aren't on this subreddit, aren't on any discord realm servers, aren't following any Classic news or memes. The servers are going to be full with randoms rolling where ever the hell they want.
---
Plus whatever differences these communities are perceived to have, the one thing in common we all have is we're hyped for Classic, and that's a bond that's stronger than any boarder or language barrier.
---
The RP servers will be flooded by people who are sick of waiting in the queue and just wanna play. Even if they'll delete that character after a week
---
Don‚Äôt let everyone shit talking get to you man. Looks like you got quite the supply of treats to last you into classic.
---
On an aside, nice kitchen. Can you remember how old you were when Classic first launched? Did you think you‚Äôd be as successful as you are now to be able to afford that kind of home and food? Good on you OP
---
Sadly, this.
---
Having a different opinion = Annoying?
---
What about the Tauren?
---
I have no plans to get any. I don't use them on current WoW so won't need them on classic either.
---
Yeah dude. It's why I avoided Herod like the freakin plague.
---
Also much more illegal gold traders
---
nostralius was just closed because the servers were located in france. that was way too bold. other servers are located in russia and other eastern europe countries and blizzard mostly didnt bother to shut them down because it wasnt worth it since those people who played there wouldnt have played retail either.
---
Troll. Always go Troll.

26th, EU.

Midnight: try to logon to Gehennas.
---
I too have not seen an answer. Im assuming that because you are in a realm you wont be queued again but if someone knows, that would be great
---
Is there an install link for it?
---
How do I pay for the classic sub?(If there is one?)
---
How are druids/warriors/paladins for end game?
---
1 hour later: "I know what you're thinking, why oh why didn't i take the blue pill?"
---
Outland is LITERALLY in a state of upheaval... like pieces of the ground are heaving upwards into the air.  Those were your lands!
---
I remember playing with tanks and healers in vanilla with that mentality, there was this 1 situation in which one of them got super annoying for whatever reason and we kicked him and ended the dungeon with 4 persons. Turns out he wasn't that important.
---
Dwarves existing is the only reason this choice was hard. They should be adopted by the horde or made their own faction.
---
Depends. For Holy PVP, tier armor is going to be your BiS since the pvp gear is more for Rets and you dont want go be wearing anything less than plate.
---
Internet explorer and picture from your phone
---
Install Windows on it. It will run.
---
Just send me the money and I‚Äôll ship it to you
---
I think it's supposed to be tongue in cheek. But it's hard when only OP knows the punchline.
---
I plan on going ele to 20, ench 20 to 40 then back to ele for 60
---
for ret its good but...you have 2 options as a paladin you can heal or logout!
---
Well no changes died when they decided to not use physical servers and use the Legion(? I think) client.
---
Not allowing people to have different opinions (that's what you basically do) is annoying :)
---
Oh hell yeah I can‚Äôt wait to spend 3 hours to put together a dead mines group just to have the healer leave as soon as the groups ready then have everyone follow suite and leave those were the days am I rite boys üòé
---
Lets not pretend that /who warr and "Can you tank DM east?" is in any way a valuable social interaction. It's like going up to some shmuck on the street and going "Do you want to go to the gym?" Its weird, its potentially discomforting, and its annoying. And when the answer to that question is "No thank you" Literally nothing is gained socially speaking.
---
So you think #nochanges means that they shouldn't support Color Blind Mode?
---
Do you also think #nochanges means to use their old infrastructure and security measures? 
---
You are close minded if you think anyone wants this.
---
Nice diabetes bro
---
Amen! Take my upvote!
---
I've been told I lack empathy, but that one hurt.
---
Paladins are that impotent, heh?
---
Whats the Mage.
---
Not really. The original is much better. It's akin to how the old Classic skins look better than the modern ones.
---
I don't know why I didn't think of that.
---
at least rogues still look kinda cool with t1 and even some preraid stuff
---
but paladin  is all shit
---
oh and u actually wear ur tiers for pve
---
You know that's curated for you dont you
---
ewww
---
I think Summer would play an undead rogue because she would only play the game if some guy she liked got her into it, and she would only go for a Horde Chad, not an Alliance Virgin.
---
Probably the only Asmon video I actually enjoyed watching. Heck, it's the only Asmon video I actually even finished watching. Hope he has fun in his way on his realm. I'm just glad I'm on a different realm.
---
I'm the opposite, during work the past two weeks I've been pretty useless with trying to not focus on WoW. At home I can catch up on shows and nap to make the time go faster.
---
Biggelsworth? They saved the best for last. Rip
---
I don't know man. Some people will never go back to retail unless major changes occur. I am one of them. I played from 2005-2018 and quit the prepatch to BFA as I hated warmode so much.
---
Warmode ruined the last little bit of wpvp fun and trickery I could squeeze out of the game. I used to love camping that cave where people would go open chests. Now any outside of the box zone like that is gated off because warmode and ganks are inaccessible. 
---
Little stuff like that is what kept me coming back year after year, once I realize warmode was an "artificial-world-pvp-battleground" I instantly quit. Zones went from being full of horde to gank to empty and only full of coordinated gankers who had no motive to be there other than to que up and zerg. It was inauthentic and not fun.
---
I could never go back to that. I miss loads of aspects of retail and I discuss it with my two other friends often who quit for the same reasons.
---
We went to private servers. We'll be back on classic and once classic is done retail won't be the option. It's been corrupted too much by the "new modern gaming" philosophy so many other games have been ruined by.
---
Like  Walker Texas Ranger only the stakes are higher.
---
All it tells us is that they watch anime and like it enough to display a character as their avatar, and absolutely *nothing* else about that person.  Don't be a prick.
---
It is literally no different to playing WoW and typing/saying "FOR THE HORDE/ALLIANCE", yet the "dae weebs omegalul" wankers don't seem to take exception with that.
---
So that's Moonglade to Tanaris covered. What about the rest?
---
I've walked away from everything else. Walked away from my XBox, my D&amp;D game... My gaming tablet got stolen last week and I just shrugged. "WoW's coming out next week anyway.". I'm all in!!
---
Heh. I can't wait to see fellow mages in pvp who think the "3 minute hero" spec is good.
---
Being called worthless for leaving your computer for an hour does not bode well for my experience in Classic as a casual player lmao
---
50 sit ups as penance.
---
And then everyone stood up and /clapped.
---
So... is it hard?
---
Dude! This is literally my fear right now! I‚Äôm hoping to snag a sick name on incendius, but i also don‚Äôt want my guy to look stupid lol.
---
rogues priests hunters warriors
---
Same! I have a BE hunter I'd like to level because their starting zone is so beautiful but I always feel like a big phony playing horde.
---
This is cringe. Take a dang screenshot on your conputer you barbarian
---
Awesome piece! One question tho. I could be mistaken but weren‚Äôt there 5 discs in the vanilla box?
---
Cool
---
I definitely agree everyone should play it how they feel. I'm just afraid that an addon such as this would inadvertently force people into using it, whether you want it or not. In a similar, but not equal, way like r.IO has done in retail. If I don't want to play with it, I can of course always create my own group, but you can't deny that if you want to play m+ you will be affected by it and it's hard to ignore.
---
At the end of the day though the most important thing is that people are having fun, but being so many players that play the game so differently will force everyone to compromise to some extent. For example I don't want to be forced to use an LFG tool, and Blizzard seem to agree, so some will not be able to play in that way, however I might want to play Ret paladin in raids, but people don't want to have a Ret paladin in their raid so I have to compromise and play as holy in raids but ret individually.
---
How do you know he's using 3rd party software? It could be click-to-move with broadcast.
---
The kids are old enough to feed and cloth themselves. /s
---
I don't have kids.
---
That LFG outrage from Legion is a perfect example. Everyone talked about that API change like the world was ending and things were ruined. Meanwhile, the addon still does what it advertises, just requires more clicks.
---
That's what's going to happen here. Or they'll be too broad with their fix and break other harmless addons as a result.
---
&gt; This won‚Äôt be 2004 no matter how much people want it to be
---
Wish more people realized this. You can never go home again, no matter how hard you try üòû.
---
Now they go to tbc and a new generation of private server kids will be very knowledgeable about that version of the game
---
https://youtu.be/bbQ4xI7XEUw
---
Yes, As long as its on the same realm.(you could still disconnect because of game/server related issues tho) So there is a small risk.
---
There‚Äôs an LfG addon? How is that possible?
---
Lol Seriously.
---
I‚Äôm just waiting for activision to get it‚Äôs greedy hands in there
---
Sorry to hear about gaming tablet...I literally just deleted all games , Steam off my harddrive. lol
---
More than likely. Just wishful thinking.
---
Nah, Rick might play. He'd just alternate between being [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1p3FjVNFS4) and [this guy](https://youtu.be/mLyOj_QD4a4?t=83).

Raw rogue DPS is just far higher than feral. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JqgaZBmqN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JqgaZBmqNo)o
---
A feral just does not get to the numbers as shown in the video. 
---
Also the poster above you put in a lot of ifs and theory. If you are willing to pop a 2g consumable (FAP can become crazy expensive on certain stretches of progression) after your trinket, the rogue can just blind, restealth, sap for 30seconds, wait the duration of FAP and reengage. Sap is is an incapacitate, not a stun, therefore it works on FAPed targets.
---
You can also just bruteforce your way through their health. A well geared hemo rogue (the spec doing all that stunning) can do *a lot* of damage.
---
What is true is that rogue's aren't stupid broken anymore like they were when casters had no +sp gear, lacked +stamina and rogues just got all their essential offensive stats from +agi. That was the time that warlocks were mushrooms.
---
These times are long gone in patch 1.12.1
---
dear god i remember spending all the time on this waiting for BG pops and talking in chat
---
good times

You're missing the 64-pack of TP and a toilet plunger

Escape artist makes gnomes sooo much better in PvP.
---
&gt;"More casuals tend to play Alliance while Horde has MinMaxing"
---
What are you basing this of?
---
As a BC baby I always thought they summoned. But when I saw you needed warlocks to do that I assumed they got added in with BC.
---
Especially when the example word is in fact a defined word in most if not all contemporary dictionaries.
---
I don't know's the priest.
---
&gt; I still can't believe that people consider writing "invite please" a social interaction
---
* I still can't believe people think showing item level is a bad thing, it lets group leaders easily see who is worth inviting.
---
* I still can't believe people consider having to scroll through chat to find suitable groups and contact the group leader good social design. I play DPS so just let me click a button and find a group that needs DPS.
---
* I still can't believe people think running to a dungeon is immersive. It's just wasting time to make it take longer to do content and keep people subscribed longer, so just let us teleport there.

All of the problems with modern WoW didn't happen over night. They gradually came into existence as changes were made in the name of efficiency. Right or wrong, people are against this addon because they want to remove the "weed" before it starts to grow.
---
Even if you don't use the addon, if enough people do it becomes the norm and it can affect you. GearScore is a perfect example. Even if you didn't use GS in WotLK, other people did and people became viewed as a number and nothing else.
---
I just don't get why people have so much issue with talking to other players in a massively multiplayer game where progression relies on people working together.

I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt have to roll on any server with him

Him and his fan boys are the worst

Even just from learning your spell names you can add some cool words to your vocabulary.

The most realistic part is that Horde wins almost instantly.

Do Rogue do rogue!!!

I plan to play fairly casual, probably about 3 hours a night once wife and kids are in bed unless I'm off work or weekends where I can play more.
---
I'm not bothered about rushing to 60, I want to experience the journey to 60 as I missed out when it was first released.
---
Is that right? I mean I've heard that criticism before which is how we got LFG and LFD and LFR. I think it's probably for the best if you don't play Classic. It'll save you the grief of putting up with the *awful* grouping system and *how you do dungeons in general*, and it will save people the trouble of telling you to play BFA, which "fixes" those issues. Too many problems with Classic!
---
I'm just slightly worried about how easily people got blizzard make a change to addon api, possibly permanently. Especially in the name of #NoChanges
---
I don't about the LFG addon itself, I just hate to see how easily people got zealous against addon that basically nobody even played with. And from what I've seen most didn't even know what it is, as people seem to be thinking that it's a replica of the "LFG" feature in modern WoW, which it certainly isn't. It's just a match making addon to reduce spam and giving bit of QoL for people looking for groups.
---
I know how to look for groups in trade / global chats / guild chat, I was doing it for years before LFG addons or features got added in game, but that doesn't mean I liked doing it "the harder and more inconvenient way" if there's a more simple way available. It's not like people were forced to install the addon, same people will probably miss ton of groups being searched in discord servers too because they're not part of the game.
---
5:55 is where he explains where to get and how to install
---
Their work is done!
---
Wait, can you farm gold in classic also to pay for the sub? 
---
I dont play WoW, of any version, since about TBC.
---
Wash, dry and iron. Still need to do that or I will look like a bum on my first day back to work after 1 week of classic.
---
No, They will just have you get fucked by queue's.(most likely gonna add free transfer to lower population realms when they remove layering)
---
But this is just an issue that can be fixed by either queue times or keeping layering. And we know already what one they pick.
---
I don't have YouTube Red but I do have RedTube!

You must play alliance
---
I already have "The day I no longer see the sun" written in the 27th on my calender. Am stupidly excited to play this game.
---
&gt;you ever heard "the fourth of july"?
---
Nice mic drop line.  Well played
---
Except it totally is data because we've just seen incremental changes to QoL such as the LFG tool in retail take us to where we are now. It's a slippery slope argument, yes, but it's a valid one, not a fallacy. Period (writing this makes me more right, right?).
---
How have they changed the game to cater to "private server shills"?

It's just that the white auto attacks also take a big part of the combat, you see more white hits compared to yellow even if you spam sinister. And to not focus on that... Idk it feels wrong?

You can make huge crits from regular white attacks, assuming you have 1h swords with like 60dps

Solid Gold.

RIP Hayven
---
I don't care about the LFG tool at all, I wasn't planning on using it anyway. It's all the other times the private server community became "outraged" and forced Blizzard to make changes to the game.

No, they did. Or else they wouldn't have needed to launch so many extra servers after the first batch.

Wrath was about the first time you could pretty much play any class in any role and not be super impeded in any huge way. From the early days of vanilla blizzard intentionally kept hybrids behind other pure classes.. especially DPS.. straight out dps classes like rogue or mage if played as optimally as a hybrid class will always outdamage you.
---
3 day ban, classic launch in just over 2 days = he's fine. He'll probs be better off by avoiding the queues.
---
Either way, does it really matter? If he wasn't a streamer, would you have posted this? Nope.
---
I‚Äôm starting two weeks late. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine
---
likely more like 2 years. based on the previous release schedule
---
All of a sudden?  Blizzard is not omnipotent and is dealing with the most anticipated game launch of 2019.  Their focus is not on borderline add-ons.  Part of the relationship between players and developers is to help bring light to areas Blizzard may have missed.
---
The add on does not prevent use of the other channels, but it introduces a risk of those channels being less effective.
---
Stalagg polling with better #s than Herod - I was thinking of going there briefly but then seen Incendius. Sadly, I think its going to get slammed Monday and since name count restrictions get lifted at the same time people will probably rush to hoard names on it. With the French swapping to Stalagg and its high count plus I cant get two main names-Im going to go with Skeram. I really wanted a decent PVE but with the ratio so fucked phase 2 will be a nightmare when I want to do BGs.
---
&gt; Because you think this change will kill the game when in reality it's what fans want to keep the game alive
---
Where the fuck did I say anything like this?
---
&gt; Also, I didn't copy or paste anything,

&gt; but if you see the same comment so much then it's probably got a valid point.
---
Absolutely glorious retard logic there.

A bunch of cultist tards chanting the same holy commandments of the true vanilla wow experience‚Ñ¢ must mean they are absolutely right!

Lets see how long you true fans‚Ñ¢ can keep the game going with pure nostalgia alone.

The real good comment

I would think that you would lose all reputation when moving servers - they don't know you...

Before someone tries to tell you MJ withdrawals don't exist I must say, I've experienced withdrawals from opis/benzos, and while MJ withdrawals are certainly milder, they are still  DEFINITELY a thing.

What he says kind of makes sense given that retail is shitty but yeah, classic is for chads not bfa.

Please stop

again thats alienating the playerbase...whats so hard to understand...at the end of the day as long as you complete the content, why should it matter if you bring in people that havnt done it? all you are making yourself out to be is an elitist

---
Is cross realm not implemented such that only pvp servers go against each other and PvE server go against each other since PvE servers would otherwise have an advantage (getting gear easier). If that is the case horde will get long queues in pvp servers and alliance on over servers.
---
It means he plays a character on his stream.
---
Just find another platform
---
What race are you going for hunter?
---
Well...he is not wrong.
---
Better yet, try it out in Classic in 3 days.
---
it's not a defense at all, no need to defend myself.
---
Basically twitch chat
---
It makes very little sense for the Undead to be a part of the Horde.  Similarly for the Night Elves to be a part of the Alliance, however.
---
Based on this [image of Ironforge](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Second_War#/media/File:Ironforge_-_movie.jpg), I made an edited and animated version :)
---
Of course they can. It's the way it was back in 2005. Altering that would be a massive change that could potentially ruin the whole social dynamic of the servers.
---
However to be clear it's not 3000 players total on the server, it's 3000 players ONLINE at the same time. Each full server back in the day had a total population above 10k.
---
I actually have more free time now than back then.
---
Men are men, women are men, and children are the FBI.
---
I'm just watching all their 2000's stuff honestly 11 may have been the last "great" season imo at least, afterwards there were always a few duds a season.

"any minute now"
---
Would make a cool screensaver
---
Why do people keep asking me to show my gratitude to a company that has marginalized and mocked me and a large portion of the community for over a decade with a smug ‚Äúwe know best‚Äù attitude because their incompetent management finally decided to cash in on the legacy server market, not because they finally listened to the community, but because their precious retail is declining and they‚Äôre desperately grasping to maintain relevancy in the market?
---
Retail is free to level 20 I think, not sure about classic.
---
Most likely not considering your choice of words
---
They need to do a Henry Cavill one.
---
even changed the All Might Figure to a Thrall one. Nice work
---
I‚Äôm paying for 40
---
hahahah epic
---
Incorrect, a layer is not the full server cap. It's a very large chunk of the server and is used to avoid choking the server when people are all in the same areas.
---
Once layers are removed, the server cap will still be the same.
---
It was a slight contradiction, granted. But to say Quest helpers were prohibited back then is just silly. But the main point of it is that's a personal choice, like whether you wanted to search around yourself for a quest item back in the day or use thottbot to look it up. Whereas with this addon and it's group automation in it's current state, affects the gameplay of those not playing with that addon.
---
Very carefully
---
Nope, I woudnt. It coudnt ever happen if he wasnt a streamer. Like that is an argument. I get that people dont like streamers. I dont wanna play with Asmon or anyone on the server, even tho I personally like watching him.
---
But all that has nothing to do with this being wrong
---
After all these years it‚Äôs still what I want out of fucking retail too.
---
‚ÄúBubble!‚Äù
---
Stopping other people from playing a game they paid for is not "awesome."
---
In spirit, this is no different than aimbots or wallhacks.
---
The way that I found out about WoW...
---
Been playing ever since!
---
The game still was designed for a certain amount of people and it's the way it was back then. Changing it for no good reason makes zero sense, they'd have to make massive changes to the entire game as a result of a raised population.
---
U seem jealous. u miss the first time around? üòÇ
---
Yes?
---
My ap pyro will land before the first sunder. It is the true path.
---
Haven't watched recent SP in years but damn if they did a Classic episode I would watch the hell out of it.
---
Short answer; No.   
---
    
---
The WoW Token is a retail thing and won't be coming to Classic. Game time covers both versions though.
---
He bought the food for launch you stupid Euro fuck
---
I show my gratitude by giving them ¬£10/month for it.
---
Layers are not full servers, they are chunks of it split to prevent choking.
---
With or without layers, the server cap will be the same.
---
He checked the post... it just was a gif...you cant tell. No way you would even think about it being a possibility
---
You leave the gnomes out of it
---
Correction.
---
*Why EVERY gaming fan"
---
I was seriously hoping this came out before classic as well! Ugh.
---
&gt; Incorrect, a layer is not the full server cap.
---
Incorrect. Blizzard has specifically said that a layer is the same size as a server.
---
Update your client?
---
tbh if I ever get seriously into PVP I'll probably get the castbar addon as well, it just gives such a huge advantage. But other than that I just cba keeping the addons updated between patches and all that, most content is just fine without them.
---
15m lfg addon would have saved the day
---
Solution: pick a less populated server with a friendlier community
---
Apparently someone said that you could turn the auto invite off in the addon if you don't like it.
---
Thanks for putting in the time! Excellent spreadsheet
---
Also for the rasuvious fight in naxx.
---
It's ok to cry dude. Some of us actually had a childhood.

Faulty premise. Male nelf is ineligible to be chad.

The real hype for me with Reforged is gonna be the custom maps. Who knows, someone might end up making a Dota-like game better than HotS.
---
Try Windfairy to avoid any negative connotations
---
wait you have to pickpocket him? I thought you had to kill him and his adds.
---
It will run if you install Bootcamp and run the game with Windows. That's unfortunately the only way to get it running on a Mac that doesn't have the graphics hardware required to run Metal on macOS.

---
kek
---
I can see why you might empathize.
---
Yeaah, And? Did you forgoet 2006 was ythe year of addons for vanilla? TBC was released in 2007 ;)
---
I would prefer realms be the same size as they were back then. No one knows for sure exactly how many people are gonna be on per realm when layering is removed.
---
This is not guild wars 2 at all. I don't even see the similarities. Played that game, failed to do what WoW did right, and didn't do much to improve where it failed.
---
IIRC it says it in the quest text.
---
for the alliance!
---
&gt; Engineering without Mining will be very, very, very, very, very expensive.
---
Enginering without mining is almost as expensive.
---
&gt; Otherwise Tailoring + Enchanting is the perfect combo for light armor users.
---
Any combo that doesn't involve engineering is not a "perfect combo"
---
FLAG ES POINT RIGHT DOOR
---
&gt; And why they have a clear majority on retail. 
---
I mean they have in a sense of PvE, but when it comes to PvP you have a majority of EU **pro** players still playing alliance. The reason that horde is overpopulated is mainly due to PvE and imbalances through out the years that have given them the upper hand in PvE, but it's unclear how any of this has anything to do with classic. Therefore, if anything, it shows that more casuals play horde rather than alliance.  
---
&gt;Alliance had a clear majority population back in the day because people enjoyed being "the good guys" vs "bad orcs" 
---
This is not a fact, just your opinion. There's no proof of this whatsoever. How do you "know" this?  
---
&gt; And lets be real, Horde are just over all better in vanilla when it comes to pve/pvp racials and things like windfury(there's legit builds that can only be done with WF procs)
---
Orcs are amazing with their stun resistance, UD with WotF and Taurens WS. But so is Stone Form and Escape Artist too. Alliance are arguably the best PvE faction due to human bonus expertise on weapons for Warriors/Rogues. The paladin blessings are quite strong as well. It's no windfury, but from wisdom to salvation, the blessings are all great for PvE. I'd definitley give the horde an upper hand in early PvP cause Ele shamans can one shot players with no gear and stun resist is great when fighting rogues.
---
&gt; ... data from all of these sources...
---
I giggled.
---
&gt; And the polls even shows that on servers with something stupid like 65% horde and 35% alliance consider these realms consider themselves "hardcore" players. 
---
Checked the V4 poll. Nothing indicates that there are more hardcore players on horde (the poll doesn't include faction when it asks about what level of commitment your giving).
---
I'm not sure if punishing players for doing something allowable by game mechanics is really going to be as simple as you're making it.  The only thing that's kind of a grey area is coordinating with the opposite faction, and that one is damn hard to prove.  Price fixing and economic manipulation have been a part of every mmo and people don't get banned for it as it's as legitimate a play style as any other.
---
This isn't going to be as simple as blocking an addon and might actually fall on to players and not blizzard to police.
---
10 in the barrens ü§ò. Or 6 in whichever zone you prefer
---
my mom was confused when I knew what "necrotic" meant. Bitch, I played necromancers for years in Guild Wars!
---
Why 6 months tho ? Embrace the darkness, reach the record
---
Exactly. Imagine if quests were not preplanned as much, but more of things that just occurred.   
---
Were on campaign, we were about to go through dustwallow marsh, but lacking the equipment needed to move through we went back to the barrens to get some kodo hide. Tracking down a kodo was kinda hard due to their fast movement, however we managed to get a kodo that was old. We hunted it down, got the hide thus made some improvised tarps that would allow us to keep our stuff dry during the long walk to get to Theramore.
---
That was a simple one.
---
Imagine a road that is mainly travelled by miners bring copper to a larger road. Passing through the thick jungle, raiders were a common problem. When swords for hire were paid to follow along, this problem was reduced. With both sellswords and thieves being players a large economy might emerge. With less losses it might be economic to expand the copper mine further, leading to the area being strategic, thus larger factions get into the ordeal.
---
Call to Arms existed in vanilla. vQueue existed on private servers. Only a very small minority actually used those.
---
Addons aren't going to ruin the classic experience. People might, but they'll do that with or without addons.
---
I have made and deleted my three characters on Herod four times now as I decide what I want them to look like ect.
---
I have not lost my name once.
---
Log in, delete, make new character.
---
The chances of someone trying for your name at any given time are less than winning the lottery 10 times in a row.

Even ass hole has more use than people who don't corpse run.
---

This is actually pretty funny that you would point this out. The [zero to hero](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage?from=Main.ZeroToHero) trope applies heavily to wow classic, as well as most RPGs, really.
---
Except the entire process happens before the show starts in OPM.
---
Absolutely - they've learned to delegate and work as a team by account sharing along with becoming proficient at monotonous tasks such as grinding WSG.  It is going to come in handy when I hire them to put toothpaste caps onto millions of toothepaste tubes!

---
No, you can re-create immediately. It's not locked.
---
hey whatup :) im going fulltime in wow classic, join me on zalandar tribe eu rppvp!

Maybe...
---
Why were there other games installed in the first place?
---
Yes, as long as you‚Äôre only playing wow it should be fine.
---
The name "Dawn" seemed perfect for my paladin, bringing light and all that stuff. But there was no way my perfectly named paladin is gonna look like a scottish hobo. My heart was pumping as I recreated Dawn at 4 am, after practicing at least 10 times on a private server. I felt so relefied when I was done and nobody sniped the name. The issue was permanently running through my head "I got the perfect name... do I risk it and recreate or live with his flawed appeareance? Do I pay an extra 7 Euros and sub with my gf's account so I have someone to hold the name while I recreate...?" Glad I was able to put my worries to a rest. F to all the people that got their name sniped, seems to actually have happened to some.
---
You‚Äôll become so fat, have fun
---
"Google it"
---
Google is your friend.
---
Thank you! :)
---
That's awesome.
---
Yeah, because your friends and guild mates are always there when you have time to do something. Even more so if it is something no one else wants to do.
---
Besides, the best way to make friends in Classic is through dungeon groups. Which means you are fucked if you start and the chat ends up like this.
---
His version of precautions wasn't good enough. Preview ALL links off screen first. 
---
If the same thing happened to me, if I was a streamer? I did something stupid by opening a random link from an untrusted viewer... I would deserve to be banned.

Is this a butthurt lfg addon comment?
---
My friends brother dropped out of high school so he could lead his guild full time.
---
We would go to his house after school and wake his brother up at like 2:30 in the afternoon. He would then play WoW until we left for school at like 7am
---
I taught myself how to properly type playing WoW.
---
Didn't realise Questie automated your questing experience.
---
Rolling gehennas with my friends, glad your fulltiming classic! Have fun out there :D
---
reminds me of the path of exile trade experience circle jerk.... GGG sticks to this stance that they want trade to require interaction between players, so they wont put in an AH or otherwise streamline the trade system. Meanwhile, 99% of interaction is copy-pasted from a website, TY, or "fuck you thats an insane lowball"
---
You have the point... if this classic didnt launch in 2 days, it woudnt be such a big deal
---
This. Exactly this.
---
Hunter!?!?!!?!?
---
That's actually a genuinely cool suggestion about priests and pallies being able to consecrate the bones away.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs another option to go with two gathering professions at first. Compared to later expansions Mining was the profession that gave you gems you needed for Blacksmithing and - if I recall correctly - Engineering. I don‚Äôt know what all the high level Engineering stuff requires but ore and especially those rare gems will be very expensive. They‚Äôve been expensive throughout all of Vanilla. Maybe you can get enough Gold with Skinning until 60 but I wouldn‚Äôt be too sure about that. Gold in Classic is important and where you can save it you should. That‚Äôs why I wouldn‚Äôt think about getting two very expensive professions like Engineering and Enchanting in the first weeks or months of Classic when you need your money for the epic mount etc. 
---
Another thing is resources in Classic are rare and sparse, too. Not like retail where you can roam around and get stacks of stuff within 10 minutes.
---
And now their watch has ended
---
Doesn't matter, you do you.
---
Fat? the kids a unit .
---
That's private servers though, they're known to consist of extremely toxic and selfish people. Some of that will definitely bleed in to Classic along with the retail community that at the very least have a similar level of laziness.
---
If you want to avoid those people I'd suggest you pick a PvE or RP realm. If you don't want to do that I suggest you pick one of the PvP realms that will be added the day before launch.
---
&gt; Maybe for a time, but itll balance out.

It'll balance out by people moving out of the game to Discords and third-party sites for group finding. One of the benefits of the LFG add-on is that it keeps players in the game, instead of pushing them outside the game to find groups. It uses the same interface someone checking the chat channels uses.
---
There needs to be an actual usable avenue by which to find groups in game. Chat channels are probably not going to be that.

I did think about this but would probably end up dying irl.
---
You are addressing minor points and not addressing the larger ones.
---
If I can find a group faster with lfg tool than through traditional means, there will be fewer social networks forming.  Why ask guild mates when I can just use lfg tool, get a random group and never see them again?
---
Suggestion: BiS and Pre-BiS guides should be banned. It undermines my classic experience, because I didn't use them back when I started playing this game during Wrath of the Lich King.
---
Twitch client
---
ahahah im retarded
---
During Vanilla everyone ran back. Sometimes a person would ask if they can get a rez so they can go get a drink or something. Or you would have the new guy who would get lost and ask for a rez.
---
I think in general everyone just understood it wasn't fair to sit and wait for a rez. 
---
Will it be the same now? I honestly don't know as the gaming community has changed quite a bit since Vanilla. 
---
But Classic isn't for the average gamer so we may see a change in the etiquette we are now accustomed to.
---
What are you hearing about french coming to stalagg? Will it be a major part of the server? Like 10%+
---
I'm not really sure why anyone should care whether it's a personality or not.
---
My longtime Wow friend would always ask when they were going to add a skunk pet to the game, for years. They finally did in like Wrath or Cata haha. Unsure if her years of badgering GMs half seriously had any impact, but still fun.
---
Yes!!! It‚Äôs easier to see it if u press pause and scroll between the images during that short time. Why is it showing?

Oh damn you called me a dumbass how will I ever go on living.

Why is he garbage? He believes in freedom of speech not freedom from speech. Sjws are the cancer of the free world. They want to take away from others to protect there fragile feelings. When in reality all they ever have to do is hit a mute button or ignore.
---
I got most of my base ones off the twitch app, due to easy update functionality and they have a dedicated "works in classic" list. I am only using one other not from there which is Immersion Classic i pulled from wow interface that i hope works!
---
Because it wasn't a retail group finder... How do you guys still not get that? No cross realm, no teleports, still had to communicate and run the damn dungeon.
---
It "streamlined" spamming chat lfg.
---
&gt; So I suggest to ban Questie and other addons like it to increase socialization in WoW: Classic and improve feeling of WoW Vanilla Spirit.
---
I'll google the quest.
---
Can we stop being delusional ?

...for what exactly?

GAMERS RISE UP

the best answer to people asking for gold is to ask them to meet you in an endgame zone

If I come back, is there stuff I can sell to get tokens, or what?

I dont want to have to play retail really.

A lot of the hype party in this sub has never played Vanilla. No one can convince me otherwise.
---
My FWB is trying to come over Tuesday to just ‚Äúhang out‚Äù. I still think she is wrapping her head around the idea that I legit am focused on playing all week.
---
That and https://legacy-wow.com/ for now, i've found that there's quite a few missing from the Twitch client at the moment, but should hopefully be more populated a could of weeks after launch as more addon developers add support.
---
Nope it‚Äôs not locked so be careful so many sob stories of people just trying to switch how they look quick and lost the name in that time
---
fucking battlestation posts
---
&gt; If I can find a group faster with lfg tool than through traditional means, 
---
But you can't.
---
I play because it distracts me from my shortcomings in real life and allows me to feel artificial, short term gratification so that I can at least experience some resemblance of success and happiness, which I otherwise do not experience in real life.
---
I mean... I play because it's fun
---
Does blacksmithing ever become worth it if you're hung up on wearing as much plate as you can because of PvP, or just hands down engineering?

Did this for girlfriend. Had her open and design character and then i onsta tly deleted and she made her char.

Install via b.net launcher. Select WoW on left side, then choose classic from the drop down menu above 'Play'.
---
Sub as you normally would to WoW so through b.net account management.

Warriors are the optimal end game tanks and decent dps. Druids can off tank and heal pretty well. Paladins are mainly used at end game as healers.

But there's nothing wrong with ganking people in ungoro.

Of course it is.  97% of posts since the announcement have been butthurt retailers who wanted their stupid addon.

The dev said before this whole debackle he wouldn't be bringing the auto-invites to classic. So everyone made an issue out of nothing.
---
Thanks again :) I'm very hoping to do so in future, atm I'm learning to do this faster and better!

Real life&gt; video game

Are you looking for the perfect premade composition or something? It's not raiding. They are fun and powerful, go melt faces and have fun.
---
I think people are confused.
---
The innkeeper is where the vanilla random grouping tool was. The meeting stone in 1.12 had all functions removed.
---
That will change real quick when you arent being teleported to every dungeon
---
We (transfers) maliciously rang the gong right before server downtime on Ysera.
---
'cause of everyone telling us what time we had to do it at.
---
Now he works at an Advanced Auto Parts store and hasn't played wow since wotlk.
---
Ich habe es  vom  kiosk  da war aber nur noch 1 da

---
Nah they have an audience of people who claim that "alex was right" and that classic is not true vanilla
---
They are also heavily addicted to "F R E S H" realms and can not stand playing the same server for longer than 3 months, so these people keep those servers afloat
---
&gt; I know I'll never compete with those able to sink 8+ hours a day into wow.
---
It's not a competition.
---
I don't want to spread rumors and if someone knows where it was exactly (ClassicCast possibly?) but I faintly recall hearing a dev talking about varied server transfer cooldown? In otherwords if you server transfer to a low pop realm the cooldown would be shorter than a high pop realm to ensure that you wouldn't get stuck on a server with zero activity.
---
I‚Äôm doing my chilli cooking Monday morning before work.  I hadn‚Äôt thought about grabbing some taco shells to go with but I sure as hell am now.

ah yah good very nice you're so noble and great, you care about things happening about in the world and attack peoples lives rather then stay on point because you realize you are wrong. I'm sure that doesn't happen a lot nowadays no you're right I have issues you're so kind hearted :)

---
Ah yes must've been wrath then. It was a silly combo and pallys we're at their mercy
---
It's pretty much the same as for all code.
---
Run it -&gt; identify problem -&gt; solve problem -&gt; repeat until no problems are known.
---
If you had experience with addon development you could probably look through addons and see things that wont work and fix them without the running them, but seeing things break is a great starting point for knowing where to look.
---
What was removed from the client? The exact example I used were of addons that existed throughout the entirety of vanilla and were never negatively received. 
---
Addon police need a reality check and to get over themselves. Stop forcing people to play a game exactly as you want that is different than the original vanilla experience.
---
I reserve one slot in my bag for a stack of ammo for hunters.

Good bot.
---
There's a second far less toxic discord for shazz. However they still promoted the boosting services thing so I'm not part of either server now
---
&gt;Or we can just find alternative gear, that is slightly worse and go for the raid upgrade. We will survive the 2% drop in efficiency
---
We can yes. But people do look at the BiS lists way too religiously.
---
Why are all the PVP servers horde sided? Are there any legit alliance pvp servers for EST
---
Remember that as hunter you‚Äôll need to buy ammo and feed your pet!
---
Cool, now we can overreact in the other direction!
---
You can either run to your friends starting zone so anywhere between 15-25 minutes.
---
Or you can start when you all inevitably end up in the Barrens somewhere between levels 13-25.(if you're Horde.)
---
I was interested in bigglesworth until I got on its discord and found out the mods are trash. I dont see that server going well if that is any indicator.

My first memory of ST was doing a run to get a cool sword for my rogue. Lvl 60 warrior was gonna speed run us with his friend who was doing his rogue quest. I told him I‚Äôd give him the dragonscales as a gesture for the run. He left after finishing his friends quest but before the boss I needed. He asked me for the scales through whisper. Needless to say I did not give him the scales after abandoning me. Weeks later when I was finally 60 I ended up in the same guild as him and he became one of my better friends throughout WoW.
---
First we get Classic server - a big win for classic community.
---
Now they block anti-social addon - another big win

Thanks for keeping the vanilla spirit alive Blizzard !

---
&gt; It‚Äôs code that‚Äôs limited to what it‚Äôs allowed to do.  
---
This is called an API, and the WoW LUA APIs are not so limited that they couldn't identify your class/race/spec to determine how useful a piece of gear is for you.  
---
&gt; An addon can‚Äôt just randomly sim your character to find what your ‚Äúreal‚Äù gearscore is.
---
Nor does it need to. Pieces of gear are basically static, since the only real breakpoint in vanilla is hit rating. Every piece of gear has basically a set DPS worth to a given DPS character.  
---
&gt; It‚Äôs why we have a website that has to run 4,000,000 combinations to tell me what to gem.  
---
Two things:  
---
1. This is because modern WoW has more complex gearing than vanilla WoW. Proper gems and enchants and breakpoints with talents all contribute to a more complicated experience. Contrast against classic, where one piece of gear is clearly superior to another simply because it has more strength and 1% crit.  
---
2. Even in modern WoW, serious players often do not need to consult any sort of optimization engine before throwing gems or enchants on their gear. People who know their character inside/out, their stat priorities and weights, their breakpoints, and their playstyle -- the people who get #1 parses (like I often did, up to and including the end of MoP when I quit) -- often know what to do. Because even modern WoW is not *that* complicated.
---
Hahaha that final quote is amazing.
---
Damn, Thalnos was shaping up to be quite the quarantine server but looks like the cold frogs broke that.
---
Your toilet is not prepared
---
While heroic strike "technically" only costs 15 rage, you need to remember you're also losing a white swing worth of rage by using it.
---
On top of that, using instant attacks also contributes to your Deep Wounds uptime, so there's damage to get there as well.
---
If an addon was abandoned years ago is it disrespectful to try and update it or reskin it and release it under a different name with fixes? Trying to do right by the community
---
What is it you do?
---
You're right. Somehow forgot about Fury warriors. Was like.. Wouldn't that be a relatively good one for Arms pvp?

Well I know that as do many, but when people think of summer months it's generally June/July for summer breaks.
---
Why is Fire spec considered neutral for levelling? Granted I started in TLK, but in my memory the fights were basically max range pyroblast/fireball, fireball, fire blast, and the mob would be basically dead before hitting you.
---
No because that means I get a 5pm release. Ill be able to get home, sit and relax for 30 minutes before I have to log in and sit anxiously in a Q until I go to bed for work the next morning.
---
At least until April when Cyberpunk comes out
---
Heroic strike happens on your next swing so you lose the rage you would have generated from it. It's literally just do "+x damage" (which isn't a lot at all) for a high rage cost.
---
Mortal strike is an instant weapon attack, meaning the stronger your weapon is the more value you get from the rage you spent on it.
---
Instant weapon attacks &gt; on next swing attacks, always.
---
Yeah, as if WoW never had toxicity in the early years, lol.

Mortal Strike is an instant attack in between autos. Heroic Strike adds damage to your next swing.
---
it's about damn time, ty fo rthis post
---
lets pretend its 2004 yall
---
But they did it 13 years ago.
---
I met a lot of very nice guys through chatting in WoW.
---
It will be good for the general social experience if people will have to asking about quests instead of looking on markers.
---
Yes, many players will google, but solid proportion of people will ask in chat and solid proportion of people will answer, how it was in original game.
---
Its launching right at the end of good weather season here. So in going to be focusing my spare time on enjoying the outdoors. I have a long shitty winter coming that will give me all the time in the world for video games.
---
Spamming TwitchSupport for his unban isn't the way to go about it. He should just stream on Youtube day 1 and then move to twitch after. Maybe even stream on both platforms if he can.
---
You dont have mortal strike before level 40..
---
And Mortal strike is instant. HS is next weapon swing
---
In this fandom we say "how can you kill that which has no life?"
---
sure the random nobody on the internet is making accurate predictions, totally

Someone binging on junk food for the week isn't going to kill them. You aren't saving anyone with your self righteous posts.
---
If you don't wanna use the cancer that's the twitch client there's also warcraftinterface
---
For mutilating a good game then expecting us to be so thankful that they are finally returning the untampered version. Sounds like an abusive relationship to me. üò¨
---
This makes me want to actually play on a RP server. Thanks for the info,  I‚Äôll likely be joining them.
---
Always have cheese and lettuce around.  Not fancy enough for creme fraiche besides it‚Äôd dull the Carolina reapers I grew all summer in anticipation of this chilli.  Can‚Äôt fall asleep at the keyboard if your ass is on fire.
---
When a group's composition is 60 percent DPS (3 out of 5 group members), but 90 percent of the player base on at any given time looking for a dungeon group is DPS (I just made the 90% number up, no idea how many it really is but it's obviously very high due to the long LFG queues DPS face), then yeah you have a supply/demand imbalance. 
---
Most people simply dislike tanking or healing in holy trinity-based games, like WoW, which means you end up with an over supply of DPS. Hence, DPSers wait a long time for groups whereas healers and tanks pretty much get groups instantly.
---
you need to fuck off and get a life cuz not everyone wants to spend an entire night to find a tank
---
Lol
---
i defended it because everyone's argument except blizzard's was straight up dumb. 
---
they really know how to hit key points to make me okay with banning it.
---
This sub though? yea, no.
---
Holy shit, it's a game dude.
---
I agree. Cortello's Riddle was way more fun the first go-around than with a guide or addon.  
---
But what are we to do? I agree that it's not true to the original experience, but I assume that Blizzard created the addon system because people would cheat anyway with overlays or some other stupid system.  
---
People want fast gratification, even if it kills the long-term enjoyment of the game.
---
This thread counts for both right?

In wrath, I ran a pvp guild with friends and when we would do raids, we would invite random people from the server to fill in, and would distribute loot based on peggle scores.

Oh ya definitely not lol. I‚Äôll probably make everything random and then delete it when I think it‚Äôs safe to make the real one

Dwarf paladin is my favorite class/race duo.  But I'm always a rogue.

you know that u can just go ahead and remake it now? nobody will snatch it within the 5 mins 3 days before release

Haha, spot the butthurt teenager.

They are at their weakest in 1.12 and with the items they are doing a lot of match ups are going to be harder.
---
The one change I wish they'd make is to lock people to their armor classes. 
---
It would instantly expose all of the "class fantasy and immersion are super important" folks for the frauds they usually are.  The meltdown they'd have when their ridiculous random half-cloth set that looks like they just came out of a fetish club is no longer BiS would be glorious. 
---
That's easily one of the worst things about the pserver min/max culture, and it scarcely existed in actual vanilla. Vast majority of people just wore their armor class even if it was horseshit itemization -- you didn't have a raid full of fury warriors in fucking leather or paladins wearing wizard hats.
---
Shitty
---
i cant find the Auctionator there, is there something else everyone are going to use?
---
Kill the job interview, tell them you can't start until 2, 3, 4 weeks out. That way you can play as much as you want and rest easy you have a job starting. Win-win. Good luck btw.

Thank you. That saves me from reluctantly clicking it and then regret wasting my time on this nonsense.

I wonder if Blizzard is planning to be a lot more harsh on vanilla private servers once Classic releases.
---
That only really applies when you unruined it in between..
---
i agree!
---
Looks like asmongold‚Äôs weekly food supply.
---
Casual.
---
My point is the socialization aspect is a bold faced lie and entirely dishonest. And this is literally no different than loading up thottbot, getting the coords and going to where you need. To me it‚Äôs in the vein of vanilla and to make it exactly as pre-existing addons you could remove the dots on the first run through and they are added as notes after you have completed the quest the first time around.
---
All in all this addon does not affect the community so it‚Äôs not the same logic at all. And people need to stop trying to dictate how others should be allowed to play the game.

If you had 1v1 Feral Druid vs Rogue, you'd generally put money on the Druid. If the Druid opens on the Rogue it's absolutely devastating and if the Rogue opens on the Druid it's just a battle-of-attrition, seeing how long the Rogues health lasts vs Thorns and whether the Druid could put together enough healing to out-pace the Rogues damage. Druid PvP gear (gloves) also gives increased Stealth detection, it's fairly reasonable to assume that all PvP oriented Druids can pick you up a little better than the average bear.
---
The only time you'd really get a 1v1 (that mattered) is if you were trying to Ninja-cap flags in a battleground (AB or AV), meaningful 1v1 combat is otherwise fairly rare
---
+ World PvP ganking doesn't count for obvious reasons
---
+ Everything else you end up with a many-on-many battle for objectives
---
Rogues are insanely vulnerable if they don't get a meaningful opener (i.e. detected early, or they fail their opener) where-as Druids have options (and you can't really chase them down).
---
Consumables are only expensive if you're not willing to put in the effort to get materials yourself. Stuff like 'free action potions' are cheap as hell to make, much cheaper than [Restorative Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11452/restorative-potion) as oily blackmouths are trivially fished out from the low level zones adjacent to the faction cities (so you just simply ride out and go fishing whilst you wait for your BG queue). The same deal with things like Arcane Bombs, some people freak out at the fact you're literally throwing arcanite down the drain but don't bat an eye-lid at all the various 'raid consumables' some guilds make them farm. [Flash Bomb](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4852/flash-bomb)s are great for dealing with Druid and Hunter pets but getting the mats is a massive pain (due to how you get them). Thistle Tea is a staple (and pretty much a 'must have') for Rogues who need to do serious burst damage in a small window of time.
---
I could give more examples but it fundamentally boils down to how important 'winning' an engagement is to you. When you consider how long something like a free action potion lasts and that it'd literally let you fight in the middle of a melee whilst ignoring all stun/movement effects (e.g. think fighting over blacksmith flag) it's a trivial expenditure.
---
Let me move the goalposts back a little from "Dont you remeber how annoying it was to have to find a group by talking to peolpe"
---
"dont you remeber how annoying it was to have to run to dungeons eerrgghh, Im glad we can instantly teleport to them now. This would have never been possible without our LFG, God bless LFG"
---
The fear of that kind of add-on is if it got to the point of complete automation - if it auto trade posted for pre set amounts, it would be an issue.  Just having another way to display trade information is never going to be an issue.  It's like having a forum where you post rare crafting prices, or check server/guild discords for who is looking for what.
---
Because the age demographic Blizzard is targeting is older (25+) so no school schedule for them.
---
Murican timezones
---
From that it just looks like they are going to limit the functionality of it not ban it. So seems like it will still be helpful. Hopefully I don't have to talk to pieces of garbage like your self. Have a good day
---
Nobody ever wanted "NoChanges" they wanted the game to conform to their memories of it.
---
Everyone, apparently, has a shitty memory cause mods that do what ClassicLFG did AND MORE were around since like 1.4..

This whole thing is just mass hysteria perpetrated by a bunch of shitty people who happen to be streamers losing their minds over the imaginary utopia they remember Vanilla to be.

But great idea on washing the sheets, my wife's jaw will drop.

They ruined retail wow and now they are trying to ruin classic. They can play it however they want if they don't ruin it for us with LFG addon and other shit like that.

We destroyed that addon. I am proud to have done my part to defeat it.

Phases 1 through 5 are excellent, then 6 through 8 are so bad that mass suicides are triggered nationwide

Gurubashi arena even?
---
Or Call to Arms adding that everyone with a brain used? Oh you fake ‚Äúvanilla player‚Äù kids.

Blizzard already stated they will be breaking this addon in a patch soon after release.
---
Graffiti on the wall. That's a paddelin'
---
This was a thing before LFG as we know it. You could open a panel and pick dungeons you were interested in doing, and it would show a list of players on your realm / faction who were also interested in doing it or had started forming a group. You still had to whisper people and figure out who was what role.
---
While I don't disagree with what you're saying, I think it's missing an important point.
---
While it might not be mandatory or necessary, if you don't want to be the strongest you can be, why would you ask this question in the first place? If you want to pick your proffs by flavour or w/e subjective factor one might use, what advice can people give you?

Everybody was on thottbot back then anyway so it really doesn't matter.

That's honestly pretty pathetic.

Is that you stay safe?

fuck off with these posts

Its a great time to be alive in this world (of warcraft)
---
i did rank 11 solo queue ...looking back ..dont know how that shit was brutal
---
Blizzard don't really need proof, this isn't a court of law, you accept in the ToS that they can ban you whenever they want for whatever reason.
---
Yeah most people who obtained them did so in burning crusade at 70 I imagine, and even then I don‚Äôt think it was particularly easy
---
Is THAT what people are calling "social interaction"?
---
You fell for it.
---
Knee-jerk reply to thread title.
---
Yikes.
---
Wouldn't be hard to add a mouse click In to that script
---
If it continues shaping up as it has, It will easily be the worst community that WoW or likely any MMO has ever seen. It's going to make retail look like a paradise.
---
&gt; Wait... Really?
---
A warrior with two fairly meh one hands is going to out DPS a warrior with a two hander. If any warrior claims he wants Ass Candy for PvE he's either bad or lying. It's a PvP weapon.
---
Thing is, Hunters can actually use it in PvE.
---
An auto shot timer, bartender, and ktm are all I'll be using personally.
---
Yes, I am using it.
---
Love that meme S
---
Looks like it was published after Naxx release as it is listed under the raid section.
---
Wow is boring to watch.  It's all about the personality that props it up.  I think Chance is 100% correct in his statement of Classic Wow being boring to watch.  But games are ment to be played.  Not to be watched so I think the general consensus should be this.  This game isn't Fortnite.  It's not a neon clad spectacle to entice young kids to play it.  It's vanilla Wow.  It's a 15 year old game with dated graphics and dated combat.  But it's gonna be fun to experience it all again.  It's just not gonna be fun to watch.
---
Why can‚Äôt people just play WoW classic first? Complete the content and then ask for more? Let‚Äôs see how Classic responds after a year.
---
I don't remember Blizzard telling to go back to retail in their post. I don't think you get what people are saying is elitist.
---
Literally every PvP server has horde majority. And Horde has better PvP racials. Coincidence?
---
More alliance on RP/normal/pve realms coincidence? 
---
It's almost like Alliance players want less competition and Horde want more.
---
all i want is my BRE back ...to 1 shot clothies
---
As a weeb who doesnt play retail im offended by your out of ass statistics
---
You are gonna die and Debeka wont be able to help you
---
Wish I hadn‚Äôt wasted a day to take Monday off since the servers come up after work.

But I will just spend the day cooking a weeks worth of food haha.

It was subtle, but yes. They made a slight pivot and we are now doing something after.

CLASSIC +
---
It's not wierd, being able to go to ungoru and find content no matter what time it is is awesome.
---
Given player knowledge back then? Probably didn't even think of it as a tanking weapon yet.
---
Lots of stuff to do besides those two.  Hell there are so many quests to do its crazy.  Plus profs, exploring, economy is really fun if you decide you wanna be a tycoon and corner the market
---
Not but a lot of people solo dual boxed when they had the recruit a friend experience bonus ... so yeah one person can play multiple characters on two different accounts.
---
soda... u never know
---
For the horde
---
He doesn't say what you are claiming. That's just how it works.
---
So either get a valid source or you making things up. Simple as that.
---
Mechanics and rotations are pretty simple outside of a handful of bosses, but things like threat and debuff limits add a level of complexity that a lot of players will be unprepared for.
---
The wisest thing Cartman has ever said. But I have to say, where was the horde during this episode?
---
Sunder? Was this by any chance on Bleeding Hollow?
---
ye the cata pet, never got to have them in game, need some practice material, so decided to make them irl :)
---
What‚Äôs your twitch? would be cool to have it on another monitor while i play
---
It used to break up your party some of the time.  Not sure if that was a bug or not
---
rip double blade dream. never existed as an actual item...
---
\*diabetes
---
I almost shy'd away from hunter due to the stigmatism, but who cares? I get obvious things like taking a strength weapon or staff for mana, but people here have already told me they'll refuse to invite hunters.
---
I've had multiple people threaten to blacklist me for wanting to get agility and hit melee weapons. I've had people tell me they'll leave grouos as soon as hunters join. I've been told not claiming you're rolling on an item in a pug will get you blacklisted even though other classes don't have to claim they're rolling on things.
---
And if even you do those people will still leave. I was so close to picking another class, but then I realized I don't want to play with those kinds of people at all. People aren't going to take those ragers seriously anyways, but what would I lose from not playing with them?
---
Either I go to a dungeon and let everyone else have everything, make my own group for no competition (plan on it anyways sometimes), or those lunatics will try to shun me from all loot for wanting THEIR (in their minds) loot. Selfish bullcrap to sideline my character and ruin my experience by gimping myself for random people.
---
Yeah guild or friends have a priority system, but random people? Sorry bud, you're going to have to beat me in a roll or run the dungeon again. Happens with other classes too. I'm committed to hunter for the end game challenges.
---
I don't see Blizz even acknowledging the idea of Classic+ in that post, only BC is mentioned.
---
Personally I'd be more than happy with either.
---
Glad you enjoyed it my dude

Will be interesting to see how it falls out - this data set needs to get larger and even then it's only a survey. Plus attrition could make things better (or worse) as players who join for a few weeks go back to (non-classic) wow or drop entirely
---
and this is the toxic server owner everybody
---
Great, thank you so much for the response!
---
ah thats phase 3, could be a while
---
Coming back to wow after a 2 year hardcore competitive Fortnite grind.  The devs on that game have been destroying it from the inside out.   The community is ready to fist fight any dev on sight.  (Fuck you /u/EpicLoomin )
---
Seeing things like this makes me genuinely smile and excited for this game.
---
its funny, i didnt find them boring in retail but i just preferred monk/shaman but now I know ill need all the utility I can get so this is hard. Def going with rogue or mage so thanks for the info!

Then its a dps race
---
Mmm diabetes. At least get one of the caffeine energy drinks and not a shit sugar one.
---
Yes, LFG was welcomed with open arms, but it quickly became apparent that it hurts the community and the overall MMO experience. And this is only one of many other changes that made the game what it is today. 
---
Of course some people just dont see it, or dont care because they actually want LFG. So yeah, you can disagree. But the idea of Classic WoW is to go back to see what the game once was. Sure you can add LFG, sharding, realm hopping etc. , I guess some people would like to see this implemented.
---
But there is no point in doing Classic WoW if you want to add such game changing features as LFG. That is why people here are so butthurt about this.
---
Can you link me the logs from that raid?
---
I haven't really decided if I'm going to yet, but I made "wownub" for if I do. Thanks!
---
Toss me
---
What about toilet breaks?
---
i dunno about that bro.
---
that's like your opinion and stuff, but alright.. if you think the future is set in stone and is unchangeable, then that's fine.
---
you *must* realize, that at some point in the next classic games' lifespan, its going to hit the brick wall of the end of in-game progression (which is where TBC will be launched, but assuming that won't happen, they'll have to do something else with the setting of vanilla at some point in the distant future)
---
I took the time to edit mine and still got my irl name, youll be fine. Just go for the edit.
---
There's always going to be bias one way or the other. For one, we're but one of many communities built up around this game. Streamers have their own communities who are no doubt going to be centralized around the streamer. This community is also in fact quite anti-streamer.
---
i think it would be cool if the release each expansion with the same gameplay mechanics as vanilla. imagine playing BFA with vanilla talent trees and a level 60 cap. and all dungeons have vanilla difficulty, with 40 man raids. including weapon skills.
---
Literally 0 precautions taken heh.
---
Needs Fairbanks
---
Same! But probably won‚Äôt work much the first week of classic
---
Won‚Äôt be possible unfortunately
---
You were basically a piece of shit if you didn't run back with the healer. Of course if you needed to go afk for a legit reason it was tolerated, but to outright refuse to run back was not really a thing that happened due to how rude it was perceived to be.

If anything the best thing for alliance is gonna be faster BG queues lol.

That's a hard no on having your own opinion I see

Amazing !!
---
depends on the dynamics of your server
---
r u playing on herod? probably not. r u gonna be playing in premades and organize who gets it? yeah probably you can do it.
---
What are the streamer servers so I can do the same?
---
That's why I said "might", I think it's pretty recognizable if you have played wow for a longer period of time. "THATS A WOW SHIRT" might not be your first thought when seeing it but if you sat down with someone at a bar or something and had a closer look you probably would figure it out eventually.
---
Nope. You pretty much need to do 16+ hour days for multiple weeks in a row to even be in contention for HWL.
---
Thank you! I will come but I will tell them I won't be available to start until mid September!

Pretty sure Bloomberg was Mayor at the time.

so him getting shilled on here will get him twitter views but not twitch? you're not very bright are you
---
Ah, thanks! I thought it had something to do with streaming something, ha.
---
Thank you for posting this and showing that we aren't all stereotypes.
---
I mean, I‚Äôm not the one who cried about AddOns allowing for something that was originally in Classic and also preached #nochanges so much that Blizzard had to make a rather LARGE and IMPACTFUL change to the way Classic worked. 
---
Most people who agree with this change was upset first. Don‚Äôt worry though, the mass amounts of us that will continue with LFG AddOns will go on without you. *shrugs*
---
lets not get to greedy here just yet lol
---
Path of Exile?
---
Fuck I'm torn on the next league because of WoW...
---
Okay.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler, as far as we know, will be best in slot for Spelladins due to the 'Use' effect. That's because one of our seals, Seal of Righteousness, hits with every attack. ^(Unlike Seal of Command, but that's another topic).
---
Seal of Righteousness also scales decently^ish with spell damage.
---
Maybe, still beats the current buffoon.
---
Or you can sit in Orgrimmar spamming global chat channels for 2 hours each day saying "LF 3 MORE TANK/HEALER/WARRIOR FOR SFK", in light of them trying to ban the addon.
---
This time around we will be correcting the spelling of words like "racist" and "bigot"..
---
Is your experience relatively spoiler free so far? Have tou watched alot of videos regarding the game? If you are going in completely blind, id be down to have it on my 2nd moniter. I wish i could delete all of my memory of wow and go in blind again.. 15 years ago.. lol
---
I fucking love cream pies
---
You are right! The thing is that the boots was for tanking and I never tanked a single dungeon.. The worst deal I've ever done in my LIFE.
---
Yeah, this is almost worse than when analysts compare graphs with different axis scales.
---
please keep me updated if you don‚Äôt mind
---
Yeah no shit
---
Theoretically sure, you just need to grind more honor than everyone else on your faction. Realistically probably not since you will be up against people with more time on their hands to grind honor. Guess it would be possible if you join the best PvP guild on the server and if they will rotate the R14 between players.
---
This sounds like something a real virgin would watch

---
Does this guy just not give a shit about ruining the vanilla spirit of the game? The lfg part was the main social interaction that led to friendships and guild invites and he's just trying to remove it.
---
HAHAHAHAHA okay let me clarify! We will be organizing bathroom breaks together! So 1 person doesnt make everyone wait for 10 minutes. Instead we all go and only spend 10 minutes as a group. Instead of 50 minutes if we went separately
---
Then you must be able to give me a reason for why you believe that is the case.
---
I‚Äôll be looking for some streams exactly like this to watch during all hours when I can‚Äôt be playing the game. I‚Äôm in a similar spot where I played retail quite a bit but never before 2015 so I consider myself to know nothing about Classic. And I tend to favor streamers who just play the game from a similar perspective and level of progression as I am at, which is basically exactly what you say you are going for. I would follow and at least check it out if you happen to be on at times when I can watch.
---
I imagine a good chunk of player might not play without ui addons.  The default ui is just ugly as sin.
---
it always was, always will be... that's sort of why i made this thread, because there is no reason to invest time and love into a character that will eventually make me feel inferior compared to literally everyone around me.
---
Wow, sometimes it clicked for people when you told them how the game is played
---
Mostly PVP.  That's why I'm thinking just sticking with Rogue. I want to remain competitive.
---
ESH.
---
I'll be playing with no Addons until I raid, in which case I'll get Omen but that's it.
---
They lack comprehension... The player differences and volume between pservers and classic will be huge.  Not every classic player will be a basement dwelling no-lifer like on pservers.  Pre-raid BiS will mean exactly Jack snot to 99% of them. And for good reason... They'll get in to MC anyway!
---
Don‚Äôt hearth out before turning it in like I did the first time
---
That's the whole point of this post, so people don't end up on the wrong time zone...
---
Organizing group breaks!
---
If you do, make sure to chop the boss up by 10 min intervals for YouTube
---
In all likelyhood, no, but if (and that's a really big if) you get really lucky with your server *maybe*
---
Brilliant! Thank you for sharing this finding :*
---
In order to make cat DPS work you need a lot of stuff. 5/5 Furor from Resto. Natural Shapeshifter and Omen of Clarity from Balance. And then eventually you need the Wolfshead Helm and the nigh endless farming of Manual Crowd Pummelers. I feel like trying to make a cat druid shine is among if not the most irritating, demanding, time consuming chore in all of Vanilla WoW.
---
It's a shame about your Warrior tank friend, as Bear seems to be the natural default role for ferals. You guys would probably level faster as a 5 man if you went bear and your Warrior friend went Arms...bears make better, less gear-dependent tanks from 1-60 than Warriors. At level 60 you could then switch it up, with him going hard into Prot for raid tanking, and you playing Feral as a flexible OT that can pinch DPS and Heal as needed.

If I buy this budget build I‚Äôm looking at online it‚Äôll be like $635 and should get here on Monday or Tuesday

MrGM was just raising controversy for views. The dev was already removing those that ngs on his own, blizz ensuring they can't be added later is nice so that someone else can't go add it back in but anyone who actually went and read what the dev of the add on was saying would already know that the streamer was, as usual, full of shit and stirring up controversy for money
---
I'll try to tinker around with it, thanks for the idea!
---
The pale dogs approach!
---
That's pretty subjective! Even though I agree with your example.
---
The fact that you are even asking this.... combined with the size of the server populations.... means you will never get rank 14.

But it‚Äôs justifying spending $600+ on a computer right now

Do we really need Naxx out asap? Does it really need to be skipped like it was in the past one of their biggest regrets said MANY MANY times is they pushed TBC to early killing an entire raid tier

I hope we're all ready to gain some CLASSIC weight. Mountain Dews and Doritos are calling me (who eats nuts and drinks water while gaming LMAO)

Luckily I finished uni this July!

It's honestly mindboggling how retail players always paint vanilla players as this enclosed circle of people who don't want anyone else in unless they abide their rules, yet I never believed that because I didn't see that on private vanilla servers. But on reddit, people like you are everywhere, telling people who suggest something they don't aggree with immediately to fuck off back to retail. I guess the closeminded people were not a myth after all. BTW, a similar addon like this existed all the way back in vanilla and also on private servers just FYI.
---
Sounds like an investment well worth it considering what you are doing.

Make sure to stretch while you guys go hard. You do not want to mess up your body playing this game, if you haven't played marathon sessions in years and are now no longer young you will feel it the next day. Don't rest your elbows on the armrests of your chair for extended periods of times (you'll get ulnar nerve pain, which you feel in your pinky and finger next your pinky). Make sure you stretch your shoulders and pull them back, don't slouch.
---
Even if you played every minute of every day there would still always be someone higher level / stronger / better geared waiting to stomp your head in. 
---
It‚Äôs all part of PvP. Don‚Äôt worry about it, win the fights you can win, run from the ones you can‚Äôt and just have fun.
---
A shining example of how it feels to wait
---
Yikes did you have FXAA on in classic? It's super blurry.
---
Otherwise, nice comparison, seeing things in motion helps a lot compared to some of the stills people have already shared.

Its a spain + latam server, I don't know if I can say a pserver name

Bagnon or onebag is very handy, especially if you want to use an item you haven't hotkeyed etc.

I find that a good buff tracker can be pretty handy in pvp too; sometimes you won't notice debuffs immediately especially if you're in the middle of a huge fight.
---
If you‚Äôre above hit cap then you *never* miss!
---
All the better! Anecdotally I guess, but all my interaction with Northerners gave me the idea that you guys are incredibly genuine and honest to a fault. Hope to see you in game!
---
It makes sense for only one person to corpse run and res the group - this can be any of the classes which have the spell, not just the healer.   I agree it is bad manners to not say anything and expect to be ressed, but it is also bad manners to refuse to res people and expect them to run.  Better to ask for a res, or offer to res everyone so they can take a small break.
---
Read down these comments too. Its shocking how many people are desprate for a full LFG tool in classic.
---
You still have to talk. You still have to walk. You still have to coordinate to complete the damn dungeon. How do you guys not get this? 
---
There is no social interaction spamming trade and lfg chats looking for groups. All interaction comes after the group is formed. Which would be unchanged.
---
No I wana go to orgimar and kill people all day
---
tbh I liked BC's implementation of LFG.  The rewards for a specific boss kill were what bothered me most about newer implementations, because they encouraged ignoring everything not in the fastest path to that boss
---
Self harm  + porn = ban Kappa

&gt; Discord is more than a chat channel. It allows for cross-faction, real time organization on channels specifically dedicated to each realm, with no real limit on the number of participants. All anyone has to do is advertise the realm channel in game chat. It is even more powerful than the LFG addon because you can use Discord bots for automation AND you can contact players when they are not in game.
---
And all of these things have been a thing in the past ever since xfire, ICQ, messengers and facebook was a thing.
---
So - how exactly does Discord change the landscape compared to 2007?
---
I think some people vastly misremember 2006 and imagine it to be this kind of low-tech stoneage, when in fact most of the messengers we use today are based on applications that were conceived and updated between 1999 - 2007 and were already available during classic.
---
Classic on the 26th? Nerf 'murica!

I mean I'm not fucking lobbying for it, I realize it's not gonna happen. The no changes people won and are getting more or less the fundamentally broken game they wanted. 
---
It's just something that I would personally change about the game, because it's fucking dumb and goes against the idea of class identity which people seem to value quite a lot.
---
I have over a decade's worth of notebooks *full* of WoW chicken scratch haha!
---
what is push ups? if anything do earth downs my guy! gl on the leveling and speedrun 100 pushups in 1 minute
---
Rogue + Priest is nice. You can do well in PvP together as shadow+daggers, or he can heal instances/raids to make easy group finding.
---
Killing machines together.
---
It looks like a skylander :D
---
I'm not sure about the classic API buttsm can definitely make a macro and keybind it for you.
---
You sound like you played hunter like I did heh.  
---
Spirit Bond is a really dangerous talent.  It causes proximity agro when you are not full health, which can completely ruin some kiting methods.
---
Ah word , well if  you're gonna wait anyways take your time and buy your parts yourself and build it too you'll save even more money , as long as you get compatible parts it's like legos
---
I'm rolling UD warrior. Hate on me
---
Mr. Grady...you *were* the caretaker here...
---
Looks really awesome, definitely going to check out your levelling at some point. Wishing you the best! You're going to be making huge leg gains playing like this!
---
Not on a pvp server
---
Yes baby.  Yes.
---
They aren't talking about an in-game supported swap...

Day 11 Patch Notes:
---
/u/Buzzed27 raised a very valid point yesterday: You have allowed other people to influence this too much and now it's bad. As an artist when other people criticize your work you're supposed to say "Fuck'em, I'm always right."
---
And I realize now that I was trying to please everyone and that is absolutely impossible. So I've reverted some of the days back to the ones I liked best. Now I'm off to the beach for the day so I don't drive myself insane pacing around watching the count down clock, lol.
---
TL;DR THE PACK IS BACK, BABY!
---
I love the Horde races way more than the Alliance -- but Alliance has better cities and they have my favorite leveling zone (Duskwood). :(
---
No need to follow GOT, make it 500 years after or a 1000 years before GOT.
---
Alliance scum
---
Was it 5 minute buffs too!

Any word from Blizzard on a release date? I bought this immediately after it was announced. Can't wait to play it!
---
False.

He only gets like 20 viewers so no biggie hehe

The etiquette is, don't be a lazy tool,  run back.

---
From the weapon. Head shoulder legs boots / cape u already have a good idea if the person is geared or not
---
These have got me more so pumped for wow!! 
---
What are your plans for day 12?!
---
I don't see how gaming convention hygiene is relevant to completing your adult responsibilities before gaming. If you think basic hygiene is a big deal you have a very narrow world view
---
Yeah, every Wednesday. They're useful for sure, but I wouldn't rely on them to pick a main. Internet strangers don't know you as well as you know you.
---
I'd be a PTSD ridden mess if I ever got into that community by the sounds of it, lol. How did you manage?
---
I haven't played that series in a super long time. It used to be a turn-based strategy game backed up with a realtime tactical subgame (the actual battles). Is it not that way anymore?
---
It's great!  I like how you can move the key face around.  I have a claw grip and it's still pretty comfortable.  Lots of LED and macro customization too
---
I dont often "laugh out loud" 
---
I did just now :)
---
On the stress test I was level 14 aoe farming with arcane explosion. You‚Äôll be fine.
---
Back in the day when it first came out, I actually gave it a fair shot... The most notorious one I made it into ended up being literally 3 warriors, each one after the other, each assuming the next one would be "the tank", a shadow priest, and myself a mage. None of the warriors wanted to tank since that would invalidate their ability to roll for 2h weapons, and the priest didn't want to heal for whatever reason, despite the fact any of them would have worked. Needless to say the group went nowhere and disbanded.
---
You just have to be really, really petty about it.
---
Die, rez, get killed again, and then, this is important:
---
 - don't release spirit
---
 - target the camper ...
---
And go and make a cup of coffee. Do the dishes. Start or empty the washing machine. Every 15 minutes or so, check back in, and if the camper is still there, de-target and re-target him so he knows you're still there....
---
And then go and make another cup.
---
That just means killing them will be a greater pleasure. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I interpreted it not as a hunter being ignorant of the ammunition mechanic entirely (which is unforgivably stupid) but underestimating how much they'd need or just having a brain fart and forgetting to stock up before the first vanilla raid they've done in a decade and a half, if they ever have.
---
Lots of fruits and water
---
Cant break something you never managed to fix again :D
---
Maybe offer some "custom" spec shirts? I do enjoy mace spec on my warrior :).
---
Oh no I got you :)
---
It makes no sense for them to stop though.
---
There will be something. 
---
This launch justifies it.
---
Becasue its the easy way out. Its like saying why cant we use 500% speed flying mounts in classic wow? If people dont want to use them they can just not use them.
---
Who goes to gaming conventions?Gamers.
---
Everyone knows that a lot of gamers have a tendency to let even the most basic tasks(e.g hygiene) go to minmax. It's been a meme for almost 2 decades now lol.
---
Thank you for your contribution to the Classic Community!
---

---
Makes sense and thanks!
---
My argument is that the existence of addons of that sort make it into a bigger issue than "if you don't like it, don't use it".
---
If the majority of the playerbase feel like they have to use it, they will. I never wanted to use gearscore addons, but it didn't prevent its existence from getting in the way of me enjoying the game.
---
Take it from someone who watched addons slowly take over the game and the community to turn it into what BFA is today, and understand the skepticism.
---
Alliance because they have the sexier cat form. UwU
---
I don't know. As a Gnome I know I'll be fighting a lot of undead with will of the forsaken. And is escape artist really that good?
---
dude nobody has "settled" any server, this is not your Civilization V game.
---
To the top with this I say.
---
....dude wtf? I bet you don't even take your actual life this serious. Coordinating bathroom breaks? This shit is blowing my mind. So, if someone has to go, and another person doesn't have to go for 5 more hours, they just hold it?
---
OP, how about using Classic as healthy eating motivation? Any day you deviate from a healthy diet, you don't allow yourself to play classic, every day you eat healthy Classic is your reward. Go for it man!
---
Diet mt dew only
---
In all fairness, I'm sure some of these people try and fail because they get lost. I don mind rezzing the directionally challenged.
---
hello diabeetus
---
I *love* this dungeon. I started playing wow when j was 13 with my little bro and my dad. We would three man dungeons to level up, I tanked, dad healed, bro dpsed. This one took FOREVER, but it was so fun. 3 manning dungeons for us felt kind of like raids haha.
---
Okay but my whole arguement was that it's good as you're saying that the functionality is being removed and prohibited by blizzard. I'm not trying to criticise the dev at all or the addon in a state where it doesn't have the feature in it.
---
where are you seeing these numbers? the graph on this post shows 60% horde 40% alliance
---
This is a really common to hear in this subreddit for the last year. Not saying "repost" or whatever, it's just interesting seeing lots of people in other places completely dismiss this game from ever being wanted by someone. It got insanely popular for a reason.
---
People are joking about it, but honestly, why not just get rid of addOns? The argument against ClassicLFG and other addOns is essentially that, even though similar things might have existed in Vanilla, they weren't wide spread enough to be considered part of the authentic experience - and I agree with that viewpoint. However, isn't it the case that *most* players didn't use addOns back in WoW? My entire guild refused to use addOns all the way until the end of TBC.
---
You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in Elwynn and believe whatever you want to. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the honor farm goes. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth.
---
This is brought up very often and I can‚Äôt stress enough how trivial buying arrows and food is. I‚Äôd really hate if someone didn‚Äôt roll a hunter just because of well intentioned comments like this making a mountain out of a mole hill. Ammo is sold by all general goods vendors, and in some cases when there is not a general goods vendor the innkeeper or a fletcher will. For food, when a pet‚Äôs loyalty goes up it‚Äôs happiness goes down very slowly and you rarely feed it. 
---
If you buy new ammo pouches and quivers as you level all you need to do is stock up and keep one full stack of food on you whenever you go to a quest hub. Unless you‚Äôll be gone from a general goods vendor for over an hour and a half of killing you won‚Äôt run out of anno.
---
I mean... he's not wrong. Just because he happened upon one CS rep who knew what he was talking about, doesn't mean most of them aren't clueless. Hence why he said 90% not 100%.
---
Anecdotally, the one time I made a ticket about a bugged quest I got worthless non-answers from 2 different GMs before I got one who actually understood the issue.
---
Miller Light and what ever we have.
---
so great. this had me rolling
---
Amazing work once again dude! Love u stuff like this!
---
You and u/nenaiknedrom are making the assumption that all classic realms are progression realms.
---
It's more likely that TBC would have its own set of realms, transfering or cloning characters there would be entirely optional.
---
Baby carrots and a bit of ranch
---
I remember there was a HUGE post on the forums about this guy dead by the apples, there was quite investigation to whom was responsible for his death with some people speculating he was the actual Apple vendor that the orc leatherworker in Shattrath city was always yelling about.
---
Wish I could find that thread.

Whenever i mess around with clay adding new pieces smush the previous ones how do you deal with that? Does a skeleton underneath and hardness of polymer clay negate that problem?

2 min is manageable, given that I remember it taking well over 20 minutes just to get to some instances.  So it wasn't really the worst thing to be second up on a summon.

Agreed. I was referring to the mafia though. Can‚Äôt really have a mafia if there are several layers.

I didn‚Äôt say anything about grinding. I just buy enchanting mats from the ah and craft enchants for a profit

All my parts, besides the motherboard I just bought last night, are stock with the pc when I bought it. It has an intel i5 processor in it right now. But if I buy a different processor I can get a different motherboard too. Do you have any recommendations?

It slows it down significantly actually since if they run back they'd probably be at full health Mana by the time they get to where they died instead of everyone waiting for the healer to re them and then drink eatbuo and then buff etc.
---
That sounds a lot like Archaege which was ruined by bad management and a cash shop that required you to spend a lot of actual money to progress gear wise.

Just some ideas for you for great snack food :-

Breakfast bars

Nuts

Fruit

Carrots with houmous is a deal-breaker

You should be thanking this man and his ancestors for saving your from the horrors of nazi Germany.

Improved Rend is a trap-talent, at low level it literally doesn't increase your damage. It becomes alright after you've gained some levels and ranked it up though.
---
Careful OP, this could be called extremely toxic these days.
---
Have you ever seen a Vanilla pserver back in 2005? 
---
It's like 20 people playing on it.
---
So many pserver haters in this sub.
---
Pizza rolls, taquitos, nachos, mountain dew, Oxy, Lasix, dialysys,
---
Flying mounts change the actual game, tho. A easier way to find groups than spaming the trade chat does not.
---
Your processor and your motherboard is most likely not your problem. 
---
Return the motherboard and get a new power supply.
---
Exactly. Good PVP and fractals, but those are games within the game. It's not a game, it's a world, is the feeling that made WoW the game it was. GW2 completely lost the atmosphere of wow. Example, the transport system. Just move to the nearest waypoint, pay a few coins and that's it. Really doesn't make you feel like it's a world. WoW had the flight point system, but you actually flew over all the areas that you moved across, and that gave you a feeling of a coherent world. The only things that should behind loading screens in a perfect game would be those that made sense lore wise. Portals and teleportation is basicly it. Everything else is just a loss of immersion.
---
Were ‚ÄúMoral America‚Äù really watching South Park tho?

Oh, my bad mate. Early morning internet arguing got the best of me.

I don't believe there is, but if it exists, it represents only a very small portion of this sub. We have 215,000+ members from all over the world, on different servers, and different factions.

In what way do undead hold a 2hander? Can't remember seeing undead warrior much at all

Umm it was easy AF at launch. You could MC with a priest and do custom emotes to talk. Just /e hello let's jump farm the tubers so we all get a stack instead of fighting over them, or I'll jump you off a cliff with MC

What is that small screen to the left of you‚Äôre monitors? Is that a laptop or a razor switchblade?

---
Hopefully no auto invite or ability to see talent distribution and level.  Those should be communicated by the player or the group leader should say ‚Äúx lvl+ only‚Äù.
---
You're optimistic if you think they won't introduce microtransactions in Classic WoW also. There's no way they aren't going to monetise the shit out of it like they do in retail. This *is* Activision-Blizzard afterall. One of the greediest companies on this planet.
---
Yeah I just saw the link. What a joke of a group of human beings. We're all nerds here... But they're trying to suck power and meaning out of a pixel. Sad.
---
Yes, but to everything else.
---
I'm in college. My classes don't start until monday, most peoples are similar too. Ofcourse if you have a job, that's not my point. A lot of people are still in college while playing this game.

And you're just a random person on the Internet. I don't care what you believe, I've already gone out of my way. I'm perfectly fine with you not believing what they say, I gain nothing in convincing you.

I like to have a similar character to myself IRL. Orcs and tauren are too big. And trolls look horrible with most of the armors in vanilla. Undead is the only choice for me

They said all the hardwork is done already and adapting tbc would be incredibly easy now that they have the wow classic platform.

I always loved this dungeon. When I came back to WoW I was really disappointed how they gutted that whole dungeon. It was confusing.

Ketchup, or you'll be left behind.

Ahh :( well best of luck I hope you can figure it out before launch!
---
Kinda hard to believe it takes them longer to remaster WC3 than to completely rebuild WoW.
---
Oh,  well if you already tried a psu that works then you scratched that as a solution.  It did the same thing; turn on and immediately off? If so then the PSU won't be the issue.
---
I hope whoever he is he sees this and cringes harder than we are.
---
Put a price on your leveling guide.

Both but mostly bg spam

Nah, we should just ban people like you.

Sure thing. If we're around the same level :).

Thank you. I am pve!

If you go sunbathing this weekend covered in olive oil, some say you can "bank" enough sun for around 6 months.

Absolutely right. I did the quests because it upped my chances of invites to good groups.

These guys are acting like it was impossible to do stuff.

This is why streamers are cancer. Imagine being on a server with people who think this is news.

I'd also recommend getting some peanut butter and chocolate to go with those cookies~

---
Ok speak for urself
---
There's loads of videos of top Ret paladins doing well in raids. 
---
The whole ret meme came from nostalrius where Rets were bugged to do only 80% of normal damage. People didn't play Rets well in Vanilla as theorycrafting wasn't as big a thing. So here we are with countless people laughing about a spec that can and will be competitive with hunters or warlocks in raids. Players that minmax the class can crack top 10. Not saying they'll beat warriors but they're not as memespec as people give them credit for. Unfortunately many are clueless and just like to upvote the memes. 
---
Drakova and esfand were/are both top raiding rets that are extremely successful.

Well. Scruffy will die as Scruffy lived.

We just need a popular addon that automatically blocks users of that addon to make it less appetizing to use, before it snowballs us all into being forced to use it.

Read my reply,  does the new motherboard that you have power up with the psu you have then?
---
I've told this before but I was a Warlock running Mara and the epic dagger dropped off Princess, which has no stats and just a proc on direct spell damage.  I didn't even know the item existed.  A hunter rolled against me for it and ever since then I've had a bad taste for hunters.  Luckily I won the roll but I can only imagine the rage if I didn't.

Yikes

Part of me wants to try to enjoy this final weekend of my freedom from WoW Classic addiction... but then again, I should login real quick and check my characters again, brb.

I have potentially 3 weeks off for classic, I'm very happy
---
Someone with a brain would tho recommend you to play what feels right to you. Because you will spend hundreds of hours on that character.  If min maxing feels right to you, thats fine to.
---
Yeah that's a thing I miss from back than GMs were rememberable and interacted with their players.

I'm not too sure either, where would you put the extra point?

It's okay to just log off if you're getting ganked. I know I did it a few times while leveling up on Lights Hope in Ashenvale.

Its important to eat healthy when you plan on doing something unhealthy! Balance the scales a little. It also helps you focus for longer period of time.

if you playing for example a human priest and it actually affects 40 people... then those 40 people are not the ones you should be guilding / raiding with...
---
No atm it's a "feature" to being a Sub to Retail. Only retail has the trail *for now* and with how hold sellers and stuff work probably never be classic trail
---
It harms literally every person you're grouping with ever.
---
Probably hunter
---
Did you really buy that though, looks like its still at the store.
---
Looking at Warmane which was/is(?) one of the most popular realms, a full donor gear will cost more than year of retail sub, shadowmourne was like 90 dollars. They don't need all players to spend money, just couple of whales and occasional donors for an item or two which they use to allow people to skip queue. Some realms only let you skip queue if you donated that month... I have no idea how much it costs to keep pserver up. But I'm sure they have it figured out since Warmane has been around for over 8 years at least? Went through being robbed by one of the creators and all that drama, yet it didn't stop people from playing.
---
if you seriously think that someone not being the optimal race/class combination in a video game constitutes 'harm' then i don't think we need to continue this discussion.
---
I could see that, only thing that would cause problems with though is gold seller spam would be unreal again.

This is awesome. Anyone know where i can find more entire albums of old screenshots, I mean of high profile players like this.
---
Not annoying at all! Good advice all round :)
---
Blessing of Salvation is miles ahead of Windfury in any PvE situation. Also, you only need 3-4 Paladins to give everyone blessings, but it takes 8 Shaman to give an entire raid totems.
---
Windfury (the totem) is good in PvP, but even that is offset by the fact that Paladins can dispel magic and Shamans can't.
---
As some one who started WoW in TBC, I would prefer if blizzard released the content that wasn‚Äôt finished before TBC was released. Let‚Äôs not forget blizzard had unfinished content for vanilla.
---
Alliance sux ass
---
For the Horde!
---
Looks like Alexensual
---
I‚Äôm literally shaking right now I‚Äôm so scared.
---
Pretty much a useless statistic. One is being release, other has no new content atm
---
You need to listen to the other vent trolls. ‚ÄúThe ring‚Äù is another popular classic.
---
I've recently joined the Hydraxian Waterlords Discord (RP-PvE EU), and while the people on there are generally really friendly, the mods also have their heads so far up their arse that oxygen is no longer reaching their brain.
---
What is it with Discord mods? Are they so starved of attention?
---
Majority of gamers know concepts that will make the general understanding more clear. Back in vanilla most never played an mmo so the concepts were new. 
---
Nowadays most have played WoW and other WoW clones so we all know how shit works. 
---
Vanilla WoW is little league football while retail is NFL. We had more fun because we didnt know the rules and were just doing what we thought we were supposed to. In modern times you can google anything you dont know and get an answer, a guide, a video explanation, all the math is done for you.
---
I don‚Äôt see how this is WoW related.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to slaughter horde dogs in unfair fights because I role in a 5 man group. 
---
I will have literally no honor about it either I will gank you with my goons and spit on your corpse because I‚Äôm a terrible human being
---
You didnt see the post abut blizzard saying theyll limit the addon?
---
Limiting probably meansprevent auto invites, but the chat parsing will remain.
---
Otherwise a whole lot of other addons will suffer aswell.
---
Twitch emotes that are cringey af when used outside twitch
---
Not nice
---
Ah yes, I did forget to mention that in both this post and the video I believe. When I was looking it up once looking the Blood of Heroes elites will spawn from it. I'm not sure how many I saw "elites" so I'm assuming at least 2, maybe?
---
&gt; Well I rolled a healer on a private server 
---
There is the problem. Private server community does not exist. Players rerolled new pservers every 3 months. They didn't had any connection to their characters and their accounts, for more than obvious reasons.
---
Whatever you did on a pserver, you did in another game.
---
Not Vanilla.
---
As long as you dont use my special sauce. 
---
Guess the Devs vision is a fantasy land too.
---
That's a weird hot take. I'm guessing you're a gamergator or something? The dickwolves thing didn't really new crowd to Penny Arcade, it scattered considerate people away and attracted the anti-Social-justice types to them.
---
~~Infamy.~~
---
To help.
---
oh i thought it was easy to farm honor in AV like that, havent played wow in time as you can see
---
Playing some Halo 3 with cousins today then a 3500 point game of Warhammer 40k tomorrow.  Keeping myself super busy this weekend to avoid this problem.  Also figure spend some time with RL people this weekend since I‚Äôm going ghost for a while after Monday night.
---
I haven't seen this porno yet
---
Those who are going hard and not accustomed should also do some wrist/forearm stretches to prevent carpal tunnel. Or just stop playing if you feel those symptoms.
---
You joke, but that might be even better than zone chats
---
You made this? Kudos man great editing
---
I would wait til 60 to dance near stormwind ah.
---
Rep is hard to grind. But you will grind it eventually.
---
Alguien sabe donde juegan los espa√±oles? üá™üá∏
---
Last question if you don't mind, what would you recommend someone do who is primarily playing for the WPvP and 1v1's, when reaching 60, am I best gearing up in dungeons playing Combat Swords and switching to daggers when I am pre-bis?
---
Probably lives with his parents and admitted to playing WoW all day so no need for money lol
---
If that is true why even bother posting this every day, just post the 12days on day 1 and be over it. Totally forgot the community aspect of it. You were the one asking for good ideas in the first place.
---
&gt; As a frost mage, for example, my raid single-target rotation is just one spell with some cooldowns thrown in.
---
That's basically everyone's rotation in vanilla.
---
It will
---
Will be fun to see everyone rage because they logged in 30 minutes prior to launch and land in a 5 hour queue.
---
Why would the virgin be ahead of the chad?
---
Ah, i remember when guild were destroyed by the LFG tool in BC.
---
Oh wait, i dont.
---
That is false. 20-25 hours a week is around 3 hours a day. That is quite a bit of game time. The hardest part of classic with that amount of playtime will be leveling. After than you can log do a dungeon or 2 and log off.
---
   There‚Äôs no dailies in classic (until argent dawn?) So you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem enjoying classic.
---
Most raids do weekday night raids, there‚Äôs plenty of Guild ads here or on the WoW forums.
---
Just make sure it makes with your time zone, or if you prefer different hours explore a different region e.g. Oceanic.
---
Retail is more forgiving than Classic.  If you can't find the proper server, heaven help you when you try to take down Molten Core.
---
Tl;dr
---
&gt; It doesn't make sense to assume the casual level experience will be more crowded. It's casual for a reason. Meaning people playing casually won't be on as often. 
---
This makes no sense considering the casual population makes up 80%+ of the playerbase and everybody is going to try to login the first week.
---
Nobody is suggesting OP risks his career to play WoW. I'm just saying you're going to have a much easier time leveling if you're able to get out ahead early. Somehow you're still trying to argue that having significantly fewer people doing the same quests that you are is a bad thing.
---
Just a heads up, this thread is probably going to get locked. There are stickied posts to help people pick classes. But I'll try and help really quick if I can.
---
From most played to least played (generally speaking):
---
Warrior
---
Paladin
---
Rogue 
---
Hunter 
---
Warlock 
---
Priest
---
Druid
---
Simplicity wise, especially if you're leveling with a friend and don't want to heal, I'd recommend a Mage. They're not an underplayed class by any means but they have a simple enough PvE rotation and they're easy to level. For PvP, they have a lot of abilities and room to grow as you progress. 
---
Aditionally you'd be able to provide free food, water, and teleports for your friend to speed up the leveling process. 
---
Lastly, as a mage you won't be competing for gear with a Paladin so you'll be able to trade greens that you find and not roll against each other in dungeons as you level.
---
You must be new here.
---
Well, imagine something like EVE, but less hardcore and time consuming.
---
It‚Äôs the cabin fever... it‚Äôll be *slightly* less when the servers open.
---
Grobb
---
Am named Cameron as well. 
---
Can confirm, am hyped.
---
I dont see how you cant be social while looking for a group in the addon.
---
If anything it opens up more time to be social in barrens chat.
---
That's a name I haven't heard in a while. Didn't they have some scandal with the people running it?
---
I dunno, maybe it's just because I never found `/2 lfm healer ubrs last spot" as a particularly social experience.
---
Me neither haha, I enjoy tanking so I‚Äôm going Druid so I can at least tank for 5-mans every now and again. Won‚Äôt have the time commitment for serious raiding so don‚Äôt mind not being warrior
---
I don't know about most servers but Light's Hope was only accepting crypto a while back and may very well be because of what you're suggesting.
---
past decisions show that blizzard doesn't go back on what it says. so it may not be over for you, but it's over for them.
---
Except clicking on enter world?
---
To assume that I have is ridiculous unlike many I pay for what I get I don't ever take anything for free.. downloading illegally obtained music videos of All Sorts for free honestly there's a good chance there's a really f*****-up virus inside of them so no I'm not going to risk my expensive computer or any of my devices for a cheap shot
---
O sure, and we might not finish the instance, but I am playing for the journey rather than the endgame. Rather not finish the run doin the best we could while recruiting a 5th rather than have it ruin my time. 
---
I was at a tournament to play for the top tables one time and my opponent was a total asshole, so I forfeited as soon as I saw the match up. Lots of people asked ‚Äúdude, why forfeit the win‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI come to tournaments to have a good time, not for rewards. I might win the game but it would ruin my weekend‚Äù.
---
im eu and wish to be on a pve server. so can i just pick the server with the highest population soon as the game launches? i cant go wrong then right?
---
43 is considered exactly halfway in terms of time spent.
---
No server will be dead and even if it does die you can just pay to leave. Just pick any server.
---
Steak, jambalaya, tacos, fresh fruit, tea, water, tuna, salmon, coffee.
---
Sounds good, makes sense.
---
When did they say that
---
these are great.
---
do pvp and thats what you look like ;)
---
People who play wow dont have friends so you can play with them and be their friend. Now youre an everyday-hero. Wow is therefore morally better than going outside.
---
Almonds, cashews, apples (presliced), peanut butter, mangos (presliced), rotisserie chicken, white rice, broccoli (making several chicken + rice + broccoli meals), 10 frozen bean burritos, cliff bars, 30 pack of pretzels, 2 packs of 24 bottles of water, propel drink mix (or pedialyte), 24 pack of Gatorade, 12 pack of 5 hour energy, 12 pack of reign energy drinks, 12 pack of monster energy drink.
---
15 guys that were all spread out on various servers through TBC, so I'm not passing up playing with them just because they are ill-informed morons with bad taste and poor networking skills. I definitely wont regret this. Right?
---
Thanks, you reminded me that I am probably still feeling like shit because I didn‚Äôt drink any water this morning.
---
would love this too
---
Your kind is not welcome here
---
In TBC/WotLK I would just give them a gold ore/bar
---
Shazzrah
---
It‚Äôs all good, you can just pretend you‚Äôre doing research at home or finding relevant studies already done for reference.
---
30/0/21 is the best spec for PvP. 
---
You really have to spend 30 points in Elemental to be effective.
---
If you are geared well you can heal 90% of Raid PUGs.
---
If you want to join Hardcore Raids they will expect you to have Mana Tide Totem and you would benefit from spending more points in Resto.
---
This reminds me of TBC launch when my brother would blast the ingame sounds and music from upstairs while I had to sleep for school.
---
Do people honestly think they are supposed to just sit around or lay in bed all day if you're sick?  Why the fuck wouldn't someone be playing video games while sick?
---
Non-issue.
---
The sum is not 0, it is negative.
---
While the shitty guy leaves one server (+1 point), and joins another (-1 point), he also escapes the consequences of what he did (-1 point). He is also free to keep transfering multiple times without having to level a new character to ditch the bad rep he builds.
---
Tbc as well. Netherwing went from 6k to 2k pop. Pservers will be very low pop after Classic.
---
ngl so did I

Shirts are less than 1$, silk screen is less than 50¬¢.
---
You da real mvp
---
Exactly this, the racial becomes 100% redundant eventually
---
You'll be missing it. Rep grind is a big part of Classic and the +10% will add up for a REALLY decent amount.
---
&gt; You're not going to wipe because the priest is a night elf unless you're in a shit group to begin with.
---
Someone getting feared into adds isn't going to wipe the group? Are you seriously claiming you've never seen this?
---
Dis some bullshit
---
Me but with plagueheart instead.
---
The general opinion is that you will probably want full resto for progression in raids, and after acquiring better gear you can start messing around with your specs when raids are on farm status.
---
They were good looking by 2001 standards.

They look pretty rough now.

You think France invented America? That was George washington you literal idiot.

As a Warlock I love [Curse of Recklessness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=16231/curse-of-recklessness)
---
I had the opposite experience in game. I originally chose to be a night elf. Once I got to darnassus the toxicity floating around was unreal. I thought it might be better if I went to stormwind since it was more populated, but no, it was just as bad.
---
At least the horde kept that crap to the barrens, and always seemed to keep it as a joke. And anyone who tried to take it farther than a joke just got drowned in chuck norris jokes.

I don't understand your statement. I didn't say that playing 3h/d average is too low and you won't enjoy the game at 3h/d. I said it was the average.

Why is anyone stocking up on anything? Don‚Äôt know about the rest of you, but this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve played a video game.

You‚Äôll be downvoted but what the fuck? This has been posted dozens of times, same exact idea, slightly different execution, all low effort.
---
Where is the program I‚Äôm currently on a PPL but can throw some reps in while on zeppelin
---
Thank you man!
---
It will happen.
---
People will get scammed.
---
Just don't partake and it wont affect you.
---
The addon/third party program are not made to talk cross faction. They're made to automate everything, from tagging who's friendly or not in the opposite faction so you know not to kill them (discord is not enough for this, much too tedious), to knowing when mobs and nodes are respawning instantly without having to communicate, to blacklisting players for everyone to kill, to tracking players, their zones, their group, who they usually group with, when a guild groups up to raid or pvp, and more.
---
It's absolutely massive. I find that impressive. Such addons are pretty rare in WoW, the ones that do go to such extents to improve everything at once are usually very useful and popular.
---
Try this https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vanaskos

Ive always been a "no changes" guy, which i assumed was that they released the game as close to as it was in vanilla and then people play around with that old game in 2019.
---
But ive seen people that not only want that but they also wabt to dictate how people play, so that they play it the same way they did in 2006.
---
Extremely amateur, I'd say he got off easy it could've been far worse. Could've been malware or some shit.
---
No one cares.
---
But I should hold of going daggers before I at least have some decent gear at 60? Or should I just make the switch as soon as I reach 60?
---
and people complained that it wasn't actually hard, and now there's no LFG addons, and complain when it is actually hard.
---
I'm just gonna do beer, coffee, and water for drinks. ;)
---
It does have a role set, but it didn't early on. But when you click the stone you can pick between tanking, healing or dpsing, at least in 1.7 and forward.
---
Ion became game director in 2016. You think the game was great until then?
---
it will be funny once it's been posted 9 times, just wait.
---
You should read up on Elysium and what they did and delete your comment afterwards.
---
The gnome Int bonus isn't noticeable until the later phases in full raid gear.
---
Escape artist is a nice ability.
---
Human spirit bonus gives the player a few more spell casts before going Oom.
---
Perception is helpful.
---
Love this shit! To expensive though
---
I mean, saying any twitch emote, especially outside of twitch, is done ironically right? Actually I‚Äôd like to live in ignorance for this one and assume that‚Äôs true.

[Laintime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LftVFbJ4iO8)
---
Oh I 100% don‚Äôt doubt that. That wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if that was the only game I play. But, believe it or not, I also want to continue raiding in Retail WoW and play miscellaneous games with my friends. But I also want a laptop for when I start running my D&amp;D campaign so maybe it‚Äôs a win win
---
Haha thanks! Too bad I‚Äôm more of a PVE player eh...
---
Why repost after just 1 day?
---
Yes. You can. I respect the troops more than anyone. Your great uncle is a hero and a brave soul. Just like this guys ancestors who saves you from the Nazis. Instead of thanking him you reeeee over the food he eats. Sad!
---
No, what I'm saying is that fights are not balanced around people having particular racials. 
---
If you are wiping because of a fear, it's more than likely something that you can correct with better positioning, not a "if you don't have fear ward you are screwed" situation. After all, horde has to be able to clear stuff too.
---
Then he is LOST!
---
If the auto invite was removed it‚Äôd still require socialism to know what spec the person is.
---
Unless you plan on farming rep for fun, I would say its not worth it. 
---
There is 39,999 rep between Friendly and maxed Exalted. So you're looking at ~4,000 extra rep - which is substantial, but once you're capped, you get no effect from the racial. 
---
So unless you're trying for Exalted with things like the Timbermaw, Thorium Bortherhood, or the other Alliance factions, I wouldn't worry about it too much.
---
I‚Äôm still going to gank you.
---
I love classic guys:). They are very passionate and trully care for what they do
---
Nerd. Love it!
---
Some, yes. But you don't have pay to win in classic. Those people want to brag.
---
The only real issue you might face is in drop quests, where you have to kill enough mobs to drop the items for everyone. It's not like on Live where all the people potentially get an item from a single kill. 1 mob, 1 item, 1 person.
---
And re: experience gains: 1 player = 100% xp     2 players = 100% x 1/2   3 players = 100% x 1.66/3    4 players = 100% x 1.3/4   and 5 players = 100% x 1.4/5           
---
You can all meet at whatever small town with an Inn you come across after a starting zone. So for Horde, that's Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore where Tauren start, Razor Hill in Durotar where Orcs/Trolls start, or Brill in Tirisfal Glades where Undead start. No breadcrumbs necessary. The quests there are open by level. You CAN wait until the barrens if you want, but that's at least level 10, but I think in most cases you'll want to wait until level 12 to go there.
---
It's not confirmed but they said it's highly likely. It won't be there on release tho
---
Translating these for the people from the other side of the pond
---
The horde runs
---
Do you feel the earth trembling?
---
Do you see the smoke on the horizon?
---
Can you hear the drums?
---
There must be thousands...
---
There they stand,
---
in rank and file,
---
breathing the breath of death
---
Filled with hatred and wrath
---
they only want one thing; The alliance's blood
---
slaughtering everything
---
and nothing can resist
---
they sing their songs
---
and everything behind them burns
---
You want to safe your house and farm,
---
but you will not succeed
---
The dark breed is mighty
---
and you're a little wretch
---
Brave you are, yet also vain
---
I advise you to leave this land
---
Take a few things
---
and leg it
---
But if you get in their way
---
you'll breathe your last
---
Pack your things quickly
---
swiftly
---
Flee from your house
---
They'll cut your throat
---
or do worse...
---
Get lost, go away, back off
---
The horde will soon be here
---
Now they are here
---
you stupid fool
---
They don't know any mercy
---
They take away your wife and child
---
and everything you own
---
Hot embers,
---
as red as blood,
---
 is everything that's left for us
---
Mute and numb we are all ...
---
we are all doomed
---
(chorus) we are all doomed
---
\-
---
The alliance strikes back
---
You've murdered us long enough
---
long enough have you tortured us
---
This ends now
---
You've chosen your own Destiny
---
Your greed is your doom,
---
your overconfidence your death
---
Rage was your ornament
---
your future is as red as blood
---
Hatred and fear have you sown
---
a true masterpiece
---
It is to late for remorse
---
The alliance
---
it strikes back
---
The horde will be annihilated
---
before the next dawn
---
United army
---
your heart so pure
---
a thunderclap
---
gnomes, elves, humans and dwarfs
---
the alliance marches
---
Remember this is all your doing
---
now vengeance reigns
---
Can you hear what makes us furious
---
it is the melody of battle
---
It sings in our blades
---
whistles in the wind around us
---
For you this means pain and suffering
---
nothing more, nothing less
---
nothing less and nothing more
---
There is no question thread currently and I do not want to post a new thread, so hopefully asking here is okay...
---
How do I sub for WOW:Classic?
---
I have been out of the loop for a few years, so I am not sure. Do I just resub to BFA?
---
leveling and gearing at the beginning of 60 with swords is easier yes, so unless you plan to go full on dagger leveling starting with swords is better
---
There's an lfg channel IN THE GAME. I don't get how people are demonizing the add-on but think reddit or discord is so much better for finding groups.
---
Naerzone, you can't even enter the page without login in
---
Yes, 90% of twitch chat is ironic shit posting. Poggers is supposed to taunt people who used to use POGGERS unironically.
---
PvP gear is definitely not trash. Mage and rogue are the best PvP classes, pick whichever sounds more fun.
---
They could also break it by banning it's title, name, and or code signatures from being able to be loaded.
---
\*Repost\*

Adds have nothing to do with exact search history. It's based on videos you watch. He's watching wow videos so getting related adds

I've played a good amount of PoE since like 2014 and still have yet to experience one of these trade experiences. Mine are usually uneventful unless me or the other guy give extra currency as a nice surprise. Guess I'm just insanely lucky
---
Shadow is a solo pvp thing. If you have a warrior, you should be healing them. Shadow is extremely strong in pvp, but you're not going to be tagging around a warrior with the intent of keeping them alive.

Was questie broken? I set that one up on the stress test and thought it was working. I never looked into alternatives but might need to? Any recommendations off that list?

If forming a group by spamming General and Trade is an integral part of making friends for you, then you have shortcomings that no AddOn can fix
---
Most likely a very unpopular opinion. 
---
I think the models look like fucking **steaming hot garbage** and are everything but what blizzard have built up over decades to what Warcraft is supposed to look like. I'd rather have the old &lt;250 polygon models than these Chinese bootleg looking models... Above EVERYTHING else that will be "reforged", i hope you have a graphics setting that gives you the old models. Because f\*\*\*ing hell, i dislike the new models above everything else.
---
That's junk food your gonna feel like shit eating that everyday I hope you make better decisions
---
I think Twinstar as a whole will survive without major issues, but they will probably have to reduce the number of realms. They have a very solid domestic CZ/SK playerbase that went and stayed there because it was free in the first place, not because it was a different expansion from retail. Kronos might end up the casualty though, that particular realms was built upon vanilla sentiments, not upon being free. I've never played on Twinstar for longer than a few days, but I remember that their TBC realm was always the one that  struggled.
---
That‚Äôs great and all, but where is it?
---
Y?
---
Yes to this
---
Do it at 4 am and you should be good
---
Who‚Äôs in the top picture?
---
You: I did.
---
Could you make a big Raggy? :D
---
thanks.  I was testing mage out on lights hope and retrowow and it was fun, but I think it would get a bit boring after a while.  I'm starting to drift towards hunter now, but thanks a lot!
---
Because Blizzard is a business and anyone shitting that hard on their customers can cost money.
---
They wont let some sweaty nerds get between them and their profit, especially if those guys are being dicks in the first place.
---
Do you??
---
Man you never know. If WoW Classic ends up being a huge success they might just run with it
---
These guilds are so cringe lol. I guess this type of stuff matters when you have literally nothing going for you in the real world.
---
Yeah this sub is now filled with folks from retail.
---
All you LFG fanboys ruined the entire game. Also there is an explicit LFG channel, so take a fucking a seat in the corner, ya dunce.
---
Because nuance.
---
This addon has 2 part the chat parser and the auto invite feature.
---
I defend the chat parser thing and find the auto invite silly in a classic environment.
---
In vanilla most of the time at 60 u don't want twice the same classe for loot distribution.
---
No they didn't.
---
I understand that. But how is blatantly blocking users that use an addon any better? The addon was never planned to have the automatization stuff in its Classic release - people just got mad, because their favorite streamer said it's bad and didn't even make an effort to loop up what it actually will do in Classic.
---
Lol there will still be a queue papa.
---
Ain't no skipping what's inevitable.
---
a true poet wish they would have do/done another wow episode  but considering how the first one got produced i doubt it
---
It is pretty insignificant in the larger picture.... I dont think you understand how little people will exist in both games. So this drastically reduces the desire to seek a conversion of currency at all.
---
So, I've tried the Logitech G600, Corsair Scimitar, and the Naga Trinity. Razer has longevity issues with their products, but the Naga is definitely the best of the bunch. The G600 has squishy membrane buttons instead of mechanical ones like the Scimitar and the Naga. Corsairs software kinda sucks. The Naga Trinity has clicky mechanical buttons, Synapse is pretty bloated but works well and is easy to use, and it's the only one of the bunch that you can swap the side panel on completely. I've found I actually prefer the 7 button circle layout to the 12 button grid.
---
Brb creating puppetmaster on all avaible realms.
---
Yes, along with tens/hundreds of thousands of other people who will be doing the same. You're not going to magically avoid queues this way if you're already on a full server.
---
I want to lighten up as many people's days as i can before launch, if i can make one person laugh today that didn't see this yesterday, and make their day better, my goal is reached. &lt;3

I definitely did play ally on storm. But.now that i think about it I'm almost certain i was healing too. Either I'm misremembering or it just happened to other people lol. But i remember a tank trying to pvp dance and the hunter pet taking over that exact dungeon. Weird!
---
Couldn't agree more. Retail insta everything encourage these behavior.
---
Honestly I don't want another TBC. The story was incredibly jank and they wasted so many characters in lore. Now would be the perfect time to diverge the timeline.
---
Can you kick people while in combat?
---
Didn‚Äôt play previous to legion except BC and first half of wotlk.
---
no raid ever wiped because of a race\\class combination.  if you wanna min\\max go for it but no no one is going to care if you dont
---
How would they use discord?
---
Raided till AQ40 as 31/20/0. 36/15/0.   
---
No need for prot. Just good raid gear.
---
You took me back. Back then I was apparently a Satanist because I played Pok√©mon Cards and Yu-go-oh. And people who played WoW worshipped satan too because of the demons and stuff in the game.
---
My grandma was something else back then.
---
Not as unpopular as you may think.
---
I guess I'm the only one who will continue drinking water and orange juice?
---
I was Alliance until Wrath. Never leveled a Horde character until Legion. I am going to main a Horde character this time so the game feels new again. I won't have all the quests memorized etc. 
---
I'll still have an Alliance character though. I'm going to level them to 10 and park them in IF while I focus on my main.
---
And they regenerate health and there's nothing you can do about it
---
That‚Äôll sell for a few hundred gold in classic. All the bear tanks want it.
---
For the first time ever, I'm actually excited to work Monday. Thank God I took Tuesday off
---
the gnomes will avenge him
---
Many areas will be just fine, but certain zones like stv can be totally unplayable at times. You could be forced to do dungeons and grind elsewhere to level. Keep in mind at the beginning there wont be many level 60s to gank you for a little bit.
---
My friend group already decided on a realm and there are too many of us to attempt to change and still get our names.
---
Early development is different for each kid. Some kids are bigger than others and most even out around highschool, no sense in giving young kids 10-13 concussions and unnecessary injuries that early in life. Weight is usually the factor for youth contact sports, it's been proven to be safer. 
---
Youth rugby doesn't give a fuck though. source: rugby ref/coach

I would delete this if I were you, otherwise you're in for one hell of a treat.
---
Because these addons existed in vanilla and were a pretty core part of my vanilla experience be it CTA or vqueue. Its a shame to see them change the game like this
---
alliance. :)
---
That's a great use for it!
---
anyone who played vanilla 13 years ago with an orc could verify "it is addictive". If you only accept strict logic proof, then no. But I think the data is large enough to notice the difference between something like 30% and 6.25%.  I played an orc rogue back in vanilla, thousands of duals with roges, orcs and orc rogues. Based on my experience, 30% it is.
---
I must have misunderstood you earlier, I thought we were talking exclusively about how a PvP server would look like. Like your first comment and everything else until now that you conviniently swapped after my comments, which you also have decided not to argue. Almost like you've already decided how your point of view must be true.
---
There's nothing that points to that the alliance part of a PvP server would be more casual. The fact that PvE servers have more alliance than horde would also mean that most casual horde players have chosen a PvP server.
---
And how is it "more" competition to play on a server where you simply outnumber the opposition? Doesn't that remove a huge part of the competitive side? Anyone can win 5 vs. 1.
---
And about the PvP, I hope you enjoy sitting in routes or getting opened on by rogues over and over.
---
yeah, must be fun to farm a new weapon each time u want to dps a boss lmao
---
I remember a time back in scholo when we wiped and this mage didn't run and wanted a res. Everyone told him to run and just continued without him.
---
Because people enjoy the experience in different ways? Some people's enjoyment will come purely from end game 60 content. And that's OK. And those same people might not have the time to play and getting to 60 would actually take them months. So they buy a boost. They get to 60 faster, and they're happy and enjoying the game the way they want to enjoy it. Just like you who will be happy leveling up yourself and enjoying the game the way YOU want to enjoy it. I can't believe I have to keep spamming this everywhere but seriously LET people enjoy the game how they want to enjoy it no matter how much you cannot see why someone would enjoy it that way. But everyone is different and plenty of people will enjoy it that way.
---
If you want a fun experience just don‚Äôt play until the pack is gone.
---
I don't know he takes the time to make these things if he's going to misrepresent every single class accounted for to date. The guides are so cute, I just wish there were better, more useful information inherent within them.
---
For min-maxers it falls off big time tho. You want your MT to have TF anyway.
---
But... WoW classic IS retail too now?
---
We don‚Äôt have a crystal ball but the chance of it happening is there. You could very well be on a server where contested areas are just non stop war zones for the first week.
---
We don‚Äôt know, and if you don‚Äôt feel like rolling the dice to avoid the experience, just go to a pve server.

Check out the Hunter discord my dude. All you could ever want to know, and more. https://discord.gg/8TVHxRr
---
A ton of people are going to be playing female dwarf rogues this time because they want to be ironic and unique and quirky.
---
Warlocks have silence too. 
---
Not sure what their poly is.
---
You're right. I just remembered the buttons didnt feel as good as the naga when i did the switch a few years back. My bad.
---
Afraid this is not a new concept and not shortage of videos and guides on this topic. It will work great for some, but most would rather be using that extra time to just play the game. Not sit around and craft huge stacks of junk to sell. 
---
Being out in the world farming (if you can) offers much higher return and you also have the chance for greens, blues and even purple drops.
---
Yeah, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of drama between my guild and the Europeans on the NA Fairbanks server.
---
Don't worry, you don't have to play with us.
---
only 90's kids get this meme lololol
---
There is more to it than "spamming."
---
There is far more to it that you're ignoring or underselling, like the potential emergent social activity that it can result in,
---
versus an automated system that shuffles people into groups based on class, level, and dungeon.
---
There are many like you, particularly many retail players that never experienced anything different.
---
Give Vanilla WoW a chance.
---
Do disorients &amp; incapcitates such as gouge and blind fall anywhere on this chart? Or can they only be removed with Skull of Impending Doom?
---
For leveling you‚Äôd want to go Rockbiter on most of your weapons, unless you find a 2hander with high range damage. 
---
In endgame PvE, most enhance shams go windfury and likewise for PvP
---
think they would still be good? Cause I got one
---
Pretty sure the question is a joke
---
It's grammar, my dude.
---
As I said, you can do that, but no one would ever recommend it.
---
I came to this thread to trick and treat but im all out of trick. So here's your treat OP
---
,,l,,
---
Side-question:
---
Doesn‚Äôt this also matter if you want an alternative mount btw? As in, imagine the Orc wanting to ride an UD mount. He needs UC rep right? I wonder if you get that rep in Deathknel or Tirisfal glades?
---
I ninja your item i sell it to vendor for 2g 
---
I ninja your item and I can trade it to you? 500g plz ty 
---
no 
---
150 mbps 45 bucks a month. You‚Äôre getting ripped off.
---
Holy shit, they must be related!
---
Log in late to enjoy the game
---
Just remember the nost launch brings a tear to my eye knowing I won't get to experience it on a grander scale on classic. Hopefully the wife will let me skip away from camping life to watch a couple hours of a stream.
---
It‚Äôs doable if you‚Äôre ahead of the pack. The problem is they mean 7 real days not /played. Some people will make it in 5-6 days.
---
Sure, every mage guide takes that talent, but that's only in the 50's and that only because the majority of the early arcane tree is a flaming garbage heap and you need to dump enough points to get down to meditation on the 4th row.
---

---

Erect, more like it
---
See you on the battlefield alliance scum :p lol
---
It's bannable on blizzard servers though
---
I don't do well with discord to begin with, last thing I need is a server for every little thing
---
Yes, because of layering. Instead of having one layer with 3000 people online you can have ten layers for example with 30000 people online.
---
It's 10% attack speed for 10 seconds if you're at full health. 
---
It's certainly helpful, but it's not head and shoulders above everyone. On the other hand, orcs get +5 axes, which is great for threat gen and they also get stun resistance. 
---
If you want to min/max, orcs are probably the better option for people who will pve and pvp. Or even just people who roll on a pvp server.
---
I‚Äôm not even mad, that‚Äôs just impressive
---
Ill pass when I get Lokdelar
---
Step 1. This ain't it chief.
---
Reeee tail shill
---
There are some good plays in this. If anyone is debating playing a mage for pvp, look at it.
---
I am missing the context in here. When I started wow new I didn't understood the game and made mistakes.  What the downside of this trading I am missing?  Some gold farmer abusing this?
---
You can do this in raids in classic
---
I want to play so bad but I don‚Äôt think I have the kind of time I‚Äôd need to feel good about my progression

felheart is aiight. Just needed a proper helm. Those exposed midriffs though...

---
In classic you can experience the content as you want to. Blizz isn't sitting there behind you saying you have to do x for this long now its time to stop. Want to sell mats from gathering on Ah and buy everything you need do it. Want to sell things you made, like consumables, do it. Want to play the AH do it. Want to sell dungeon runs do it.
---
The game sets out some end goals and you get to figure out how to get there. Its freeing.
---
Fucking shill

I have one. [My armory] (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/sargeras/Goo)

I‚Äôve gotten to the point where i legitimately cant game unless my day is cleared. Ill try and play but there‚Äôll always be this thought lingering in my head going ‚ÄúWhat about your work/gym/house chores?‚Äù And i just won‚Äôt be comfortable. Maturity feels weird.

Saying that though, there‚Äôs no better feeling then sitting down knowing you have 4-5 hours of free time.

Casually leveling with a stream in the back, if I make it to end game - healing. Either in PvP or PvE

Not trying to hate but damn dude....you *seriously* need to fix your diet.

You don't have cable? Most cable companies require you to have cable to have internet, obviously so they stay relevant, I use my cable for the online streaming of their on demand services, plus they have live TV on their app.

Toxic vitriol would be "I hope you get a heart attack you fat sloth." I don't see anything like that in the comments.
---
It *might*, considering BGs are also coming with it, but 9 months to a year might be a better estimate still
---
Nope. It still took a whole raid at 70, with 8 tanks.
---
If you open the game itself, bigglesworth is west coast PVP
---
It will be a clash of veterans who believe it's their game versus the know-it-all's coming from retail. should be pretty hilarious

it wouldnt be that much money to make a few other zones and maybe one raid

Damn I need to set up my Alexa on my deck so I can jam shit that‚Äôs a good idea
---
i see a smiling dragon in the middle of the sun am i crazy
---
Mage has no downsides and you didn‚Äôt even list it!
---
Thanks for your input! Let's say I go with an arms specc with sword;  would I be able to perform adequately in raids as a DPS and an alright OT if my gear is up for the task? I may remember incorrectly, but I seem to recall that most Warrios chose Fury for PvE? I'm trying to find a specc that performs well in any situation
---
What was your character's name?  I probably will remember you.
---
I want to be able to be a badass at questing and grinding alone, but also do very well in dungeons and raids, and not be garbage in battlegrounds. Those are listed roughly in order of importance to me. 
---
I haven't played in 7 years but my main was a mage, which I enjoyed, but think I want something new.
---
FATHER TED MEME .... MY GOD. I miss home.

You're literally doing the same thing I just criticized you for, but OK.

Ok, I do trust and believe you, that's just on a level outside the scope of my comment. I shouldn't have said professional athletes when I meant just anyone who does marathons.
---
In the AMA they literally said the "enter world" button will literally become available.
---
True. I‚Äôm perfectly fine with it
---
really? THIS is the hill that you can't climb when it comes to healing? lol ok then...
---
Absolute arsehole. Just say no in future
---
good luck with that. this addon will be irrelevant in two weeks
---
How is the state of that in classic? Can you twink or is exp added in? I know they added an option to turn exp off for BGs but that wasn‚Äôt until much later right?
---
Get ublock origin or install a pihole and you wont get any ads at all, lmao
---
I think it‚Äôll be disabled by Monday, according to the devs. But yeah.
---
The whole thing is blizzard wasn‚Äôt specific in how they are are going to break it. Other addon devs are worried it‚Äôll break theirs too. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs being broken. I doubt blizzard cares about the rp addons because so few actually use them.
---
Chad is a state of mind. He plays the shittest because other people don‚Äôt phase him.
---
I mean it's not going to kill you, if that's what ur worried about. I wouldn't advise drinking more than 1 a day, but other than that who gives a fuck.

Go gnome or go home. Everybody knows that Gnomes compensate for their small stature by having a HUUUUUUUUGE intellect.
---
remove 4) ClassicLFG, its blacklisted now anyway.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm not gonna say a lfg queue like retail has is good. But this isn‚Äôt even close to the same thing. I don‚Äôt have an hour to find a group, 40 minutes to run to the dungeon, then 2 hours to clear it. I play a healer class and am still worried about finding groups quick enough to squeeze a dungeon in an entire play session.
---
Oh god you like this stuff?

Its not that there aren't a lot of small changes that could benefit classic. Its the lack of trust that good decisions for the game would be made. That and everyone has different Ideas of what's good for the game.
---
Should I go for the XL or double XL diapers. The double XL can hold more so I dont have to change as often.
---
There's tons of stuff to do. I literally never got bored at 60 because I could always work on a new goal :)

Dungeons
---
PvP in both the world and BGs 
---
Farming materials 
---
Leveling professions
---
Leveling alts 
---
In Classic, you're pretty much never going to be full BiS, so you can always get better gear.
---
There's nothing they can do, at least nothing that wont cause a fuckton of collateral damage.
---
English majors. Not even once.
---
Great Cranius reference
---
Here is the thing - nobody cares about leveling in retail at all. There aren't many new players anymore, so most of the people leveling are the folks who are maxing their fifth or tenth alt, and couldn't care less if it's hard or not. And the occassional new players are already pretty intimidated by the 120 levels, which they mostly have to do alone, now imagine if it was the same difficulty as vanilla - they would just quit the game after a few levels.
---
And the majority of the game is definitely not leveling in retail, it's endgame.
---
hmmm.

I believe the forum post is correct since it also lines up with the updated [WOW CLASSIC REALM NAMES AND TYPES](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-realm-names-and-types/246645). Hopefully blues can confirm though just so there is no confusion.

Played Shaman and Priest in Vanilla, and yeah like you said you may have some exceptions to the corpse run, but largely everyone would run back.
---
If any group ever sat and waited for rez like the OP I would quit immediately.
---
Before: Buy/bake/cook his favorite snacks/foods + whatever he enjoys drinking.
---
During: For the most part leave him be and let him play without interruptions, except for asking if there is something he would like (a drink or something to eat etc).
---
After: Do not guilt him, make fun of him and/or use any of this against him.
---
Forgot about that!  Thank you!!

I imagine there will be players never played wow or classic. One of my family member gonna try wow first time.  So the community prefer to call them ninja if they make mistakes out of ignorance or 2 AM on Saturday  instead of letting them correct themselves? But you do have a point the retail does have a mechanism that doesn't allow arbitrarily clicking need if you can't use the item which we don't have in classic so this might now work.
---
It doesn't make sense because it takes longer, and half the time there will be trash respawns that a healer can't solo so now we've all sat there for the duration of the corpse run and then do a second corpse run! Vanilla dungeons are more than long enough on their own. Don't make them even slower.

I‚Äôd say it is worth it if you are rolling night elf and plan to pvp. If you‚Äôre horde then you can skip it since warstomp.
---
Some people are slow learners when it comes to new trends, usually these are older, dumber people who view the world with rose tinted glasses.
---
These same people forget that slang and shorthand has existed in the past, and it will continue to exist despite them kicking and screaming about it.
---
Huh? Where is Paladin?
---
Honestly,  no idea however the dev keeps it constantly updated so there's no reason he shouldn't for classic
---
I mean, we all know that Alliance players are either 12, or betas. Compared to Chad horde players they don't even stand a chance
---
Everybody runs because chances are you are going to have repops or patrols that the healer can't deal with on their own.
---
Also it's really shitty to just sit there and wait.
---
Mages technically have a stun. You can get a 10% chance to stun with fire spells
---
No broken if you use it alone without any other addons. It did not play nice with some things. BUT that more than likely has been addressed, so give it a shot.
---
No german guilds there? Too bad.

Most raids will be master loot. I expect most guilds to have rules about selling raid gear. I‚Äôd be mad if someone got an item over me then tried to sell it to me.

With no gold in the economy at first, it might be tough. Skinning is an option here, just to get more stuff to vendor. If you plan to play quite casually, you might just level slow enough that there'll be more gold in the economy, making Mining or Herbalism more viable.
---
An example mage going Tailoring/Enchanting might level as Tailoring/Skinning, and then drop skinning and go for Enchanting at max. Leveling and DEing greens will ensure you are super poor anyway, so, not a great idea. It might feel like you're throwing away materials by vendoring greens, but by not doing it, you're making getting gold while leveling much more painful.

this isn't gonna end well for WeakAruas. fixed your title for ya

Nothing to do with being hardcore. I just think the game would be more enjoyable if addons didnt exist. Dont get mad.

Huh... How 'bout that...
---
Streamer drama = auto-downvote, every damn time.
---
Tbh, I don't think the majority of players ever did.

And while wouldn't mind the lower skill floor granted by lack of boss mods, I'd mind the lower skill ceiling tbh.

Nope, once it reaches 50g it stays there forever

Thank you for clearing that up!

I like how you know mexican coke is best #cocacola #elchapo

imagine a pug just randomly having 5 dps that can spread and threat bounce bosses while dps racing it down. thats a reality i would enjoy as well, but not one i have ever experienced.
---

---
I mean I play a lot of video games normally but will be playing way more than usual next week given I took time off work and this is the only time classic will be released. Kind of a weird position to think that people on this subreddit aren‚Äôt gonna be absolutely diving into this game next week.
---
Get a load of this normie with his "healthy" food
---
Yeah, it is bad desing, but I don't really see a good solution for it. MMOs are not as big as they once were, so there aren't many new players interested, and even if there are, they're probably gonna play Classic because it's a fresh start.
---
And honestly in its current state, taking out leveling would be an improvement. It's really not much more than a chore, but I don't think it's just Blizzard's fault. The level squish they're planning might help it a little, but I don't think anybody cares about leveling anymore, just endgame. And this isn't exclusive to retail either, there are a lot of people here who are planning to get to max level as fast as they can because they're only interested in the endgame.
---
Turning into retail does break the spirit of classic lol
---
No you can't go farm a bunch of shit that's not in Retail and transfer it over.
---
the same way drm sort of works, They can blacklist the code of the addon itself without affecting anything else. Yeah the dev's could keep changing everything around to try and escape but its a losing battle and curse will just remove it regardless.
---
Depends on the situation. Often when I get home from a day of *hard* work- it was more accurately a day of lot of time consuming work.
---
Karlskornit checking in! Where is this? üòç
---
Done that many times, just continue without them. 4 man'ed many runs due to lazy dps.
---
You expect people to actually read an addon description? It has LFG in the title, that‚Äôs all some people needed to know before jumping to conclusions.
---
You got downvoted but your right.
---
Chicken salad and crackers? Yum. Its one of those things you don't think to pick up at the grocery store, but when you do, you're like "Why did I not do this sooner?!?"
---
I believe you need to reach lv 10 before that kicks in
---
Having a gold of 40 people or so active members that really cared about each other. I couldn't make friends when I got out of the system that weren't trouble for me until WoW.
---
i already see myself missclicking xD
---
Makro? *clever girl*
---
Here is my take on things. I cleared the content back in vanilla as resto, so now I wanted a change. It took a lot of searching, but I found a guild willing to take on a few "meme specs" (and actually let me play the class and not just totem twist auto attack) in order to increase the challenge of the content. Are we competing for Server firsts? Of course not,  and we all accept that. Guilds like this exist because Classic is about creating your own experience with like-minded people. I still am expected to drop WF totem for the melee group, but I get some freedom. A good chunk of my mana from totem twisting will be saved to use stormstrike, which we allow despite not being a meta debuff. Will I be top dps of course not, but I can put in an honest effort and not be pigeon-holed by conventional meta ideas. Will I even end up enjoying this niche I carved out? No one knows, but what I do know is that the possibility is/was there to do so.

Cuz bg and open world pvp are different. Not to mention the non pvp servers. I can understand the fun in twinks but it just ruins the game for most other people. Yea 1-2 people are having fun but the other 20 are annoyed that they get one shotted by the obvious twinks. Not to mention the difficulty in balancing all classes at every level bracket. 
---
And remember that everyone will be their real level not the fake one like now.
---
We still have it in retail?
---
The fact that you're looking at it as binary as "being able to clear or not" doesn't make it sound like you're shit, it makes it evident.

Imaging the classic wow Dev team saying your add-on is breaking the spirit of classic wow and they're against it, and continuing to develop it anyway. I know someone joked about making an add-on that auto ignores people using the ClassicLFG add on but I'd definitely use that.
---
Yes he covers that but it goes deeper, and has earlier roots. Recommend a watch!
---
Fasting works but from what I understand you need to have a certain rhythm to it. If you're eating regular meals then forget lunch, dinner and breakfast the next day only to start back up on lunch your body is going to hold onto just about everything from that lunch you eat. 
---
That's my understanding of it at least, I could be completely wrong.
---
Well this isn't true at all, you only needed 4 tanks at 70 and you didn't even need 8 tanks at 60 because there were working 6 tank strats. 
---
Also you did not need a full raid at 70, half was enough to get through without much issue.
---
My child is 3 weeks old. I feel you homie
---
But the "slippery slope" argument doesn't apply in this context. 
---
The community has been rather vocal about not wanting this add-on. People only feel like they have to use it when the majority of the playerbase already does, to the point where (in this context) the add-on is the primary way to make groups so not enough people are making groups outside of the add-on.
---
This community doesn't want the game to progress, they want the game to be a "true vanilla experience", the people who want the continued development will return to retail after they try it out and get bored, leaving you with those who want to maintain the experience.
---
In that circumstance, the add-on users will always remain the minority, so unable to force others to use it.
---
Things like this may have ruined the experience for you last time, but the community is different this time.
---
Doubtful that anyone will think its anyone other then the tanks fault to be honest. I was didn't raid during vanilla but I did play and I was a Warrior. It was during the last few months of Vanilla but I did reach 60 before BC hit. I think the thing that made me hate tanking the most.... and why I ultimately raided content as fury... Was the horrible experiences I had as a tank during my entire leveling process in Vanilla. Of course I would later realize it had nothing to do with my own lack of skill. I also did off-tank in raids for years after but I would never be a main tank because of earlier bad childhood experiences as a tank in Vanilla.
---
I‚Äôm not looking at it that way. You seem to be though.

Global launch + the existence of time zones = this release time for the US.

Wow, what a surprise. Majority of player base didn't use any addons back then. Doesn't mean that addons didn't exist.
---
If PvE is your focus Gnome is the easy choice. 5% INT is minor, but the Pally buffs are huge. That said if you're only playing casually it's not going to matter as much.

Your pick! ;)
---
I'm of mixed mind.  Five years ago, I wouldn't have trusted the community to correctly weight anything.  The majority of people I dealt with up until Cata who had opinion on gear had the *wrong* opinions on gear, and Blizzard eventually smoothed things over by mostly making item level the only stat you needed to know, with the occasional trinket-based exception.  
---
But vanilla, these days?  I can at least see an addon author who has well intentioned and reasonable accurate tables, something I never would have believed possible back in the day.
---
Except a single faction thing isn't what is being planned on servers.   
---
If alliance guilds choose to dominate the market and horde players just don't bother then that would be okay. If horde fights back and theres a constant battle for rare items. I think the PVP community will love this.
---
the problem is when Horde players kill Alliance members not in the mafia in order to help the mafia procure goods. This is 100% bannable and will be. If it was a single faction there are always chances you lose your chance to tag the mob and it goes to another player.

People dont have an issue with people locking down the market place. Its when you control all the spawns and force people to have to use the market place is when people have issue. The only way you can do that is by colluding to keep the spawns all to your guild / the other faction guild.

Which is my point. It probably works for some demographics/scenarios and some it doesn't. And here comes my point again, Blizzard PR probably knows better about this, than some armchair Reddit user telling them they need to bring the commercials back.

If your tauren racial (I think its ~+500hp when geared) is needed, that means that your hp got lower than 500hp, this means that your healer is doing something horrible wrong and you will probably wipe anyway
---
I love druid tanking for just about all content. Druid healing not so much. That being said, rolling for offspec gear is usually a norm. So do it all and play whichever you enjoy more.

Also this sub: "Except break that addon we don't like even though it's only using the old APIs."
---
Lowers by 5g a mo. 
---
The guy you are replying to is wrong both about the costs and for whether it lowers.
---
Blizzard never banned anyone for using an addon and i doubt that would change. It just simply wont work when you load into the game and If the dev's change the code significantly enough to bypass the block the new version just gets blocked. We've already seen this happen in retail.
---
Thanks I'll try and let you know how it goes. The organizing breaks is so you aren't afking every other half hour for someone to do something

Don't see anyone asking this- why isnt it in first person? wouldnt that be way cooler for VR? to see the skyboxes and experience it in that new way

I would have posted it. ‚ÄúFuk this gaem, &amp; all u snobb 70s‚Äù
---
While I had a night elf priestess too, I never understood why their racial spells were allowed to be so bad for so long. BC addressed it pretty well (with buffs), and then after that they just gave up and deleted them.
---
You could certainly make arguments that they were good for pvp (they were very hard to kill, even if their damage was..inconsistent to say the least), and for the final imgur album we actually adjusted that https://imgur.com/a/rG21yQ8 
---
In PVE aspects though they did suffer quite a bit. Not only was their damage completely sub-par, but they also competed heavily for gear with warrior, who blew paladin dps out of the water. This makes it very hard to actually get the gear to even make the pvp work well, and could cause some drama in guilds (When everything goes to shit in a raid, the first people targeted for blame will often be the "meme" specs so to speak)
---
The gametime does
---
Regex failure
---
Lol blizzard are fucked if the addon devs stop making addons, they have been carrying the slack for 15 years now.
---
I would sub out the vitamin water, and maybe the gatorade, for something else. It's a whole bunch of sugar that won't help you in the long run, even for staying awake for classic. I just mix up some water with salt, potassium chloride and a tiny bit of baking soda when I'm fasting, something similar might be good here.
---
Book is correct. Viable =/= Optimal
---
Once you hit 30 your doctor tells you you have bad cholesterol and are gonna have a heart attack at 50.  You do what you gotta to stay alive and play classic wow the next several times they re-release it.
---
I guess you could do it. I did it back in the day. But yeah there‚Äôs always a risk of getting banned. They actually don‚Äôt ban you permanently for powerleveling, they only suspend you for a couple of days.
---
To keep up with people that are power leveling their own self to level 60. They are not playing for fun. It cant be fun to play for 12 hours a day to rush to the next level

How does it get info about your talents? Does it auto inspect people? I can do that myself manualy. Does it read from armory API(don't even know if there will be WoW Classic armory)? Then it is not 100% updated and again I can do it myself manualy.   
---
I don't get this 'no talking involved' stuff. I literaly cleared 3/4 of TBC content with a guild and I never talked to anybody, both chat and voip included. The only interaction I had was writing application, writing 'hi' once when I was invited to the guild, signing up for the raid in calendar and whispering my dpk bids to raid leader. Why? Because I simply didn't have a need to seek for a friends in a video game.   
---
In Legion, which was already super streamlined with every activity and super instanced I made tons of friends, mostly PvP one simply because I felt like it. I wanted to make some buddies that I can play with so I started talking to peole.   
---
No addon or feature will ever take ability for you to build social connection. It's up to you and your social skills if you will make friends in a game or not.

Generally speaking, WoW-related imagery over non-WoW related imagery is scrutinized under the "low quality memes" rule. Of course, a removal is under a mod's discretion (thus you see this content pop up into the top page and such), and some let certain memes that fit the criteria slide. Reporting it brings it to our attention sooner so we can see the situation and act based on the rules (in the sidebar) and our best judgement. If you feel this removal was unjustified, hit me up so I'll review the situation further.

I drink them pretty often tbh. I work an active job, and have been a weight lifter for 12 years or so. They give you a nice boost, and if u get sugar free, you won't really crash. Drinking them a few hours before bed is a bad idea. Are they healthy? No. Are they as bad as all the ignorant people on this sub say? God no. 
---
 I read on another thread a guy saying if you drink pre workout for a week you'll have a heart attack. These people are so misinformed, so I suggest anything you read here you take with a grain of salt and research yourself. The recommended amount of caffeine a day is 400mg for an adult. If you don't want to crash and feel like shit, drink only water until you drink your energy drink.
---
If you're 14 hours into a 16 hour session, I highly suggest not drinking one. It'll keep you wired for at least a few hours.

&gt; he broke the rules there‚Äôs a consequence
---
Life really doesn't need to be that black and white
---
Also, people are outraged because of Twitch's inconsistent decision on rules
---
It should have been released literally when they confirmed the classic launch date. No better way to build hype than to make an announcement and then immediately give people a taste of content to talk about. Hell even Fallout Shelter being released at the Fallout 4 reveal was a huge PR move that generated hype and that's freaking Bethesda.
---
Really sad to see they delayed it so hard.
---
Yea mage was absolutely astounding in classic, easily one of the better classes as they had very little downsides
---
You have 100 blue coins (regular people) and 5 red coins (streamers). You put the coins into a bag and draw out 5 coins. The statistical likelihood that ONE streamer gets beta is 1% out of the population, and guess what? They all got beta and their streamer friends who weren't even interested in classic WoW got the beta aswell. Don't be delusional.
---
I think in the end, everything *is* technically viable. Raid groups will just always choose the higher performing of them.
---
When it comes to PvP or solo players, though, there's a lot to be said about a person who goes against the grain but still plays so well that they can make a name for themselves. That's respectable.
---
Heresy!
---
Yeah I remember having tons of fun in Highschool with my friends in WoW.
---
My major thing is the idea that "if it's from modern wow it's shit" is ignorant af. Do I want the LFG that modern wow has... Absolutely not! I don't shit on every person that suggests something or brings up an idea though.
---
I was really pointing my comment at those individuals, most of which were probably only like 7 when Vanilla ended and TBC dropped lol. Also the individuals that make up bs excuses why something shouldn't be included. 
---
I want Vanilla, but I don't really want Vanilla exactly TBH. All the bugs and everything that they worked out over the years, I still want those fixed. I'm assuming that most of the private server people also want that, might be wrong though.
---
Fuck this add on. It wasn‚Äôt in the game originally and should not be now!

Yup. It is how you describe. He's wrong.

Do you see the right fats here ? .....
---
I think Tauren make for better tanks that trolls.  I don't think you'll be in bad shape as a troll though, especially with the extra threat as Hathan explained.  
---
Tauren have two racials which help with tanking- they bigger hit box is usually a very small boon, and of course, extra stamina is very legit.

This isn't a server or version thing. This is a "are you a lazy asshole" thing.

Vanilla raid mechanics are not difficult enough to require DBM. The game is designed around it now, sure, but back then? No one needs it.
---
Why do advocates for the addon continue to mischaracterize CallToArms? It wasn‚Äôt nearly as powerful, and couldn‚Äôt have been due to the API not being available in Vanilla for it to work as it was planned to.

Thanks so much for these Ravenholdt. Any chance for a Tauren warstomp? I‚Äôm rolling Tauren for the first time and not sure if their stomp has a specific /emote.
---
I would down vote you twice if I could.

he is a classic wow youtuber thats just started streaming

You‚Äôre moms so fat it took Thanos two snaps to send her away

Yea, isn't that the whole point of the pre-patch?
---
Read my comments again, I haven't defended BFA, I think it sucks. But it will have an audience regardless. People who are looking for challenging content from Classic will leave empty handed. The most challenging part of Classic is leveling but when that's over then it's really over. Dungeons are easy and raids are even easier. There's nothing you can do other than attend. Your performance doesn't matter, everyone can do one button rotation. There's nothing to learn and no room for improvement. Some people want this from games and they will play BFA.
---
Yes they do. Grenades, Impact, Blackout, tidal charm. Plenty of stuns from just 3 classes.
---
what happened with weakauras?  
---
Also sounds like the functionality being limited more and more is the addon "crosstalk" of sharing spec and listing groups of other people with the addon.  
---
Sounds more and more like the chat parsing and triggered invites will work.
---
"attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely."
---
To play the pessimist, isn't this describing RP add-ons as well?
---
wanna see probably the best and most skilled vanilla rogue? dudes videos and timing are insane.

I'm sorta in the same boat. I tried to get some friends to play P99, but they never played EQ before and the client being so outdated frustrated them too much.

I'm 30, weigh 175 6'2. I can easily eat all this type of food and be perfectly fine(just have some big shits)I hate energy drinks though.
---
Most everyone's body's are different and how food reacts to them as well. I'd just want a lot more red meat in there.
---
Ah yes, the PvP Acorn trinket
---
The difference is Rouges can actually use the bloodfang set without any issues. Paladins are stuck with this awful looking mishmash of cloth, leather and plate if they want to be optimized for holy.
---
Because flippant internet remarks, no matter how offensive, should be treated as such. You're never going to police the internet, take a breath.

How can you not do something you already did?

Everybody: Multiple monitors

Me: singe monitor that's not even 1080p

The hooves are the most ridiculous. üò§
---
Which server is that? :D I was holding that name for few days on one of the EU PVP servers until I deleted it to make one with a name mor I like on Firemaw when it released.
---
My prep so far. Just need to buy drinks and some snacks now and I'll be set for the first week.

His name is actually Rapeface. Not sure why the game let me have the name
---
I started WoW about 2 weeks after launch. I also figured classic was just going to be nostalgia fuel that would just die off after a couple months. I opted in to the beta just to try it. In the beta there was definitely a lot of nostalgia and "Oh, I forgot about this!" but that's not what kept me playing. It was fun. People were throwing buffs on eachother, helping with fights even though they got nothing out of it, and just helping out in general. I felt like the tradeskills I picked were actually useful even below max level. Hell, even below level 10 they were helpful. 
---
Basically, it was a totally different and more fulfilling experience than retail. And it got me hyped for a game version that I hadn't cared about up til I played it again. And now I can't stop watching WoW classic youtube videos and browsing this sub.
---
This came across as more of a WoW-aholics anonymous post than I intended.

No thanks. I never planned on using this, I just don't care if other people want to use this.
---
People like you are part of the problem. That addon  will not do that when classic launches as been stated multiple times.
---
R.I.P Hayvengames

Communicate with bots, very social
---
&gt;"attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely."
---
It absolutly changes that. Again, if people without the addon are excluded from these trades somehow, the addon will go down for the reason qouted above.
---
You can't just ban an addon in their addon model.  All anyone has to do is just change the name.  The only way is to remove core API functionality that the addon uses.
---
Oh god it really made BC-WOTLK grouping so toxic .
---
Thanks for reminding me -___-

True, true kind of forgot the return part

Ill just open my front door. He knows what to do
---
This joke is both old, wrong, and quite frankly it's really offensive.
---
The French have fairly consistently fielded the world's best armies throughout history.
---
Also, where's your respect for the French who fought for US sovereignty?
---
And where's your respect for the French who held off the Germans while the British were evacuated to the safety of the British Isles? 
---
At a certain point a joke is so horrendously bad it's no longer funny, it just reflects poorly on you as either ignorant or straight up awful.   
---
Not to mention: **unoriginal as hell.**
---
Ps. Am not French. Am not offended.
---
Ah, the old time travel nap
---
Can you provide evidence for your claim? I don‚Äôt think this is true.
---
Well shit. What would you recommend that's just as good as mage but fun in both scenarios?
---
Needs more cheesy poofs. Better call Mom...
---
If they drink energy drinks like they're supposed to (tl;dr drink water, sip energy drink), then that's by far the best option.
---
Yup.
---
Cant really stop this from happening.... but a majority of classic players have no issues with personal income, so a much bigger factor is trading real life currency for vanilla gold.
---
1hr of work for an average adult probably buys 1000g by the time the economy stabilizes.
---
I think I saw somewhere that trade is layer specific
---
I will say an edge for a hunter is the variety of pets and their pet abilities that they have access too. You can find a pet that fills a hole with what you need. There something like different 15-20 types of pets you can tame. 
---
With lock it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs like imp for dps, void for solo, fel or succubus for PvP; Fel against magic and succubus against melee.
---
This was a troll? Are you 12? Jesus this entire exchange with you was weird, grow the fuck up lmao 
---
Honestly who unironically trolls people in 2019. Man, you‚Äôre weird.
---
Pi-hole will block all adds on your home network, they wont even be downloaded so your usage will be significantly less as well.
---
I've played wow since 2004 I enjoyed classic I also dont see anything wrong with this addon tou dont speak for everyone so wind your neck in mate
---
Is it weird I haven't been to mulgore in \~12 years and I know EXACTLY the spot this was taken from?
---
No, your point was that people know about it so it doesn't require any advertising, which is blatantly false.
---
You can eat junk food just wash it down with plenty of water and you‚Äôll be fine. And black coffee, the true gamer fuel.
---
I've been waiting for this for so long and still no announcement for its release date. I really hope it doesnt get cancelled.
---
I got a flask as a groomsmen‚Äôs gift once, it got me in a lot of trouble as a 19 year old.
---
I'm set on Shaman as my main but that only changed like last month
---
Yes, so great, many claps
---
I'm sure all the people that were spazzing about it will feel much superior as they sit in their LFG discords now.
---
Thank you :) as for the ribbing, I made wings smooth(ish) and then added sausages of clay and smushed and sharpened those :) 
---
Sculpey 101 Class by Josh Foreman on youtube is where I learned most of what I know, highly reccomend it!
---
Please stop advertising the addon for fucks sake.
---
Just me and 39 of my closest friends

Druids are fun. Someone will have a place for you. You just have to be comfortable being a utility player and take the time to learn/gear all specs.

Every time I try this, the MT dew always leaks out of my taco before I can  get a decent bite in.  I have figured out a way around it though - if you make the Mt Dew into jello and cube it up, it stays in the taco shell much better.  The downside is that you have to heat the Mt dew to a boil, the add the jello mix so it'll set up- which completely ruins the carbonation.  Anyways, after the jello is chilled down it goes well with the taco shells.
---
Long as they don‚Äôt ban questing guides. Then I‚Äôm fucking done. No way in hell I‚Äôll play without them. 
---
People are so adamant about banning this LFG tool as if finding groups without having to wait around with your thumb up your ass, spamming chat for 30 minutes is a bad thing.
---
My Vanilla WoW Undead warrior MT looked freaking awesome in Battle Gear of Might wielding Quel'Serrar and a shield.
---
Yep this. Paladin warrior is by far the best duo in the game.
---
Yeah man wtf. They tell us to move from Herod, so we do but ultimately it's looking like Stalagg is going to be more crowded than Herod.
---
his cyber cafe would have been the perfect place to play classic.

shame that all his computers all got stolen by pure coincidence on the same night his wife moved out for good
---
I wanted to use the name dawn, but it was taken on every realm :/
---
I dunno it's a terrible post anyways lol
---
Mostly for aesthetics and because Will is still a strong racial.
---
In before the community wants Blizzard to ban streamers from leaving Faerlina.
---
You really trying to argue that no raid ever wiped on nef from the tank getting feared, and no raid wiped because the tank took 2% more damage than hp?   Ideal race combos are not necessary, but it's asinine to think they don't make a difference.
---
Personal preference. I rolled an Orc Elemental Shaman for PvE back in the day, despite Trolls being inherently better at the time (Berserking = dps). People just play what race they want, not everyone is a min-maxer
---
It's designed for boiling water from a kettle. The only time it has problems is when you don't stack that sunder, then the dps goes to jelly.
---
You can combine the macro with any spell too. I plan on just binding it with my mount button so I dont even have to think about it
---
I would have gotten so much loot!

Queues on the streamer server will obviously be 5+ hours, which means Asmon will be rolling on another server. It's basically a roulette at this point, but all I know is one of the east coast PvP servers is going to get absolutely screwed over.
---
Atleast I know my full server is safe from this inbred
---
Entering Barrens though is pretty bad ass. The music there is really good imo

The grape Bang is the only one I can drink taste-wise. Has a ton of caffeine.

What was he banned for?

&gt;&gt;e-celebrity nobody says something
---
&gt;WOW OH SHIT STOP ALERT THE PRESSES
---
This is you whining about streamers literally two hours ago.
---
Your tone in calling them "whiny crybabies" was pretty indicative of your personality. You can dance around with semantics all you want, but you're guilty of the same shit you vilify streamers for.
---
Runescape is a good example.  The thing is usually played modded with runelite or some other client.  The experience is similar but the QoL improvements are just such a big improvement.  In classic I wont have time to play like I used to, maybe 30 hours a week if I push it really.  Losing a whole day to find a team?  Not good.  I still planned to use discord or something for that anyways.   Some people dont wanna hear it but if you limit wow classic too much it will only keep its most harcore audience, it wont grow.
---
Feels good to be safe on Highpop Herod.
---

It logs you out after 30 minutes, so I suggest you log in 29 minutes before launch to do this
---
Not necessarily, they could simply prevent Addons from searching for specific terms like LFG, LFM etc...
---
stay hydrated tier post
---
Excellent work!
---
"FUCK STREAMERS, THEY SHOULDNT HAVE QUEUE PRIORITY".

---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQdxHi4_Pvc is better with better production quality

I'd honestly pay extra for a server where every single mob is elite. The community would be fantastic if you needed to group for every quest.
---
Mexican coke is better because they use sugar instead of corn syrup
---
Such a humble start for the beginning of WoWs LFG cancer.
---
I played in Vanilla. I can't speak for the functionality and usability of Call To Arms, but I can say that no one used it, so it was effectively worthless as an LFG tool.
---
Why would you even play then? Save yourself and everyone else, don't play classic
---
Oh man.. that sucks. Especially if you want to get into the professional business.. Hopefully he‚Äôll get a reduction..
---
I'm glad you guys are taking a stand for the gay community in Classic WoW.
---
Hes not going to be able to appeal a 3 day ban lmao. Twitch takes like 2 weeks to respond. Don't bother.
---
I thought they only did it if someone petitioned to have your name.
---
Don't worry, Asmongold is famous for saying he's going to do something and then not doing it
---
Good comment!
---
Most of the tier sets looks like hot garbage.  I am 100% excited for no cross realm stuff and server communities, but this subs autistic hatred for being able to mog your armor is retarded.
---
Grats on having on of the 4 or so decent looking sets while everybody else has to look like a godamn clown.
---
I‚Äôm rolling Troll priest just because everyone picks UD priests.
---
Fuck off with the streamer drama bullshit
---
It's just amazing that someone tried to take every single name of yours.
---
I dont watch any streamer at all, but please feel free to explain this asmon hate.
---
Maybe a petition to unban him? Upvoting a reddit post won't do much.
---
Oh not saying it‚Äôs not BiS. Just saying you can still use it without tailoring
---
I love my doggo

It‚Äôs just 3 days. He can just stream launch from elsewhere

More likely the previous person just gave it up for another name due to the 3 name cap, not that they lost it in the 2 mins it took creating a character.
---
Human Mage, because I can't gnome.
---
This means someone tried to take my names?
---
WeakAuras, you committed the ultimate cardinal sin, you got personal. You, as a team of professionals trying to make money, got personal. You got personal and decided to insult your playbase, calling us "ass-hats" and "freeloaders". Not a wise move.
---
We won't forget this. You've set a new tone for the kind of interaction we'll be having with you. It's a cold one. One where there aren't any illusions about the reality of the situation. Previous notions of "family" are dead. We are mere consumers to you, and that is obvious.
---
You have chosen to bring in a new era of hostility and bitterness. Well done. Great PR move.
---
Well, some things in life are not provable and we can only debate our opinion on them. I'm glad there won't be LFG addons in classic.
---
I just can't care if it's suddenly too hard for all the tryhards.  I think it would be hilarious.
---
And here I thought Amazon would side with Sylvanas and the Horde cause of the whole Brazil thing.
---
Lmao
---
It seems to be the consensus, that its more important for the devs to enjoy their weekend, than to have the best launch experience for the players, after having waited 10 years for that one moment.
---
She is taking her TEAS exam on Monday actually. Hopefully she does get into nursing school but I‚Äôll help her find the balance to still play Classic!
---
Or his dick is cut off !
---
Ahh, gotcha. Thanks for the info
---
I lost shadow on faerlina in roughly 30 seconds
---
I will be incredibly surprised if the servers are even playable during the first day.
---
Just to make sure though my week vacation starts Tuesday!
---
Free name change is nice, but why did you take a picture with your phone instead of a screen shot ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
---
Honestly this shit is ruining launch.
---
I would love to see that kind of stuff for all the classes. It doesn't even have to be cosmetic like I suggested, but the main thing about that kind of ability should be utility(non-combat stuff like portals/food for mages is amazing), or just RP focus like I suggested.
---
Maybe it's a thing for classic+, I think it would fit since vanilla definitely takes a lot from the RPG genre.
---
I always loved that you could make some money as a mage by selling portals to people, that's just awesome class fantasy to me.

Layering effects core gameplay significantly.
---
Here are a couple. If you let me know specific spells I can make more. Also character race and gender helps:
---
\#showtooltip  
---
/cast drain life  
---
/run TeM=TeM or GetTime()-3 if (GetTime()-TeM)&gt;3 and random(100)&lt;10 then DoEmote("healme") TeM=GetTime() end
---
/cast drain mana  
---
/run TeM=TeM or GetTime()-3 if (GetTime()-TeM)&gt;3 and random(100)&lt;10 then DoEmote("oom") TeM=GetTime() end
---
/cast death coil
---
/run TeM=TeM or GetTime()-5 if (GetTime()-TeM)&gt;5 then DoEmote("threaten") TeM=GetTime() end
---
Also all of the hunter pet macros above will work for warlocks:
---
/cast dismiss pet  
---
/run TeM=TeM or GetTime()-5 if (GetTime()-TeM)&gt;5 then DoEmote("farewell") TeM=GetTime() end
---
/petdefensive  
---
/run TeM=TeM or GetTime()-5 if (GetTime()-TeM)&gt;5 then DoEmote("helpme") TeM=GetTime() end
---
/petattack  
---
/run TeM=TeM or GetTime()-2 if (GetTime()-TeM)&gt;2 then DoEmote(GetRandomArgument(""whistle","attacktarget","","","")) TeM=GetTime() end
---
/petstay  
---
/run TeM=TeM or GetTime()-3 if (GetTime()-TeM)&gt;3 then DoEmote("wait") TeM=GetTime() end
---
/petfollow  
---
/run TeM=TeM or GetTime()-3 if (GetTime()-TeM)&gt;3 then DoEmote("followme") TeM=GetTime() end
---
Then don‚Äôt announce it when it‚Äôs still a year away?! That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand. It kills the hype for many people - having to wait for so long :/ 
---
Why do they do things like this. Can anyone explain?
---
Why can‚Äôt they announce almost-finished games and release them (almost) straight away after the announcement?
---
Yeah.  They don't just expire your names automatically.  Someone tried to make a character with that name, got pissy, found you on the armory and saw you hadn't logged in for a year and opened a ticket to have your name changed.  I just didn't think they used numbers, but I guess they did so that you are forced to change it.
---
This is a spammer linking to a random shady shirt store that sells stolen art slapped on a shirt. Report and downvote this sort of post/comment when you see them.
---
You're lucky you have things that make it an easy choice. I have no anchors so I'm still completely split on faction. Horde races cooler, alliance cities and music better. What to do.
---
Yes, but you may want to wait a few days or pick a low population server if you don‚Äôt want to be inundated by the hordes at launch.
---
Ya I 100% plan on downloading that shit
---
If you check into "personalized ad experience" under Google settings section it clearly states your search history can change what ads you see.
---
Not sure why you think otherwise but uhh they kind of tell you they do it this way.

The dead server comment was in regard to my point on picking a server because of a guild. The RP-PvP server specifically (there are a few guilds rolling there ironically, including a /vg/ guild).
---
It was late at night, and I'm a lazy asshole. Imgur album making is easier via the app for me lol
---
Sigh. Another one. Copy/paste :

This is going to go down as well as the previous 4 (5 now!) posts about this.
---
Not being mean or argumentative but; he did open a .gif on giphy, consciously pressed the "play" button and was shocked to find that an unvetted stranger had linked him an image that led to his ban.
---
He should have viewed that gif off-screen first.
---
Is it fair? I dunno. Was it stupid of him? Yes.
---
Because it‚Äôs much worse than Dals and has a stupidly low drop rate. What‚Äôs so hard to understand?

I understand but 225 concurrent viewers on average less than 1 week of starting? Dude basically doubles his viewers every hour on the first day he streamed.
---
Resto shamans can‚Äôt twist totems because they are too busy casting their heals. and most of an enhance shams damage isn‚Äôt from fire totems whatsoever, It‚Äôs mostly from stormstrike and WF procs. Vanilla raids aren‚Äôt hard whatsoever anymore relative to what most WoW players do now in retail. You could clear entire raids with the whole team made up of meme specs
---
So why do all BiS listings disagree with you? Are they just missing something, or is it possible you're overestimating its worth while underestimating other weapons' worth? Trying to give an accurate DPS value for a proc based attack that summons something is pretty silly as well.
---
This.

*I'M NOT DRINKING ANYMORE! I'M NOT DRINKING ANY LESS EITHER!*
---
your melee DPS isn't taking a major hit though, as it  has the same base DPS as Dal'rend and virtually the same as other pre-raid bis weapons. 
---
And regarding the onyx wep, that 14 base DPS should make it better in raiding, however it should still be worse vs high armor targets in PvP.  This comparison is mainly for pre-raid bis though, There should be better weapons in phase 1 from raids
---
Probably.  But the [store page](https://smile.amazon.com/World-of-Warcraft-Alliance-Shirt/dp/B07KRXGX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) says it's the World of Warcraft brand as the seller at the top.  I haven't seen any other non-licensed products with that instead of their off-brand whatever name.
---
that is not the word you are looking for
---
if the lfg tool is allowed to go forward even without auto invite, there will be immense pressure on the community at large especially those who have erratic work or life schedules to use the addon. questie is a choice that does not affect the others around you, this lfg tool is hardly that.
---
True. 
---
This is why I remake them between 3AM and 5AM.
---
I‚Äôve done it more times than I care to admit.
---
gonna shoot with bow then

Duuuuuuuude! Whaaaaaaaat, that‚Äòs just great
---
This is great, just don't expect a rez during a corpserun every time because you have pushups to do.
---
Yeah, stop distracting us from skeletons and addons!
---
Also here to say this was awesome and yeah even lurking 3-5 hours a day you'll still miss a large portion of the posts in a day.
---
The most fun i have had in WoW was back in vanilla. TBC was fun because after 6 years of vanilla it was nice to see something new, but once they released the lich king i started missing vanilla. 
---
The community aspect of vanilla was what i missed and getting your first blue or epic piece of gear. I almost miss the interactions of seeing the same person on the opposite faction and /wave or /bow them. 
---
Also really miss the old Alterac Valley that use to take days for one faction to win.
---
Exactly. He was stupid to open a random link from a random viewer
---
But...aren't the players today supposed to be "better"?
---
I kinda WISH they kill DBM.
---
KTM is more than enough for Vanilla. Zoomers should earn the damn fight, it's not rocket science.

Or go back to retail...either way, win-win.

I would be interested in seeing what you put together.

What is this LFG addon? Someone took the LFG thing and is adding it to classic? Fuck that
---
My completely bias opinion... 
---
I play an Arms Orc Warrior. You can actually hit things when you're using a 2h weapon haha. Not to mention that the Whirlwind axe is freakin' awesome! You'll also be doing some serious damage with Moral Strike as well. Now that the limit on debuffs have been increased, you'll be viable in raids for sure!
---
Let me contact my own hunter cl and make him
---
Post a build he would recommend. Personally the only raids where I actually used freeze trap as a cc have been in zg and naxx. And In naxx it was only for 10 sec until first mob was dead. 
---
I make reply here later on.
---
As hunter u will be one of the lowest dps classes so all your focus should be on staying competitive and kite the one or two odd bosses
---
viable != good
---
Idk but I‚Äôd love some banter between the EU servers as well

If you actually melee weave with its pretty good in pve since its a big slow 2h you get a fat raptor strike in between autos

Good to know.  In your experience, is the Surv hit better or the extra BM pet dmg better?

That‚Äôs actually really kind of you

If you are herb or enchanting, the ideal use is to use one bank slot to maximize your room if you have enough mats to warrant it. I think the best enchanting/herb bag was 24 slots compared to 18 for the best regular bag (though most likely you would run mostly 16 slot mooncloth bags because bottomless are insanely expensive). So those extra 8 slots can come in handy if you are heavy into one or both those professions and storing mats.
---
Might not be leaving the house, but i hope you at least take proper breaks and rest. Level 60 isn't going anywhere, and since content is going to be released in phases, there isn't really a reason to rush it. Don't ruin your health for content that is over a decade old.
---
The lesson for him to learn is not to click on any website/link that he is not sure of.  Ignorance is not an excuse.  He broke the rules.   
---
You clearly are addicted to this streamer and you should think about that fact.  Is it healthy that you cannot go 3 days without watching this person stream???
---
This is no choice
---
Oh yeah I'm aware that they become healers for raids, which is ideal with me having previous BWL vanilla healing experience with my OG druid.
---
the game is very easy to run, for solo play you wouldn't need to play regularly. even someone that travels for work still gets breaks to relax and sleep and eat. you could spend some of that time on a laptop playing if you want, and it wouldn't need to be that expensive a laptop as the game is so old it should run on a potato. there is internet in most of the world now too, in some form or another. considering you likely would not be traveling for no extra pay, you can likely afford it. a laptop can be used for other things as well obviously, so if wow does not pan out for you, its not like you wasted your money. it does take a bigger leap then for most people though, but hey, its your money to spend as you wish
---
If they're that easy, why are resto shams 'too busy' to totem twist? And if they're meme specs why are we debating whether or not it's better to take a meta spec? At the end of the day, enh probably will get a spot in raids, but itll only be because it's hard to fill 40 spots with meta builds.
---
Really good to hear, he's legit one of the true legends of gaming in a similar vein to people like Flash. Was so weird that he wasn't involved in a public way with gaming communities the last few years.
---
Hope he's all good going forward. Can't way to check out the stream.
---
Sweaty gamer girl- you should sell your sweat as energy drinks to the wanting.

Seriously, there is [a Skyrim mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16139) that is dedicated to the author's fiance who died from a blood clot that formed during an 11-hr gaming session. She was 21. Being young won't protect you.
---
Please, guys, do not sit unmoving for hours while you chug caffeine and hallucinate from lack of sleep. Self-harm and pointless risk-taking doesn't make you look like a badass, it makes you look mentally ill and it's legitimately concerning. You're gambling with your actual life when you do this, and if that doesn't seem like a problem to you, *please* seek therapy to figure out why you hate yourself so much that you don't care if you live or die.
---
I say this as someone who used to live like this. It's no different than smoking. It's passive suicide. I fucking hated myself, was massively obese, had nothing to feel proud of, and was publicly self-harming like this for some twisted kind of bragging rights. It's not impressive, it's sad. A healthy, balanced life is a lot harder to achieve, and thus a million times more impressive, so if you want a real gamer challenge, try that instead.
---
How did you feel, being denied these... Hungry Hungry Hippos?
---
THANKS!
---
The second addon you posted is the closest thing to what i want...but is only people who you do dungeons with.
---
Maybe i can add people outside dungeons also? With who i party with?
---
Unless you have a time machine to head back to 2004, this is the best time to start.

Omg yeeeeeessss!

Oh my God was there drama over fucking WeakAuras too? This community needs to chill the fuck out about fucking addons.

Arguably it is hard in a logistics sense. It takes a lot of time, and the goal is to reduce how much time any action takes through management of resources and people. Time working towards objectives will always get you something, as is the case in almost all traditional RPGs, but a skilled player will get much more in the same time.
---
In PVP they are disgusting. Shamans are the rng Kings which makes them fun, but a pally can ruin some days.

Careful brother, showing support for anything that might diminish the "soul" of classic WoW is dangerous in these parts.
---
As you shouldnt measure your life on it. But in a post where you ask for upvotes, it will show how people feel about your topic. You are confusing people caring with people being frustrated about hearing about this again. Big difference.

I'm sorry but saying the bigotry is "minor chan stuff" and only being said to "keep out the easily offended" is defending bigotry. I'm sure it wasn't your intent, but that's what it is.
---
It's one thing to talk like this in a private group of friends you know actually care about others, but when you do it in a public setting no one can possibly know if you're being serious or joking around. At worst, they're racists, at best they aren't informed or lack empathy. Regardless, shit like that can bring up shitty memories and feelings for anyone that has to deal with discrimination on a day to day basis.
---
Are you guys still going to be friends?
---
I‚Äôm not friends with any previous roommates in life. I do far better living alone or with a partner, not a roommate. It was on me though, I could have been a better roommate.
---
Fair enough. I used fuck in my reply, I'm not hyper offended, or offended at all. It just seemed extreme because I can't hear your tone through text.
---
Enjoy my favorite example of this: https://youtu.be/naleynXS7yo
---
Yeah, from the polls on this sub it seems like Stalagg is actually going to be a lot more full then Herod or Faerlina. I think the numbers are skewed by the fact that they were the "original" servers, so they have a lot of leftover characters there from players like me who only cared to make one singular toon on the new server I actually plan to play on. 
---
I really wish Blizzard was doing a better job of handling this stuff - I think they should have locked servers that became full.
---
My sides
---
You don't require a teammate specifically to run it though.  You look for group members in-game.  I played just fine without any irl friends playing it.
---
Please stay on retail.
---
Kala on YouTube has a really good guide.
---
Mexican coke is better becuase it's cocaine... Not some shitty sugary drink.
---
WotF is a 2 minute cooldown (PvP trinket is 5 minutes) and it essentially frees up your trinket slot for a damage trinket because WotF removes everything the rogue PvP trinket does (except poly). 
---
WotF is MUCH better vs destro warlocks because they usually have a succubus charm you as you are stunlocking them, so as soon as you trinket (as an Orc) the succubus is casting another charm, with WotF you are immune to those charms for 5 seconds. Also warlocks will immediately pre-cast a second fear assuming you will trinket the first fear, WotF doesn't give them that option.
---
Cannibalism is a free bandage every 2 minutes.
---
10 shadow resist is actually pretty good in PvP
---
Animations and emotes are cooler.
---
All that being said I'll be rolling Orc too, but it was still a **very** hard decision to make because geared priests/warlocks are not pushovers lategame (even for a rogue). Orc's stun resist doesn't happen every fight, and Bloodfury is on par with the free trinket slot that Undead rogues get especially when AQ gates event begins and you can get Earthstrike as a better Bloodfury.
---
&gt; Can't wait to see you all crawling back.
---
I enjoy your ignorance in thinking that *100%* of the people signing up to play Classic are coming from retail.
---
But thank you, I will in fact enjoy my walking simulator.
---
Totally agree, female UD warriors always looked amazing, especially in raid gear.
---
Im going without DBM. I will howver yours threatmeter. But ye I agree. Itd be more fun and challenging without DBM. Esp now when everyone knows the content.
---
They are mainly in major hubs/cities. So if you are questing across the world you would have to run back and forth, spending maybe half an hour just to get skillups.
---
What a humble brag.
---
Low effort.
---
Are literally any tier sets bis when they come out?
---
I feel like a lot of people are excited for them but in reality people are going to be wearing random stuff with good stats, if you think your character is gonna look cool you're prolly gonna be disappointed. 
---
Even if you get a few set pieces, and happen to not get anything better, you're still most likely not ever going to have a full set, and if you did, you would almost definitely have something better to wear.
---
Or maybe I'm wrong here? Interested in other peoples thoughts on this.
---
edit: After some googling, some tier sets definitely *are* bis, but more often than not, there are very few set pieces in bis lists.
---
There's literally only 5 east coast PvP servers. He's going to pick one and that one will be fucked.
---
As shadow I was healing just fine up to and including some level 60 content. Granted it was a lot easier to heal as holy, but some of the lower end 60 stuff is doable as shadow.
---
bosses have higher nature resistance than other spellschools. also there is no debuff like curse of elements or curse of shadow lowering the nature resistance.
---
this is basically what makes ele shamans not viable, make moonkins not use wrath, and enhancement shamans not use earth shock
---
Considering amazons toll on earth id say they would be gnomes.

No it's not? 12 is a greater number than 2. lol.

Am I going to have a really bad time if I main paladin in classic? I've been playing that class since I started the game and i want to continue to do so, but not if it's absolutely horrible.

Oh... Uh... Did I say poop sock? I meant tube sock. Stupid autocorrect. Of course I know what a poop sock is. Who doesn't know what a poopsock is? Noobs

Alright, Todd, we know its you, you can come out now.

**Software versioning**
---
Software upgrade versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. At a fine-grained level, revision control is often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of information, whether or not this information is computer software.
---
Modern computer software is often tracked using two different software versioning schemes‚Äîinternal version number that may be incremented many times in a single day, such as a revision control number, and a released version that typically changes far less often, such as semantic versioning or a project code name.

It scans ah and it tells u max price, min price, and it tells u what price u should put to sell within 8-12 and 24 hour or whatever the settings are. It is the best addon I‚Äôve experienced and I‚Äôve tried most AH addons. 
---
Basically u go to AH with a bunch of trash and addon will ensure u sell at profit with litterly 2 clicks. It also tells u which items are below average price so I can resell.
---
It‚Äôs magic and existed for last few years on privat server community
---
Because you guys have been fighting wars amongst each other for thousands of years. You‚Äôre over it.
---
America is only ~250 years old. We‚Äôve still got s lot of wars to fight to fight before we get tired.
---
So i‚Äôm not sure if your kidding or not but it is not 1.1.2. It is 1.12. As in 1-2-3...9-10-11-12
---
Well no one will be for several hours after launch.
---
.12 is not greater than .2 though,  which is what causes the confusion.
---
You forgot, reset family aggro.
---
That's what I originally thought but when he mentioned they've essentially blocked an addon in retail I thought maybe he was referencing the addon they blocked. I guess he never mentioned which addon they did this to or if it's even real.
---
its like this  
---
1.02 vs 1.12  
---
they just didn't use a 0  
---
its not like a fraction, its just build 1, version (0)2 or version 12  
---
and 12 is greater then 2
---
I tried many things believe me. but to no avail I'm not opening up my computer if it's under warranty that would break the warranty on it. And I dont know a lot on computers.
---
Time is a flat circle. See you all in 15 years.
---
I like customizing my guy tho! Especially since I‚Äôll be potentially using him for a long time
---
7/10 if a shitpost. I lile how it starts kinda realistic and with a few half-sane arguments.
---
If serious, then, uh, seel professional help
---
Don't worry, bub. We picked up all of our American junk food already :)
---
The funny thing is they all fucking love Questie, Recount, ktm, etc. Well, some people just hate all addons but they're fringe.
---
everything you just said is debased after you said demon hunters are the most skill based class and thats comming from someone who mained one as soon as they came out.
---
Race to 60 or Ragnaros?
---
Just play homie, youll learn, and there will be plenty of people to ask the natural experience is the best one.
---
Actually many people feel it unfortunate.   
---
Also, just because i have a punkrat tattoo on my face, doesn't mean im "so into" him.
---
This is true. I just personally don't see the point.
---
I'm super competitive to a fault when it comes to useless shit like video games, and I wouldn't be able to be content with losing out on dps/hps for the sake of looking cool.
---
Bring on the skirts.
---
If you have recommendations, just let me know and I'll add them! :D
---
Really it's like 1.02 and 1.12
---
Can anyone confirm: This is for raids only, right? This is not happening for 5-man dungeons, right?
---
Hell yeah. Was it here or in the main wow subreddit?
---
I‚Äôm considering farming Redridge for those snouts/livers/claws/lungs to sell in the AH.
---
Exactly this.
---
&gt; He is saying people that play retail will go back to their characters when new content comes out
---
I think you meant classic, not retail
---
I can understand the perspective of retiring your retail characters. That's nice that you'll be going back to retail for new xpacs or content patches, personally I will too. I have a sub after all, might as well.
---
But I can also understand the perspective of players who've been waiting so long for classic, many who haven't touched retail in years, who likely won't be touching retail unless they announce an xpac that attempts to get back to it's roots (perhaps not classic-like, more like tbc/wrath-like with some modern xpac enhancements that have done well over the years). If xpacs continue to go in this BfA direction, I can see people rather not spend money on buying the expansion and only play the game they enjoy, classic
---
I understand that, but 1.12 is less than 1.2
---
Atlasloot.
---
You get new skills every 2 lvls so you never want to go back when you hit odd lvls like 25-27 etc. I would advise you to get the addon "Field Guide" which is just a window you can open at any time that shows you what skills you learn at what levels. 
---
Might be hard to know what abilities to bother learning and not but if you read their descriptions you should be able to make out if they are any goo (the reason not to learn everything is because training costs a lot of money and you want that money for level 40 so you can buy the mount).
---
you can cry troll or bait all day it doesnt change the fact that live is clearly the evolved version of what you neanderthals want to play
---
I subbed for wow after not playing since MOP just for character reservation. I logged into retail once, and logged out. I have zero intentions to play retail. But will be playing classic.
---
Wait
---
Do people really look through post histories this often and this thoroughly?
---
Bitch please I have to wait until 00:00. Fuck my ass
---
And has some major differences. Dalaran is flying in the Warcraft movie, but even during vanilla it's still grounded as it wouldn't become a flying city until Wrath of the Lich King. Some orc figures are shown who would not cross over into Azeroth for years to come, most notably Grommash. Durotan dies to Gul'dan in the Warcraft movie, but would be killed by assassins several years later in the main universe's timeline.
---
Oh, also Medivh is Garona's father (she's half-human instead of half-draenei) in the movie, but in the main universe they actually banged. So, uh, don't confuse and combine those points. Gets messy.
---
&gt;And once, me and some of the bros went down to the beach and just kicked the shit out of sandcastles for, like, an hour!
---
I understand you get personal pleasure from depriving others from it, (or at least you did in this specific instance, so whatever) but if everyone got their fun out of ruining other people's day, wouldn't everything eventually be totally unplayable shit? Aren't you just killing the game, thereby depriving yourself of a community to play with?
---
I just don't understand glorifying cancer in a community. Do people like this play LoL or Dota specifically to find situations where they can feed the enemy team and make their own team as salty as possible? It's not even "to each their own". These people are just worthless shit.
---
I‚Äôll be surviving off of bacon and tomato sandwiches with 12 grain bread. 
---
Not the healthiest but it will keep everything moving inside of me lol.
---
Not exactly the best advise tbh, if he still has warranty left he might as well use it instead of breaking the warranty in the attempt to fix it and paying for the parts needed to "fix" it (assuming he would be correct in his diagnosis of the problem in the first place)
---
Will you marry me? :D
---
Definitely a messed up spec, no points in Arms for leveling.
---
Quest Help mods do not mess with the social fabric of the community, that's why nobody cares about their usage.
---
except the horde is all about deforestation
---
Looks like we have a Keto fan. Not that I disapprove, but your guidelines seem to lean towards that sort of diet. 
---
Speaking of diets though, MMO expansion launches tends to be when I get in my best shape. I always start in on eating better when an expansion launches because I know my excitement for playing will over-ride my boredom and desire to snack and/or stray from the diet plan. I almost forget to eat entirely. I have a standing desk with a treadmill, so that probably helps too.  Classic wow will make time fly by, which makes dieting really painless.
---
I would buy one in a heart beat if you decided to make more.
---
I'm old now. Gotta plan out my binges... can't wing it like I used to :(
---
Incendius here I come.
---
World of Warcraft is about exploration and community, I‚Äôd recommend going with what‚Äôs in your heart.

Ah ha! It was there! Grabbed one, thanks!

Just means that they get the same AP benefit, slower will still do more damage.

Here's the shadowpanther weapons ranking list, made by probably the most reputable vanilla rogue theorycrafter out there.

Now maybe he just calculated the whelp damage improperly, but I kinda doubt that.

---
Well personally, I‚Äôll be high all day. So I don‚Äôt want to go out and drive under the influence.
---
I'd consider moving from Mirage Raceway to Nethergarde Keep but i don't like the name. Ideally I want a single word, like my old server Anachronos
---
You‚Äôll need the antiacid too.
---
If you want to heal and you like dwarves, priest or paladin are the only choices.  If you never want to tank dungeons, priest.
---
So exactly the same with and without the addon
---
I suppose. I don't see people buying premaids often anymore so im not used to having an entire computer under 1 warranty umbrella rather than individual parts.
---
The horde are small in number. Humans alone should come close in number or outnumber them even, if I remember some posts from the lore subreddit. Tauren number in the hundreds, maybe a few thousand for example after having been ravaged and enslaved by the centaur. The horde need all the manpower they can get and are united under one war chief for survival purposes.
---
Haha il be alright with the sugar. Unfortunately i live in a small town and we dont have a laundry mat here.
---
I don't think you need to be able to prove that. 1. Blizzard has logs of what is happening on the servers and 2. you agree to ToS and basically if Blizzard wants to ban you they can do it. This is no court where laws apply. Blizzard is the law.
---
Keep in mind that higher ranks even if they are better HPM tend to overheal a lot.
---
Back in the day we used to do rank 4 and rank 5 HT and only use high ranks with NS or when the tank was dying.
---
Were all old now. Lol
---
You will have to leave the house to get your new insulin prescription, though
---
Once you get a second monitor you'll be pissed you didn't have one sooner.
---
Exept that guilds are a feature of the game?
---
Yeah  OP messed up by changing this. I don't care where you are from, I care about what language you USE.
---
Basically this. Hes just saying this so everyone tunes into his stream on launch to see where hes going to go, then for like an hour he'll say "should we roll on \*insert server here\*?"  "yeah were gonna roll on \*insert server here\*!" and then continue to not do anything and sit in queue. 
---
Reminder people throw $100s for this high quality content.
---
I don‚Äôt know enough to help in the conversation, but I just wanna say don‚Äôt be disheartened by all the ‚Äúit is this way because that‚Äôs what the guide says‚Äù defenders.
---
Questions like this should be asked even if it‚Äôs just to make the real answer public knowledge. As someone looking to main a rogue, this is definitely a question I didn‚Äôt even think of, and am glad you asked. 
---
I‚Äôll be checking back to see if there‚Äôs anything that actually explaining why your thoughts are right or wrong.
---
I see.  Everyone, including reference material refers to it as 1.2.0 however. Strange...
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.2.0
---
&gt;What potential social activity comes from trying to get a group together?
---
Once people give Vanilla (Classic) a try, most will come to understand.
---
High fructose corn syrup is frankensugar. Don‚Äôt kid yourself
---
Classic is superior to the current expansion. I would recommend only playing Classic.
---
I'm not really interested in premades because bgs aren't going to be a thing for a while.
---
In before cease and desist.
---
Not that I don‚Äôt believe you but do you have a more thorough source for this?
---
Well if you can talk your wife into things just by offering expensive stuff i think your marriage is how its supposed to be.
---
Nice attempt at making this position on a \*game\* seem like a nazi move lol
---
Back in the day I didn‚Äôt have any add ons!
---
Yeah, I don't agree with this. Beginner friendly doesn't refer to how easy or streamlined a game is, but to whether it's easy to get into and follow, which Vanilla totally is.
---
On the other hand, retail has a mishmash world and a coupled thousand systems and the transition between piss poor easy and endgame is extremely jarring.
---
AFAICT it's mostly ported but search is not yet implemented. Maybe I'll just figure out their database structure and make a light search window for it.
---
I think if he switched to classic he could probably spike that but I guess there's always the language barrier...
---
What a fucking retard, fuck him and his addon, go back to bfa
---
I've seen multiple memes about Cartman freezing himself on here over the past months.
---
I didn't say nothing about fun.

This looks amazing ! Is it hard to start getting into sculpting with polymer clay ? I‚Äôve always wanted to try it. Stuff like this is incredible !
---
What level can you learn professions at? I can‚Äôt seem to remember
---
One of my favourite parts of Dawn of Discovery (awesome game btw) is that the narrator voice tells you every hour how long you've been playing for...and his voice becomes increasingly concerned each hour before he actually starts to tell you you should take a break haha
---
Very helpful, thanks.
---
Really cool!
---
I agree. The biggest issues with LFG were:
---
* Teleporting to dungeon
---
* Increasing exp rates beyond classic leveling routes
---
* Cross realm queues
---
Otherwise, I really hate spending hours looking for a group of idiots, only for it to disband because that one guy wiped the group.
---
can u share known nodes with others?
---
They are amazeballs :D
---
Is the orc in the back getting ready to tbag?

Not my xpack but you never forget your first guild.

Farming soul shards is fun?

I think I‚Äôll stick to layering.

WOW HOW GOOD WAS MY SOLUTION?
---
Are they usable?
---
Oh yeah... The 'grocery getter' ha! I feel like she would make it backfire somehow and play for a couple hours and then want the car..
---
Ah yes, the streamer seems to also be playing a Dark Iron Dwarf, one of the iconic playable races from Vanilla. My point was that the automatic group finding part hasn't been part of the feature list at least as long as I've been aware of this addon, i.e. few days at least, yet people are still losing their minds over this addon.
---
EDIT: If the auto-invite is just automatically inviting who ever wants to join you group, with no logic vetting those people, then good luck to anyone brave enough to use that. Sounds about as great idea as just manually inviting the first four people who you see spamming "LFG strat". =P
---
I love how this wholesome post got removed
---
Horde big gay.
---
It it 30 minutes of inactivity? If I scroll through characters every once and awhile will I stay logged in?
---
They aren't just not great, they aren't viable in raids. It's also hard to get dps gear as a shaman, because you need to wait for all the dps classes to pass, then you roll against the million other shaman.
---
I have to slightly disagree. I did just fine as a night elf warrior back the day. Sure they‚Äôre some benefits that come with a particular race that favor a class, but it‚Äôs not enough to justify a decision. 
---
Good luck
---
Orc warrior still gets that stun resist that is helpful in some raids.
---
Like I said I assumed they were around, I just missed them. But I was thinking g about it haha
---
Ya for casuals go human all the way. If you PvP or PvE seriously go gnome.
---
I know. I‚Äôm not saying there should be no dbm. I‚Äôm saying the raids are doable without them. The problem is can 40 people do it without them lol.
---
Man, this is kind of sad. Y‚Äôall mother fuckers got serious issues if you forget about your dog. I seriously hope nobody actually needed this post

It can also be cringey as fuck. See above

Perception is a problem of the observer. I am not so sure about yourself, but I do not live in a world were I expect people to speak and act much more ignorant than they do normally. I also do not get emotional when speaking with people who are much more informed that myself on certain subjects.
---
Yeah I  work over 16 hours a day, 5 days a week 2 different jobs. One is hard on the body, one is hard on the mind and body.  And all I know is that there is a difference between a long day of work and a hard day of work.
---
I‚Äôll be wearing my horde shirt with red gym shorts on launch https://images.app.goo.gl/zjsCWD8fZT1gTGke8
---
What are you guys wearing?
---
Its gonna be annoying to not be able to see combat related stuff mostly, health and mana bars and also quest item pickups are gonna be a bitch on those low drop rate ones. But yeah I'm mostly doing it for fun and to have a more "cinematic" view of the world. Thanks for the input &lt;3

Then immediately following the 5 man group to pick off their slow friend.

I think it's okay if I can time my crashes, but that's unlikely. I will never drink coffee

Just out of curiousity ... what is a skinning macro?
---
No, just prepping now :) Still have 2 days
---
Lol, people will find a way around it. You seem butthurt that people will have an advantage over you.

Hey it‚Äôs me your wife.

I play with you and take the corvette

Ahhh, makes sense! Have fun :D

You the 1!

lol my body will probably give out, but I plan on drinking and shmerkin and gonna try to 24 hour it. I say I‚Äôm probably getting to 12 and stopping

Nope doesn't matter if you're tinkering for 30 minutes you're logged out regardless.
---
Every poll has shaman the second most played on horde.
---
Who the hell are making these pointless threads? 
---
It's just to unreal to believe this subreddit is that fucking stupid.
---
yall mafuckers need jesus
---
Worshiping corporations is dumb and Blizzard's WoW dev team fucked this game for a long time now, but credit where credit's due: the Classic team's doing an excellent job so far and they do deserve some gratitude.
---
Oh hell yeah you my kind of girl! Too bad you‚Äôre not a dude ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Have fun!
---
Releases at 3pm for me while I'm still at work :( may try to get in early that day so I can leave early, but also I'm probably just going to be rushing home to queue so maybe not haha
---
Just using the word 'elitist' tells me you're an LFR raider.   
---
Don't worry, LFG is still in retail and no one is forcing you to play classic.
---
Yea, I was thinking hunter, but now....I'm thinking Warlock or Druid.  leaning towards warlock since it's similar to mage, in a way, but would be new and fresh enough to me.  Druid would be awesome for the amount of variety, but I worry it'd be too many different roles and abilities to master with my very limited play time.
---
Lfg isn't bad for the community.  Crossrealm and teleporting to instances is bad for the community.
---
Nobody does.  It‚Äôs just a karma grab.
---
Buy it and say it‚Äôs hers but have her drive the mini van while you take the Vette to work everyday
---
That doesn‚Äôt get me that item back. Also, it doesn‚Äôt matter if that becomes the norm. There are already people out there saying need on everything. If they had their way you‚Äôd never get the gear you need.
---
Its not killed though.
---
Yaaas. I thought about it but RL got crazy! I'd much rather have homemade
---
ffs you BOUGHT PREMADE PB&amp;J
---
So you raided MC instead of her panties right?
---
Just be careful. If they do end up needing someone before then, they may go with someone else. Make sure they say it's cool. Not worth losing a job over.
---
I made a gnome warlock and a night elf druid on a PvP server since that's all that was available. I usually like magic based characters in games do we'll see what happens.
---
Yep, the maker also prints instructions on first use and care for the stein.
---
HUH?
---
Go read Dr. Suess please.  You completely missed the reference.  The Sneetches story.
---
Damn I hope you all the luck in the coming week.  Let's blame diablo he has to have something to do with it!
---
Scorch you can ignore, fireball level it up for frost immune. Or vice versa
---
It‚Äôs not. US servers will not be up at midnight EU time tonight.
---
I like it! Can't wait for Doomkin Form!
---
A macro you bind on your mousewheel to spam the skinning command.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, you're entited to your opinion.
---
The way I understand it, it's more of a celebration of the game, and classic specifically.
---
Though they might cover the race to 60 and the race to Rag, I guess.
---
Holy shit this is great
---
i probably haven't seen that video since 2008. wewww, thanks for reminding me of its existence
---
What a weird lie to tell.
---
Cool stuff. Thanks
---
Ironically that blue cloth robe is way better for holy pve than T2
---
*most* players? How so? Less than 1% of the playerbase will experience MC a week after launch. 
---
I will personally take my time leveling to 60 and I imagine most others will too.
---
I disagree. Welcome to the Internet.
---
That is the best case scenario that we are all hoping for, but can you really blame us for worrying?
---
He wont die inside a week. 
---
He may not die in 2 weeks.
---
Fight me
---
The base damage of sinister strike is indeed higher with a slower weapon, but since the hit also has a chance to proc a whelp we don't have to factor it into account. It would only matter if abilities scaled differently based on attack speed since that would bring the calculation of gear into the equation.
---
Thanks for linking the spreadsheet. I see he lists the weapon at 2% proc rate instead of 10%, which would certainly make this weapon worse than Dal. I wonder where he got that number from.
---
The wowhead comments state that they often had many of them active, which would be highly improbably if it was only a 2% proc rate. People after 2.0 are commenting that the proc rate has been nerfed, perhaps he is using data for a wrong patch. Also, it is  very plausible that the 10%  proc rate  figure I read is inaccurate.
---
I guess we'll see  it once the  game  launches
---
Like this?

LFG Wasn't ever bad for the community FFS.  
---
It wasn't bad *at all* until they changed it to the dungeon finder and made it cross server.  Then they made it *worse* by making it auto teleport people.  But the LFG tool had nearly two full expansions before any of that stuff happened.
---
Getting a vasectomy so one can play classic wow. Gotta love that
---
It‚Äôs ok and it will happen. Doesn‚Äôt affect me personal because I will have plenty of time to kill him
---
They have a financial obligation to their shareholders. They don't give a shit about you and you should stop being so naive.
---
Oh wow why didn't blizzard have the foresight to wipe everyone's memories?
---
Also i wouldn't recommend linking any item from atlas loot in chat on launch day, because if the item isn't droped yet on the server or wasn't queued from the database you get a dc
---
Stealth noise
---
Imagine buying 10,000 calories of soda and energy drinks for a video game launch and then posting about it online. You can justify it however you'd like, but I think that it's pretty gross and unhealthy.
---
Imo the modern game shouldn‚Äôt try to become classic.
---
I also believe that these classic servers should remain as they are forever for the museum effect.
---
So what do we do next? People say TBC, well that means we need Wrath too. Doing that would go back to the imminent doom of classic just like back in the day. Sure those expacs were fun but that‚Äôs the same road we‚Äôve been down and then you would have 4 versions of the game.
---
But what about 3 versions of the game? Keep retail going as it is. Keep classic a museum. Now, in 2++ years open ‚Äúclassic+‚Äù and give the option to transfer our hard earned museum characters. Classic+ could go many ways to add content from those expansions yet keeping the true spirit of classic and not divide the player base into 3 museum servers. No flying. Keep the world pvp to the max. No increased level cap? Could be amazing.
---
They're saying to not release, so you would still just be a dead corpse and not a ghost
---
Looking at the microwave reflection, I think he's had his fair share of cake already :D
---
Cool, but normally a cross-faction group effort to have a monopoly over important mats is used for RMT which is against ToS.
---
EQ was way more fun than WoW would ever be. You can play at your own pace, when I played EQ I didn't even consider hitting max level. Problem with post 2004 game design changed to "hit max level fast!" kind of mentality. No one would understand that there's a game before max level; I spent 2 years playing EQ without hitting the max level and had a blast.
---
No, people who played in the beta get two weeks head start and level 40 bis
---
So it's treason then?
---
It's because he's sitting in polymorph while his shaman friends gets nuked :D
---
Nothing like being in a server where your only way to fight the mafia is to compete for the tag...
---
is that reset method tested to be working right now?
---
ive heard that for DM its a bit problematic
---
Sick thanks man !
---
I will, thanks :) You seem a little hurt that someone disagreed with your favourite guy.
---
Escapism.
---
.. what do you think? Like REALLY stop for a minute and think.
---
i will. i don't have a problem with blocking people if that's your thing. i think its wrong but people should be allowed to be wrong. when people start messing with what i am allowed to see on the other hand, that's then i start feeling anxious, as i like to know what the people around me really think, in stead of what they just pretend to think for good boy points
---
Poor arms warrior, he should have went axe spec.
---
Real players always have a pee purifer on hand.
---
I agree, even normal Pepsi Max tastes better than Coke zero here.
---
i like your art very much!
---
You don‚Äôt need to worry about macros or addons. Just enjoy the game.
---
more like pvp big brain 300IQbois, if you're a rogue and you take fights like that you're an idiot. The way to go is following them around and when they inevitably split up and return to questing you kill the soft targets.

Playing US servers while living in Netherlands? Really?

Man, Oxhorn's machinimas were the shit back in the day. Inventing Swear Words is one of the most clever series I've ever seen. As well as all the catchy songs (Tank Tank Heal Tank, Stab Cast Pwn).

They're entirely different servers.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Ui is onion in dutch.
---
Nice easteregg
---
I think the problem is that most of these guides don't take into account its a completely fresh server and every server is overpopulated.
---
Most people are going to want to buy their own level 40 and 60 mounts before they go around buying your ore, herbs, or leather off the AH and there is going to be thousands of other players also listing ore, herbs, and leather driving down the price a lot.

Interesting, good to know. I was considering writing an addon that just records any items I see. Sounds like that would at least be safer.
---
One person is an asshole in your party. 
---
Rather than deal with, or try to diffuse the situation, you seem to be saying that you'll completely ditch the entire party because you don't care what happens ultimately. 
---
That it's a journey and what you want to do is more important. 
---
So instead of just stranding the asshole, you strand everyone else.

Do I have that right?

I think religious beliefs are scarier than this health manifesto

They keep their characters. That‚Äôs why everyone wanted beta access so badly. Do you honestly think people would want to play an unfinished game that badly if their characters would just get deleted in a couple weeks? Use your brain dude.
---
Gnomes have +5% intellect, not just +5.
---
For leveling most people roll frost for slowing enemies and for practicing damage abilities for raiding and dungeons as many are immune to fire damage. Also there is improved blizzard for aoe grinding.
---
Profession doesn't matter that much, ones that can be useful are enchanting for wand crafting, tailoring for making some gear. Otherwise if you are lacking gold, pick skinning mining or herbalism for selling reagents.
---
For casters, the weapon is basically stat stick as you are not auto-attacking with your weapon, basically pick one with better int or stamina and you are good to go :P
---
South Park doesn‚Äôt have a say. Comedy Central is very serious about their cease and desists.

Depends. On a pvp server, guilds way ahead of the pack are the ones in tons of epics kicking your ass outside BRM on your way to your first MC.
---
Zin‚ÄôRokh, Destroyer if Worlds is a Hunter Weapon. At that level you‚Äôll have access to better swords for warriors.
---
So, we all love our junk food (Trust me I know)
---
But consider eating other things that will make you feel better but still delicious. Pistachios , dried fruits, maybe trail mix.
---
The physical location of the servers is not the motivation of anyone‚Äôs complaint on this. The physical distance difference isn‚Äôt going to make a big difference in terms of latency.
---
People want to share a server with people who are on the same time as them.
---
Too bad you don't speak for everyone either, so take your own adice and wind your neck in mate
---
Nah just gotta put the microwave near you and cook the whole 12 pack during long flight points or auto runs.
---
Because one person dying in an area makes that place a hotbed of world pvp?
---
The whelps hit for ~200 on way underleveled targets. On top of raid bosses resisting nearly every shot a level 55 pet will take, when they do it it'll be drastically reduced. Firing one every 2-3 seconds with a 2 second CD, AND you have to wait for one to spawn, you'll be lucky to even get that 10 DPS per whelp (and a lot of people on wowhead say you will never have more than one). So the damage it does will be basically nothing but also extremely inconsistent, and you're losing 1% crit, a lot of top-end damage for SS, and the 50 AP if you have the offhand. And the whelps can probably be killed by any AOE that hits them. There's absolutely no reason to use this over Dal'rend.
---
Calling out sick 3 days since I already planned a vacation for my family and used my vacation time.
---
Just the streamers, I heard.

This is what I am afraid of. I think they will have to kill all add-ons use of private channels in order to kill it.
---
Ok. And how is that any different than before.l? There‚Äôs always gonna be more geared players.
---
She's the hot pocket you dolt
---
No man I'm sorry but you can't act like calling out bigots and racists is "surpressing a perspective." Bigots and racists are blatantly destructive. Society moves forward by squashing destructive tendencies and embracing positive ones. Of course it takes time to figure out what's positive and what's negative, and there are phases of regression. But it's pretty damn clear that being a racist and/or bigot is destructive to society.
---
Again, people are more than welcome to criticize a country on merits, but acting like they are inherent scum has no place in any sort of serious discussion.

I told her she could make a NE Hunter and stealth with her lvl 10 bait pet in The Barrens

Yeah because it‚Äôs copypasta

this attitude is *only* the subreddit. i can't tell you when to start playing, but i don't think that's going to be nearly as much of an issue as this subreddit makes it seem. i find all the try-harding annoying, too. just play the game y'all lol

No loss.

well in the meaning of progression , you are going to higher number. like after 1.9 you make 1.10 , what else should they make?

Doesnt matter. You're getting mad at "LFG haters" supposedly ruining a chat channel. That isnt an "LFG hater" problem, it's a "not knowing which channels to use" problem. The fact that you think it's an LFG hater problem shows what a moron you are.
---
The solution to LFG spamming trade is "use the right channel" not "introduce features or allow addons that break the game in a way we already know is bad".
---
TLDR: christ you're a moron.

Seriously wtf is up with these challenges

He WOULD play a bald ass UD mage.

Ah dang. Could work well in a starfire, instant root, starfire combo hopefully

It definitely feels better not living w/ my parents, like I did when I was a teen playing vanilla. I can stay up all night if I want with nobody to tell me otherwise.

And red bulls instead of amphetamines? Kids these day are way too casual

Yeah, a few people thought I could change the launch date. I wish :(((

Most people play with 'show target of target' turned on. If you re target the camper, they would assume you arent AFK and continue camping.
---
Lol I‚Äôve been playing this game for 15 years, played vanilla pservers for 3 years, yeah my mind is well made up buddy. Doesn‚Äôt mean I lack critical thought, it means I‚Äôve thought about it and I know how I feel about it. And some random person on the Internet insulting my intelligence is definitely not going to turn my world upside down. Jesus fing Christ.
---
and throw away 1g instead of just dealing with a less than optimal talent until 60?
---
nah bro. I gotta save up for a mount.
---
Never underestimate the size of dragon hitboxes!
---
I hope not. The reason they're drip feeding servers is to try and avoid this all together. There's only so much they can do in the end, though.
---
Wack
---
give it a day or two, and everyone rushing ahead will be in higher level zones. then youll have the great masses of average players surrounding you instead. in a week it'll have calmed down some in newbie zones.
---
Well during vanilla I took 3-4 months to get to level 60 and by that time, the most dangerous person on the server was a warrior in T0 with arcanite reaper and a hunter with something like 3 epic items that in retrospect were far from being Overpowered. 
---
In 3-4 months you‚Äôll have quite a few people with almost all their phase1-2 BiS completed and enchanted with bags full of grenades completely walking on new lvl60

So it's not me saying that the LFG Add on goes against the design philosophy of WOW Classic. It's Blizzard itself.

Classiclfg is good, it parses the in game chat to look for "lfg/lfm" posts. It even alerts you when people lfm specific dungeons.

Better than a guy I was raiding with during wrath.  He admitted that he'd need on anything with higher armor... as a hunter, lol.
---
35 count for 8 bucks and it tastes better than La Croix imo. Just only have lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors I think.
---
A tanks job is to not die.  
---
A DPSers job is to not pull aggro.  
---
If you perform "less than optimal" and produce less threat than another tank did, then it's their job to adjust accordingly.

Thank you all for the helpful comments and advice! I‚Äôll likely give it a shot.

The alliance gets so much cool shit.  The marbles that can be used again and again without charges?!
---
No version 1.13 that I saw
---
Peggle.
---
ROFLMAO forever!  I wish Oxhorn had created a new video in honor of Classic.  On Monday we're heading back Into The Tin!
---
Tank tank heal tank, I hate elves!
---
XD
---
I was waiting for it the entire video. I knew it was coming. 
---
Was not disappoint.
---
Good points. There were a lot of exploits and cheating that happened early in Vanilla too. Extending a lot of this "IT WAS IN VANILLA!!1" logic means we should take both the good with the bad - which is stupid.
---
Holy Fuck!
---
100%. I would‚Äôve bought it. Now question. After Classic is out I won‚Äôt care about it.
---
Wasn't here to remind myself. You should prolly go fuck yourself.
---
In Vanilla WoW Ragnaros died 6 months after launch. Many guilds didn't kill Ragnaros for at least a year after launch. In Classic he'll die in less than 2 weeks. This means a lot more players will be in epics much faster.
---
Who do?
---
Aww cool! :)
---
The big boy guilds are going to play there
---
You ever try just *not* being a huge fuckin' creep?
---
god fucking damn it

I feel like they could come close if they did separate servers for every expansion. There is a ton of unused value in those assets, as I think we are seeing now.
---
They'd make good discord emotes
---
Shit, mind blown
---
Ok. Well I‚Äôm here to talk about facts. Not made up stories of the past and made up stories of of the future.

Hey there wonderful art, could I request some paid emotes! Let me know how I can get in contact these rock!

none of your dmg dealt is arcane. id say its a frost spec

This is at least the 2nd time I've seen that mug posted on this subreddit, he must be drowning in orders by now.
---
Yeah, and tuesday is the 27th, so that would be correct.
---
If you've never played WoW before rogue is gonna be easier. Priest will be more rewarding if you want to do dungeons and raids.
---
What ppl don‚Äôt realize is this is AUTHETIC vanilla Art work. You think we had those fancy fangled photoshops and 3D renderin machines back in the old days? Yes, but they weren‚Äôt nearly as popular and readily accessible as they are today.
---
So what does a 11 year old child with the love of Vanilla WoW do? They open up MS paint and start drawin.

Because hate and love are two sides of the same coin, my son.

It's pretty insane, a mate and me thought about making meal preps for classic.
---
insinuating that someone‚Äôs having a stroke because you don‚Äôt like what they‚Äôre saying to you lmao
---
We do these studies all the time. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúover-feeding‚Äù.
---
They drop from a non-repeatable quest so you only get 1 per character
---
The Horde get Really Sticky Glue &amp; the quest rewards 10 of them which is really nice
---
I think you only get 5 charges

All of you need to chill and stop downvoting, it‚Äôs just a banter between lovers.

Nah.

If you have to do that, you lack skill. WoW isn‚Äôt a game where stealth characters are severely gimped and unusable if they aren‚Äôt stealthed. You‚Äôre just trying to RolePlay under the guise of ‚Äúsmart PvP‚Äù

No one is obsessed with retail.

Vanilla wow was good because you could put 12 hours of work and get 12 hours of progression. 
---
Stop trying to prevent people from playing the game.

I got zero tokens that run.

Yep because the populist vote always works out well.

Wait, you went OUTSIDE THE HOUSE before classic release? Playing loose and dangerous with your life there. What if you end up in the hospital just before classic releases?

Hey, I've seen that guy at the farmer's market. I think he's a [35 year old white man from Colorado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaB5AVNg14c).

I'm going Horde this time round as I was Alliance Vanilla - Wrath but holy shit am I going to miss Ironforge music
---
I‚Äôm only answering to the question in how it‚Äôs different than before and my point is that new lvl60 back in the days were fighting people in T0 with very few epic and this times, player reaching lvl60 after 3 months will be facing people way more well stuff in term of raw power.

‚ÄúGrow some balls you pussy.‚Äù

Everyone gets every patch. You pay for access not patches.
---
It's a great class for casuals because you can immediately join one of the countless groups looking for a tank.

I strongly recommend leveling herb and alchemy, the multiple hour long buffs make a huge difference.

Welcome to classic

There is a website that gives the server location by data center that was last updated in June of this year that shows/proves just because it has an eastern timezone does not mean it's in Chicago. It lists all of the current live servers. With that in mind of the info I've found just by using Google I tend to believe the classic servers for na are in California.

I agree with the guy who told WA to fuck off.

My iMac runs it fine. What‚Äôs the problem with yours? Too old hardware? Wow isn‚Äôt demanding on lowest settings

At 60? Probably like a fiver, run through everything and consecrate.
---
I see your viewpoint, but the problem is when people say how they feel, and then you don't correct them or confront them and help them understand that that talking or believing that way is wrong.
---
Our wholes lives, we are taught what is right and wrong. We are taught that 2+2=4, that the Earth is round, that fire is hot, and that murder is bad.
---
That is how we got to where we are today. 
---
And we are going backwards because we refuse to confront bigots and racists and just general ugly (in the inside) people head on because we should respect their "perspective".
---
Dunno about shitty America but they can't prevent European players to use the product they have bought.
---
Really :(
---
Hahaha
---
People aren't going to use LFG to form groups, now. LFG on most servers is going to be a total circus.
---
Most people are going to use Discords and third party websites. To me, that's a real problem. You should have a good way to find groups in game. But the LFG channel is not going to be that.

Aw man no T2 for mage? The other classes got em lol
---
As a filthy casual hunter main all weapons will be mine!
---
 Of course not. You don't have to raid to be able to play a warrior. Dungeon tanking is really fun. Personally I think it's one of the most fun things to do in the game when it comes to PvE.
---
 You will be weak in PvP however without a good weapon which you can't get in dungeons. However eventually AV will release and The Unstoppable Force 2h Mace will be available. It's a fine weapon and getting exalted with AV can be done without a massive time investment.
---
 Warrior is a super fun class. Back in the day it was my first 60 which I took to rank 11. My endgame was just PvP, no raiding and almost no dungeons at 60. I just PvP:ed. Unstoppable Force killed many a player.
---
You‚Äôre gonna have a bad time if you try to travel to the Tauren areas. Long journey and no mage trainers anywhere around. Just meet up later
---
Only Scandinavians are allowed to bully Scandinavians.

It‚Äôs insane isn‚Äôt it that after decades of MMOs, people still ask this?
---
Level intelligently. Try to do quests that are green, and you will have a MUCH easier time. This might mean doing multiple similarly leveled zones, but it will make your life much more enjoyable. Also, dungeon gear goes a long way for leveling. Level and tank dungeons as fury and you'll be good to go. Just, seriously, level with stuff that is green and you'll mitigate much of the warrior issues that come with leveling.
---
Not the first week, maybe in 3 or 4. The biggest hurdle wasn't really learning mechanics, it was the fact that most of your raid back in the day either ran wow on a shitty PC and/or had a bad connection. Nowadays, that hurdle is pretty much gone.
---
I read that this program can help reduce latency:

Lol Oh dear. It was a bit of tongue in cheek humour. I'm 28 years old, I'm not going to go to a family event and act like a stroppy child. I'm just not a fan of being in a Church as it's a bit hypocritical of me. Also, It's my wife's cousin that's had a baby. I've never met her.
---
Boo
---
What if i do that thing i enjoy for extreme periods of time, therefore neglecting a bit other things i used to do more before WoW Classic releases?

It'll be hard to put down the best game in history in order to do something else. I will try though....

Firemaw is just the norwegians and danes. The swedes and finns (not scandinavia) is going to roll gehennas.  Using the word "scandinavia" is a bit misleading, either way I hope you all have wounderful time in classic.

ClassicCodeX and it‚Äôs not close
---
Ever avoided a gank due to seeing a field of skeletons? Or walked through the visible aftermath of a world boss's spree of devastation?
---
well, get fucked because of hate speech and advertising, I guess. How about we just ban the people doing that instead?
---
I am now significantly less interested in Classic. I mean, they literally fixed a lighting bug, and then reproduced the visual effect of the bug, without the bad code, so concerned were they with keeping the game faithful to the original. Now they're *actually* screwing with the game's mechanical systems.
---
Ideal is to shadowmeld/feign death to get around the corpse run. If i do have to run back, im confident I can do both simultaneously.
---
Yeah I agree, I‚Äôm personally not going to use one, but idgaf if someone else uses one.
---
I do think its possible to skip that and go into natural shapeshifter in balance although im unsure how worth that would be
---
Addon rage, queue rage, streamer rage, etc etc etc. Im about to disconnect from all of the reddit/forums until after release and stick to my guild discord. Will make it more positive and enjoyable

This is my favourite this week.

Shadowform
---
Yes but it's a work computer at a PD. Not going to explain why I'm SSing Reddit to my inspector
---
How will they know what your gear is like?
---
Usually, if you join a party, you may not even see the other players before you get to the dungeon.  There aren't any gear ratings, and skill/level is usually more important than gear before raids.
---
Unless you're wearing grays or some bullshit, you're several minutes from a city, so they won't kick you because you aren't geared.  There's no LFG or instant teleport to the dungeon, so I've never seen somebody get kicked during a dungeon group because they didn't have the gear.  I don't really even remember inspecting other people during parties, unless they had really nice gear.
---
Have you ever seen a Mage portal? ;)
---
I've seen clickbait, and I've seen karma whoring, and I've seen watch-my-video-so-i-get-paid.

But rarely all in one post.

Not news. Hasn't been news for a year. Has been explained many times. New snowflake doesn't make it worth rehashing. 
---
Player 1, your turn has ended.
---
Player 2, please step up.
---
&gt;If any group ever sat and waited for rez like the OP I would quit immediately.
---
Or boot them if you're party leader. We shouldn't be putting up with that shit in classic.
---
A sensible approach
---
I legally divorced my wife when they first said they would be working on Classic. I also walked out on my last ex before  our kids got to know me and I left their dog at a truck stop. We free and clear boiz.
---
Yes, absolutely. Some races have it easier. There is a zeppelin that files between Undercity and Orgrimmar so teaming up as Orc and Undead is trivial, but if you are a Tauren then you'll have to run for quite a bit to get to Orc/Undead areas, but it's not that hard.
---
Gonna have to ban a majority of addons then. Most of the QOL changes that retail made were addons back in the day. 
---
That being said a lot of people here will ignorantly say the systems are what killed communities in wow when in reality it was the massive boom in populations and the subsequent regression. 
---
People got spread out on tons of servers, often with massive faction imbalances and so Blizzard put systems in place so people weren't forced to transfer off dead realms and battle groups. 
---
You guys can blame the systems all you want but at the end of the day if Blizzard doesn't take hard line stances on server/faction numbers then the same thing will happen to classic population wise.
---
I merged my upper and lower sessions, so I only have to leave the house for 4-5h, every 3 days. Also got me a 2 week stockpile of macros-fitting food that doesn't need much prep. I'm prepared.
---
I didn't even think of trainers even though I remember them from the testing phases and pserver. Would the orc areas be any better? Org would have to have a mage trainer right?
---
Is it worth it for an Alliance player to play on a PVP realm? Since it seems like they are in the minority on all pvp realms.
---
Shadow fuck, please.
---
Hello all!
---
So i finally decided that i‚Äôm going to play a priest with enchanting and tailoring. (I might drop tailoring at 60 after crafting the epics for herbalism).
---
Given the following: what race should i choose?
---
1). I want a race that will compliment my professions. Idealistically i want to be become the premier enchanter on my server: so any race that gives me an edge is ideal
---
2). I will be predominately Pveing. I want a race that will make me desirable in raids.
---
3) i want a race that will be ideal for world pvp / farming. Eventually once i get tailoring gear ill drop it for herb. I want a race that would benefit the world farmer.
---
That's fine, nothing of value will be lost.
---
K dude.
---
Me: Suggests you should choose based on objective metrics that benefit those around you.
---
You: Suggests you should pick based on your own subjective benefit.
---
Yes, it's in fact me who is unable to think about other people.
---
I already upvoted this the first two times I saw it.
---
I got nothin.
---
Wait... what? I heard about removing skeletons but what about all if the models i.e undead that have protruding bones etc?
---
Yeah, think he played BfA for like a week and stopped
---
that's kind of an innacurate website, 2-3 weeks with rushing is pretty much expected.
---
Yes you can travel from the undead starting area to the orc/troll one at level 1 if you wish. Alternatively you could join you friend in Barrens at around level 12.
---
Read the quest ?
---
Thank you daddy blizzard for letting some players police how all players play the game uwu
---
Can still make characters
---
Link?
---
the devilsaur mafia is more of a private server thing iirc where they really don't enforce cross faction collusion or can be bribed to allow it, it literally goes against blizz's ToS to run that sort of operation in Classic, not to mention the sheer amount of chaos ungoro probably will be post-layering.
---
Ironic since ‚Äúit‚Äôs just nostalgia‚Äù is what the pessimists use as an argument for why it will fail.
---
Nostalgia is NOT why I want Classic, I want it because it is a great game.
---
I‚Äôm finding many sources claiming there are in fact Chicago sources, can you link me some of your sources? [source1](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-realms-listed-by-data-center-updated-8-22-19/250875) [source2](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Americas_region_realm_list_by_datacenter)
---
Yes you will get d/c if you afk too long. You could just log in early and keep clicking on new classes to keep you connected. Or you could roll on the servers opening up August 26th as those will likely have little to no Queues
---
Hey, seems like were both looking for the same thing. Lmk if you're still looking!
---
looks like fun to me.
---
Work just made the switch from IE to chrome so I feel ya
---
‚ÄúWas‚Äù ;)
---
Blizzard should have forced them all onto 1 server
---
Yeah. You can even do a tank shaman. I'm really eager to try this out as an alt char. Looking at the enh tree, there's just so much tank stuff there...
---
but frostbite means no aoe farming at all
---
Any MOXXERS?
---
Thats amazing news.  Grapefruit is my favorite fruit, im so glad its trendy
---
He said on his facebook he likely wont come back
---
I started playing during TBC as well and spent the majority of it in the old world. Vanilla is the closest thing to TBC.
---
Me [laughing](https://youtu.be/D-aVm-VvziA) when it doesn't work.
---
Forgive me for being noob but how are you playing tonight when the game doesnt come out til monday?
---
U know it‚Äôs not just skeleton but corpses too
---
Alliance or horde?! Good luck and have fun leveling!!
---
That depends which toy you use!
---
I did an even worse thing when I was young, got a BoE epic gun to drop in EPL and sold it to a vendor.
---
You need classic auras, and classic cast bar. To go with what you have.
---
Yeah if I'm stuck in Que for hours then I'm getting more of  work done early. That way I can play more later.
---
‚ÄúVanilla experience is about being equal footing‚Äù
---
‚ÄúLet me tell you about how in Vanilla I got camped by people out geared than me‚Äù
---
It was added later in vanilla, and will be in at the beginning of classic.
---
I'm fat as fuck I live everyday like a king lol I just like to endulge a lot more than I should. I just fucking love water. I'll have like maybe a cup of coffee on average per day. And that's usually just because I want to drink something warm in the morning. I'll beer or liquor at night too. I just fuckin hate pop. It's a combination of not really liking carbonation. And not liking sweet stuff too much.
---
^this. Theres a bunch of assholes out there who can eat like this and look great. Assholes.
---
Ah shit, I realised thats why I was thin. Now we have all these food delivery services..
---
I‚Äôd like 100+ skeletons for each player. Not playing until they make it so.
---
My main reason for it, is just so i don't order junk.
---
Nope, shouldnt be in, hence why its classic.
---
Mostly just the guards.
---
Valve was rather late to the game with micro transactions.
---
Yeah prolly a bit too broad a term, but I'm referring to going for 30-40ish hours first day and long days after that, following a guide/dungeon grinding.
---
Lol I can only imagine.
---
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!
---
I think people are used to retail where people get to practice in PTR first and bosses go down in days after patches and expansions.
---
Unless a guild does straight up account sharing with 60 people and play 30 - 40 characters 24 hours per day, he won't go down in the first week.  I \*think\* this is against terms of service, but I'm not sure.  
---
My guess is during week 2.
---
Solid
---
On the bright side, insane queue times might make release day a very boring stream anyway.
---
Thank God I have a cat. He's going to be so happy not having to deal with my shit
---
I think you are underestimating how long this is going to take.
---
Having my girlfriend log in about 4 hours before launch as I'm headed home from my driving lesson, should be back about 2-2,5 hours before launch and then I'll take over the job of staring at a button for a ridiculous amount of time.
---
Blizz already said they will release them shortly after launch.
---
I think they don't want people to get too attached to a realm before launch. They've asked several times for people to reroll on less populated servers (and the new ones they're releasing launch day).
---
They didn't want people to start posting, making friends, forming guilds, etc, making it harder to move off a realm at launch.
---
VANILLA HUNTER HERE.  I ROLL NEED.  ON EVERYTHING.
---
There is no way to break these without effectively breaking a lot of other addons.
---
Are you by any chance the same 'Deadrat' that's married to Tom Chilton?
---
Where are her beautiful feminine tusks? :(
---
I mean, you're right. There was literally nothing wrong with flying. It was a cool and interesting new way to explore the world. The way it was implemented needed tweaks, sometimes major ones, but flying is fine. So there's that.
---
But also, I have seriously never seen a more entitled, whiny group of grown adults than this fucking subteddit. "Everyone should be forced to play the game the way I want them to. Absolutely no quality of life features are allowed. If I could stop people from organizing on Discord I think that would be a good thing". I'm just baffled. You know how to grow a community? Connect people. 
---
Why this community shrieks "slippery slope" fallacies left and right is beyond me. Remove the auto invite api. *That's* reasonable. You know what's not reasonable?  Letting some players police the entire player base and prevent them from communicating about and organizing groups unless it's through the specific channel *you* approve of.
---
They also mention in that same AMA that they will be resetting the servers before launch so anyone just sitting in character creation is going to be booted anyways.
---
All they said is start logging in "minutes" before launch.
---
I love the meme, but here and elsewhere, the clowns were going berserk over layering, for a long time. 
---
I'm actually proud of bliz for not caving on it. Now if people wouldn't lose their shit over an addon that lists who is LFG, instead of us sitting in citys spamming all day, we'd be good.
---
So you looked like starvin Marvin
---
I knew it for the WoW meaning for 10 years before I ever heard it refer to gay men. It‚Äôs quite the opposite for me.
---
You know what, you‚Äôre probably right. If you plan on playing on Herod, you probably should roll min max or you‚Äôll have Krissam complaining about how you‚Äôre ruining his 15 year old video game experience. 
---
Or, for the people with big dick energy who don‚Äôt want to roll on the memelord server, play what you want. Min/max, go for aesthetics, doesn‚Äôt matter. Most people won‚Äôt care. 
---
Losers like you literally do not matter. Adios.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Just because you got through it doesn't mean there weren't lasting changes to your brain you can't see or are aware of though.
---
I mean it will never be the "authentic" experience. I remember when I started playing people were wondering wtf was going on in the dungeon inside the dungeon. Everything in there was just "??????????????????". Nowadays, everyone is going to know virtually everything about every encounter. The mystery isn't coming back, the community is.
---
I'll fuck your cat in the ass
---
Very shitty to not run back, unless you've asked to use the wipe as a quick break to do something  (bathroom/drink refill). Always happy to res people if they've asked nicely.
---
You can‚Äôt see his big ass tit?
---
can make characters cause blizzard is embracing the madness
---
You're ganna need to pee a lot!
---
He probably needs to be moved up in age groups and I imagine it happened after this game. lol

Thanks dude, you gonna remind people to drink water too?
---
I was set on hunter until 2 days ago then decided to make a warlock instead. Getting the full nostalgia back , I played alliance before I came to realise I love horde (horde main for the last 11 years) but for the sake of classic I'm going back to alliance.

Go arms or fury. You can tank dungeons fine while leveling
---
From where?
---
Is there a way to uninstall the BfA client and keep only the classic one? At launch I will play on an old laptop until I get home a week later, and I would like to only have the essentials there.

The only time I remember seeing time zones in retail Vanilla was when you were auto-looking for a server;  I believe you selected a server type and a time zone and then it would toss you to a realm.  That feature doesn't exist in *World of Warcraft: Classic* though.
---
If you‚Äôre going to take vitamin d3, you should take vitamin k2 as well. Vitamin d3 can leave calcium in your veins and the K2 helps the calcium make it to your bones instead of causing blockages. 
---
There‚Äôs also the possibility that supplementing d3 can cause a negative mood swing after dosing. Mood regulates itself once supplementation stops. Not everybody has this happen, but it‚Äôs common. Sunlight is always best. You only need 30 minutes a day. 
---
This all being said, you should get your vitamin levels checked before supplementing specific vitamins. And if you‚Äôre truly short on d3 you will need mega (MEGA) doses weekly, not 1000IUs. Hell, I take 5000IUs a day and I‚Äôm not even deficient.

Far less. I'll be amazed if more than a couple groups pull it off.

If you eat like this you have to do 20 reps of heavy squats every time you level

How can you unironically hold this opinion? Just because someone wants a chatparser to more easily find what they‚Äôre looking for you think they won‚Äôt stick with the game?

Noob question: Why bring Rogues if Warriors do more damage on the logs? Same with Mages against Warlocks or vice versa.

do you have the correct account selected? above the PLAY button is a drop down where you can select a game. choose  wow classic and to the right of that dropdown there is an account dropdown. make sure that the appropriate account has been chosen and that you have active game time added as well.

---
I know I don't have to and can just skip to them but...
---
Only way you or anyone else avoids queues is by waiting 3 weeks to play
---
someone posted a pretty cool mage lvling spreadsheet yesterday and i edited my own take at it. redding out all the skills i plan on skipping. 
---
https://imgur.com/hgRF5OT
---
basically arcane missiles is useless, damped/amplify are not useful, flamestrike is bad, scorch is useless. fire/frost ward have very niche use. Slowfall can be decent when questing at thousand needles as horde. Also most of the time ur drinking u can just use lower tier food, since it always takes longer for ur mana to go up than hp, for this reason im not sure about getting upgraded bread. Fireball does more dmg than frostbolt early so ill be using it to lvl untill 30-40 range when i get decent frost talents and switch to frostbolt. at 40 after u get the mount u can get kinda whatever, since the next gold threshold will be 1000g(900) at max level.
---
Also im going to go for aoe farm build. If you plan on just single target questing casually this might not be that accurate for you. Kinda midmaxing so if ur just in to have a good time leveling and saving a bit of gold, id skip the following:
---
flamestrike, amplify/dampen, scorch, arcane missiles, extra ranks of frostnova, extra ranks of polymorph untill dungeons get hard.
---
Most importantly remember to have a great time playing. cya in azeroth
---
Yeah, it ballooned rapidly since spring.
---
Arguably better than priest until naxx.
---
Yeah that's what I figured too. Maybe holding yourself at a different height can make it more difficult/easier?
---
Hmm maybe it was TBC then.
---
I like where you're going with this.  If add ons were completely banned, I'd still be playing and I'm playing with no addons to start.  But I like bagnon for the simplicity of storage and I have used DBM in raids back in TBC and Wrath..but what you're saying makes sense.  I'm not sure I'll go without for the whole of classic, but I do think they dumb down the game
---
I didn't extensively test it, but it worked during the stress test.
---
The thing is I never played this game as a child , is it really that good?
---
Maybe look at the full picture and say what will be changed and what will be lost so people can make an educated decision if moving the LFG Tool to a Website/Discord Bot is worth that loss. Hell we do not even knew how much impact it would have in the first place. It could barely get used at not inflict the community in any meaningful way but the API changes could still break RP Addons or Spam Filters/Unit Frames Threat Meters and other things all to achieve more or less nothing.
---
tl;dr
---
Also, no.
---
The group leader picks and chooses who he invites addon or no addon. The way im handling invites isnt going to change, im gonna invite based on what i want for a dungeon.
---
As a 50% working student, I worked full time all August to have my working schedule look exactly like that! I told everyone to not even think about contacting me!

Yea, but you have to play a paladin. The only reason it considered "good" is because you can spam FOL, no skill needed.

---
Can you get retail wow to work? Also are you using battle.net app/launcher?
---
If youre always going to have a partner i could see you getting by okay. Just remember. Your designed to tank damage not deal it. Id honestly recommend you leveling as a dps spec and once you hit 60 re spec to prot. You can still off tank pretty well in a dps spec. Just always carry a sword and board with ya
---
But this is your story. Play it how you want ;)
---
Glad to see people are into reducing plastic usage !
---
until i passout lol. the first week ima play hardcore nothing else to do. the second week I have a 20h job and the rest of the week is all free
---
It's lunacy. It's like... I don't want to use evasion because I might dodge their mortal strike and get overpowered! 
---
Instead I'll just get white crit, into MS, and then dodge their hamstring and get overpowered anyway.
---
Why is the orc a cat?
---
Instant classic the night it aired. Was raiding BWL at the time...
---
What is layering? I am dumb.
---
What about rep, professions, getting gold, getting consumables, helping guildmates catch up, Onyxia attunement and then 2x/week clear, and epic mount?
---
Even a ridiculously hardcore person is going to have months worth of content to do.
---
Please show me where I've asked for anything. People on this subreddit are so quick to defend classic from the evils of retail that apparently they don't even stop to read before hitting reply. I only responded to someone who claimed that you can play classic in a bubble and be behind the gear curve without that impacting your gameplay experience, because I think that's wrong. My point is that people are right to worry about falling behind, not that the game should allow them to catch up.
---
Alexa cast Holy Shield
---
You sure spent allot of time only to get downvoted to oblivion. I respect that.
---
Guessing just people mad because that lfg addon was removed.
---
Look at your first comment rating, looks like i'm not alone who thought you are retarded.
---
No offense but it totally is irrational. It‚Äôll have little to no effect in everything you do in game
---
Nothing in this game beats being able to go invisible lol. cant wait to drop some folks
---
I‚Äôm rolling with u squad
---
yea idk what op is thinking lol. The in game chat is for you to communicate with them, not making some dumb posts on the forum where nobody checks for groups
---
I'm just gonna have uber eats deliver me a tub of spicy Wendy's chicken nuggets every afternoon
---
I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs a big problem but just the fact people will farm MC very quickly will have an impact on PvP. Now personally I‚Äôll play on PvE server and not put a feet in BG so I don‚Äôt really care but I just agree with OP that there‚Äôs some ramifications to that fact

LFG services ruin the game. If you don't know why, you haven't read enough.
---
Shucks could swear I saw it on some list of updated ones but no way to know until launch cause i'm not in the beta.
---
LULW
---
Also back then people weren't even in a rush to reach max level. Level 60s seemed to be bored most of the time. The endgame at first was a big complaint, and overall folks were more just kind of poking around and going where the winds takes them. I would log in sometimes ready to quest forgetting I had walked all the way to another continent for some goofy impromptu event or something. Getting back to where I was might've taken a whole nights play session all told.
---
I like Colombian coke the best, but to each their own
---
I remember farming had some kobold candles in TBC, they worked on Magtheridon and I used it on him for our first Mag kill
---
Art isn‚Äôt content
---
When I played vanilla leveling a Pally. I never heard of LFG addons. I saw lots of DPS meters, required raiding addons and such, but nothing for LFG was ever used.
---
Mostly you found a healer and tried to become his bud. Because every guild was looking for healers but had enough DPS already. You wanted to get into a good raiding guild follow a healer in because your 'friends'.
---
Boomer has sort of be redefined in gaming culture to lump anyone over 30 together, or anyone that does stuff an adult would do like eat healthy or go to bed before midnight.
---
Lol good luck with that
---
Classic will kill you before you try griding to 60
---
My experience in private servers is that it's not great 1v1 against melee due to reliance on scorch and immolate.  It can be impossible to get a cast off without deathcoil.
---
No for that they must prevent them from reading Chat at all.
---
Blizzard can only Change the API so the CHAT EVENT returns a string with every chat message you can prevent them from getting the information in the first place but you can not prevent them from comparing to Strings in LUA.
---
Thanks for reminding me i gotta take a moderate ammount of sleep as well.
---
agreed 1000%. i just cant decide between feral or rogue for stealth shenanigans
---
They should stream the Warcraft movie in perfect lineup with classic launch.
---
These are very cool!

Then I cast... FROSTSHOCK!

You would also need to form a group on every layer if you wanted to do this

Joining bigglesworth, name like that is bound to pull in decent numbers.

I‚Äôm planning on tanking 5 mans with mine to 60 with my friends.  Anyone else up for the challenge?

They're out there it's just Kyle wasnt a popular name for that generation so you dont see many

I think I ran ST once before it's rework, and once after. At least that I can recall. I did manage to loot Dragon's Call back in the day, my first epic item ever.
---
It's easier to spread out gear with a diverse class roster.
---
YOU will, most will not. If you think it won't have a auto invite feature forget that if it never someone would make a new one that does splitting it between multuple apps tell blizzard has to make their own. Been there done that why we old players don't want it.
---
I would cover those license plates with something... black bar or squiggles in ms paint. anything.
---
Real hardcore players don't drink anything and race to 60 vs their inevitable death.
---
I like to go hiking, but I have a sitting profession (programmer) so my legs aren't used to standing and walking those long stretches. I can to switch to a standing desk for the "standing" practice, but the "walking all day" can only be trained by actually walking.
---
That takes so much time though. Our kids still need a lot of guidance when they get home (special needs) and I can't let my wife take care of that all on her own (she's also exhausted after her workday). So the only time where I can go walking would be when the kids are asleep. But then I'm out all alone, often in the dark, making everyone worried I'll get assaulted in some way.
---
I guess that'll get "solved" in the future as the kids get older (we may also need to put our oldest in boarding school due to the distance to his next school, depending what he'll decide he wants to do in life, he's 12).
---
I can't do weights since my wrists are already strained from desk work and gaming.

This was actually a thing in EQ2.  Think it was a deal they had with Pizza Hut, but you could literally order a pizza from the game client.

Almost 50% according to the survey, that is just insane!
---
Are you going for tank or heals end game?
---
I usually like that song but seems like they butchered it tbh lol
---
I‚Äôm genuinely tempted to go evasion tank rogue just for kicks. I played it back in ye olden days and it worked somewhat. Just hard to hold aggro
---
I do not have dropdown like that, I just subbed to classic. I made account specifically for that (didnt have one until now)
---
Select the version dropdown above the play button and switch to classic.
---
we didn't get to where we are today by being thought right from wrong. 
---
why is something right
---
why is something wrong
---
why everything. if you don't know a why for what you believe, you take it on faith. i don't have faith in authority, too many states committed mass murder in the past for that. confront the bigots, don't silence them. amplify their voice, if the people know why things are right and wrong they will hear him and know he is wrong. but more importantly they will know why he is wrong.  
---
why
---
Exactly. Also, the 1.12 loot tables will be in Molten Core at launch. This means a lot of Epic Weapons that weren't avaiable until patch 1.4 will be in Molten Core at launch. Rhokthelar, Perdition's Blade and many others.
---
Agreed
---
just keep vanilla servers going, but just allow players to transfer their characters into TBC(regardless of lvl actually)
---
people that want to keep playing vanilla should be able to do so even after TBC launches(when it does)
---
if Vanilla server population shrinks they can also do resets(or ideally just launch fresh servers Vanilla servers)
---
Hertog Jan! Good choice ;)
---
It's a weekend dude, I'd be surprised if they even actually have people working.
---
But one thing trying retail would do would tell you if it's not seeing you as having an active sub or something.
---
It's not mean if im not calling you out.  If you doubt the validity of my statement,  that's your opinion.  Im totally cool with your opinion,  but disagreeing with me doesn't make either of us correct.
---
I was the epitome of the fat ugly dude with a greasy face full of acne.  In 2005 through 2010. I made some changes.  I didn't know that my mountain dew IV was contributing to my poor health,  wish someone had told me then.

I don't blame you if you feel like I have offended you or someone else.  But i don't mind being offensive for a decent reason.

I'll be at work all day, if there are still hours of queues when I get home, I just won't play and wait the day after.

---
If you're on windows you have to go into the built-in windows add/remove programs thing to uninstall battle.net games.
---
Yea, the addon is called census something in the classic section. It's one of the few ill use. Mostly just to help other people making decisions later based on population. I'm sure it won't be perfect but the more people that use it the more accurate I will be.
---
Totally agree!
---
Be careful, those fruit by the feet will plug your butthole.
---
Maybe, but people will spend time leveling alts, and the factions will be mostly balanced.  World PvP kind of escalates; you won't have one raiding guild freely killing the other faction for long.  Within about 10 minutes, a group will come from the other faction to come world pvp.  Since there's no limit to players in combat in a contested zone, things will get crazy, and lower level players can go to another zone.
---
What does this actually mean? I don't think they will block this addon (at least the chat scraper) since that lfg channel is public so it doesn't "create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on". Autoinvite and auto-chat-messaging definitely could be on the chopping block though.
---
Not to mention the fact that banning the whole addon sounds like it might push people onto discord which definitely does meet the requirement of "an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on"
---
The thing that fasinates me is how widespread that S was, we are talking before the internet and everyone was doing them everywere.

Nice argument.

I always click on spells that are far than \~"5" , somehow often I can't accurately hit farer numbers especially in stressful situations.

Short but good video! I played Ele shaman back in the days, they are awesome in battle grounds and really high skill ceiling outside raids. Especially the burst damage is really nice in pvp!
---
Same. I want to play a Dwarf Warrior tank but my friends are all going Horde so I have to settle for Tauren. Ironforge is beautiful and the most nostalgic part of Vanilla for me.
---
Yeah because only reddit will play classic
---
/r/hydrohomies rise up

Awesome! Thank you!

Your only responsibility is to the horde my brother.

Whatever makes you feel clever there young one, just trying to figure out how sad you have to be to watch streamers let alone hate one of them.

This is so funny and accurate!
---
Point is that Norway and Denmark alone is just Norway and Denmark, not Scandinavia. But yeah, Finland isnt Scandinavian, "just" Nordic.
---
Yep this hit the nail on the head. I promise you there are many of us private server vets who have no issue showing any newbie the ropes. We were all there at one point and anyone who forgets that is someone I would rather not play with.
---
Regardless, classic is out in LITERALLY a few days. All these years of wishing and fighting hard for classic servers are finally coming true. So excited to see everyone in azeroth again.
---
A second yes to this!
---
Shrug, I have no idea what Blizzard will do. They know more about their API than I do and what they can change to facilitate breaking LFG addons but assuring other addons aren't (as) affected.
---
Thank you. This is the biggest compliment you could have given.

I legit never knew this. I thought the trinket removed all CC for all classes lmao

Best buy replaced my 2500 lap top and the only thing i had to pay was another 200 to put the 3 year warranty on the new one.

No gimmicks either.  I had a crown and coke spill into the key board and caused the whole system to short.  No questions...simple diagnostic and replace with a brand new system (also an upgrade becasue my system was 2 years old and they just game me a credit for the original amount i paid for my system)

That could describe any class lol
---
That won't work, it's a timed kick.  Won't matter if you're clicking or not.
---
im the type of guy that learns while he levels with the spec thats why i want to stick with one thing the whole way through
---
&gt; It's actually a great idea to create a channel that is pasted publicly (like server forums/discords/etc, spread it word of mouth) and people can join whenever they want a group (or always stay in it and filter it to another tab).
---
That literally exists. LookingForGroup works just like WorldDefense, it's an official channel but you don't join it automatically.
---
Lol relax papa, it was funny.
---
2 days, 1 hr and 27mins to go. Chill
---
I don't have that memory at all. I remember Kara being a fun run to do with alts and newer guildies, and to give new raid leaders practice.
---
You know what's up
---
!RemindMe 16 hours
---
Do you want to tell him or should I?
---
That would be nonladder classic
---
Anyone worth their salt in pvp will autoswap to riding gear on mounting. You're gonna get run down and outrun if you dont
---
Can you create al char on a full realm? All my friends are on one ,but i don't have an active sub yet. Els im fucked
---
I used my big boy braid. Druidz rule!
---
Also bears are good through Naxx. The only problem is farming Gnomeregan maces every week.
---
3 uses per mace, repairing will restore uses, not all fights will require more than 1-2 uses..
---
But yeah I 100% agree that it's gonna suck, but the mace part is gonna be fine, the boss is literally a 5 min run in Gnomeregan.
---
However, most preraid BiS is located in BRD, LBRS, UBRS -&gt; Those will suck major donkey.
---
You need tons and tons of FAPs then you‚Äôre a god
---
Me.  But I hope to make friends as I level
---
I really like the dungeon guide videos by Thraex on YouTube. Short, concise, quest descriptions and strategies all included.
---
Which guilds? I'd love to see a link for that week 1 rag.
---
We are encouraging all GREEKS to join Mograine so we have a nice wholesome community there, regardless the faction!
---
Even Amazon is wrong sometimes.
---
LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
No, for real tho, it actually is.
---
Whatever man, I mainly world PvP and never cared. But to say you lost interest in the whole game just because of this is ridiculous.
---
Classic is released worldwide on the 27th but because of time zones the US get to play a day early.
---
Layers also scale with the amount of people so in theory, if you have 3 layers for example, you have 3x person in the mafia but you also have 3x leather sold.
---
"It only takes a couple of randos that stay around and get tags and then intentionally do not proceed to loot anything off the dinos so they expire without the ability to be skinned to piss people off."
---
This do not matter, the point of the mafia is to get a monopoly to sell less leather but at a higher price, most leather are vendored and they won't lose anything if a few randos do that for a few hours.
---
Lirik‚Äôs viewers don‚Äôt play wow. Stop being such a cry baby.
---
Yeah, you'd have all the people who happen to be online right now delighted and everyone else would be so mad at you. Just not worth it, as cool as it would be.
---
Oh, you are right, I somehow missed that comment when reading over them. It is level 57 on the priv server and I assumed they had a valid source for that :/. That makes it quite useless in PvE. case solved, thx.
---
&gt;Imagine actually believing that only west coast players play on west coast servers. Just imagine actually believing that. OR THAT ALL 100 GUILDS ONLY RAID AT ONE TIME LMAO.
---
&gt;I live on the east coast, I need to be in bed before midnight my time and I'm in a guild that's rolling west coast. Guess what - I just joined a guild that starts early enough. Holy shit, what an idea!
---
Totally! I don't really understand the hate.
---
I used to play WoW on the shittiest Dell, riddled with viruses from vanilla through TBC. No doubt anything can run the game.
---
Can I use these for my twitch description images (Info, PC Specs, etc)? I'll credit you in the description.
---
I need to open my spell book whenever that low level mage buffs me with +2 intellect while being too low level to receive my fortitude buff.
---
I played this SO much when it was new. Just sold my collection a few months ago. Good memories raiding MC in this!!
---
See this is why classic sucks compared to retail. You would hate to admit it, but it‚Äôs true. At least in retail you could dps as a paladin.
---
The truth hurts.
---
/vanish
---
Why do you keep saying ‚Äúnerf‚Äù?
---
I'm a tank, that's what I do. Fuckt it, I'll roll a warrior. Fuck the comfort zone.
---
Jesus you're dense. To get that much hit% you have to give up stats like attack power and crit
---
You can.  There will just be a warning when you do.

No judgement at all, genuinely curious: why do people buy water bottles to drink at home? I know it‚Äôs not uncommon
---
nostalgia. it‚Äôs cheesy to say but I do genuinely miss the days of my two best friends and I pulling all nighters together, while we played wow on crappy laptops in the same room. summers spent either at the pool or in azeroth power leveling for 8 hours at a time. those were the days.
---
No reason?? What did they change for no reason? If your referring to blocking the lfg addon then there was plenty of reason for it! If you dont like that go play retail...
---
Looks like it's time to avoid this sub for a few days. The whining is real
---
NymN ?
---
I think maybe you are confusing it with dual wield? Rogues gain dual at lvl 10, everyone else at 20. But in modern game everyone learns at 10, and rogue from start.
---
Afaik you just gotta have the 10s to train in classic.
---
I used curseforge which someone already linked to and also https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/cat160.html
---
[I got mine still as well! ](https://i.imgur.com/jILtGGY.jpg)
---
Is this thread just a plug for osrs?
---
Goblins are neutral in classic, right?
---
But then in comes Blank with the supersoft
---
Jokes on you I have cats.
---
Also back then everyone wanted to play tbc because it was new.. Nowadays a lot would prefer vanilla(not me i hope for tbc :D)
---
Reminds me so much of Biden. Looks like him and also the whole, give up everything to sniff the already married woman‚Äôs hair thing...
---
I think you‚Äôre the one confused. Even if TBC wasn‚Äôt available yet, the 2.x prepatch was the conclusion to classic. You were playing on TBC systems. 
---
Just like at the end of TBC when the achievement system was added. The moment that patch released, TBC was over.
---
Wait, is that even possible? How long does it take to get to 60?
---
Theres a very good chance there will be quees at launch yes. If im being honest with you i imagine launch day wont go over very well. But only time will tell
---
Just renew your sub and you're in.

Just the $15.
---
And your soul.
---
Quick question for y'all: I go back to school 3 days after the release of Classic but will have access to my school Macbook Air to play during study halls and stuff. How well do you think that'll run it?
---
It‚Äôs the comment section, no one is gonna give a fuck about rule 1 over comments lol
---
You only have to buy subscripton ‚Ç¨12.99 in EUROPE or $15 or so in USA
---
I am going in alone, but making friends along the way is part of the fun.
---
I'm on mobile so I'm not watching the video. How bad did the video say it was? The mana issues are definitely really really bad.
---
Goblins are employed by both sides.
---
But the horde hires out their zeppelin
---
You just need an active subscription.
---
I have a mouse with like 7 buttons now, at least for me I'm much more efficient with buttons than multiple keyboards inputs.
---
Thank god!
---
And that for clearing it out for me!
---
You just need a WoW sub and download the Classic client
---
I don't think classic sucks at all, I just think it's fucking stupid that BiS for a lot of classes is wearing shit that doesn't fit with their class identity.
---
Create/delete does not work
---
Thanks for the answers everyone. Just trying to figure out my plans are for launch
---
Oh I thought that was a city restricted channel, because I remembered it being a big problem finding replacement players when you were at a dungeon. We always sent people back to town and before meeting stones were added to the game that was a big inconvenience. Maybe it was just because people chose to use General and not that LFG channel but I could have sworn it either didn't exist as an official channel in vanilla or only existed in the main cities.
---
As long as you have an active subscription, you will get the option to install the Classic client within [Battle.net](https://Battle.net).  No need to buy the Battle Chest or BFA.
---
Honestly probably another rogue. That way you can sneak past stuff you don't want to deal with and double sap to help with pulls. A hunter would work well also.
---
Lmao this dude thinks classic only happened cuz of jaggex...not the thousands of people that wanted it for a decade, private servers being super popular and petitions...nah it was all jamflex
---
 https://lmgtfy.com/?q=WoW+Classic+Addons
---
I coulda sworn it was 10s but I guess we'll see.
---
I think he meant we have normalized the recreational abuse of those medications
---
most guild leader\\loot masters will pick melee thou  
---
atleast those that do have decent melee in roster  
---
hovewer ZG is on 3day lockout so i dont think there will be much drama...  
---
and I'm still hesitating ti pick either hunter or warrior(cuz i love tanking)
---
Reading through this, I am wondering how many people up-voted and commented that didn't understand that this was satire. They do exist.
---
They dont even have a date for it yet
---
Paladin - best defensive healer (bubble, blessings etc.)
---
Shaman - best offensive healer (purge, good dps, windfury totem) 
---
Priest - most versatile healer (pw:shield, heal for every situation) 
---
Druid - most slippery healer/best mobility (forms, can get away from any situation) stealth!!! 
---
That's basically the gist of it, they're all good in their own right pick whichever area you want to excel at.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt get this. Prepatches introduce the next expansion systems, effectively transitioning the game into the new expansion. It‚Äôs irrelevant if the content is available or not as the core systems are changed.
---
It‚Äôs going to be easy to meet people.. that‚Äôs the best part of classic
---
Amazon must feel really silly now when the Amazon rainforest is burning down
---
It's a phenomenon.  Lovers of a show or program will say I listen to hear what he has to say next.  People that hate the show or despise it say the same thing.
---
Sick! So cool :)
---
There is no dungeon finder in TBC.  That came in 3.3.  And no, we won't have 'dead' servers, we'll have 'less' servers.  Blizzard also said they're open to community feedback for special exceptions, such as WotLK with no dungeon finder or heirlooms.
---
 Gonna work from home, problem solved.
---
It's based on the modern client, not the true 1.12 client.
---
All guides pretty much agree that flamtounge should not be used. Please educate yourself: 
---

Hunters are the worst class in the game in every area.
---
I had my dog put down so I can play more classic
---
As lomg as you credit me sure :)
---
You could even link my website: http://dawndragonart.webstarts.com/index.html

...why?
---
Stroopwaffles and spiked coffee is a legendary combo
---
It is what it is, sometimes you win, sometime you get camped lol
---
My friend and I are making healer and tank alts to level if we are 'camped' on our mains.
---
The interaction between the other side is completely worth it, you'll come to respect some and loath others. Also depending on how you treat them you can either earn respect or become a kill on sight every time, if I walk by someone I just pvped I'll throw a DoT on the mob they are killing and /salute to them know we're cool, and see you later sugarbooger.. ;)
---
It's why I'm considering rolling orc rogue over undead.
---
Will it classic
---
thanks bro!
---
Skinning and vendoring early skins is good for gold so just do that? No need to wait for lvl 35 start early. Just skin every beast.
---
Holy Pallies aren't "interesting" anywhere, they are definitively the most boring, numbing healing spec in the history of MMOs. They're considerably more SURVIVABLE than Priests in PvP, however, which is where the appeal lies.
---
I only got into it because of my childhood best friend and we made a lot of good memories
---
I only recommend it for solo play if you're really into MMOs
---
This is spectacular! Great job!
---
The add-on could simply change names titles etc.
---
I see a Dutch shopping bag there... You playing on us servers?
---
Focus on school at school. Play at home.
---
Any class really. Healers pair well with any damage dealer.
---
That's complicated. Should I just get some Flintstone vitamins instead?
---
there are many natural tricks to get to any layer you may want. Think outside the box, nothing is impossible.
---
I'll give you a clue though. Many coordinated players entering alone and attempting to locate each other in un goro crater.

The innkeeper in Dun Morogh didn't have the LFG menu during the stress test, not sure if that means it was removed or that only innkeepers in the major cities had the LFG function.
---
Send this to the Czech translator.
---
If retail works and classic doesn‚Äôt... reinstall classic. If both don‚Äôt work, check account to make sure it actually says ‚Äúactive‚Äù. If sub is ‚Äúactive‚Äù and neither work then...
---
Open a ticket! And wait for a response! It‚Äôs the weekend before a big launch you are not the only person having issue I‚Äôd guess
---
Good luck ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What are you not getting here? I based this upon the character creation screen, not the orb of deception transformations. 
---
This arrangement is correct :)
---
There's 4/5 more coming on Monday....
---
Retail is a lot more complicated, it's just boring.
---
Want to confirm that enchanting is a bad idea leveling up.  Way too expensive on your first char.
---
Don't forget about the 5hp/s
---
You're a fool to judge allegiance by race. He may be forced to carry an Alliance flag, but where does his heart lie?
---
I have no idea, but I figured that was a better chance atless troll comments than straight up asking what the first level up moment was.
---
"Level 2 scrublord"
---
Stalagg was originally my "backup plan", which then became my "main plan", and now I have no idea what to think anymore... feelsbad
---
Glad to be of service ;)
---
Hadn't considered Shaman mail.
---
Still by wotlk there weren't many higher armour whites
---
I would kill horde to see one of these as the male Nelf.
---
I had a laugh :D
---
I remember being so shocked to see WoW on TV.
---
Same story.
---
You always dream, literally imagined tge same myself. But never got more than 6/8 judgement...at leaat it looked like a full setüòÇ pants shoulders head + ashk...P I M P!!
---
No WotLK. Or at least change it to exclude the LFD
---
Are you sure? I know you can‚Äôt smell images, but this picture smells like urine and diesel fumes.
---
just dont forget. (its easy to forget food when on speed)
---
Why? You play the game how you want, and others will play it how they want. Horrible comment for good OC.
---
Just like all the other thousands of people, making your message hard to be seen!
---
Shhhhh!  Let these goobers que too early so we get their spot when they D/C!
---
Runescape kids have always, and will always, be the worst.  It‚Äôs always been a subpar MMO and it always will be.
---
Seen some of your vids on youtube earlier. This guy is legit, guys. Follow this if you‚Äôre melee and dump the very well known Joana guide.
---
I will credit all of them/include links! Thank you!!
---
Oh probably. Wouldn't be hard to out damage a disc/holy priest.
---
I would just never call Holy Paladins in Vanilla WoW "interesting". They're a stunningly boring spec. You could probably set a drinking bird at your keyboard and it would achieve very similar results in a PvE environment.
---
They are doing, it was announced the other day *and* it's detailed in the post.
---
because over half the playerbase will begone next week when it takes them hours to get into group content. blizz knows this,
---
1. Ammo
---
2.  Pets are so shit in vanilla
---
3.  Dead zone is great for the "feel" of hunters but tedious to play with
---
4.  Only brought to raids for tranq shot and some niche shit 
---
5.  Bad in pvp unless you're putting in 6x the effort then they're like slightly decent.
---
6.  They use mana but weren't designed to use mana
---
How I feel about Borde lands 3 :'(
---
Why not now? Why not a week ago? Just seems like they want every server to be full.
---
Oh god memories... this throws me back a lot of years, thank you for sharing.
---
Anybody also remembers Allimania?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1dlnrL1WkE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1dlnrL1WkE)
---
Druids are literally the best one then. Animal forms are already immune to polymorph and slows and the trinket removes all the other effects. Neaty
---
Better up that to every 15 minutes.
---
I thought it‚Äôs been shit down awhile back when all that stuff about them was everywhere.
---
Apparently they have a plan to have several people grind elementals to get rep for the quintessences. And EU's first week is 8 days long, so if they get it on day 8 it will be a week one kill.
---
FYI, it didn't. The guy who made the addon talked with blizzard employees and agreed to change it a bit so it'll fit the "spirit of classic" better.
---
It's gonna be working as is for the first couple weeks of Classic, too.
---
Makes sense they are a ‚Äúhorde‚Äù anyway...uncivilized mob
---
"Blah blah blah my anecdotal experience means more than 70% of the wow population blah blah".
---
If you're unable to understand why "just dont use it" doesn't work for these kinds of things then I can't really help you.
---
I feel that taking out stance dancing ruined warrior and stopped playing warrior as a main after like 5 years of playing only warrior.
---
can I save these and use them as my desktop wall paper? Also do lakeshire!
---
Lol gonna be alottaaaaaaa pee breaka
---
Also, just because new realms are released that doesnt mean people will actually switch. Whitemane and Herod would likely be full even if they released another 20 realms. You would just have 20 fairly empty realms and a few full ones, just like it was in vanilla.
---
This is probably my favorite wow zone art I've seen so far. I love this style. May I ask the purpose of the diamond/dotted pattern in some spots?
---
I'd also love to see your take on a night elf zone :)
---
where and how do you check if sub is active?
---
I was thinking mining and blacksmithing but no idea honestly
---
Gaming in general? The first time I watched competitive Starcraft: Broodwar. Seeing their first person VODs and watching their replays just blew me away. Similarly, the first time I watched a competitive DotA 1 replay and was amazed at how often they used town portal scrolls.
---
For WoW I don't quite remember. I watched a fair number of PvP videos and would occasionally read stuff on Elitist Jerks and later Arena Junkies. Nowadays there's so much info out there and the skill level of the average player is dramatically higher. Not because people are even particularly good at the game, but in the past, most people had no idea what the hell they were doing.
---
Yes! Go take your dog for a walk and get logged out for being afk so i can get in.
---
While I sympathize with a lot of what you‚Äôve said, that last sentence is just defeatist. If your wrists are strained from normal ‚Äúdesk work‚Äù and gaming, then the muscles are severely underdeveloped. You NEED to do some basic exercises man. That‚Äôs not normal. You don‚Äôt need a gym for them either - just google ‚Äúwrist exercises‚Äù....
---
Don't forget sound effects
---
I think 2h weaps that aren‚Äôt from the start are learned at 10, Polearms at 20.
---
Hmm?  Oh, by wrath he'd figured things out.  It was wrath when he told me about this stuff.  When it actually happened was vanilla and early tbc.
---
Yeah it's crazy I'm actually wanting the weekend to be over and Monday to be here.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
The screenshot is inaccurate - you won't have a helm until like level 20.
---
Yeah but the char screen is incorrect too - as linked in my other post.
---
Nice.  
---
I am currently in the process of actually switching my sleep schedule around for the midnight launch.     
---
Veel succes!
---
That‚Äôd be nice, but I‚Äôd much rather get new content exclusive to classic.
---
that is literally my meme

didn't mean to mislead. I meant that I was really tired and my eyes saw what they wanted to see.

PS. I had my second WoW dream last night.
---
This to me is like shouting at a brick wall. You don‚Äôt get it, and you refuse to see any perspective that isn‚Äôt your own. I‚Äôd tell you to get over yourself, but it would be a waste. You are who you are, and apparently you choose to be a crusty shit stain with the intellect of a basement dwelling inbred and the perspective of an earthworm. If you don‚Äôt get it, I can‚Äôt make you get it. You just don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúmental capacity‚Äù.
---
Sign me up
---
Where can you even find WoW TCG cards? I looked back in Cata and even recently and could never find any, only on eBay and they were pretty pricey.
---
Moderate amount would be 8 hours a day.
---
If people don't want to switch that's on them, not Blizzard releasing realms lol.
---
(people will switch the moment they see 8 hour queues)
---
What the hell are you on about?
---
Blizzard made Classic because it‚Äôs what the players wanted.  Not because they were ripping off anything. They have never claimed it was their idea.  This is 2019, nothing is an original idea anymore, everything is derivative, and that‚Äôs OK.
---
Also, the (very) limited marketing they‚Äôve done?  That‚Äôs for those of us that asked for it, to keep us pumped and excited for a product the we asked for.
---
Working out 2-3 hours is not excessive and doesn't have to be long distance runs or heavy weight lifting nor does it have to be 2-3 hours in one session.
---
You trying to tell me you think blizzard can't ban euro players
---
? lmaoo
---
Everyone saying druids are the worst performing class are just trying to make sure people won't roll one so all the loot is theirs. But I'm not buying into that, druid all the way baby!
---
Which is right
---
That's not how weeks work but if they have to lie to make themselves feel better that's ok with me
---
I wouldn‚Äôt. Multivitamins are generally a waste of money unless they‚Äôre a high quality brand. And even then you‚Äôre better off getting your vitamin levels checked and supplementing what you‚Äôre deficient in.
---
I know! It's almost like this is an unprecedented release and they didn't factor so many people would be interested and they're adjusting as they go to make our experience better! How dare they!!!
---
TOTEM PLZ
---
This doesn‚Äôt impact anything... you‚Äôre being negative for absolutely no reason.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take away social interaction, it doesn‚Äôt streamline or automate anything, it doesn‚Äôt affect other players in any way. 
---
This is a fantastic addon by the sounds of it and will save lots of hunters a lot of wasted time as well as help them not annoying dungeon groups by running out mid dungeon.
---
I‚Äôm all for removing lfg addons, but this is a perfect QOL addon that shouldn‚Äôt bug anyone who isn‚Äôt just looking for reasons to bitch.
---
I would want it to go to the hunter just to mess with non-guild members seeing it in the world. As long as the rogues and warriors were cool with it obviously.
---
Farm elementals in the open world
---
To me, this is the only part of the add-on that is unacceptable. Personally, I think anyone who would consider using the auto-invite feature is a complete fool and would get what is coming to them, quickly learn their lesson, and stop. Past that, it is a chat parser with the ability to spam a message - things that existed before.  
---
Remove the direct addon communication and auto-invite and leave the rest of the functionality.
---
At least slightly.
---
Where can i find one like you?
---
I made my character on Firemaw today lol.
---
If your parents are gamerphobic (this society smh), then you can hire people on craiglist to do it. You only need to give them crack money so it's dirt cheap too.

you just need to use alternative methods to tame them.

Yea yea #slightchanges
---
Make friends and no server will feel small
---
Also no matter what, there will always be a smallest server in the list. And no matter what, there will always be a community of people happy to be there with each other
---
Classic uses a modified version of the BfA API.  So when looking at addons for Classic if the addon works on both it will only show the version 8.X as the websites don't clarify.  Just know that if willitclassic brings you there it does work on Classic.
---
That's exactly the problem. They are removing some API calls that can completely break other addons that have no connection to LFG only to remove a tiny part from LFG functionality.
---
In the end LFG will still work. It won't be possible anymore for it to work on private channels but it will still work with the public LookingForGroup channel.
---
Yeah, this is turning into a bit of a PTSD episode now with the flashbacks. It was honoured to get the quest and revered to get the permanent one. Ah sure I was going to be in Molten Core a lot anyway!
---
I was an Alchemist/Herbalist Rogue in Vanilla WoW. It was alright.
---
If I had to do it over again, I'd probably go Engineering though.
---
It‚Äôs honestly kinda always been that way on WoW. Certain servers lean heavily towards one factions, while others towards another faction. 
---
It‚Äôs mostly for the reason you‚Äôve already mentioned. No one wants to join a server, see that their faction is just always getting smashed and then stick to the team that‚Äôs getting destroyed. They‚Äôll join the winning team. 
---
I would wait until the game‚Äôs launched and then make another post asking which servers seem most balanced.
---
Just understand loot mechanics to avoid unintentionally pissing people off in dungeons. You only roll on loot you can use and is better than what you have. That's it. Otherwise I suggest going into it blind and enjoy.
---
5100?
---
I don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôm one of those players who ultimately wouldn‚Äôt have cared at the end of the day but isn‚Äôt the appeal of classic/vanilla knowing the community doesn‚Äôt have those convenient features?
---
Yes but I found it hard to find (maybe Im just plain blind),  you have to choose bfa over the play button and in the window of bfa where there are news and stuff you should see an additional button such as options. Should be there and not in the main settings things.
---
Layering will only exist in the first few zones.
---
I can't remember if there was a point at which you got locked in or not prior to killing any bosses (but I think you're correct). If you don't have any lock-out issues, that makes it even more lucrative.

Hertog Jan, goede keus. Don't know whether beer and powerleveling really work well together though!
---
It's you that can't be helped. I know what I'm talking about... 
---
You don't need to install it. 
---
You won't be forced to install it. 
---
You can do just as well, if not BETTER, than those that have it. Starting your own group is easy. Everyone that uses that addon will never find groups at cap. People will ask for an ilvl that is higher than the gear that drops, just like what people using Gear Score did back in wrath and how people in retail use iLvL. 
---
This addon will never catch on, as it goes against the classic philosophy. Any ilvl/gear score addon that is made for classic won't either for the same reason.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true. Though, there‚Äôs probably an argument for the fact that they‚Äôre so much more available, over-prescribed, and socially acceptable today than ever before.
---
While stealthed. In true undead rogue fashion.
---
As a Horde Rogue i'll still be listening to that music plenty &gt;:)
---
Alright thanks.
---
Do you have a good website to search for available addons? With willitclassic I see no option to essentially "discover" addons if that makes sense
---
You are just plain wrong. Omg. The OPs post was silly but your comments have an extra chromosome.
---
youre not understanding the point, they shouldnt even be close to all full.

engineering for better pvp, alchemy for money and flasks

You have fun in that group with a casual tank. Best of luck. Don‚Äôt be surprised when your healer drops.

Pretty sure the ! Is after the remindme part.

for those who play both horde and alliance they should have a tshirt thats half and half lol

something is going on with your account verification then. Not sure exactly what, but you should have 2 dropdowns. 'version' and 'account'. i would try reinstalling, but you probably already did that.

Wrong Emblem... FOR THE...
---
I'm not sure this is something I can trace as it varies significantly from game to game and I treat different games differently. I'm not really interested in competitive gaming at this point as the payoff vs the time investment does not really appeal to me. WoW in particular is not a game I perceive competitively, it's more experiential/cooperative for me. I spend a decent amount of time collecting info on classes I don't even plan to play to help out friends and such.
---
Mulgore is my favourite.
---
What's the faction balance looking like there?
---
Yea that's what I understand as well. A lot of people on this sub are celebrating as if this addon will never reappear in some form.
---
Take out the autoinvite, inspecting a spec, and probably showing the boss kills(if it even did that much) and I can see that being left alone by blizz.  Hell it even says the patch that will change the api won't be around for a few weeks. I feel like the creator of the addon will have time to adjust it based on Blizz's guidelines.

it launches at the same time my shift starts :( I wont be logging in until 7 AM the next day.

---
is this in 1080p ? :&gt;
---
Gonna preface this by saying I'm pretty new to WoW but a bunch of my friends are going to be playing classic so I will be as well. But do people actually care about having to have a conversation with people to group up for a dungeon? I play a lot of Path of Exile and do a lot of trading and use a bunch of "addons" to make trading clicking buttons with autoresponses/auto invites so I don't actually have to type things out. So I guess what I'm asking is why do people think that having to spam a channel with LFG and then having a conversation with people will lead to a more social game? What are the actual chances you continue to talk to people you just did a dungeon with instead of just forgetting about them the moment you're done with the dungeon? If I want actual people to do a dungeon with I"ll do it with my friends, not some people sitting in a chat channel I just met.

most players do not want realm queues. would much prefer realm combining in a few months over 10k realm queues on release. dont see how this is smarter

Herbalism saves you a bit of money for poisons but not much.

you have to disconnect yourself from your ego and essentially treat it as its own entity, have the mindset of " fuck you mind im going outside" this is what helped me with addiction as well, any time i was quitting and would crave drugs i would just view my mind as trying to "trick" me "go on just have a smoke itll be fine" no brain fuck you you sneaky fuck im not doing it, you have to battle your mind, every battle becomes easier and in it eventually succumbs to you so you live along side it, for me running was the main thing that helped my depression as its essentially telling your brain to stfu when you want to stop and putting your physical body first

Replace "classic" with "BfA" and it's half this subreddit

How does the addon notify you? In the chat box? A pop up in the center of the screen?
---
6 slots bags are only 5 silver from a vendor so it's not too hard to get a few of those early on. I am sure there will also be tailors around happy to make bags if you supply the materials (I know I will be).

Raided through aq as a clicker. Got to college and my roommate was phenomenal at pvp and showed me a lot that I didn't know, including keybinds which never occurred to me to change. So tbc I got a lot better.

This guy is the reference to Forest Gump. After you start the quest he talks about all the kinds of food you can make with the fish.

Dude it's an unprecedented release for them. You don't go balls deep right away in these scenarios. You put your foot in the water then adjust accordingly.
---
You tell this beta what's up dude. Absolutely no excuses.
---
Just play the game for what it is and don't worry about any kind of meta, you'll appreciate it more. Every class is viable in at least one way.
---
His name is laintime2005
---
&gt;  This addon will never catch on, as it goes against the classic philosophy.
---
Hope so, but people usually take the path of least resistance when offered to them.
---
As for the rest of your post there's nothing worth responding to.  Ion himself even said at blizzcon that they know "saying just don't use it" isn't good enough so apparently he, I, and everyone else can see something that you can't.
---
Yeah i think the best way to farm the trinket is to park your main at the spawn location &amp; level an alt &amp; log in every 20-30mins or so
---
Hey dude, you're not alone, stay strong! You can pull through this. Make sure you get your basic needs met: food, water, exercise and socializing.

Omg this is so on point.

Got my first bag at lvl 3 during the stress test. Thought that was nice. Then no more all the way to lvl 15. Hope release gives me a bit more luck.

And again, the game is not out yet, you wont be able to play for atleast 2 days, so relaxe abit.

---
You will see some group/elite quests throughout the guide. It is written from a solo perspective but like always you can add more grinding/dungeons throughout the guide to supplement in duo/trio/+ situations. The guide does suggest some times you could do extra content but doesn't go in depth so as not to confuse the majority of users.
---
I do mainly want to PvP
---
Yup, this is correct, its multiplicative
---
Ashkendi should be prio for hunter it's an off-spec item for warriors.
---
You don't need to play 12 hours a day to play your class well. Well, maybe you do.
---
There isn't eight realms being added because history shouldn't repeat itself.
---
Blizzard released too many realms in real vanilla at launch and they all died off quickly then they had to """fix""" them by adding cross-server and CRZ to the game.
---
Blizzard is smart enough to not repeat the same mistakes.
---
Aye!
---
I cannot understand the fundamental reasoning other than cost sunk fallacy as to why people are playing the absolute trash that retail is.  Especially after classic release.
---
Stealthing and ice barrage from osrs are truly nightmare inducing noises. You just know your fucked
---
Leveling isn't an issue (and it's a once-off, trivial investment of time). Gearing up a character however is another issue entirely (it's not like retail where gear is handed out like candy for token effort).

Nobody will spam you with pre-generated messages. They will spam the LFG channel and you won't even be able to tell the difference from those with or without the addon.

I'm not back at Uni until a week into October so I'm planning to wake up at 9pm or so on the 26th and doing 24 hours. Hoping that by 3am or so the queues will have died down a bit so I'll be able to get on. Then I'll probably go to bed at like 11pm the next day, get 5 or 6 hours sleep, and repeat.

Pummeler tanking is real. I'm not even memeing. Skarm is using druid as his first main and will use it through MC as a tank.
---
I never understood why dressing like its 1980 became a thing again.
---
I‚Äôm just dying that this is the hill you guys die on. Everyone keeps saying this is for keeping the classic spirit yet nobody has the same definition of the classic spirit. Let people play the game they want to play. Someone having an addon to find groups isn‚Äôt going to bother you. Everyone who is saying ‚Äúif you want lfg go play retail‚Äù like that‚Äôs the only thing that separates the 2 games. There is so much different about classic and retail that a player might want to play classic for so many reasons but would enjoy and extra add on that helps them find groups. The main demographic that would use this would be players who played classic when it released and now have more responsibility and less time to game so they can‚Äôt rationalize waiting an hour just to find a tank to do the dungeon quest. Stuff like this is what will keep the population alive on classic. Everyone who is saying go play retail over something so damn trivial is going to kill this game before it even starts. I really hope you are all just the vocal minority because if not that sense of social interaction you guys are desperately wanting to preserve is going to fall apart the minute you open your mouths

If you look at the stats for ADHD half of people who have been diagnosed with it aren't receiving medical treatment (25% opting for behavioral only, the rest are untreated entirely), and while the number of people on it have gone up, it's still not as available as you'd think unless you're on a college campus.

The only other factor that's different is that we're more open about actually talking about pretty much -all- drug use and w/e in media.

Holy Paladin is arguably the best PvP healer, incredibly fun to play, huge impact. Not particularly strong 1v1 but you can try and outlast people, or if you have spellpower you can do some shockadin memes
---
&gt; Feels weird to wait that long for BGs though, but maybe they want WPvP to flourish
---
Yeah I think that's it.  I mean it's prolly gonna be 6 months before more than 50% of the players on your server are even 60.  So honestly I think we'll see phase 3 around summer next year, perhaps like june/july ish or something like that.
---
Also, having played thru it last time around - wpvp without BGs is pretty fucking great imo.

It's not that serious, chief

---
The corrupt ones know who they are. They were there for every shitstorm.
---
Sure! It's quite a way away though, give me 50 hours or so.
---
Yes, I get off on Monday early, right at launch. I work from home and my work laptop/dock station is right next to my gaming area, I just have to roll over to it. I am almost certain everything will be broken, so getting off early likely allows me to properly disconnect my work brain.

I have some Red Bulls stashed away. I also have a couple extra six packs of sodas (RC Cola) and an assortment of water flavoring things (generic version of Mio).

When you get up to piss, you also need to stretch. I do 24-hour gaming marathons for charity and have no-lifed plenty of releases. To keep from getting stiff or sore, just stretch when you piss. Reach your arms up, touch your toes, move from side to side. If you wanna do some jumping jacks or something, it won‚Äôt hurt. I keep a 20, 25 and 50 pound free weight by my desk, as well as a desk bike. This things can help to invigorate you, as well as give you something to do other than stuff your face or play on your phone during the long process.

I am an aquarium hobbyist. I have 8 tanks all over my house. All but one of them requires me to to change water via buckets. I will be changing about 100 gallons. I will be sucking out 100 gallos of waste and water, dumping it and then refilling all with 5 gallon buckets. I will be wiping glass and tending to any trimming of live plants, too. My largest aquarium (125) has a more automated system where I just turn it on to get it out and then hook up the hose to the faucet to fill it back up. Started today, will finish tomorrow. Gotta make sure my fishbros are good before I check out for a week and only stop to feed them. 
---
I am super excited about Classic. I am a bit salty that some things were fixed early, while other bugs were deliberately left in. I hope there is good support from addon creators and community alike. I really hope six months from now people are still playing and having a good time, but I definitely feel a lot of people will be out in the first 4 to 6 weeks. Pretty sure before we hit a month Rag and Ony will be dead, too. I look forward to spending time in this old world that I loved so much, though.

**Public service announcement**
---
A public service announcement (PSA) is a message in the public interest disseminated without charge, with the objective of raising awareness of, and changing public attitudes and behavior towards, a social issue. In the UK, they are generally called 'public information films' (PIFs); in Hong Kong, they are known as 'announcements in the public interest' ('APIs').

Thanks for the tips! He will be speccing holy, but we were thinking he still try to hold aggro while questing/killing mobs, so backstabbing could be doable while questing.

I know combat is best for leveling, but we want to be able to hold our own 2v2+ vs horde in the world, and engage in some shenanigans along the way.
---
Only thing I know of is if a server is "Locked" it only lets people who already have characters on that server create new characters.
---
&gt; People care about their names that they reserved.
---
...Exactly. *Think about this when you argue in favor of server mergers which would completely annihilate the sense of identity forged in the initial creation of servers.*
---
They are erring on the side of overowding and incremental releases for a reason, and layering will provide the slack necessary to allow populations to shift gradually rather than have huge variation.
---
Are you taking about the nameplates add-on that put every nameplate within like 40 yards into a single display that allowed you to click on them for multi dotting? That thing was broken af

Totally agree with what you're saying here. What would be helpful is listing examples of what would he considered "good" for each segment (you mentioned trans fats are bad, but what are the good fats?)

agreed. i also think 30% increase in forms makes them great flag carriers also

In Vanilla we started using it for Vael IIRC. Most guilds on Illidan required it.
---
Just wondering why.  Will you be keeping in touch with your Steam friends and want them to know what game you are in?
---
I travel a ton but the program I'm on currently has me "working" about 40-80 minutes a day. Im on site from 3-6 hours a day a couple days a week at most. In the winter, there's less going on so I will take months off at a time. There are a lot of total dipshit losers that fuck up their lives for this type of thing but there's also a bunch that have a plan.
---
Fuckin' A, man.
---
These friendly reminder threads about the most basic common sense topics are so annoying.

---
Zygor because it has an ingame addon that tells you every step to do. Also auto-vendor all gray items and auto-equip the best item and talent advisor
---
rough take for someone whos going to end up playing the same exact game just in a different way.
---
to be fair though, retail raids are also balanced on this. Instead of 1 mechanic like in classic, most bosses in retail have like 10 and without those add-ons maybe only 0.1% of guilds would be able to complete a raid
---
No I'm not expecting there to be but I'm interested in a resource that offers the strongest options.
---
i wont be playing hunter but i think this is a great thing you made :)
---
The server being full is related to total accounts or accounts logged in. It doesn't matter how many characters you make.

I had a few friends that said they might play but I'm expecting to go in alone. though when battlegrounds and raids come along, I'm going to love creating team events and meeting new people then and on the journey to get there!

also I'll be able to heal my friends as a healer so it's going to be a nice time

How can someone who is a "partner" of twitch, stream on another platform.In the terms and conditions of being a partner, you are not allowed to do this. Read up Fam.

You might be onto something here. Do quest text pop up even with no UI when you click on a quest giver? Or do you have to swap in and out to pick up and deliver quests?

Also I'm assuming you'll need to turn it back on to put spells on your bars and keybind them every time you get new ones.

We have to be grateful for the two servers we got already.

This kind of breaks my heart. I wish I could do this. Now with 2 kids + a job + *cough* a wife. It's just unrealistic to pull off.

But gosh I'm jealous. I will maybe get to play 1 or 2 hours a night if I'm lucky.

No, Asmon and all other streamers (95%) are on Faerlina.

There was a "Booty Bay Babes" on my server back in the day, pretty popular.

There are plenty of useful Engineering items that non-engineers can use, it's just **most people will overlook them** in order to justify needing to have engineering directly
---
+ [Discombobulator Ray](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4388/discombobulator-ray) for PvP (instant-cast that will dismount players, snare them and reduce their stats)
---
+ [Flash Bomb](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4852/flash-bomb) aoe fear against beasts (think Druids, Hunter Pets)
---
Those are game-changing items (in a PvP environment) that don't require engineering that you will sell a lot of (to anyone serious about PvP who can't make their own).

I think a HUGE factor that you're overlooking here is that a lot of us were preteens during vanilla. I didn't know what a CNS stimulant was at that age.  So the original comment "now we have adderall" makes a lot more sense under that context

You did not get the joke

Its better to not have Classic LFG in the game. Not only is ClassicLFG fundamentally antithetical to the philosophy of Classic. What minor negative consequences arise from other users is worth the pain.

there's been a LOT of bad/misleading info in the last year.  Your best bet is to look at guides from old pserver forums.

To my knowledge no official metrics have been released by blizzard in regards to faction balance. I think you‚Äôll be fine rolling on just about any server
---
Very valid points. Definitely didn‚Äôt know the stats on it, and I kinda figured as a recent college grad my perspective was probably skewed.

Totally just mouth diarrhea.

Not really a risk. I planned on buying it either way. I was just answering the question.

This is wrong and not accurate until TBC where you literally cannot win if you're x class against y.
---
In vanilla, you can beat any class as any class.
---
That's a great theory, but the reality is once blizzard made twinks play in separate battlegrounds it died out almost entirely. You can't argue with facts and logic my man.
---
They do exist! Holy shit

I come from Path of Exile. And every League (which is an economy reset and new mechanic every 3 months) there's 1000 posts on the subreddit complaining about people not responding to PMs, getting spammed with PMs and other such stuff that stems from the fact that whispering people is pretty much the only way to communicate with other players in that game. Spoiler alert, whispering people and spamming a chat channel is not social interaction like people like to claim in this sub. Social interaction happens when you're in a group already, and you talk about strategies and other stuff that happens in a dungeon.   
---
Watch I'm gonna get the reply "go back to retail zoomer"
---
I mained a druid in BC and WotLK and seconded a Shaman into WotLK and played them both pretty evenly in Cata until firelands when I quit. 
---
My plan is to main a Shaman, 2nd a mage and 3rd a druid. The Shaman I intend to mostly duo with a friend, I'm EST he is PST.  The mage will be another duo character, since I am grateful enough to have a super amazing girlfriend who although isnt much of a gamer, is very interested in learning to play! So the druid will just be my in between off character when time zones conflict and my SO isn't playing.

In general I think there will be a lot more actual talking to your group in dungeons, unlike current wow. So it‚Äôll be easier for people to know when to run back and such like that. Dungeons take too long to put up with someone you dislike, so people will learn to be good or they‚Äôll get left behind.

Running Gnomeregan is probably easier on a spelladin than a feral since they have consecration. It really won't be bad at all, my plan is to farm Gnomeregan 15 minutes in the morning before I start my day and 15 minutes when I get home. With a drop rate of about 30-40% that leaves you 20-30 if you farm every day. You don't need that many though, so you probably will only have to farm every other day. Not entirely sure how efficient a paladin will be since they can't stealth, so it may be more or less farming depending on the circumstances. Typically most people only use 1 per fight and switch to a secondary weapon after the 90 seconds are up, you'll do slightly less damage but not too much less.
---
Hahah ikr, I actually got the heart rate monitor working in my stream today :P

&gt; then you go through loch modan and the wetlands; you'll die no more than maybe 3-5 times between the mid-range spirit healer to the menethil harbor spirit healer. Rez there, grab the flight path, hop on the boat. make your hearth wherever you feel is best a long the way.

I agree that these zones should be used, but I don‚Äôt think we would need 3.5 sets. Instead, we could have a new type of resistance that is only effective in the new areas. That way we could have new gear that is only stronger than T3 while you‚Äôre in a Classic+ zone. Would be like horizontal progression somewhat similar to GW2, that way Classic won‚Äôt end up bloated like live, and the new items won‚Äôt trivialize old world gear.
---
there was a macro or an addon that was basically focus in vanilla, but then they broke that when they added focus, and then they removed focus for classic and didn't add any way to do it the old way
---
Do you not have a piss bucket?
---
There are a few world-spanning, long questlines, but its mostly self-contained to the immediate area.  The storyline is much more inferred on your part by connecting all the dots.

I'll be well past whatever lvl you choose to twink at by the time you finally get your gear together with that 3 inch club of yours.

---
:D  Just noticed the updated population and this made me chuckle. Need that right now :D
---
Relatively speaking, quest stories in classic are amazing. 
---
But when I say "relatively" I mean relative to what  came before classic, which in the case of MMORPGs was often [keyword], [enemy] [direction], [keyword] interactions. 
---
If you play classic, you'll be playing a game which lacks 15 years of polish. As far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing.

Im also playing warlock, you can do two gathering profession at first since it will obviously bring you the most gold, but remember you can only track one ressource at a time, so it can be painful to have 2 gathering professions at the same time. Also, tailoring is the only profession where you get most of your ressources through drops, some stuff also need mats from skinning. 
---
What i will be running is tailoring and skinning, as it doesnt take much effort since you only skin what you kill, you don't have to run around for nodes and stuff. I also believe that tailoring will be a must since gear isn't as common in classic, so you will get many upgrades from that profession. And bags man, this can bring a lot of gold too. Since engineering is mostly a gold sink, i will only take this profession at lvl 60 because i like what it brings on the table when you PVP.
---
yes join the skeram harem bug brother
---
How are you at character art? I'd love to see some tier sets. Really I just want to see more of your stuff. Do you have a deviant art or do you take commissions?
---
.........Blamo it is then.
---
A gold farm that is up to 3x as good as any other in the game, when you spend hundreds of gold a week to speedrun raids is a pretty good motivation.
---
Gold actually had value in vanilla btw
---
I'd just take tailoring+enchanting from the get go and have fun with progressing with professions naturally.
---
LoL nobody is gonna see this but this is actually the only useful comment from the all thread if true (can't join the discord from the GitHub page so can't check)
---
As they did with the addon, most people won't try to understand the Blizzard change either. So see you all in a month when that shit show is gonna happen :D.
---
So drinking tea is shit according to you.
---
Hint: It's not.
---
I still can't decide
---
Mage or rogue... I'll be playing together with warlock  and pvp

and I guess enchanting /leather/skinning are the best profs for the beginning  right ?
---
It's not fair to make me choose this or classic REEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!

Sound like a great idea! I plan to keep my regular exercise regiment but I'd love to try this out. I'd like to know more exercises to do at home so I'll gladly give this program a run to see if I like it

There are a lot of addons in retail wow are to make it so players don‚Äôt have to think, and instead could just press a button to do it all for them. I think that addons are a large part of why wow isn‚Äôt as fun anymore. Like there are game mechanics that have changed or have been added that also contribute to that but addons have definitely been one of them. Things like Quest Helper back in vanilla wow was like the first big step in that direction. Or maybe Decursive.
---
So for me I am gonna try to play without any addons that take away any work or brain usage.

Exactly.  The wow community doesn't exactly have the best reputation for being welcoming and this whole fiasco does nothing to help that stereotype.
---
If they just ninja leave after 1 wipe without a word, black listed. If they say something like "I just can't do this anymore, good luck", no problem. We're wiping a bunch and the group is looking to split, no problem.

Serious question, why would not update your OS to at least Windows 7? Why dual boot?

Doing skinning and tailoring personally. Vendor skins, make some bags for myself and my group. Level tailoring as I go for Shadoweave set. Drop skinning down the road for either enchant or engineering.

Min-maxing is a ver real part of competetive play. If you REALLY want to compete, you always take your edges. Even if it's for a .1% winrate, because that wins you 1/1000 fights/games/matches w/e. If you're killing 1000's of players, that adds up.
---
Haha so true
---
It‚Äôs reasonable for me to assume that the people from eve were trying to create rmt paywalls for flasks/gear. They said they had no interest in pve or pvp aside from killing alliance and colluding with alliance for devilsaur and lotus. What value does gold have if you don‚Äôt pve or pvp?

Remember... Every character with a gleam in their eye will be putting mats on the AH. This will certainly drive the price to rock bottom. It would be a good time to stock up.
---
I'd stick with tailor+enchanting till you can make a wand, then drop tailoring for a gathering profession. I'd go with herbs, because alchemy is always a good money maker.
---
Don't follow the FOTM engineering for everyone who even want's to PvP. You don't really need it till way later. Hell...we won't even have Honor till Phase 2, so yoyu have a lot of time.

He could probably get sued if Blizzard cared enough

Go listen to the Rolling Stones song Mother's Little Helper. That was 1966.
---
Who is this guy? Does he live here?
---
Personally I'm gonna go two gathering professions. I don't think having a production profession is gonna be worth it early on unless you're the designated LW/Tailor for a guild.
---
There are lots of small stories that are excellent. Pay attention to the little details, read quest text. It all adds up to an excellent experience. 
---
Also the Onyxia attunement on both factions is fantastic. Horde side is the greatest. Looking for Rexxar is so simple but it feels so epic.
---
My dude if your just playing casually, play what you want
---
Uwu, what's this?
---
FYI: 5 man paladin groups in undead dungeons are a riot. Everyone is tank, healer and dps all at the same time. Someone pulled agro? They're the new tank. Healer went down? You've got 4 more.
---
Bah, wat vies. Gewoon pre-workout gebruiken of pep
---
That was my first thought as well, but booting in safe mode and downloading and installing the newest drivers does nothing, pretty sure the gpu just finally died on me, had it for i would guess 6 years now, so I guess i got my money's worth.
---
Well, there is only 2 options for horde warlock, both are good on their own. but 5% miniondamage is really not impactful, so if that's you only consideration......
---
I would use a 3 monitor setup more efficiently personally. Right screen with any kind of tracking/informative add-ons, party/raid frames, chat information/etc. Left screen for websites/music/video.    
---
Your current setup would just make me nauseated and overall visually fatigued.
---
It is a bit ironic though.  If you look at all the Reddit server surveys, Grob has a far higher population than Bloodsail, just goes to show how strong the PvP bias is on this sub.
---
Google it, can't be that hard huh?
---
The "zone" south of Silithus is AQ (40 and 20)
---
More like don't neglect your kids... ehh, they'll figure out how to survive...
---
they have some dope passives compared to ESO. For instance undeads can consume bodies for health and have an anti stun ability. Just look up the classic passives. Id say if youre really going to get heavy into it race does matter some.

It will make the day go faster. I'm going to a barbecue. It'll be my last outdoor activity for a while.

40 x 15 = $600/mo. Not the most expensive hobby but it's up there! Sounds like fun. Gl man I'll definitely tune in to see how it's going.

Some people either have no responsibility such as no just, while others have good enough jobs that allow them the time off. There‚Äôs tons of reasons and ways people get to do it.
---
This is true but you can still "be competitive" ... If you want to be absolutely number one then yes you need to forego preference and go with every tiny edge you can get.
---
briilant

Does the stretched out edges not bug you? It's horrible... I use an ultra wide, so I totally commiserate with the desire for width, but I just can't come to terms with the terrible distortion.

I think im going to retire my dwarf hunter in the thunderbrew Inn, it was one of my earliest memories from when i was a little kid getting into the game and i was amazed how cozy and homely it felt

Bumping this comment bumping the thread because I too really like this concept and agree completely.

---
I would love to... But my bosses husband will be playing clasic to so they know and i would never get away with it. I think my wow mousepad and or statue's at work may have given something away.
---
If you are raiding and you have only one character, I suggest herbalism and alchemy.
---
Otherwise, I'm not sure how you can prepare for raids with all the necessary consumables, unless you make enough money with other professions. 
---
Perhaps skinning  + leatherworking could work, or skinning + engineering, though you'll have to buy mats.
---
Besides grenades and damaging items, you can also make your own arrows, which is nice for both pve and pvp.
---
I'm really scared of the cost of wisdom flasks, resistance potions, mageblood, mongoose etc, so I'd probably do alchemy + herbalism anyway.
---
thats sad to hear, i hope you can still get a fix or a new in time for classic thou

Sadly tiger at 40 isnt possible for anyone but NE.

I‚Äôm new to the Tartarus and to the Naga, they are gonna be battle tested in Classic, but I have this keyboard for like 5 years and never had a problem with it.
---
Hmmm.. so to reply to peoples comments and tag on some thoughts. I suppose I'd also consider their utility in a bit broader context. For example:
---
- Is cannivalize a useful BG PvP ability to keep pushing, or fear and eat a corpse? 
---
- How useful is it in dungeons and raids. Will there be corpses around to eat and lifetap or is that even preposterous to consider? 
---
- Do grenades incapacitate count as stuns vis a vis Hardiness? Or just some grenades or none? 
---
- Anyone have a feel for whether the 5% pet damage maybe juuuust helps tip the voidwalker to hold threat effectively?
---
Ban language
---
I think that you're underestimating Hardiness. Unless you have a way of breaking out of Cheap Shot, you're not popping free acting potions until you're out of the first stunlock. If you pop a free action potion expecting the second stunlock, you won't accomplish much besides getting Sapped until the potion fades.
---
OP blueballed us hard.

What a weird coincidence in Chinese culture the displaying of bones is prohibited. I guess blizz can virtue signal and look woke in reality they are just bending over to Chinese censorship. Seeing 309240 skeletons after a World PVP battle was hilarious, it also actually let you know shit was going down. What were they thinking? 
---
I guess you better ban the alphabet, bonfires, totems too since that can be used for 'hate speech.' Which wasn't even in blizzard's vocabulary in Vanilla and there wasn't much of a problem.

Taurens and dwarves are nothing special but apart from that just roll what you like based on aesthetics. Or perhaps you could choose for the best PvP racial in Orc, best PvE racial in Troll, or a fun gimmick in nelfs?

To be fair, the mouse might as well not exist in FFXI. It wasn't designed for it, and you can tell.
---
But yea, I used to main WHM and have my most important spells on the bars, along with gearswaps and some utility spells, and then job abilities I'd usually just leave off the bars and type them in to use them. Since incoming damage and abilities were fairly consistent, you could get away with doing it easily.
---
Nowadays with all the addons, half the stuff can be automated for you so it doesn't matter as much.

You're prepped for diabetes feller.

Yeah, but soon he‚Äôll be on the take, and that‚Äôs when the real problems will start.

Wait you mean you don‚Äôt like all the posts about snacks, eating healthy, proper ventilation, drinking water, exercising, and other shit that‚Äôs painfully obvious to most people?
---
Good thing i have nothing she wants including my penis.
---
Priests are pretty great at leveling. You‚Äôre very sturdy and won‚Äôt die much if at all. Spirit tap with wand specialization means you have really great killing speed and high uptime. Make sure to find good wands as you level, they make a huge difference. And you‚Äôll make friends easily, if you team up with a warrior for example you can chew through a ton of quests and it works out great. And then at 60 you‚Äôre an important healer with good options and some fun BiS items to hunt for. 
---
I‚Äôll be playing a priest as an alt- love that class.
---
Some race/class combos make a significant difference. For a Horde warlock, race really doesn't matter for PvE. For PvP, undead is a great choice for fear/sleep/charm breaks and orc is good for extra stun resist. Some might also say Orc is good for PvE because of extra pet damage, but a lot of the time you will sacrifice the pet for increased damage. Those who play the SM/Ruin spec, which keeps the pet, also won't benefit much from it. They'll have to use their imp in raids to provide Blood Pact, but imps do fire damage while most bosses in the first two raids are immune to fire.
---
Not, unless you play an alliance priest, then dwarf is manditory.
---
 I know he was going to have a members version but he did not say that his guide was going to go from fully free to locked behind membership, that is the point. that is why people are upset. And yes i can understand English just fine, how about you stay on topic instead of getting into personal insults :)
---
I think a lot of people are forgetting that even with layering, you'll be leveling with a pretty large pack of people (if you don't get ahead of the zerg) and you'll have to fight over nodes in the beginning because everyone is trying to do the same thing as you.
---
Also IIRC you can make an alt, level it to 5, get enchanting, and disenchant certain items up to X level. I might be wrong on this, but could be a better option to do that instead of have it on your main.
---
Engineering + blacksmithing.
---
Engi for a bombs and toys, bs for anti fear trinket.
---
I like it but this misses raid times which are very important!
---
my Mage and then Hunter
---
I think the get caught up thing really applies this early. I've been at the front of progression on TBC and there were often massive delays because two guilds ended up going to a raid at the same time and fights broke out. In vanilla that's even more common since warlock summoning is even harder.
---
lol everyone relax and save it for the crossroads. ;)
---
If you're at a point in your life where you're happy, you've been working for years, and you decide to just take a couple of years to do something that makes you happy how is that sad in any way?

As long as it's not negatively impacting your life, and you're taking care of yourself, what's the harm?

This is the best I‚Äôve ever seen durotar look. Great job. I hope you work in a creative field. Otherwise, your talents are wasted

Consistency is important in life.

Hopefully there'll be at least a little bit of that in BC or WotLK with the Rogue Thrown talents and deadly throw and all that stuff.

Warlocks changed a lot.  They went from complete joke to powerhouse.

Yes, all of the above.

From what I understand there's two main ways of key binding for stance dancing.
---
Keybind the stances to switch panels.
---
OR (what I personally do)
---
Macro basically every ability to a stance and have the same abilities show for every stance you're in even if you can use them in that stance.
---
For example for me 3 is Thunderclap. Whenever I press it, in whatever stance it will put me in battle stance and use the ability.
---
She'll still take that in litigation though.
---
I'll be going solo because i work night shift and my schedule doesnt match with any of my friends. 
---
Also means finding a guild with people consistently on in the am is going to be difficult
---
Maybe an Eryx video?
---
Most people playing wow are 80% crevice
---
There are only like 3 or 4 encounters where fear ward is useful. It's not the end all be all, it just means tanks don't need to stance dance for Magmadar/Chromaggus/other fear encounters
---
Here I am trying to take WoW into moderation, how dare I have a full time job and a 2 year old...

Chosing any class for the reason you gave is...intelligent. Enjoy your competitive class.

Lol I can do a full shower easily on a cross continental FP.

There‚Äôs an imposter of him on mal‚Äôganis which is sad

People who only play 4 hours a day will only hit about 120 hours in a month. Meaning they wont be level 60 because it takes 240 on average. Fastest time play to level 60 in private servers is like 4 or 5 days
---
Well for me I played Vanilla 15 years ago and it was awesome. I want to keep those memorys and have no desire to replay it for any reason but nostalgia trips every now and then. (During the beta I did like half a quest and wanted to poke my eyes out due to boredom xD). But that's just my opinion I know there are many who share this opinion and many who don't... good Blizz gives us the possibility to chose now.  
---
Neither game will be dead, I am pretty sure about that. (Just to be clear I think BfA is the worst addon WoW ever had xD still I prefer something new every few month to grind out over something where I had achieved almost everything 15 years ago xD)
---
WHM main represent!
---
Thats what I'm playing! At max level you can summon demons to wreck towns, provides alot of fun!
---
Sell the armor/weapon you start the game with, go to your warlock trainer (in the back of the cave) and get Immolate at level 1. Your replace all the gear within the first few quest anyway.
---
My mistake. I didn't finish reading your comment. I was referring to the nameplates being uncustomizable in instances and assuming that's where your comment was going.
---
Yes, but they kind of change the skin/design of the UI. I mean the gryphon art, the gray button background, don't they?

Hey daywon

Go watch all the youtubers.  Piece together all the info from all of them.  There are good hints that some mention in passing that others don't.
---
These are great. Well done
---
Stories were all over the place in vanilla. And often you get sent to different continents to carry on a story and by the time you're high enough to get over there, you'd have forgotten all about it.
---
You'll mostly miss hour-long queues and frequent disconnects. No worries.
---
Zygor because it‚Äôs awesome.
---
You haven‚Äôt lost anything because the queues will be huge!
---
I feel pretty good about how the classic team has treated us
---
dang it that sucks, im at home but for us germans it releases on midnight 27.08.2019 00:00 and i have to work, so no launch for me, i feel u buddy
---
Hint: I never said that.
---
I said it requires work to produce, time to ingest, and time to kick in. I cant see my previous comment,  but I am pretty sure I even concede that tea is actually one of the healthier options...
---
But the likelihood of tea being chosen over a monster by this community is minimal.

So will those energy drink chuggers switch to tea?

Hint: they won't

When i try to boot i get some artifacting then immediately to this screen, i can boot in safe mode, and when in safe mode i can uninstall gpu drivers, then i can boot normally, however on the default graphics (integrated grapics i believe).

Popsicles with a frozen creamy center, basically. Most common is orange popsicle, but I found a combo pack with orange, lime (my favorite), and the pink one (which I'm not sure what the flavor is, but still delicious).
---
Glad to hear it and take your time, we've all got some plenty of time to put in :).
---
Yeah, it would be a lot of work
---
You're not screwed, sleep on the plane and get in queue during off-hours and play overnight, you'll probably have an easier time.
---
Not for me my friend.  If you are in the us, you get it the 26th.
---
Something people often forget is the "Black Book build" or the "Machine Gun Imp", which in Vanilla is actually really strong in short PvP fights. With your Imp pulling off such massive dps (albeit temporarily), the Orc racial trait actually comes in handy. However, that's pretty much the only high-pet-damage build in the game, and it isn't until Burning Crusade that your pet can start to really shine and the Orc trait is more consistently valuable.
---
Shifting costs a lot of mana whereas rank 1 polymorph does not
---
Plan accordingly
---
Enjoy leveling and the game rather than race to 60.

No priests of all races are acceptable, dwarf is just highly recommend

---
All classes and specs are viable.  Only roll dwarf priest if your into the meta and want to mix/max in a progression guild.  95% of the players won‚Äôt be hardcore enough for it to really matter.
---
I've been told this several times recently. I console myself by thinking back to the times I spent in Naxx in vanilla, I never killed a boss there but thats still more than a lot of people managed. :D
---
The design is awesome. As others have said some of the talents are questionable. 
---
If you want this to really take off, consider a build your interface. And some pricing information outside of PMs would be helpful.
---
a URBS with like mid-tier raid gear would be cool , like MC or BWL or somewhere in between.

Came here for Simpsons comments. Was not disapointed.

Despite being one of their worst treated communities.

Other MMOs have shown when the games drop in popularity the RP community is what keeps your game rolling (Ie - SwToR) and yet the only time the RP community gets anything is when it serves other parts of the community as well. It's really damn sad...

---
&gt; If WA picks a fight and loses people will continue to play the game and new addon devs will fill in the gaps.
---
So many people don't understand what this tweet is saying. The point they try to get across is that by disabling parts of the API it will affect all addon authors just for the sake of getting rid of one particular type of addon that Blizzard doesn't like. 
---
If people are inclined to they will find ways around Blizzards limitations and what will happen then? Will Blizzard further cripple the addon API? It's a slippery slope and it's a bad route to take, for everyone, since it's a collective punishment in a sense.

&gt;&gt;Enjoy your splurge of junk food if that's your jam for classic. A week of eating bad stuff isn't going to kill you.

People are having fun and the way they want to spend classic is up to them. All you are doing is coming off as a judgemental prick.
---
Thanks, I'll definitely have a look at ElvUI then! I only remember a modern and sophisticated UI, not the vanilla flavored UI I'm looking for, but I may have missed some options.
---
Teabag!
---
Get mining and mine any node you see. Make sure you have enough materials for leveling both BS and Engineering before moving to higher lvl zones. Your second profession should be another gathering profession or enchanting (wouldn't recommend herbalism since it can slow you down around the 80-125 area). Ideally you want to fishbot when you're sleeping but I won't recommend any programs since it's prohibited here. At 60, drop both professions and get BS/Eng. Ideally, fishing would be your main source of money but you could also level an alt with gathering profs.
---
Badass!
---
It‚Äôs hit or miss. If you ever played the game octopath traveler it‚Äôs a lot like that. There‚Äôs a lot of smaller mundane day in the life stories going on. And then there‚Äôs a few larger overarching narratives. But very few epic grand I‚Äôm the chosen champion who‚Äôs gonna save the world ala retail stories.
---
It is also back in retail btw. Not that you should play that mess.
---
It's hard but possible to do it.
---
You have a 100% chance to have 1 tranq shot.
---
What some hard pushing private server guilds did was when the boss enraged and tranq shot was on cd or missed they'd rotate shield walls. This is possible cause in mc every boss is tauntable.
---
A fury warrior with a shield and shield wall plus heavy healing could survive for the time it was active. By that time usually tranq shot was up again.
---
Atleast thats how i remember pserver tryhards pushing for week1 magmadar.
---
Just go away please.
---
They gonna have to hire more people at the dorito and mt dew factories.

How long?

Man that Thunderbluff one is by far my favorite.
---
I hear Orcs travel in single file to hide their number.
---
They'd be pretty fucking broken if a jack of all trades class was the chart topper for every category you monkey.
---
im kinda in the same boat. but im sceptical about expansions. Its not a great concept and we've seen what can happen further down the line. tbc was great, sure. But the concept of constantly adding lvls and cutting off everything behind max lvl into irrelevancy is hurtful.&gt;  
---
I think it would be a missed opportunity for blizz not to try and go in a slightly different direction with classic+
---
Because humans are the best?
---
There's a lot of cool things that can be implemented by just revamping older less used dungeons. Uldaman was my favorite because you can make things harder
---
!remind me 1 day
---
Great thought. How did you know I‚Äôm in Texas???? Lol
---
My dream of Classic+ has always been Burning Crusade Talents and Spells in Vanilla Progression.  Like a Burning Crusade Level 60 Twink server.
---
More content post-Naxx would be great, but I'm more interested in the class changes they made after Naxx.
---
Is that wipes' voice? That screamy raid leader guy?
---
Ew
---
Doing 5 paladin dungeons is fun, but at some point you realize that probably all 5 want the same items and a lot is wasted because its for other classes.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, it is a bit short sighted to book time off for a game that is dependant on things out of their control. Plus this is not a new thing with blizzard releases, these people know exactly what they are getting themselves into.
---
honest question-- why?
---
what have either of them done that gives you "absolute faith" they could design content on par with old skool WoW, or that they'd be capable of making the right balance decisions?  Keep in mind a lot of really talented people spent years trying to recreate the success of WoW in other MMOs and they all failed.
---
don't fuckin die now..... double fisting what i assume is european beer and redbull lol. what's all this fuss about anyways, new expansion? i don't play this game anymore so im out of the loop.
---
fuck no
---
They can be fucking happy that I will still give them one mor chance 
---
Blizzard died a while ago
---
They‚Äôre all gonna be full on launch day probably. I feel bad for anyone who took work off to stare at a queue lol
---
I'd say it is probably a form of dithering, something you tend to see more in pixel art.
---
If I could gank my own faction I would, Timeless Isle was amazing for that :(
---
Ret prio
---
To be honest it doesn't matter much. Hunters are probably slightly faster levelers. Warlocks are a bit better in lategame PvE. Warlocks have summons, but hunters don't have to farm soul shards.

The Classics API is basically a nerfed version of BFAs, so you can set up most of your addons on BFA and just move the addons folder to Classic

/u/ChromedDragon had some amazing zone ideas. I wanna see those.
---
i think the 1000iq move they have planned is make a above average retail expansion and release it whenever people are a little tired of classic
---
i wont be playing it but i do think its a smart move
---
basically using classic to get some older players to try retail
---
its already known they are doing a level squish , they could try and emulate classic in retail shrug

Eu servers zijn ook 12 uur uit. Waarom NA spelen
---
First I'll level my main priest, then mage for farming when I'll have time for it, druid for herbalism and because it was always my main before and I still love them but they aren't that good in Classic, but may be they'll add BC some day.
---
With 10k people per server I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôll be any slower.
---
I was going in alone, but I used Discord to find a guild on my server ahead of launch.
---
You can be competitive on anything. All throughout WoW racials have only made a small impact at the very top tier of PvP or PvE, the cutting edge. World first guilds or players going for rank 1 is the time it matters. And even then, at that point it's the player skill with that small racial making a small difference.

Thanks, trying these but I don't think any of them are it. I think it was most likely a troll rogue, maaaaybe undead, but more likely troll?

Bruh you can make lots of arguments to why horde might be better...but the stormwind music is waaaaay sicker than org
---
that's nice. this post wasn't intended for your opinion, thanks though
---
I mined bits commercially back when the margins were better. I had a rigid maintenance regime and monitoring system, up to replacing the thermal paste annually and so I'd agree on this point. In a business it just makes sense to take care of your equipment. But when I was ready to get rid of a card it was because it has just stared showing it was weaker than it's buddies.
---
So I sold them, as used mining cards, but with a three month warranty because that's what I considered fair. I got a good third of them back and I'm guessing I never heard about the 6 month fails.
---
All of this said, I wouldn't buy a second hand card from a gamer either, so we also agree on that point. Buying new for GPUs just makes sense to me but it's not like you can't get a bad card fresh out of the factory either. It's a complicated issue, but a shiny new warranty does make the choice a bit easier in my mind.
---
There has been 10+ pics of advertising on this sub recently
---
Hahaha no :D that would be hilarious!
---
No.  I can only speak anecdotally from the people I know and I've witnessed who would prefer legacy BC over classic.  Myself included.  Main reason I'll be playing classic is with some hope of BC and WotLK progression.    
---
Some of them (again, including some friends of mine) said they started playing right near the end, or after vanilla, and therefore are FAR more hyped about possible BC realms.  One even said he'd return for BC, but not vanilla.   
---
Would any of these people be on this sub?  Unlikely.  Not if they're not massively fussed about vanilla.
---
Yeah exactly, just wake up at like 8pm, no problem.  Monday's a public holiday anyway ;)

Any addons that send info between users using same addon. Some RP addons were brought up. Other addons can have sync functions that run through these back channels such as DBM maybe even some damage meters that sync between raid members. Carbonite maps used to do something like this don't know if it's available for Classic. Any social addon like Calendar, Guild mate trackers etc. 
---
And I'm sure there are others ..
---
Yes, earth.
---
28th
---
And if it did become that bad... I‚Äôm sure blizzard will would reinforce that streamers have their own channels exclusively. Private channels (even though they weren‚Äôt used very often) do exist in the game.
---
Human racial dominates pvp.
---
Like why?...I don't get you people. How about instead of being a dickhead for no reason you fuck off and let him play however he wants?
---
Banned
---
Are shamans viable tanks in dungeons?
---
As always, this is a cat vs mouse game.
---
Best and most recent example are the WQ addons. Blizz broke them, devs found a way around it, now they are super clunky to use, but they are still there. 
---
They'll never be able to remove concepts like that completely. Even if they broke the addons, Discord and similar features are still there, for those that really need them.
---
Blizzards never had a problem with people selling guides, some guides just happen to be in addon form. 
---
However, Pirating it isn't illegal.
---
Hrmm. . You say stuff you downloaded from WiC didn't work?
---
Hrmm. . interesting.  since you can't download ANYTHING from Will It Classic.
---
Troll fail 101.

Way more fun to be the underdog

10 gold an hour and all the fish I can eat

It's cool you'll be in Q anyway. Maybe by the time they are in bed you'll be ready to go.
---
Coffee and/or tea.
---
Who does Blizzard's strategy guides in e.g. magazines. I doubt all of them are licensed, and those have existed since at least Warcraft 1 without legal enforcement. That's an awkward legal precedent. Blizzard won't take action on Joana's guide.
---
honestly on retail one server ends up 10% one faction and 90% the other 
---
then the nex server will be reversed 
---
because people want to play on a pvp server because everyone is a carebear
---
Doesn‚Äôt change that they existed then.
---
The player base is different than it was, there are going to be newer/better addons available now because we know way more about the game than we did 15 years ago. 
---
Just because players didn‚Äôt use some addons then, doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to exist now. 
---
I barely even knew addons existed when I played originally, should I not be allowed to use them now because of that lack of knowledge? 
---
Classic isn‚Äôt going to be an ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù Vanilla, experience regardless of what the game itself is like because the players are different.
---
Agreed, using a sick day to sit in queue is really what‚Äôs on my mind. That would be shitty.
---
Didn't know I was that guy
---
I took two weeks off.  Took my guild to Blaumeux and we just hit medium population.  Gonna be a damn fine launch for my friends and I.
---
uh uh
---
people wait for new exp for 2 years
---
they had been waiting for classic for a decade
---
Rogue it is. Won't be a healer in pvp,I want to melt faces
---
You forgot 2% butterscotch ripple
---
Uh tunna tun uh tunna tun ooo dadada
---
There's also many cases where they aren't even that good at the game. I remember back when I did serious raiding there was a ustop5 guild on my server that would down bosses before my guild. We would get the encounters down in 1/3 of the time it took them but since they would stay up until 6-7am raiding they got to be on the "cool" list. How they are able to raid like that I have no idea and I never wanted to ask.
---
That is the thing I was trying to tell you but the most people are rejecting reality.
---
Lfg addon not going anywhere so deal with it
---
*no*
---
being angry at bugs in a game which you paid for is "toxicity" now?
---
Doesn't matter if it existed in vanilla. Blizzard won't have LFG tools that undermine the social aspect of group finding in WoW Classic. Neither should you.
---
Me neither but my server back then was still 90% alliance. For some reason I think this time it will be 90% horde on all servers, tho.
---
Rockbiter and earth shock have extra threat so you can get stuff on you. Easier in lower dungeon and mitigation becomes harder later on, but if you like a challenge it's possible.
---
Because discord is the best app for voice chatting and video. Don't let these community posts tell you otherwise, its not like that. I use my discord solely with friends and guilds and am only member of discord rooms of interest like Nioh and Yugioh. You choose who adds you and what you follow
---
There was in the stress test.  So I would assume so.
---
These are all super cute! I love 'em. :D
---
Your assumption about the effectiveness of stuns against certain classes only works if your get-out-of-stun card is off cooldown. 
---
&gt;If someone opens on an Orc with Garrote that bleed is going to put a spanner into the works of anything they might plan on doing to retaliate. You can't sap targets that are in combat and trying to re-stealth whilst bleeding all over gives you a very very tiny window to actually do anything in. 
---
You can surely Garrote, but that's not as effective as going through a stunlock cycle. Not sure what you mean with the last part. Wouldn't the fact that using Garrote on an orc negates the option of Sapping speak in favour of Hardiness?
---

More of this and less misinformed guides. This stuff is cool.

People play specs that are not holy

That is not just this sub... that is all of reddit where topics of contrast are discussed.......
---
If you are not posting bullshit cat pictures and actually trying to discuss something that has two sides.... be prepared to be downvoted, because those that agree hardly EVER take the time to upvote and those that disagree ALWAYS downvote..... which is not even the purpose of the fucking vote button.
---
Just cook extra and eat leftovers
---
No aoe/group heals: strong st healer, but overall best pve healer is a stretch.
---
Buy a 50 bucks 2nd hand laptop.

(Not kidding you can prolly find something that can run Classic decently for that money)
---
monkaW :point_right: :door:
---
ventrilo is no way the same as discord, not even close. You can just join a discord server (without any password or special ID) for your server and enter a LFG channel over there. Not trying to put myself on any side of the conversation here, just saying.
---
Not really. Originally these guide addon's were just a bunch of free add-ons put together as a shell to hold the guide. So everything in that addon was available for free at one time anyway. The same for today, except the shell is nicer. Basically, you're just paying for a guide that you can access in the game and that's how blizzard saw it as well. Back around wrath i think there was a very big argument between players, devs and mvps and this is were it was settled.

i have to drive overnight at unpredictable times. 1hr nap at 3am followed by a coffee gets me through every time. i can only imagine that would work for wow.
---
People have taken a week or 2 off work for this? Are you fucking serious?
---
Some pservers attempted and sometimes did add existing pre-cata assets to the world. Lots could be instantly added by Blizzard with very little man hours of work. Just filling in the max lvl 60 content is all that is required.
---
Easy mode Classic+ before any real development is required.
---
Blizz has banned players who were on top raiding guilds making content and bringing players to the game for less.. 
---
Big chance.
---
I only watched people streaming beta but I didn‚Äôt see it, but I could be wrong!
---
I wouldn't exactly call the dwarf, human and gnome models aesthetically pleasing. Even the elves got some weird proportions.
---
They're pretty low calorie so nah. A dip could bump that up though.
---
Play what you want because it's all about your own enjoyment, if being not being a "viable" spec will ruin your enjoyment of the game don't play one of them
---
How do you plan on playing both specs? Are you really gonna keep spending gold to respec?
---
None
---
Thanks! Chick n' Bear are ready for Battlefield: STV
---
I don‚Äôt give a fuck if that dude does in 6 hours. What those people do has no effect on me.
---
Well I ain't that old - but I was a "Get off my lawn" person ever since I was eleven XD Mother used to say I was born an old man hahahah.
---
I agree
---
I played back in the day too and I know what your talking about; but that was when servers had 2000 people. If you have a blacklist of people that you are using, you won't be able to play because you will be writing down names every 5mins.
---
Which in turn just incentivizes people to stay on Herod now. If you won‚Äôt ever be able to get onto a server with a big population of your faction once servers start going dead then you better make sure you‚Äôre on one to start
---
nah dude. im a paladin and i dont care what it looks like on paper or what people say. Im gonna heal raids and im gonna get a 2h to smack people with in pvp. Dont give a shit about online guides or what other people say
---
Selling the bars early won‚Äôt be worth nearly what they will once the economy has been established properly
---
Not in vanilla.  Armor requirements in terms of penalties wasn't introduced until later in an expansion.
---
I'm thinking of doing the same.  Main a paladin, then grow to hate the alliance so I roll a tauren druid.
---
I might do a human paladin though... and just catch the tram XD
---
im alone but i know ill find cool people in here
---
Shouldn't you get back to killing ebola midgets? The steampunk dildos won't farm themselves.
---
play with your friends it will suck not being the faction you want but it would suck more to not be a part of the experience that they are all having
---
‚ÄòTwas a joke.
---
I watch the whole thing 3 times before I eat my breakfast.
---
I should get home 15 min before launch. Guess I'm playing all night in a suit and no dinner.
---
Why do they need to break chat parsing, the easiest way to fix the problem is make group invite protected (requiring a hardware event) like trading. 
---
Collating chat messages in a prettier UI is the definition of "acceptable" UI modification.  
---
Chat addons do it, combatlog addons do it, it would be bonkers if they broke chat parsing.
---
The problem with this type of addon is **not** taking the messages that players have posted in chat (typing, using macros, whatever), organizing them and putting them in a pretty UI, it's that it made **Group forming and joining while AFK** possible, ie automating the entire process taking any player interaction out of it.
---
Clicking a name on the addon UI to go through the typical player context menu to open a /whisper or /invite has exactly zero gameplay difference to shift-clicking a message in the chat frame to do the same.
---
This is a better argument and one I can agree with. LFG can exist for all I care.
---
From what they stated on the classic WoW panel though, it seems as though they are considering addons like these to be against the spirit of classic WoW. That's something you'll need to disagree with the Classic devs and staff.
---
I remember one time in maradaun. We had been in there for hours, but we had slowly made our way towards the end. I was the tank as a feral Druid and one of the dps pulled another group of mobs, this was too much for the group to handle so we died right before landslide. The group, including me was tired, but we were soooo close. 
---
I released my wisp and made my way to the labyrinth of hell to find the instance entrance, ran all the way back to where we wiped, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm exaggerating if I say it took me 25 minutes to get back. None of the other cunts bothered to walk. There weren‚Äôt much communication, I think they all went afk while I ran. Nobody asked if I was gonna ress, or if it was alright for them to lie there waiting, they just assumed I‚Äôd be ok with it..
---
After the 25 min or so I reached their dead bodies, and my heart sank as I realized I had no seeds to revive them. Everyone raged so hard and instantly left the group..
---
Except +weapon skill?
---
Lots of people will be picking up skinning, smart ones will vendor low level mats because there will be no market for them for a while, and some will try to sell on AH while everyone is trying to save up for level 40 mounts.  Druid doesn't really need a mount 40, you can put that gold into buying up dirt-cheap leatherworking mats to skill up.
---
That's my theory anyways.
---
Your just mad because the 8932 hours you put into training your woodcutting and fishing levels are going to go to waste after everyone migrated to WoW
---
I‚Äôm a filthy animal. What can I say?
---
They would, but it's not supposed to happen at all. That's why there's so few realms, I wouldn't be surprised if a realm like herod was above 100000 reserved names already.
---
I heard he hops uphill both ways
---
Joana is a staple of vanilla wow, i almost certainly guarantee he has permission to sell his guide in addon form.
---
Do some workout routine 10 minutes.
---
oh no 3 days , end of the world
---
The idea is to incentivize them to find friends/guilds. That's the main issue here. Making pugging easier is not in the spirit.
---
&gt;It's even more generous with tauren. There's an overlap of melee attack range and ranged attack range.  
---
I think what he was saying is that Taurens also get the further minimum ranged attack range. So no overlap.
---
Code Monkey go to boring meeting with boring manager Rob

Which step in this chain is harder than it is now?

Download Discord - Download IRC

Join server - Join server

The steps are the same with irc, ventrilo, msn messenger, aim so on so forth.

Till you get zerged by large groups constantly.

Only with the healer tank thing. Warrior priest and I don‚Äôt want to play either. Rolling ally
---
I'd be very interested in this. Looking forward to what you come up with. Please notify us here on the internet with any updates!

The video is under a minute long. You have time to spare to watch the whole thing.
---
Don't stray from the undead master race.
---
Goskota's answer is correct too, but I used the 1.13 Classic client with a sandbox software. I can't share details, because the mods here consider it as a violation of the #4 rule of this subreddit.
---
üí™üí™ what server?
---
I think that was in either late TBC or WOLTK right?
---
Was gonna say, that sugar content is suuuuper high. 4g of sugar is a teaspoon. Look at the things you eat and convert grams to teaspoons, really helps visualize. You might change your habits a bit, I sure as hell did.
---
There is a great overarching story surrounding Stormwind that is told through several different questlines when leveling in Westfall, Redridge and then Darkshire, and continues through questing near Blackrock.  Don‚Äôt spoil it for yourself if you haven‚Äôt already and enjoy the ride.
---
The questlines and scenery in Darkshire are especially good.
---
Studio apartment here. I think I can lay on the floor from my desk and grab the door to my fridge.
---
i understand a lot of blood elves, paladins, druids, and shaman want to have TBC for class balancing and optimization. Thats a separate server all together and could be outsourced by a B team.
---
Viable is a strong word. They can tank but they are not that efficient. The gear is really scarce and they lack a taunt ability so it takes a lot more effort to tank. The good part is that healers will easily keep up with mana cause they both have to drink after almost every pack.
---
Everything is 'viable', just not everything is 'optimal', and quite frankly the moment you step into the realm of 'must be optimal' you're essentially castrating yourself and signing-up for a world of hurt (because nothing will ever be good enough for you).
---
Quite frankly if you're not enjoying what you're doing you're going to bail in the game sooner than later. It's irrational to 'like and subscribe' to the mindset of others, especially since you're the one stuck making all the sacrifices/compromises.
---
if most of the community= the people who screech loudest on reddit then yes you are correct
---
Shaman is a great option still, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be playing. You get to level as a DPS and you can still heal dungeons leveling up in a damage spec. They‚Äôre the ultimate support class and you aren‚Äôt forced to heal unless you‚Äôre doing some of the harder 5-mans or raids at 60
---
But why would they give special permission to someone? Why wouldn't they just allow everyone to sell addons
---
Remember to salt your water when boiling pasta
---
Yeah, we can see that moron.
---
They probably will for launch or in the few days following it. I don't see them launching with only one realm already full.
---
I mean, less armor on it I guess while leveling = dying faster, but you're a druid so you have some heals so idk.
---
The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge.
---
I read most of the horde quests I did and I can barely remember any. Thats how good they are.
---
And having your monitor on ruins the immersion! If you can't play classic 100% accurately in your imagination, then you shouldn't play at all!!!1!1!1!1!!!!1!1!!!!!!!
---
Thanks for this post. I had been debating on PvP or PvE. And realistically you're right. PvP servers are just inconenvenient. I don't enjoy the fact that someone can come and fight me at any moment for no reason. While it would be fun to shadowmeld/aimed shot people or shadowmeld/mind control helmet, those interactions are gonna be far and few between compared to the times PvP inconeniences me.
---
I want to experience the world the classic has to offer and random world PvP is just annoying. Plus there's always battlegrounds later or city raids.
---
Fine by me, break them all. All I ever use is damage meter anyways and even that I couldn't care less about
---
I have ‚ÄúAs‚Äù on Herod
---
If a mage is cool... that's a dps role... why not go shaman and level enhance or ele.  You still get to play support while you level with totems.  You make the whole group better and can step in to save the day with a key heal here and there still.  Once you hit 60 you can then go resto and go all out how you want.  Shamans are considered weaker dps endgame but during leveling as enhance if you keep your weapon current you feel like a beast.  Very fun class and I'd suggest that route, your pally's spiritual brother.
---
My computer couldn't handle Ironforge. My screen would freeze and I would have to wait for it to catch up before I could do anything. 
---
If I had to run through I would aim my character and hit the auto run. I would wait a minute before hitting it again and waiting for my screen to catch up. I would then aim my next shot and do it all again. I think I met the bare minimum of the "recommended specs" at the time.
---
&gt; Just some people don't find it fun to fight over loot.
---
Pretty easy to avoid fights if you don't run with known jerks. Another benefit of classic.
---
The destructive part about missing sleep is mostly noticed in three areas:
---
- Alzheimer's when your older
---
- Your vision may worsen
---
- Your heart beats slower when you sleep. With very low sleep it never slows down. 
---
Of course one of the ways to make yourself tired and sleep well is physical exertion.... and if you do that by cardio your speeding up your heart as well. 
---
But it's not really about how many beats you get. It's just that if the reason you can stay awake is your never tired, because you've never done any strenuous activity, then your heart gets weak. It literally gets softer. It's like the opposite of those athletes, bazketbal players for example, who just push and push so their hearts get less flexible and hard over time.
---
I think that TB picture is mirrored? or Reversed. I dont think the bridge / river is the correct way
---
Gonna have to upvote this, even if your alliance.
---
On the second thought. I'll skip lfg addon for a few days just to be a part of this
---
More people in chat - more fun
---
We gonna eat you alive you gnome azz bich
---
Yeah, that wasn't a thing. Arcane used too much of your mana.
---
In before the flood of threads made by people who were upset their body couldn't keep up with the grueling demands of leveling to 60 asap.
---
Personally I try to stay away from deli meats due to the sodium, the Boar Head low sodium deli meats are pretty good when needed along with provolone cheese.  Water, lots and lots of water.  Also would suggest trying power naps, no more than 40min, which can work wonders versus loading up on stimulants.
---
And in case I forgot to mention **water**, accept no substitute.
---
For me it helps a lot to maintain a semi-normal sleep schedule, so something like goto bed between 00-03 and wake up around 8 hours later. I didn't think it mattered when I was younger (so around the time wow first released) but nowadays I've noticed a remarkable imrpovement in my overall mood when I sleep close to when I'm biologically supposed to.
---
Also try to eat regularly and drink enough water, that helps a shitload too.
---
ummm... i think we are on the same page buddy
---
Do you have a computer at the toilet too ?

(#)nochanges  is the motto

You know to much redbull will make you bleed from the ass due to the taurine.

Afterall, there are still several classes that never got their Epic Class Weapon(s).

But free action potion?

Ahhh ok yea when I was into league it was faker who was the best ever apparently haven‚Äôt played in about 2-3 years
---
Unless you're resto, that just means you're oom after a few rank 1 polys.
---
That‚Äôs because of naxx not due to the class changes. Warlocks get gear that allows them to one shot T3 players.
---
Good luck with your weight gain.
---
I might be exaggerating a bit. I think it was 1:5 or so. It was a pain in world PvP because every time we had a nice fight suddenly like a full raid of enemies came along.
---
Tho, it was a PvE server, so it wasn't that big of a deal and alliance killed the open world PvP because of that.
---
STOP DOTS!
---
Try to help people by tanking or healing as much as possible.

So you care a little bit then?

This is a great guide and it was well worth the subscription. The bonus is that's its tailoted around rogues so it can be used with any class due to poor leveling. Unlike guides that are based on warlock or hunter data information.

Daily Breakfast: Raw oatmeal with milk and raisins (this is super common in Denmark, apparently no where else as far as I've been able to tell)

Lunch: 2 a couple sandwiches of some sort, depending on my mood

Dinner: Haven't finished my meal prep yet, but I'm probably gonna end up with some lasagna or some pasta dish that's easily reheatable.

In terms of drinks I'm making a pot of coffee when I get up, then an energy drink before dinner and rest will be milk/water.

Hardiness means you have a 30% chance of failure, or 70% chance of success at any given stun. A 70% chance of success at something that you must succeed in, otherwise you completely compromise your character and get put in a reversal is terrible odds.
---
The chance of landing one stun (assuming a target is not outright immune) against an Orc
---
+ 30% Failure
---
+ 70% Success
---
The chance of landing 2 stuns (cheapshot and kidneyshot) in sequence
---
+ 48.999.... Success (Less than 50%)
---
The chance of either stun failing (when used in sequence)
---
+ 42.0000.....% 1 stun will fail
---
Sap does not work against targets who are in combat and 'bleeding' (dots) will drop you out of stealth unless you time your ability in between the dot ticks.
---
+ If a target has used a free-action potion: you cannot stun, even if you want to whilst the buff is active
---
+ If your target is an orc (regardless of whether they have a free action potion or not) the probabilities of you being able to pull of a stunlock combo are under 50%.
---
+ If a target is in combat (and there are countless ways to enact a combat status) you cannot sap them
---
+ If you have a dot on you, there is a tiny tiny window where you could re-stealth and open again (without getting your stealth broken by dots)
---
Using 'Sap' against a target breaks you out of stealth in the first place and at best(even if you talent it) you have a 90% chance of remaining stealthed after a Sap.
---
The fact that you're even discussing the things (and making the arguments you're making) suggests you don't have that good a grasp of Rogue mechanics in a vanilla/classic context.

based on my amazing armchair detective skills, You are single and likely do not have a gf. How warm am I?

I think according to the last census I read the overwhelming majority of responses for "Are you playing with a guild or solo," was "Solo, not looking".

---
Hm. How original are the AVs, tho? I remember it taking so ridiculous long, it was stupid. Especially as it was also fucking imbalanced and we were often hours in front of the alliance base just for it getting too late and alliance getting a free win.
---
I have about 20ish friends how are going to play... Alliance this time. So I be the only one going Horde!
---
haha  touch√© sir
---
i mean.. yes and no. they do a lot of threat, but they lack a hard taunt and they have almost 0 tank-related itemization, so they get dumped on at 60. shamans as tanks can be made to happen in lower content though
---
my crowning shaman meme achievement was tanking an UBRS as a shaman, but this was with endgame gear. it was hectic the entire way through
---
Layering do not increase server capacity. Been told like 100 times

&gt;Sun resist is OP

Gingers would agree.  They have a natural 0 when it comes to Sun resistance.

Since the AH is faction specific in Classic if you are on a severely underpopulated faction it can be difficult to buy and sell things. Desirable items dropped by rares might be less commonly seen and such as they will be killed by the dominant faction more frequently than yours. Honestly for me the lopsided economy on severely imbalanced servers was the worst thing for me before they made AH shared between factions as other things were fine if you had a group to play with. But this is really only when it's a *drastic* imbalance, not just 60:40 or something like that.

going to PoJ in ret and then going holy, probably get SoC early too.

Should make every server pvp to solve the problem.  Pve loses what makes then world alive and real.
---
Grob Mob though...I'm impressed.

Man people are so on edge right now in our discord.  Nothing crazy, but a bunch of super passionate people itching for launch.
---
Human leveling areas are better.
---
True true, that's true
---
Never. Because it is not possible
---
(This isn't intended as flame to you, more the mindset you mentioned which a lot of use have, myself included when I played retail)
---
This mentality is what ruins games imo. You need an add-on for what stats to take, what items to use, when to use what cooldowns, when a boss is using what ability, what chain of quests to take etc. The community expectation is for every player to show up and play at 100% so you need 6, 7, 8.. add-ons to tell you how to play like a top 1% player. It makes you a pilot, not a player. 
---
Part of the appeal to classic, for me at least, is stripping a lot of that back. Not using stat weights, simulations, DBM, weakauras for resources and rotations. Not using an icyveins talent build and bis list. Not feeling the need to maximize every second of a fight to try be some knock-off Method player. 
---
Some people don't want this. They want to feel like a Method player and the tools out there can give them that feeling, for a short while. Imo those people will be sick of Classic very quickly.
---
I am gonna stock up some coconuts. They are healthy, delicious and make you full for a few hours
---
Not by any meaningful amount. And it's to season your pasta, so it can absorb the salt as it cooks. Pasta water should be briny like the sea!
---
Me too. But we're all alone in this together. See you out there.
---
You're the opposite of me, I'm being forced to play Alliance and the only race I like is night elf. And the only class no one else is playing are hunter and rogue and they're telling me not to play a night elf rogue. I feel like just playing alone on a horde server in secret lol.
---
I understand where u/nukemelbourne is coming from. I've been hearing all my life that gaming can be addiction, gaming can cut you out of social life, that's it almost a sin to put gaming above anything else in your life.  
---
Like Minisynn and Javander though, I also think that, as long as you got all your bases covered (feeding yourself, drinking, sleeping, paying for your kids' expenses (if you have them), paying expenses of other people who depend on you (if you have them)... that is... basically if you are not fucking anyone up by playing WoW, and you are having legit fun and not just lying that you are just so as not to face the world... by all means, play 10k hours of it
---
Holy fuck is it possible to be any more pedantic?
---
Oh dang, Fairbanks is Full now too? I made a backup there in case Whitemane was crazy. Need another backup.
---
To be honest people who play wow usually make characters that look/smell like them IRL. For me, only flowing gold locks on my ripped human... but if you want to play a orc/troll or a smelly undead or fat cow... who am I to judge 
---
what the fuck are you even saying
---
My game plan is on Monday pick whatever server does not have a wait/long wait and then never look back.
---
Don't need sleep if I wake up a few hours before release!

I agree on the deli meats part. Working in the southern US outdoors 50 hours a week somewhat helps my sodium intake because I sweat buckets. Water, water, water and water. Did we mention water enough?

Probably dropped on the head too many times.

Falso
---
I believe it's the middle part they'll be breaking outside of groups since it's the only one that takes something away from people not using the addon.

I'll be around Arathi helping Warriors grab WW Axe in hopes someday they will help cleave someone for me in the future &gt;.&gt;

Nah. They can win against every class if played right this ignorance gotta stop.

There has been a lot of polls over the last few months asking questions about classes, region, servers etc. There was one survey I remember seeing where 50% or so of the people who responded, 30k if I remember right, were not currently looking for a guild.

There will be plenty of people looking for new homes with you. Be friendly to people questing around you and you'll make friends in no time!

The Secret Lab Omega gives off that much information? Can't afford this chair with gf dinner tabs

I like how the races match the character creation screen.

You forgot to add a way for " /e looks sheepish. "

Actually true
---
Congrats!
---
I laughed so hard
---
Really, cause from the twitter post, they make 2 implications:
---
1) it is about them and their addon, not about collateral damage
---
2) they feel they have a right to use this addon functionality (against blizzard's now stated intent), and will continue to force their way into the ecosystem. 
---
IMO, #2 should be solved with ban hammers. If blizzard says you can't do something, their use of technical constraints to prevent it is a kindness. They can resort to the EULA clauses and force you out if necessary.

i mean.. not really.  you can break it 5 times with full mana in roughly 55-60 blues. u will never use it more than twice in a fight. also innervate. i only pvp'd on lights hope as a bommie/resto. its redic. fun
---
Yes, I do know that.
---
How was the ending ? was it similar to nostalrius ?
---
Why can't it be true? Being on equal footing because everyone is a noob is a great feeling in a massive new game and is what a lot of players enjoyed about vanilla wow. You're conflating people who want to explore and people who want to be ahead. Both are worried about other people's progression, but only the latter care about beating others and winning. The former don't want to dominate others, but they also don't want to be dominated while they enjoy the game. There's an initial grace period during which nobody is dominating anyone, but in classic wow that period will be very short, so the explorers are wary. That's all.
---

Technically Blizzard copied themselves, not Jagex. And that this won't be some sort of wake up call for the industry should be clear to everyone that isn't wearing large pink glasses. But this is also not because of Jagex but simply because this game is over 10 years old and outdated as fuck.
---
I was playing a Druid early in my vanilla experience questing with a friend.  A dude ran up to my friend and asked him where he tamed me at.  Awkward.

You chose a weird way of saying "look at me, I'm a loser"

This! Stop your crying people, it has nothing to do. Don't like it, don't use it!
---
they use what they get their hands on, T1 has more int than bwl or naxx gear IIRC which is huge, pvp blue is going to be better overall or be mixed with some pieces of T1. Just compare each item and weigh the costs.  Personally I want to build the biggest spell power set possible, downgrading mana igniting cord to the blue zg belt for 4 more spell power and just having the fattest frostbolt and cone of cold possible.

Me. I've never played before and I really wanted to play on english servers. All my friends went for german servers instead. I really don't mind. I think I'll be even better off finding people alone then in my group. I'm not bound by anyone and can go at my own pace.
---
Not might, it will!
---
Yea I get that but I mean in a perfect world for phase 1. I do get what you mean tho, harder to say specific stuff is bis for pvp
---
Troll warriors produce the highest TPS. You can normally make full use of bersking and 30% attack speed is busted. Meanwhile, orcs can't really use bloodfury while tanking unless they want their healers to hate them and go oom.
---
Troll regeneration is also really good for leveling warrior, as warriors lack any other kind of incombat self healing.
---
The best tanking weapons aren't axes either. Since you can't use bloodfury while tanking, orc prot warriors basically have no racials that benefit them as tanks unless they do use an axe. Taurens are better for surviability and trolls are better for threat.
---
Berserking is a far better argument than +5hp/s, which is literally a meme for a reason.  The idea that this is a noticeable amount of threat generation is just ridiculous.
---
Get your insulin ready

you tame them by getting a big ole brown bear with horns to wrastle with it

"Full" means that there will be long queues if everyone who has made a character on that server tries to log in at the same time. You can still create characters on them if you want.
---
Or you can make characters on a server that is not full, and probably have shorter queues.
---
Before Discord we had Skype, before Skype we had landline phones.
---
Some servers are full but they are opening more servers on launch day in 2 days. People reserved the character names with active subscription but you don't have to, just join on launch day.
---
All classes are viable. For everything? No. Even warrior isn't good at everything. Solo ability is almost nil, and in a 1v1 I walked on so many wars as a pally. The only ones I don't see being very helpful is as stated before, melee hunter
---
Probably a stupid question but what are the population caps for each server? 5k? 7.5k? 10k?

Yep i was part of 3 raiding guilds over the course of vanilla and 2 out of the 3 used it. I'm sure the first guild I was in would've used it if they knew it existed.
---
Yee I'll be playing Alliance.. see you out there
---
New servers are opening launch day at noon where I am (the time changes depending on where you live). It's not too late. The full server status is based off people making their toons for name reservation. It's not too late and "full" doesn't mean you can't make a character on that server - just means you'll have to wait to play most times a day.
---
Meh - I don't think LFG is that big of a deal really.
---
The thing that really killed wow for me was the introduction of cross realms. Prior to that, you had an LFG system, but it was made up of people on your server. Rep still mattered too, if you blocked someone. Raids were still done by guilds. It literally just saved you from spamming LF1M Healer BRD over and over and over.
---
I dunno for me Vanilla was good, but TBC was better. (with realm LFG). It had the right mix between QOL features, without going full retard. Not sure why players are whinging so much.
---
I'm not sure why it's a stretch for people to think that someone could be against both LFG addon and questie.
---
why do they keep pushing it so hard if the community and blizzard are against it ? I don't get it

Maybe too late for this, but it might be a good idea to build a gaming desk around your toilet so you can play on the toilet and dont have to mess with a diaper. Diapers are a hassle.

I would like none of the expansions and instead TRUE expansions to the base game without any kind of reset. That also means no additional levels that soft reset your gear.

---
what actually is a hunter melee weapon?
---
any agi stat stick i assume
---
i wonder what the pre raid bis hunter melee weapon is
---
I think the rush is so prevalent because it's the only thing that can be easily quantified in numbers, so it's easy to make content about without being able to play the game. 
---
As for taking your time, I plan to enjoy the game. I've done the rush back in the day and I did it on unofficial modes of play, but now I'm just going to play a few characters, and I'll still level quickly, not because I'm following some guide or best method of leveling, but because I'll be having fun and playing a bunch.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Ofc rolling a troll
---
leveling IS the hype
---
The journey.
---
don't worry, someone made a discord bot that'll do LFG for classic
---
Removing auto invites and pchannels is a change. 
---
"KILL ALL THE ADDONS" would be a change.
---
My husband did ‚ÄúCAST REVIVE PET‚Äù during his first dungeon in VC. Good times.
---
Whats your ping? And what country?
---
We spent our last moments together /crying to The Sound of Silence.
---
Its funny the amount of hardcore raiders classic has suddenly. I mean everyone is a hardcore raider and rank 14 pvper now a days so its hard to give advice.
---
My nice and comfy medium server is getting overtaken by Final Boss, and they‚Äôre going to create a mafia to take all the important gathering nodes on each and every zone for months. It was great, and hopefully still is...but something has to be done about stuff like this
---
&gt;we can only live in complete extremes
---
what a charitable take.
---
I don't have the math infront of me, but I think Berserking beats out weapon skill in threat due to the greatly enhanced rage regeneration you get during it.
---
I have one friend who I know will play a lot on Stalagg if the queues aren't horrendous, but he's going to be rushing the first few days for sure.  I'll probably try to take it at least a little slower and hopefully find a friendly Warrior pal to team with and heal early on in Mulgore.  I know the altolholism will call me eventually though, lol.
---
That's via questing. People theorycrafted that running dungeons and cleaving/aoeing them is way more efficient.
---
Dope read, thanks for linking
---
There is a difference between a spam chat and a pinboard like platform.
---
No that was the argument the addonneouldnhave made us all non sociable so its best to get rid of it to keep us social
---
Don't worry. With layering, everyone will constantly be alone. So don't feel bad!
---
Going in alone is probably the best way to play classic.  You‚Äôll enjoy making new wow friends
---
We aren't 15 anymore so why are you paying a 15 year old game boomer?
---
feel like you're usin' that word incorrectly. this doesn't really have anything to do with hets so much as it has to do with just like... people bein kinda old and misjudging the modern playerbase
---
Is leveling as warrior really that bad solo? Should I look for a leveling buddy or something?
---
Is it going to be difficult to find groups/a guild as a returning noob? Should I be looking now?
---
Go Druid.  Experienced players won‚Äôt even bother with you because even if they win it takes more time than it‚Äôs worth to kill a resto Druid.
---
The only issue is Blizz stated they want the opposite of this. They don't watch addon based social networks.
---
Mining is the gathering proffeccion that goes hand in hand with engenering. So instead of buying mats you can gather them yourself. You can sell the extra, of stockpile them. Gathering and crafting your own stuff is fun gameplay.
---
Bis gear is not important. Its not gamechanging. It is a goal for the minmaxers. Its a fun goal, but it will require time and dedication.
---
Every now and again I think y'know what? fuck it, I want to play alliance so that's what I'm gonna do!... And then I think about all the good times I had with friends back in the day...
---
Square - trap, moon - sheep. Do Los pulls, dont pull agro.
---
Don't need to communicate.
---
Addon can't be banned/allowed, explanation is somewhere around this subreddit
---
The reality is the LFG addon would mainly be used for leveling dungeons or by those who casually wish to do dungeons with random  others using the LFG addon....
---
Most serious Vanilla players will be actively seeking a raiding guild when they hit 60 and will be spamming dungeons all day with their guild, while randomly picking up a few extras to fill and possibly converting them over to guildies...
---
So this concern about the LFG addon is important to many people, but most raiders really dont give a fuck because they probably wont be using it anyway.
---
Tauren minimum range for ranged attacks gets pushed out along with their maximum melee range, they still have a 3m deadzone.
---
People are older now we all don‚Äôt have time to spend 4 hr spamming a city for a group to do 1 dungeon is my take on it
---
This is a great idea! Could ammo be changed to something else like water (healers) or other reagents? Just a thought
---
i don't really mean druid as it is now, wotlk was my favorite era. you still had to pop out of cat form to innervate, battle rez, the odd decurse/abolish poison, clutch tanking when the MT died. the continuous pigeonholing of druids into not even having access to off-spec abilities took away so much from the class, but the opposite end of the spectrum of being barely viable outside of healing is too far towards the other extreme imo.
---
I feel like this is the Good option, even allow them their own private addon channels. thus not effecting those who don't want to use main channels.
---
You can turn them down, just not in the standard UI settings.
---
Bummer. I picked horde cause vanilla seemed so heavily imbalanced towards alliance (in my memory). Now got tons of other folks set to go, and too late to change.
---
everyone here is talking about druids but forget that gnome mages also can remove everything except charm
---
I mean it kind of is..... You‚Äôre example was just really, really bad man.. sorry bout it
---
They were so mindnumbingly boring to play tho.
---
I‚Äôm excited for the new people, it will be just like the old days.
---
Because that's literally what happened in wrath. Leg was introduced and people stopped socializing in dungeons. You dont need to add people to your friends list to play with again if you can easily find a replacement group. It's not hard to see how this changes social dynamics in the game. 
---
Just be polite, make friends and add them to your friends list
---
Speaking out of your ass
---
Whay communication do classic dungeons require? Assign sheep sap and trap to symbols and no need to speak at all really
---
Learn to read this is t a out the addon it's about peoples attitudes and how no one playing classic wants to be sociable and has to be forced in to it
---
Will you be porting it into guidelime?

Adderall? good god, that's overboard. Have you tried Adderall? I guess if you have ADHD, It's supposed to keep you melo or something. But I've tried Adderall a couple times, and it always made my mind go a million miles per hour with insane levels of eneergy. I can't sit still. It would not do me any favors. I'd be wanting to jump out of my seat and go run my ass off to get rid of all the energy.
---
&gt;also group finders dont ruin wow, cross realm and getting a free teleport to the instance is what hurts it. 
---
+ piss easy dungeons that require zero communication. Why do people always forget that?
---
Didn't even think to have one nearby, cheers!
---
Yeah? I just read that a fast dagger with flametonge can be pretty effective. Tbh, I'm winging everything else so might just play exactly the way I want lol

It‚Äôs looking that way
---
tis the wowclassic way
---
I'm in pretty deep in the money making community in retail. Bullshit. People get banned all the time for disrupting the economy. They're pretty heavy handed with that stuff, with some people getting handed bans for shit you'd think is just normal auction house shenanigans. What they're doing doesn't need to be spelled out in the rules, if Blizz thinks they're going out of their way to disrupt the economy they'll hand out a ban. If they try to do something like this in Classic rest assured blizzard is gonna hit them hard.

The ClassicLFG addon has nothing to do with this tweet or the WeakAura team. He is simply stating a few very clear things. The most important being this:
---
&gt; Instead of trying to communicate, classic [@WarcraftDevs](https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs) once again chose to ignore our request for open dialog. 
---
The addon developers are very uneasy right now. The months of work they have put into developing a lot of the addons many of us simply take for granted is up in the air. The backlash over ClassicLFG is understandable to a point. Nowhere to the point, it became. People where leaving hate messages and more on the poor guy's comment section on curseforge for crying out loud. For an addon for a fucking game.
---
The fear is that in order to "break" the method that this addon uses to work is that it WILL affect other addons that use chat channels for communicating. We have no word in the development community form blizz staff and only get blindsided with this blue post.
---
It does not matter if you are for or against ClassicLFG, it's how this all played out that is problematic.
---
Wife (priest) and I (warrior) full tier 2 with epic mounts and maxed professions.  Everything beyond that is gravy on top... well it is all gravy really, because the best game ever created has returned.
---
So you as a person would turn in to an arsehole as soon as you use the addon? Your blaming an addonnfor your own shitty behaviour.
---
Take some personal responsibility for your own actions in game
---
The sample size is fine if you are predicting redditors per server. But you can't draw a conclusion on the actual server population because it was a poll of just reddit.

Ok Google... FROSTSHOCK

'Countdown Time - Event Countdown &amp; Big Days Widget' in play store
---
I think let people be people and mind your own business. Don't like it, don't use it. Problem evaporates like it never existed in the first place
---
exactly This
---
Are we able to check the current faction ratios on the servers?

Me and my buddy is making a gigantic bowl of chicken/pasta salad, and got some grapes, nuts and energy drinks for extras.
---
I believe classic players are going to ruin classic themselves.

FD eat and drink in AV is pretty damn OP when you're almost dead and outa mana
---
1. The addon is still allowed. Blizzard had issue with the auto-invite (which was already removed 2 days ago) and the rate limit of the chat macro.
---
2. The addon as of 4 days ago uses public channels only Trade/General/LFG. So even if you don't use the addon people will still group up with those who do.
---
3. The community here misunderstood how the addon worked because of a video that was generated for controversy by a shit streamer.
---
I like how this community shits on streamers all the time and claims their followers are the worst, but easily gets duped by a few.
---
Fair enough I like your attitude
---
0 days off are required by federal law in the USA. Your boss could tell you to work 365 days a year if they wanted.
---
People were being pedantic by correcting me when there was nothing to correct.
---
You're pathetic.
---
Just saying that there is a way to play for everyone. Don't want to be social - don't do it, just like in rl
---
All these people are wrong about not being able to sell ore and bars. Mining is incredibly profitable on FRESH. People DO need mats, people will be leveling BS and Engi, every guild needs master BS. Everything you put on AH will sell.

Hi, /u/OmegaBard

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cv12q7/best_pvp_server_for_mountain_time/).

Sulfuras but no Crown of Destruction?  Is there a disappointment emoji?  There should be.   The picture is gorgeous though. GLHF in Classic!
---
 !remind me 1 day

Yup, moved cross country so all my old friends are EST while I'm PST now, really sucks
---
May swing through there then although it may be overkill with the food I already purchased.

yeah rip my 40 hunter

Enjoy your queues

Found an error: Ironwood Patriarch (claw update) doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúIronfur‚Äù Patriarch.
---
Probably solved! If it‚Äôs not resolved by release maybe just pay again and try to get money back for first transaction or get game time credit ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hope it works out man! See you on Azeroth üòà

Cool idea. I wish you luck with it.
---
Checking in as one of those guys
---
not even close
---
Went in alone, but met so many friendly people on discord so I will probably see a lot of familiar faces on my travel, so might team up with them while questing once in a while. For the rest just flying solo and will see what guild I pick at 60.
---
Or you can't think for a second and realize that the way you find the people for your group have nothing to do with the social aspect of the game. Spaming the chat and manually inviting someone won't make you best friends forever automatically.

Swap Druid and Priest.
---
Personally, I would have Druid and Priest swap alignments, but otherwise I really like this!
---
Why wouldn't Reddit be a decent approximation of the people that will be playing classic? Reddit is just about as mainstream normy as it gets on the internet
---
I get that, and it‚Äôs always unfortunate to see fewer options in a game because of bad management decisions or bad player behavior or whatever. For me personally, that‚Äôs a preferable slippery slope than the other slippery slope of add ons ruining what I think most of us are referring to as the Classic experience. If they mess this up so bad that we can‚Äôt use a single addon I will still be playing this game. But if I have to use an addon equivalent of LFG to play then I‚Äôm out.

Shouldnt druids be true neutral? All they want is to protect the land. Horde and alluance druids set aside the faction conflict to protect azeroth
