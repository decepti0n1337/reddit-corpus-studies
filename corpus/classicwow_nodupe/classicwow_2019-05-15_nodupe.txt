Yea, this is what I hope for too. Although for me it’d be something to make a prot spec more viable for paladins. But same concept.
---
---
---
That's pretty cool. When I spotted maelstrom in Indian Ocean I thought shit MH370..
---
Thanks! Australian leave policies are so damned good :)
---
Dev interview said they don't want to do that. Hopefully they can stay true.
---
There are no HKs until phase 2.
---
Queue times wouldn't be that long if you had 3 versions of each server though don't you think?
---

---
Like really I would take queue time over the potential exploits that arise with shifting between the layers. How can this be a better idea when you can possibly have an overpopulated server after phase 1 as well?
---
Layering is the best possible solution we could have hoped for. 
---
All of you crying #nochanges would have probably been the first ones to cry here of how they have to wait 5 hours in queue to log in. The same people complaining 2 months in of how their server is empty and imbalanced, demanding free migration and server merges. What is it you want? Authenticity at launch or authenticity in the long run? Think about it. 
---
I can only commend Blizz for finding a solution that deals with the launch shit storm we all expect AND the dead servers after a month in. All while keeping the launch FEELING authentic with a 2-3k server population. What more could you have wished for?
---
My state's legislature just passed a college tuition law, (that pays for everything a la Sweden) but the funding does not go into effect until September 2020. So, naturally I will be taking a break for a year so that I can go for a 4 year rather than the 2 year I'm going for now, in a way that will cost nothing.
---
Literally the stars aligning. I really have to keep up my exercise with how long I'll be spending at the PC.
---
Already had August 23rd - September 4th off. Gives me 9 days to play.
---
they only care about appealing to streamers and their braindead audience
---
my vacation days reset/roll over september 1, so...technically i can take almost 2 months off.  i wont, but...it sure is tempting.
---
They didnt say "An ENTIRE Classic Summer", did they? Cant remember.
---
So many shills out and about lol. I wonder how many times I've seen someone say "fair solution", or "this seems reasonable" lmao
---
They’re allowing everyone to create characters and reserve names two weeks prior to release. This will probably give everyone a good idea as to what servers streamers will be on as they will probably stream their character creation.
---
Yea, this is for me at least, but the week before labor day is one of the busiest weeks in the industry I work (Beer Distribution) and we require all hands on deck.
---
Sucks for people like me who haven’t played in years and have no desire to sub to retail just to test the beta. How many people who quit during BC, Wrath, Cata etc will resub just for the beta (probably a fair amount). But still, if it stays like this, it’ll be 90% BfA players who are very likely to bash the game because it’s nothing close to what they’ve been pampered by and have become accustomed to.
---
You're delusional if you think it's not the same. It's a different function as it's not cross-realm, but it still carries all the problems sharding has. So maybe you should do your research buck-a-roo
---
I've been saying it since the Blizzcon panel - Ion, having raided hardcore in vanilla really gets classic. Say what you want how he has ruined retail and all that(personally I think it's the economy department of Activision that demands a lot) but he gets classic. Every time he talks about it he's just right. He lived and breathed vanilla, the first thing he did when he got to work at Blizzard was to check how deep breath actually works. And Everytime I see him talk about it he seems genuinely excited about it vs how talking about the newest expansion he kinda just goes through the PR motions.
---
The dev team just seem to really give a shit for once. Not that they don't care about making new expansions but that is kinda... Business as usual. There's no passion any more but they seem genuinely passionate and excited for classic. This is the Blizzard of old.
---
[removed]
---
Blizzard announced a release date for vanilla wow. It will be a classic server before updates. They have been generating hype for awhile.
---
They said they'd offer transfers from dead Rams in an interview and also mentioned that the name registration thing is a way to gauge how many servers they might need.
---
Because I want to practice leveling
---
The point was "have a classic summer", in september... if you are gonna be that picky and not see how this was a huge jebait then ok. Technically summer...  come on...
---
&gt; You won't see people randomly dissappearing at all
---
yes you fucking will. A simple invite to another layer is all it fucking takes my man.
---
They're only stress tests too.
---
Ion is probably involved, he could ruin a wet dream.
---
I dont mean with number balanced. I mean with class flavor balanced. Every class has its thing that it's great at and when DKs were added, they kinda didn't have any real downsides except mobility (in my memory, i was a kid after all)
---
Right, but you are feeding x sets of resources onto an auction house that services x sets of players. Sure, it'll be slightly different because there will be a potentially quicker turnaround on goods being sold, but overall prices shouldn't change drastically, because the ratio of supply and demand will be mostly similar.
---
How about making new friends? How about seeing the same faces over and over before striking up a convosation? How about world PvP? These wont happen if you dont see the same faces over and over and both sharding and "layering" are designed specifically so you dont.
---
Originally I played a Forsaken rogue named Bonestalker (forgive me, I was 9). I only got to like 45 and I was obsessed for having best in slot gear for my level. For my 10th birthday my dad gave me Gut Ripper. I was daggers 4 lyfe even during leveling.
---
This time around I think I'll play a lock. Probably will go Orc for the multiple awesome synergies and awesome lore behind it, I'm pretty done playing Forsaken now. And stun resist doesn't hurt.
---
(Horde4lyfe but I'm a little sad I can't play a female human lock. Their spellcasting animation is second to none IMO)
---
&gt; I'll be shitting on Ion online.
---
and playing on your #nochanges pserver amirite?
---
Fly back up to work on the 26th for two weeks, RIP.
---
&gt; Layer will be in up until phase 2.
---
they initially said it wouldn't be in the game at all.
---
Now it's just phase 1...
---
oh no now the students will only be able to play as much as the rest of the adults with actual jobs oh no
---
TRRUUUEEEE
---
The way I see it is that I am currently in a sub for a company capable of making games so great that I come back to them after a decade of not playing.
---
&gt; Only for phase 1
---
They initially said not at all. Now it's phase 1. We all know how this goes
---
This would be a giant disaster, who cares about layering, it will be gone eventually. Restriction free realm transfer ruins entire servers. Realm transfers and tons of dead servers were the reason they introduced sharding to begin with.
---
Very disappointed.
---
No one is arguing it’s different.
---
It is unhealthy to have power creep, if it is in all other expansion or not doesn’t make it valid or invalid.
---
America =\= Rest of world.
---
Most of the buffs are reasonably what any other DPS would have.
---
Oucch, i feel ya i feel ya. My condolences
---
you only get 25$ credit in blizz balance if you buy the CE mounts on the storeshop, since they come out on the shop in August, then when linking your CE edition it just gives you balance since you have the mount already.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's stupid, I cancelled my preorder.
---
Yeah dude. I’m sure the majority of players for blizzard games are in high school or college age range. Therefore, it’s smart marketing to have them in mind. Maybe you should go back to school. Learn ya self something
---
I have to go back and look but I think they said materials will be synched between layers.
---
Doubt it, he seems super excited for once. He just gets classic, he hasn't said a word wrong when he talks about it. He's kinda back to being one of us when it comes to classic. Vanilla WoW is one of the best games ever made - and he agrees with us on that.
---
&gt; So did blizzard say that they were gonna remove the unarmored ones after a month and make it this rare mount that no one else can get later in the original vanilla? No they did not and it’s a huge difference.
---
They sure did. Not only did they post patch notes in advance, but also even had the new mounts featured _on the frontpage of worldofwarcraft.com_ for 10+ days prior to the patch being released. Anyone level 60 with the means had _plenty_ of time to pick up the old mounts.
---
The difference is most people probably didn't _care_ back then. Just like most people didn't care about world buffs or using hotkeys to cast spells instead of clicking. So I guess we might as well get rid of that too while we're at it, right?
---
I've never played wow but im kinda hyped just from that background lol
---
What about rend
---
well most people will choose the first/second version of the server, and as someone else wrote in a different thread: wow classic will be a HUGE mmorpg release, those queue times will be extreme. Also i dont like the idea of several mini servers merging all of a sudden and then just coexisting like KT - A and KT B+C, it seems more smooth with layers.
---
still overpopulated servers after phase 1 is a different topic though and im excited to see how theyll deal with that once it comes up
---
I've pulled an elite and began soloing it in BfA. When it gets to around 20% HP I get shoved into a new shard. My mob despawns. Everything around me despawns. What spawns in its place is half a dozen Horde and half a dozen Alliance fighting over the now-tagged-by-the-other-faction mob I had just been killing. I proceed to get my face pushed in by the opposite faction I just got sharded on top of.
---
No fucking thank you.
---
Layering will not have this problem.
---
Thats not what they said at all. These sub 50 iq comments are getting out of hand.
---
Yup. and sadly this sub is defending it and justifying it.
---
This sub not even two weeks ago: You're just a hater if you think the games population is going to die off quickly! Everyone is going to have so much fun and you're just going to be butthurt you're having so much fun you silly idiot!!!
---
This sub today: No layering is great because the population is going to die off after a month of two!
---
And now your hype has ended...
---
See you august 27th!
---
I read the title in Mario's voice.
---
Westfall passed up like that? Dont know about that, bud.
---
Might as well give layering it's own mega thread, no point discussing anything else in here where every comment is about layering.
---
I'm very concerned about the instance resetting. It will make gold farming much harder and increase gold value, making epic mounts harder obtain.
---
there is no valid guides, mobs in classic will have way different abilities and armor values, resistances from a private server, its what the current guides are based on...
---
Rend only works good on elite mobs, mobs with lots of health, its useless for trash mobs you kill in 1-2 swings.
---
Can this be me? I'd be in heaven being able to solo whatever I want with no competition and then still be able to search the server for people to do dungeons with.
---

Again we have no idea how it works, but I highly highly doubt its 3k per and if 3001 people are on a single guy has an entire layer to himself.  It most likely fills keeping x number of layers equally full so no advantage or disadvantage for being on a different layer.
---
Jimmy doesnt need to be gone. You use layer 2 to drop combat without vanish and reposition in stealth. Fucking dumbass, you don't need to stay in Layer 2 or know when she resses, phase 2 is a means to an end used for phasing the entire battlefield over to Layer 2 to allow you to full reset on Layer 1 without counterplay.
---
It's STV, enter Layer 1 in stealth behind a tree far away from the last point spotted, but still in the general quest vacinity. You have until Zoe gets back to corpse to use Layer 2 to reposition in layer 1. 
---
one shot Zoe, kidney shot Jimmy, get invited from Lamar to phase while the stun is active, stealth, walk 50~ yards away behind cover, drop group, get invited from Brad, boom, you're reset in stealth on Layer 1 in about 30 seconds after killing Zoe on the high end. A well executed assault could take 20 seconds from opener to reset. The rogue is effectively a ghost by pairing sharding abuse and stealth. 
---
I know I'm right, and if you're too stupid to understand this than I cant help you. It's a really fucking easy sequence of events and it's really fucking easy to farm Zoe.
---
Perfect timing. There'll be less kids on the servers.
---
please tell me phase 1 is short so we can just fuck off with this sharding layering phasing whatever the fuck
---
fuck
---
Did I though?  I’m fully ok with the release date and fully ok with the concept that August 27 is in the season of summer.
---
Take the temperature down a notch lol
---
Someone should put a list together of things like this for people to test tomorrow!
---
I'm in Houston, Fry's Electronics has them still.
---
He's clearly talking about levelling. You'll be in for a rude shock if you're expecting to kill normal levelling mobs from 20-60 in just 1-2 swings.
---
Use it. Arms gives rend dmg a 35% increase.
---
Ayyy hype up boys.
---
Lame meme
---
It's honestly amazing how this sub complains about every possible thing related to classic WoW, and then when one thing gets cleared up and dealt with they just move onto another thing.
---
I imagine adding servers would take time and in that time things could have already settled down.  It'd be smart to hold an open beta for a few weeks just to see what kind of an interest there is.
---
Server transfers are a bit scary since large groups of people (entire guilds) could pick up and leave which really affects the community on the home server and destination server.  This also devalues realm pride when people can move around semi-freely.
---
From my perspective it's simpler to let things sort themselves out, some people will get frustrated the first few days but others will have a blast seeing that kind of activity in game.  Already after 24 hours on private server launches the starting zones are much quieter and completely manageable.  Feels like overkill to implement any type of player segregation just for potentially a day or two of congestion.
---
A polite message would have gone a hell of a long way.
---
Think of it like this. If taking pills is socially acceptable to induce the reversal of depression, I’m pretty sure playing a social aspect video game to have the same effect is just as good if not better if it works for you. It’s no different than some people who have families. Kids. Wives. Husbands. Responsibilities. They are just as excited to play because it’s an escape from being an adult. If wow is an escape from depression. Rock on
---
Rip not taking off the 26th when the release starts at 3pm pacific time that day.
---
I also don’t understand the joke here. Those just sound like standard beta selection rules.
---
You'll have no problem then. Vanilla leveling isn't nearly as hard as people make it sound, it's just more unforgiving. The hardest thing to get used to will probably be aggro radius and finding your optimal flow (never being at 100% health or mana while at the same time not pulling too much and dying.) But you'll get that pretty quickly.
---
That's literally my first day of school and got svelte into the nursing program... See you guys during winter break...
---
Me freshly graduated from Highschool playing beta.... 33 year old me is contemplating if I want to go after blackwing lair more... or perhaps world dragon gank feats.
---
F in chat
---
Add people who work spring and fall shutdowns into that group.  When I have time off I have lots of it but when I’m working it’s 12 hour days plus travel time 6 days a week.
---
Havent played in many years and definitely interested in classic again. Can anyone help explain phase, sharding, and layering?
---
Blizzard: announces game 2016 (10 years late imho) Waits til the very last day of “Summer” to release 15 year old game
---
Google: announces new gaming platform Stadia 2019 will release end of 2019
---
At least it’s here, I just feel like the should have announced it later
---
Layering is sharding-lite.  You don't have people popping in and out of existence as much, but you also don't have a persistent population.  Familiarity is a huge factor in making new friends, and familiarity comes from seeing a player again and again as you level or pvp in the world.  Cycling through layers with each login means you may not see that druid who's been leveling at the same pace as you and always buffs you, nor do you see the rogue who helped you out of a gank yesterday and who's leveling right on top of you in another layer.  
---
Layering is sharding in spirit.
---
cool, thanks!
---
The issue is that they promised sharding would be for the starting zones only and people actually bought that sales pitch. 
---
Here we are now with basically server wide sharding. This goes against a major pillar of what made vanilla successful. Disappointed.
---
I never thought of this... flips side would the joy of killing them in PvP. :D
---
Pass
---
They have to.  The current client and infrastructure cannot do it any other way.  It is not technically possible unless they go back to using a single server which is not going to happen due to costs.   You cannot have multiple cloud servers interacting with each other while support 1k+ players.
---
you think there will only be a 1 hour queue? XD  
---
try 3+ hours mate, and then an underpopulated server after 1 month :)
---
They described plenty. They said a way you can change layers is if you're invited by someone on another layer. That's enough.
---
&gt; lol he barely managed to kill those three mobs, he survived with 1 hp at one point. 
---
And after a 7 second heal he was up to 25% then almost died again. Seven more heals, ending with 20%HP and 10% mana.
---
EZPZ
---
Yes
---
Resto is viable, as is resto and resto.
---
It took the same amount of time to level back in 2007.  Yet wow was still insanely popular. Have gamers really changed that much? Or is it just the way the industry “sells” FTP games these days?
---
I wouldn't say *many*. It was only endgame content, and then only a small portion of it at that. My brain is fried but I only really remember *needing* flying for a handful of annoying dailies, and entering TK. I'm sure I'm missing some other stuff, but I bet it could all be retooled in a way that satisfied *most* people. Even if flying was available as always but there was some combat related debuff for a certain period after you dismount.
---
ELI5 why is it going to take them till August to release a 13 year old game?
---
I wouldn't worry about it, steamers wont last long on classic wow, give them 1-2 weeks and they quit.
---
Yeah I was really hoping for a month earlier, rip.
---
Clearly you misunderstood the video.
---
Frankford
---
July 16th, 2021.
---
phase 1 could be 6 months though man
---
On the bright side, we get to make our character names before hand :)
---
Layering should only really exist at launch to avoid Ahn'Qiraj opening event levels of unplayability. Past the first few days, I WANT to be in a crowded place.
---
It’s simple.
---
Pull 1 mob at a time = kill them
---
Pull 2+ mobs at a time = die
---
Make sure you level up your bandaging.
---
I leveled as fury and had fun, but arms is viable as well - having a good 2h helps.
---
Also, don’t forget weapon skill is a thing; make sure you’re sticking with the same weapon types, or keeping you weapons skills up to date.
---
You can have multiple servers. Don’t need to create layers.
---
And they stretched it out every month to make sure you pay for three months. Fuck that, lol
---
Everything is viable, unique buffs/utlity is worth far more than some dps numbers. Raid content (i cant speak for naxx tho) is pretty easy and not a numbers game like in modern wow. I wouldnt mind bringing a Feral Drood or something else low-dps-y in my raid if we dont have a lot of druids already :)  
---
every class brings something meaningful to the table, and thats the beauty of wow classic imo.
---
There is also a closed beta which starts tomorrow.
---
June 15 2021
---
"Boss, im going to need time off at the end of august and september"
---
Okay how much?
---
"yes."
---
No I’m sorry man but WoD was not smooth. I’ll give you legion and BFA. But WoD I remember very vividly and it was a lot more than 2 servers. A LOT of people couldn’t progress.
---
I was downvoted in a separate post where I mentioned "adding" some East Egg quests around the world (I'm probably not the first).  
---
I knew the community dislike changes, but I thought those quest would be a great way to tie the Classic WoW with Modern WoW, like implying time travel was involved or something.  
---
Still think it'd be a cool idea, and judging from the comments on this post, it seems others are open it.
---
New content after classic would literally be the best gaming news in a decade
---
You can easily login/logout to change layer
---
That makes it super easy to avoid pvp and otherwise bounce to a separate layer and check on resources etc
---
It’s actually worse than sharding, because some sharding tech would put you back on your original shard if you logged out/in
---
The issue is that they promised sharding would be for the starting zones only for launch and people actually bought that sales pitch. 
---
Here we are now with basically server wide sharding for longer. This goes against a major pillar of what made vanilla successful. Disappointed.
---
phase 1 won't be like 1-2 weeks long so it will just screw the game
---
Layering was blizzards call not activision.

I read the first sentence and nothing more. You are just wrong in my opinion. I am not saying that you aren't potentially partially correct but like come on man, really?
---
Go home you're drunk
---
Yes, I believe my company has a busy season starting June and rolls on through September
---
&gt;  from what i've heard from my friends
---
Tell your friends that they are stupid. As long as you are not going for ultra hardcore 20 min BWL clears, you'll be fine with every spec.
---
You’re acting like very high pop servers aren’t a thing. How would having more servers solve que for a high pop server the first few months?
---
12 AM Cest isnt that like noon? I dont get it
---
They did offer free transfers during Vanilla from overpopulated servers to those with less players IIRC.
---
Think of it this way. If she leaves you, then you will only have more time to play classic. Simple mathematics.
---
&gt; I was an active Naxx raider in Vanilla and have Atiesh on my priest. This isn't hearsay but experience.
---
Okay, link the top-tier Naxx gear which you had, and link the quest greens that replaced it. I'll wait. And wait. Because you can't do it.
---
&gt; That said, I sort of erred and should clarify that the quest greens were better than most gear most players had.
---
Sure, because most people weren't raiders.
---
All you are doing are repeating myths that grew in the telling from mediocre, low-to-mid-tier raiders who were salty that they didn't have an unfair advantage at 70.
---
As far as I am concerned TBC did the gear curve about as fairly as it possibly could. Naxx raiders still had a *huge* advantage going into Tier 1, BWL/AQ40 raiders got an easy ride into the mid-sixties at least before their head start wore off, and people who were still in MC when TBC launched didn't have much of an advantage because why the hell should they?
---
More like early fall release lol, F everyone who was hoping for true summer.
---
Think you're missing the point. Unless you're in a party, you're on the same layer.
---
It still will be crowded. A layer is a full vanilla server pop, so 3k.
---
They should absolutely be in the game and I'm not just saying that because I was going to grind one of them out. They were in vanilla and if they are even just added with the regular mounts I'd be happy. Forget the rarity I just want more choices when picking my epic mount considering I'll have to stare at it for hours on end. Why limit us to just a select few if there are more in the game already? To me this seems like removing content for no other reason than to not make a small group of people upset because they either didn't know about it or didn't care.
---
You can buy wands from a vendor. If you're DEing greens and buying a copper rod anyway, you might as well just save that money, plus the extra money you'll get from killing mobs instead of worrying about enchanting, and just buy a vendor wand.
---
They said they are open to it if the community wants it
---
Oh look, more overly emotional gatekeeping.
---
Only if they were present in vanilla imo
---
Why?
---
Then it’s not wow classic.
---
If you want progression, play current wow.
---
I don't know man I think blizz will see this and stop it quickly if that can happen
---
Why put your name on it, do you actually think anyone's going to steal this?
---
The most important thing is the first session and first hour or so, if you can go 24+ hours without sleeping for 12 straight afterwards then you are gold, the vast majority won't go above 12 straight at launch and 16+ you are in the minority of people still playing. 
---
The idea is to get out of the level 1-5/6 area as quickly as possible, second zone will be way less people but eventually they will be trickling in. At that point you want to have done the initial quests in the level 6-10/11 zone so that you don't have to compete for the same mobs. 
---
Basically aslong as you can be in the top 20% of efficient levelers(skill wise) you can get to the top 1% overall if you are willing to spend the time playing.
---
With today's technology where we have elastic resource allocation that provisions and de-provisions resources automatically on a on-demand basis, it is beyond me why they would invest money in developing a new system like this.
---
Blackrock player, I remember queues of 2000+ people and that was during Australian prime time which is the opposite for America. 
---
I don’t have the time anymore to sit in a 3 hour queue when I get home, it would literally give me an hour to enjoy the game.
---
Spinning up a new VM isn't really a big operational cost.
---
summer is until 21st of September
---
WoW betas for at least the last three expansions haven't required an active subscription to participate or be selected, so a fair few people assumed it would be the same for classic.
---
I'm not having a go at Blizzard or anything, only made this for fun. I'm still playing retail at the moment anyway, but can't help but hope for an invite haha.
---
what you described is essentially what layering is doing, only difference is theres no potential for "layer-hopping" which wont really be that big of an issue anyway since theres going to be so few layers. its probably easier for them to just disable the layering function once its settled down a bit rather then having to actually merge servers
---
Yeh sitting in queue for 2 hours sure was engaging!
---
Yep. Also Ion played real classic more than the most of us, as a top raid guild leader before he joined Blizz. I think he  really understands how awesome this game is.
---
I work for a school district in IT and I am pissed lol those first 2 weeks back are brutal on our departments, so many back to school work orders. Don’t think our director will let me have that week off. Defiantly isn’t an option for teachers
---
FUCK YES
---
Can you see that there is a difference between new Classic content and new retail content? It’s like two completely different games.
---
lol k
---
Going out of town for vacation the week before and get back on the 26th and back to work on the 27th. Luckily I have another week off scheduled in September which will hopefully be enough for me to push to 60 during that time.
---
What I'm curious about is how they're confident that it won't be needed past phase 2. What if there's still way too many people on certain servers?
---

More like I'm not going to spend my evening doing that since I realistically don't care enough.

BOOYAKASHA
---
Have you ever played an MMO or an RPG? Its fairly simple to pick up
---
What the fuck is layering and where is everyone getting this info from?
---
From the company that brought you *'Soon™'*, *'You Think You Want That But You Don't™'* and *'Don't You People Have Phones?™'* comes *'Classic Summer¹™'*!  
---
^1: Contains only 28% actual Summer.
---
Mage? Hunter? Never was really into gold farming but those are my two top picks, for what its worth
---
Best is hunter to make mountains of gold.
---
youre going to love it, just make sure to play what class sounds interesting to you and not based on what people say is the most "efficient"
---
&gt; You're not getting it. It can and will be abused. It won't be a 1:1 ever
---
I just said it would be abused, and that it won't be 1:1. Who is it that isn't getting "it"? Anyway, how do you propose they do it to achieve a better balance?
---
26th to 6th here
---
If you already have kids and dont want more, get your shit nipped. Youll be good to go for a while!
---
Mine is due a month after release. 8 weeks parental leave and raiding here we come!
---
Honey, we need to talk...
---
How is my non civil or disrespectful, it’s literally a joke, not aimed at anyone and people swear here all the time..?
---
I've been looking forward to this for a long time. But, I don't see the reason of playing classic if they are going to add content. That's not the point of *actual* classic.
---
think its probably something related to the skin gambling sites?
---
I'm out of the loop. What is this about? Haven't played WoW since.. the ice one? WotLK?
---
Same game different version. If it’s nonsense then don’t sub?
---
Mage for AoE farming. Hunter for AFK farming.
---
I only see the druid pre-bis can someone tell me how to show the warrior stuff?
---
no they said theyre open to also creating BC and WotLK if the community wants it, which theres no way people wont want it. and it will still be classic wow because they likely wont force you to move onto BC or LK, they will most likely make new servers for them and allow you to copy your character from vanilla over to them, letting you play on both
---
The economy will be messed up for a while for the sheer fact that there will be very little gold in circulation at the start.

---
Yeah, it'll be really fun for all the griefers. Screw that.
---
You're actually retarded, i dont think you understand how fucked the gameplay would be without some type of Sharding/Layering on release.
---
Of course you can, and why does it matter which year it is lol. 
---
But I'm not sure there will be a way to reliably join a certain layer. Depends on if they keep the retail system of always joining the group leaders shard, but don't see why they would in classic, I think they would rather have players consolidate on as few layers as possible.
---
yeah let's make layering 1-3 months long so people level to 60 in 1-2 weeks and get all the black lotus and devilsaur from all the different layers and fuck the economy just to avoid a shitstorm that will last 5 days. Also if there are long queue times because of high population just switch to other servers and fill those servers and create a server "balance" how about that common sense.
---
You should tell them of your education and how they should run things so it's convenient for you. And I'm pretty sure most of Vanilla target audience is the playerbase who originally played Vanilla and they're in their late 20s and 30s now. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
Emerald Dream is still crazy-active.  Whoever says RPers are “a dying breed” isn’t paying much attention to trends.  Tabletop RPing has never been bigger, and there’s significant overlap in these hobbies.
---
Right but our opions and fun do not matter. 
---
1 server that is proper classic, No sharding at all please.
---
Which is fine, but there's more to it than that.  If players were forced to stick to a single layer, then most of the vitriol would disappear.  However, since players can hop layers on a whim, and you receive a random layer on login, layering has hallmarks of both sharding and CRZ.  
---
Layering is no better than either.
---
All classes are viable  for PvE and PvP
---
Are you capable of comprehending that people who run private servers figured out ways to keep 10k people on servers half a decade ago and a multi billion dollar c ompany that we helped launch into legend status can't even match what some basement dwelling nerds reverse engineered?
---
Goddamnit, I had no idea this came out. Sold out :(
---
Private servers have dynamic spawn times. How do people not fucking realise this yet?
---
He literally just listed two popular MMOs in his post.
---
That's fucking bullshit. They've had their exclusivity for over 14 years, and now they are getting it in Classic too?
---
Blizzard said many times that nothing from retail will carry over to classic, and nothing from classic will carry over to retail. Classic is a brand new *service* that they are offering, so people who have bought things on the old service still have their exclusivity and the ability to use them, why the **fuck** does it carry over to an entirely different service? 
---
So now opens up a lot questions regarding other things, like Spectral Tiger from Blizzcon, or that Polarbear mount, should people also get these as well?
---
This is so fucking backwards of anything they've stated in the past
---
You won't be familiar with the metagaming strategies of the extreme private server elite. But that doesn't matter. You can easily enjoy the game without ever opening a guide. You'll be fine.
---
 **I must keep reminding myself of this**
---
i really really really want those mounts
---
Yes you did
---
You would need to keep those low level characters logged in, and their subscription payed for. And we don't know how group joining will work, might be that the low level characters join your more populated layer instead when you group up.
---
Layering and sharding do the same thing: they allow Blizzard to make it so that a zone/continent is never over or underpopulated. They believe that this results in better performance and a better gameplay experience. The former is likely true but the latter is up for debate. Having a zone be overpopulated lead to fierce competition both between factions and even within factions. It also lead to players exploring less popular areas in the game.
---
I'm ok having it on launch and like for a week after lainch for the low level zones because spamming to tag a boar in the starting area isn't much fun, no matter how you slice it. But past that, I don't want it anymore.
---
I would love to see it but at the same time I kinda want there to be separate servers for them. So that there will always be just plain classic.
---
I dont think you understand what layers will be and how quickly they will be removed, lol. Actually I know you dont because nobody knows
---
I swear to god 90% of people in here didn’t play vanilla, the respawn time on mobs was insanely high. Makes it even more apparent when they keep mentioning private server respawns which are actually so broken with how fast they are.
---
"Have a classic Summer"  
---
Releases game 6 days before labor day.  
---
"Summer" may go until September 23rd, but clearly for most folks, after Labor Day, it's not Summer anymore.  
---
Yeah, I can see why people are peeved.
---
maybe because vanilla, tbc, and wotlk are infinitely better than the crap we play these days?
---
there are probably more people who would play those 3 over retail.
---
Just to be clear, server merging and layering / sharding whatever the hell you wanna call it, are completely different.
---
Server merging has everyone in the same server, with no instancing or zoning that can cause two people to be at the same place at the same time, but not see each other. It's literally, let's move people from here, to there. 
---
Sharding is different because theres a cap to how many people are in your instance. Yes, technically theres the same amount of people overall, but you will always be limited by the layer cap.
---
It will be pretty easy to do. But it won't have a very big effect. Any other system they choose to use would have even bigger effects on all kinds of things.
---
As someone who grew up in New England I totally get you.
---
As someone who currently lives in Hong Kong where summer is a complete write off due to absurd heat and humidity and winter is a great time to be outside, I’m slightly bummed.
---
That being said, all of September and most of October is still a horrible sweat fest here so I’ll still have time to get to 60 in the A/C before the nice weather starts.
---
Classic release will undoubtedly help Depression fight me lol.
---
Rage comics in 2019. That's the real joke here.
---
I enjoy RP. I also enjoy PVP. Don't make us have to choose between the two. Don't add them later and make us re-roll on an entirely different character.
---
We dont know yet how many layers there will be. Layer hoping of course will be a problem if people exploit them alot. Plus how would gathering professions work? Is the node just vanishing infront of your eyes because somebody on another layer gathered it or can you just farm different layers to maximize succes? Layering for PVP will be a huge disapointment for obvious reasons. The first months of vanilla were the most enjoyable open world pvp times and its crippled by splitting the population up into fragments.
---
Yes, I've been there since release. I've been in 5 hour queues. I was using it as an example. If you're actually defending layering, you're a fucking cuck.
---
You don’t get to say what you get to for on. The devs pitch you the ideas and the community decides for there.
---
I work at a school and I'm leaving that job to go back to college.  I knew I couldn't take vacation time over the summer (I'm in IT, summer is super busy while everyone else is gone) so I maneuvered things so I'd leave my job at the end of June, and have two months to play WoW before the fall semester.  That fall semester starts for me on August 19th.  I found a way to take the entire summer off, and I'm still not going to get that WoW vacation of mine.  To say I'm frustrated would be an understatement.
---
But the nature of populations on vanilla servers means that there will be a max of 2 layers per server...
---
Ty for the explanation I hope you get in
---
Elastic load balancing. There must have been a reason Blizz decided against it...no idea the reason though.
---
Stay in Vanilla then. Flying is amazing.
---
Such a bullshit straw man argument, What you gonna go back in time? What you gonna start listening to nirvana again? No? Then its not authentic already so just make it live
---
Bro I'm in a very similar boat except I'm in my mid twenties. You're right about WoW not being only pixels, it is so much more than that.
---
Honestly when we finally have the technology in 10-20 years I plan on living in VR 95%+ of the time lmao, and I know I'm not the only one.
---
That's exactly what's going to happen with layering.
---
If a lot of people decide to to roll on one server without initial queue times, guess what's going to happen after phase 1? long queue times. That or layering will persist.
---
I once modded the background music so “Along the Watchtower” played in STV. Is that in bad taste? Still made it bad ass...
---
lol what are you talking about?
---
They shouldn't tie it to the disaster that is retail at all. Just think of it was a fresh game without BC or any of the expansions (although TBC was great).
---
all the more reason not to just circlejerk each other, no??
---
Thanks! Can't even imagine a world without my little princesses :)
---
And that's why I'm fine with (temporarily) turning on the layering and other things to help stabilize and distribute the population until the servers are stable after launch.  Then everything like that should stay off indefinitely.
---
That's the crux of the issue: layers for two weeks? Sure, whatever. Layers for all of Phase 1 (2-4 months, I'm guessing)? Ehhhhh
---
"Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. "  
---
:|
---
The interview with Ion released today, he clearly states MULTIPLE times that it’s only for the first few weeks....so we do know....
---
Shit back then you were lucky to get a call home once a month lol
---
Two weeks off when i get back tho! I’m sure I’ll be no lifing then
---
August 27th, 2021, or sometime early 2022.
---
Yeah the only problem with being stuck in a layer is people play on the same server to play with their guild or friends or family a lot of the time.  If you're all joining the same server then thrown into different layers there's a major issue.  I agree the situation isn't ideal though, and I'm not arguing this is the right or wrong thing to do.  I'm not a game developer and I don't know what the best choice is here.  I was just trying to provide clarity on what OP was trying to say.  
---
It is clear from an outside perspective that there is going to be a huge population issue with 'tourists' (using tourist because of the lack of a better word, basically anyone who tries out classic and never makes it to level 60).  These people are taking up server space on launch.  What percentage of these players do you think will be playing 1 month, 3 months, 1 year after launch?  It seems like blizzard thinks the number is around 25%.  So without any sort of sharding or 'layering' (just a fancy new term so they wont have to call it sharding, imo) the realm populations will be below 1k on average after they settle out.  It's too low.  They need a plan.  They can plan ahead for this with something that wont destroy the long term health and community of the game but solves the short term tourist problem.  It's clear to me they have given this quite a lot of thought.
---
Wow classic is just the 2006 version of wow. The reason its so hyped up is because Blizzard is making it, therefore it will likely be the most authentic  vanilla experience.
---
from what ive heard each layer is about the same size as servers were back in the day, 2-3k people per layer, so theres likely to only be 1-3 layers per server. and we dont know how gathering works on them yet, we will find out tomorrow. and yeah the pvp is definitely a downside, but we also dont know if getting invited to another layer will pull you out of combat.
---
Cross Realm is the death of Classic. Can't have it. Hurts community.
---
" Also i dont like the idea of several mini servers merging all of a sudden " that is literally what layering is and people will switch to KT C if KT A and KT B has long queue so KT C will be populated like  the other ones
---
I'm only going to log in day 1 to reserve a couple of names and then watch the mayhem. 
---
Will level when things stabilize
---
Is this what we've been reduced to? Rage comics?
---
Vanilla servers had a population limit of 5000 players. 3000 players per layer means that there will only be two layers on the highest pop servers. Meaning that “layering” is a non-issue.
---
Watch the interview with Ion, why do people keep saying all of phase 1, he says only the first few weeks MUlTIPLE times
---
yeah im sure thats what they would do, i dont see any world where they force people into playing bc instead of vanilla, considering vanilla is what created this entire thing in the first place
---
Blizzard stated they wouldnt be opposed to Temporary Sharding at the beginning of the launch. So maybe it'll be smooth.
---
Stop at Wrath. For me that was peak WoW. For 14 million others, I think it was too.
---
Well I’m assuming they just don’t want 10k people on a server. That’s not vanilla like, and in order for it work at all you need dynamic respawns, which certainly isn’t vanilla and even the creators of Nost said is not a good solution.
---
This post and the OP's replies seem reasonable to me. People who disagree with him on the other hand...

Vanilla wow in 2019? Did I miss something?
---
Just a sub cost
---
You're not always going to have the gear you want drop though. More options more flexibility.
---
Well.. its summer
---
Will classic have toggles for new models and stuff or is it going to be forced old models?
---
well i dont
---
Sure, you might not have came across them, but you would have met other people on the same layer that could have been your friends for life.
---
*casts Powerword: Fortitude
---
A lot of people are circulating that layering will be around for the entirety of Phase 1....this isn't true.
---
Ion says layering will only be active for "the first few weeks".
---
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;t=300
---
He also promises that "a few weeks in" they will merge everything to a "single world per realm".  You can find that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;t=360
---
lol Blizzard just doesn’t fucking get it. Not surprised but disappointed.
---
Hi, /u/Beatstik
---
says the person that can only muster up begging the question argument and was so proud to come up with one barely coherent thought that they copy pasta'd it all over the thread.
---
Projection much?
---
Hmm, I could try that. I do need a new mouse anyway. And yeah, I notice I tend to spam unnecessarily sometimes as rogue except when I try do the minimum number of button hits to have no downtime I often mistime it which is annoying. I find I have to hit sinister-strike at least twice to ensure it goes off right after the previous. Not to mention the way I strafe by holding right click and using a and d is pretty taxing.
---
yup, but let them. I am excited for it, and thats all. Also, the guys working on it are all very cool. Like ion and the guys we saw at blizzcon 18
---
So did you buy that account with Atiesh, or get it after TBC dropped, or what? Because there's no way someone who was really the top caster in guild that had Naxx on farm would have been replacing their gear with Hellfire Peninsula greens.
---
Launches on my birthday haha
---
You can’t gen chat with other layers.
---
What do you think they will do if there is to hi pop on 1 server? Like say by random chance one of the 5 end up with 10k pop and it wont die down.
---
They will prob offer free transfers out. But I wouldnt want to take that if I had built relationships on there
---
I love how it’s Activison-Bli$$ard when they have bad press and just Blizzard she they do something good.
---
And you can only really switch layers once. Assuming general chat is linked to layers and guilds really do stick to one layer, there's no way to communicate and strategically switch layers with another person on another layer. And even if you do you migrate to that layer and stick there. People are blowing this out of proportion.
---
It's not like sharding where you can switch between them. They fill up like cups sequentially based on when you are logging in. If you or your friends are logging in at around the same time you will be stuck to the same layer.
---
Work at a college, students first day of classes back is August 26th. RIP
---
Vanilla servers had a cap of 5000 players. 3000 players per layer means only two layers per max pop servers.
---
Rip your plans
---
Assuming Blizzard does eventually release the other expansion, in order to stay true to the game, Classic WoW will eventually become the disaster the Classic community wants to avoid.  
---
The only way to truly avoid it is to have the game go a separate path. However, there needs to be a reason for doing it, and implying people meddling with time is a excellent ingame excuse for Blizzard to not repeat their past mistakes.
---
They mentioned that name reserves will start two weeks before release. If you are subbed, you can create 3 classic characters starting August 13.
---
I'd imagine they'd allow a free transfer, or perhaps just have a server queue.
---
So what is gonna stop me and my guild from making multiple characters, spread across multiple guilds and accounts from making characters in every "layer" and inviting our mains to each layer to farm?   
---
Eg, I could have a character in every layer at a Black Lotus or Devilsaur spawn.
---
Wow. They're bringing it back? Why?
---
Lol
---
No. The devs said they open to level 60 post-Naxx content. We dont need to relive BFA in 15 years.
---
this was very helpful to know, definitely will spend the first day staying up as late as i can muster. maybe load up on caffiene when i start getting tired, try to get to around 36 hours before sleeping..
---
Would be total garbage.
---
Getting married on 8.11
---
Divorced on 9.11?
---
&gt;Assuming Blizzard does eventually release the other expansion, in order to stay true to the game, Classic WoW will eventually become the disaster the Classic community wants to avoid.
---
Actually, they've already stated that they're thinking of creating fresh 60 content post-Naxx. The game will always stay at level 60 with the Classic gameplay, so the gameplay isn't the problem, but the addition of new dungeons and raids would be great.
---
If even that long
---
Yeah same here, first day back as a teacher
---
This is actually one of the things I look forward to being old. The world stops relying on you for responsibilities.
---
it was also said that it wont last past phase one, so it will last several weeks up to several months, its all up to blizzard on how long it lasts

Seriously. Its scary. Some of the people here have *nothing* good in their lives apart from memories of a 15 year old video game.

Ride the tiger, brah.
---
There won’t be 3 layers if layer cap is 3000 and server cap is 5000-6000.
---
Retail has sharding and general chat and most of the chats are shard specific. Trade and lfg are the ones server wide
---
&gt; Rastakhan is awesome
---
&gt;!was!&lt;
---
not mentioned so far, Mage can sell portal trips.
---
layering isn't a compromise, it's worse than sharding and far worse than sharding only starter zones
---
Do yourself a favor and don't bother reading up on it. The chances of it having any effect on your gameplay at all are so slim that it's not worth jumping in on the shit show that is the layering "discussion"
---
You seem mad
---
&gt; no flying mounts
---
But #nochanges
---
You realize that of the layer cap is 3000 for a new layer,  there will only ever be two active layers per server due to server cap limit of original vanilla.
---
How good are rogues?
---
This doesn't need to last longer than a week or two, really the main purpose is to prevent a terrible launch where either the server crashes  or all the casuals quit because its impossible to get most quests done.
---
What's up with instance resetting?
---
can't believe you're getting downvoted for this
---
I’d much prefer they did new content for vanilla after naxx  
---
TBC means Azeroth is deserted and flying ruins fun interactions on the ground
---
But do I have to sell my soul once a month to afford to play?
---
And server population caps will be around 5000 players like original vanilla.
---
Alright sounds good. Better than talking to you. So your just broadly assuming everyone in their late 20s is not in college or professional school. Think again bub guy. 
---
I don’t see why your so mad. Sounds like you got it your way, so why don’t you just sit tight and keep being the Jim you are until release
---
Damn. I feel attacked
---
The layers are dynamic. You aren't locked to a layer. You will join a layer when you log in. Sometimes there's only one layer on your sever anyways if only 3000 people are logged into the continent you're on. Anymore than 3000 and you overflow to a new layer and so forth until you hit another 3000 and then a new layer is formed. It's not a permanent thing
---
Flying destroys wPVP and enables very cheap ganking. 
---
It's amazing because?
---
Horse Armor
---
For gold? Not so great, unless you're trying to get rich from node farming on a PvP server (in which case the stealth is a massive help to avoid ganking and roving warbands). But Rogues in general are fantastic, and they aren't *bad* at farming. Just not as good as Mage or Hunter.
---
This reads like something off r/oldpeoplefacebook
---
Why are they calling shards layers?
---
I'm fine with having 2 ABs. MMOs are a good vehicle for large group King of the Hill PVP. Nothing wrong with getting a change of scenery.
---
No, it was literally impossible.
---
"if caster gear goes to a warlock then it's exactly as if it didn't drop at all" "blizz designed the class poorly" ....Hahaha No
---
That’s not terribly hard when all of 40 people play retail at this point in time.
---
It’s like they know they can’t release all the MTX shit from the retail version so they’re tryna scratch every penny they can get off you if you only play vanilla
---
absolutely
---
yeah, it'll last longer than that
---
Post Naxx content makes me fully erect.
---
no its the middle of the night m8
---
i will take either one but neither of those are what layering is. layering is not much better than sharding
---
Best part is that it was Ion that did all the math to find out if it was possible.
---
That's awesome! I get to see some of my favorite bands the Wednesday before classic comes out, so I share your excitement :)
---
You're giving them way too much credit. A shit ton of my friends refused to touch private servers because of how crowded they are.
---
They’re not just choosing people who have been subbed since classic. They want diversity so everyone has a good chance. Including people who came back today or recently.
---
Yeah I would welcome that too. World events a la Guild Wars could be neat
---
I'm the type of person that, since day 1, wanted a remastered Vanilla experience. There's so many things Vanilla does right, but also that it just flat out misses the mark on. From the minor elements (Respec costs) to major ones (some classes and specs are just onjectively worse than others), I like the idea of what OSRS is doing, and building the game off of the roots the classic was built from.
---
LOL I love it when shit players immediately claim I bought my account or something.
---
I'm a multi-Gladiator Mage as well (plus Glad on my priest).
---
I might very well be mistaken, since it's been 12 years since I leveled to 70, but I literally don't care enough to face check right now.
---
how do you know this? i dont think any of us know what the server populations will look like a month after launch
---
🤨
---
Works out for me just because I'm going to have my recurring payment at the beginning of the month anyhow.
---
You've obviously never had a true vanilla WoW experience.
---
Oh fuck me youre right. Id be 12pm for noon.
---
Yes, I think layering is a good idea. I was offering the classic solution AFTER the layering is over and some servers did not have the "tourists" leave. I think we'll see streamer servers stay strong for about a year or so (or until streamer leaves). This would be the server that has an overpopulation after layering is done. Those that are not there for the streamer could bolt after unlayering occurs after phase 1.
---
I did. I started playing Nov 2005. On a PvE server. Cool assumption though, bucko.
---
It drops the morning of my first day of classes for my last year of grad school. Probably wouldnt be able to get past 40-50 by Christmas break. Was really hoping to race to be one of the earlier 60s on the realm, now I'm not convinced I'll play.
---
Because it's based on 1.12 ya dingus
---
It's times like these where I wish I was wrong :p
---
Devilsaur won't be camped 24/7 since classic won't be international servers. Lotus might be an issue
---
2022 for the 15th anniversary.
---
Read with great joy, and I just can't wait to experience all that again. It actually was such a gem of a game. 
---
Glad you were able to find your ways, have fun in Classic!
---
I think the idea is to have 2-3 layers with 3kish players in each, once the tourists leave, collapse them and hopefully most of the servers have a healthy population after phase 1. 
---
That's kinda what I've pulled from what's been said so far, I'm hoping that's the case.
---
Same
---
You have no idea what you are talking about, stick to BFA.
---
Just invite to your party...
---
layering won't last the entirety of phase 1 so it's fine
---
Lmao you’re a clown.
---
Two days before my Birthday. Guess I'm going to take my birthday week off again this year!
---
Yes, one of them aged well.

Yes, probably a lot of teachers will not be that happy, on the other side, teachers have already enough holidays during the year ;')

you WILL see people fading away into different layers. watch tips out interview, they confirmed that you can hop layers via invite
---
Holy moly. Good luck bud
---
I hope you get your miracle, friend
---
I'm fairly certain blizzard will be smart enough to fashion the layers in a way so people can't exploit the system for resources. Not worth worrying about.
---
&gt;calling someone else retarded
---
Ironic.
---
there was a blue post saying it was only going to be in the starting zones for the first weeks
---
Appreciate the info man, thanks!
---
All it means is that I'm *definitely* not rolling a class that will have r14 weapons as BiS for 4+ phases.
---
I'm not #nochanges. And I don't think most sensible people are, really...
---
ey, if ppl are allowed to assume that server pops die enough after a month or 2 to remove sharding, im allowed to assume that server pops continue to grow instead.
---
especially with the server caps essentially removed because of layers, many more communities can all pick the same servers and keep them alive a lot longer than if servers were capped at 3k, more new players are likely to pick the same super active server than go for a low pop
---
I prefer releases toward september. It‘s shitt weather outside and inside it‘s nice and cozy inside. The nights are also long. Perfect for binging.

---
Also, OG Vanilla had 100,000 peak players on launch day with like 90 servers.
---
If Classic has 1M on launch day, should they have:
---
- 900 servers, with 700 dead a few months later?
---
- 10x server population and the shit that'll cause?
---
- 10x login queues? 1 hour in vanilla is 10 hour wait for classic?
---
layering is sharding for entire continents, instead of smaller sections of the map, and also it's not cross realm. to summarize, it's just as bad as sharding
---
I've never played WoW. Feel like I've missed out on a major phenomenon. Kind of sad
---
I’d try to get into a private server (haven’t done so myself so can’t help ya with how to do so) while waiting for release.
---
They won’t be 100% the same, but will give you a great idea of how the game will play
---
So why do you think they are doing it?
---
Layering is a different system than sharding and was only just revealed today.
---
Bravo!!
---
Fucking perfect time, after a lifetime of game launches at the most annoying times possible.
---
I feel like there's people who think "only in the starting zones" means the 1-5 area at the very beginning. Starting zones might mean all the way up to 20, because it all depends on the giant wave of players at the beginning anyway.
---
Like you finally get unsharded and then the game grinds to a halt because there's hundreds of people waiting at the same mob to kill or whatnot.
---
The community and economy will sort itself out quickly after P1.
---
It was kind of vague. You definitely will need an active sub in order to PLAY the beta, but people are conflicted on whether you need a sub in order to receive an invite.
---
lmao adam friedland
---
ure right but i feel like there is an important difference between miniservers merging in the back and seeing officially KT-C + KT-B merged in the server list and expecting to meet new players. Its more smooth if its dynamic imo

For me it does a little bit, I don't have a big desire to play enhancement shaman in classic but for BC they would be one of my favorites, Shadow priest is kinda in the same boat.

A big part of leveling in classic was travel time. If you lnow where to go next to keep up a good leveling pace you can avoid enormous amounts of time back tracking (and I mean like, literal hours especially pre 40

Congratulations, your server has now merged with Asmongold and his fans, where the average player age is 14, with player names CuckyMcCuckface.

reminds me of the last time i played retail
---
&gt; Confirmed we will not be getting the unarmored mounts at all.
---
This is disappointing. Seems like a small thing for them to add in but interesting for the community.
---
Vanilla WoW private servers have been alive and well for 10+ years now.
---
I dont think Layering will be uncapped. Blizzard has excellent market research and will estimate the size of the initial hype wave quite precise. So whereas without Layering, the servercap would be 3k, with layering it could be 12k to secure the ability to merge after a few weeks
---
Exact opposite for me. I absolutely love working. College was a nightmare and I wanted to kill myself half the time. 20-25 hours of classes, 15-25 hours of homework and 20 hours of working every week. Add a social life to that and I probably spent 3-4 years where I only even bought a handful of new video games.
---
Maybe you can skip classes and study while you are flying?
---
My sample size is small (about 15 people - my Retail guild).
---
Of the 15, 3 of us played Classic. I'm the only one that played from fairly early on - others came in around 1.10. All super keen for it though
---
worldwide release. US Best Coast here, 3pm Mon the 26th.
---
Every change to retail over the years had some similar rationale, and plenty of people like you defending them along the way
---
That's what I don't get. It already exists. Are they updating it somehow?
---
thats true, i just dont think its very likely that itll be necessary after a month or two. and im sure servers will still have a population cap even though they have layering, especially because they mentioned they may open up more servers after a few days if needed. the layering is just there to make sure the servers arent overcrowded at launch, not to remove the need for a pop cap.
---
Love how they try to groom you into going Dwarf Priest.

You're*. Keep bitchin' and moanin' in your late 20s. No wonder you're still in school.
---
They did it before with the MoP beta. A *lot* of people bought the annual pass subscription to get in.
---
&gt; It means guilds can’t attack other guilds on the way to raids
---
Does it? With 3,000 players per layer, there's not going to be any other faction guilds available?
---
Yep. Took off day of release, and then have the 3rd-6th off (figuring to let the first week insanity die down, and kids off to school).
---
&gt; want to squeeze us for an extra 3 months of cash.
---
Are they forcing you to sub at gunpoint or something? How are they squeezing 3 months of cash from you?
---
&gt; How many of those loyal customers have been campaigning for classic?
---
Shitloads of us my man!
---
wPVP is pointless garbage, always has been. Man up and fight an enemy on even ground, not when they're at half HP fighting a mob or when half their shit is on cooldown.
---
The only way to prove you're better than someone is to fight them when you both are on roughly even footing (levels, gear, cooldowns).
---
Flying gets you exactly where you want to be without getting dismounted by daze, in a reasonable time frame. It still gives you full control over your direction and destination, unlike a flight path. You can still see something that interests you and stop.
---
My problem with Wrath was that everything became a spam fest by the time ICC came out. Healers basically never went OOM, especially hpals which could effectively heal two tanks similaneously. Tanks were getting hit for 90% of their health in a single hit so they had to nerf avoidance to compensate. In BCC you had to be much more measured with how you meted out holy lights otherwise you'd find yourself OOM pretty quick.

IM GETTING GANKED INVITE FAST phew thanks im safe

need to check black lotus, can someone inv to a different layer?

I had never watched The Office before but after seeing your posts I started watching it on Netflix last Thursday.  Now I'm halfway through season 5.  So congratulations, fucker, you've completely commandeered what will likely end up being 2 weeks of my life.

Closed beta is different than the stress test. Closed beta starts tomorrow and runs for a long time.
---
$15 aint much to me so I prefer to just give myself the best shot possible at Closed Beta since it will likely be invites over a couple month period.

i think you can preorder copies off of amazon still, and i wouldnt consider it a waste if its something you enjoy and think is worth it. whats wasteful changes from person to person

---
It's a good game, there's a reason millions of people played and loved it when it was fresh and not nostalgic. Like any game though, it's not for everyone and maybe you will or won't like it. You can easily play for a month or two (once it releases) to see if you enjoy it for literally 1/2-1/4 the cost of buying a new game that you similarly may or may not like.

---
I guess I dont see how introducing a catch up mechanic solves the problem. It's a band aid to an inevitable part of any game that relies heavily on power progression to maintain its playerbase.
---
BC wont be coming out for a few years so you have plenty of time to level an alt or two in that time. just play what you want as your main for vanilla and level an alt for when BC inevitably comes out
---
Welcome to WoW on reddit.
---
Just dont start playing until its gone.  Solved
---
Not really true. Very few people are *actually* satisfied with BfA. A huge % have cancelled subs, the remaining % either buy their sub in long periods (ie., me. I pay 6 months at a time), are using tokens (because you can earn more tokens easily during a token play period), or are playing just because friends are still around.
---
I'd argue it was at the height of popularity because tbc was good. If you were playing tbc and liked it, you would obviously play the next expansion hoping it would be just as good or better than tbc. Then people realize it's not as good and unsub and don't play the next expansion, which is what the data shows. If wotlk was so amazing,  you would see the next expansion with higher sub numbers or equal, but you don't because wotlk was way different than vanilla and tbc
---
It’s not just nostalgia. That’s a fake Ideology by people who have no true recollection of how the game played back then vs what they enjoy now.
---
The best way to get an idea is play for 2 hours from level 1 and see where you get on Retail. Did you enjoy it? Was it boring? Did you ever feel like you were going to die taking in more than 1 or 2 NPC’s? 
---
Now go watch Esfand 2 hour video today on leveling on beta client. That the difference in the speed of the game.
---
It’s a slower grind but it’s still fun. You get into your class more. You get into the community of your server more. You learn players by their characters and remember them from a dungeon you did together and so forth.
---
Nostalgia is a feeling you can’t recreate. Every Vanilla player that logs into Classic will be able to recreate those old feelings.
---
Color me surprised reddit is mostly 13-22 year olds.
---
Yes to both. It's a separate entity from current WoW. You'll start at level one, heirloom gear will not exist in any form.
---
I don't think anyone sane disagrees that LFR is and always was an awful addition.
---
You gotta pump those numbers up! Those are rookie numbers!
---
Newsflash fangays. Private servers are free and just as stable.  Been here for years on classic.
---
Stay at home dad with a 10 month old. Wife is going out of state for 2 months for work the day before. I could still play, but my time now is very limited.
---
Dara Mactire. Holy shit- haven't seen that name in looooong while lol.
---
&gt;Opening up tons of excessive servers and then dealing with the dead communities there and whether to merge them or whatever seems like a worse problem that would linger for the entire experience.
---
And considering this is something they have already dealt with during and after WoTLK. They will sure as hell not make that mistake again.
---
&gt; even though server queues worked just fine in 2004-2006
---
Ya 2-3 hours queues on weekday evenings was "just fine"
---
I forgot Pservers were known for beeing utterly stable and free of lag. 
---
Pservers don't have to deal with the amount of playerinflux we will see at launch nor with the innevitable substantial drop after a few weeks. That's two huge problems for blizzard that will affect their player retention. If they go #nochanges they can't fix one problem without worsening the other. This is the unfortunate reality. And Blizzard went out of their way to keep it as authentic as possible while fixing both problems.
---
Most people in this sub have been playing vanilla private servers for years
---
If it was restricted to the starting zones only, every other zone would cop the issues they're trying to avoid. By running the sharding for a few weeks instead of a few zones, it means the experience will generally be better overall.
---
I have my concerns about people that will powerlevel to 60 in order to farm rare materials using the system, but I think that no matter what solution was put in place that was always going to be an issue
---
Im aware. Kinda hard to get more then 1 lock out on 1 toon....
---
I make most of my gold on a level 5 bank alt. I think it's a paladin?
---
Probably then only people it will be fun to.
---
Sorry can you show me the source? Because everything recent says the same thing...a few weeks
---
25 with no job, no drivers licence, friends/girlfriend, no work experience whatsoever= no future.
---
This is the only thing I look forward to.

Good news, makes sense. I made a thread few days back arguing blizzard should do this and I got downvoted to oblivion and downright attacked. Lol

This feels like step 1 in Blizzard’s patented 74 step program to destroy everything I used to love
---
Get outside this summer before we no-life indoors. I like it
---
Mate, schools out, has been for like 10 years. We are not all students any more.
---
Damn must be smart if you can correct that. 
---
Yeah and so do you because yeah I’m still in school but not a regular school and I’ll keep it at that to not make you feel too dumb
---
Yeah if I mount up and fly away the second I happen to catch a glimpse of an enemy player on their mount maybe? But they tend to just drop down on me out of nowhere. There's no time to react/get away. 
---
And as soon as resistance shows up the ganker can just fly off. There's no consequences whatsoever for them. 
---
Flying makes gankers so much more powerful.
---
I haven't played vanilla (started end of wrath) and am stoked as hell for Classic. It will bring back the community the game has lost and bring back the feel of exploration and having the journey matter rather than just the destination.
---
not everybody is a casual like you body they will start raiding in 2-3 weeks
---
In the interview with Ion and that one woman, they did say that they are open to player feedback in the future for a TBC classic release as well.
---
If you only care about playing the game, it's a waste. If you're a collector maybe you value this as a collectible.
---
He literally said a few weeks...
---
Did they explicitly say we wouldn't have sharding in the starting zones as well? This solves the long term issue but not the short term issue.
---
Imagine them implementing the Dragon Isles and other cut content/raids after Naxx. That would be so amazing.
---
Just in time for it to be used as the 5 minute intro music for every undead backpedaling 3 minute mage pvp vid.
---
Good they can stay away
---
yeah.. tbh i rather play tbc/wrath over vanilla
---
but obviously it supposed to start from the beginning
---
Forced old.
---
Dynamic spawn also bring many issue and would probably be considered worst by the no-change community
---
do you have any idea how long phase 1 is
---
The whole active sub thing is a lie I was invited to WOD , Legion , BFA with no active sub they can write that but it’s not true 3 different occasions 3 different invites no subscription
---
Druids is good for Herbalism. Other Classes have to dismount then mount to pick a herb but a Druid can just stay in Cheetah Form.

---
Get a better GF (ie one that will play with you).
---
I like to fall asleep to these.
---
Yeah, I see no reason not to have at least one of each type of server for *every* expansion, even WoD. You can't even say it'd split the playerbase because the playerbase is already split in classic between the different servers. Having 5 classic/tbc/wotlk/etc servers instead of 50 isn't going to negatively impact the individual servers.
---
You move out of them the second you log out. The next day you're likely to be on a server with 3000 completely fresh faces. There's only continuity in single game sessions.
---
What is OSRS?
---
Thank you for providing a thoughtful review of it for people to listen to rather than just posting another sharding meme...
---
You chose the best place to get an unbiased look at retail vs classic. JK, lol
---
having an ounce of trust in 2019 for blizzard, wake the fuck up dude
---
r/onionhate
---
No it isn't, stop reaching for something to complain about. It's literally the best of both worlds scenario
---
I mean, you could always play retail for two weeks.
---
It seems pretty fair to me. Care about your name enough = Pay up. Don't care? Then dont expect to get to be named Illidank or Guldank Day 1.
---
Yeah but are the other people in the raid fine with it? That's the real question.
---
You're missing the point. After phase 1 ends, you could end up with an overpopulated server. Yes pre-Phase 1 you have those 12k spread out across 3 layers. After Phase ends, you're going to have all those people merged together and you're either going to end up with 2 scenarios: An overpopulated server with massive queue times. Or layering will have to persist for that server even post Phase 1.
---
Without layering, you're going to suffer queue times for the first month or so, but that forces you to roll on the other server options but at the same time you know you will be merged back to the to another server at 1 point in the future if your server dies out drastically. And during that time, there will be no phasing exploits happening.
---
Just try it when it’s out. Play for 10-15 levels and see if you like it. If you end up liking BFA play that. If Classic is fun, play that!
---
This is exactly what I have been saying too. Well said..
---
What’s this?
---
You're going to logout?
---
Is it really a slippery slope? I don't think it is.
---
They're going to allow 3,000 per layer per continent during the launch window. And it's attempting to stay as consistent as possible.
---
The reason that's done is to avoid several logistical issues that the team had to face. Server access being a big one. The entire game has several bottlenecks that will not be cleared quickly, so it prevents massive hurdles in the first few weeks before players start having diverse options on where to go.
---
On top of that, it solves server population issues. This is really the first time they get to do this, and it's something that if the team were making WoW today would probably implement. The problem with having servers, letting them get filled, and opening new ones is that you're opening like 5 layers of logistical garbage to the game that has to be solved at another point. Server populations will fall and steady out over time, so if you can facilitate 2 or 3 times the server population under launch conditions you can effectively release fewer servers. While the high population servers will still be high population, it funnels more players into lower and medium population realms, stopping them from being ghost towns (and stopping Blizzard from having to offer transfers or shut realms down).
---
Just about everything they're doing is making sure everyone wins. We get a cohesive world, with a backup for when things get batshit early on (which they will). The realm will come together as a community after phase 1 permanently, and it makes sure server populations have a greater chance of being stable.
---
There isn't a downside to this. At all. Blizzard wins, we win. Everyone gets a compromise and no one gets left with a sour taste in their mouth.
---
If it really pisses you off, just don't play till phase 2, when the layered tech is phased out.
---
if you want hard core leveling that takes weeks and more weeks to get gear, go classic.
---
if you want easy mode, rain epics and legendaries for low effort go BFA..
---
I certainly hope so, done in a merge-forward kind of way.
---
As in, I can merge my character into a BC world on a separate server, and still be able to hop onto my char on vanilla, and any changes get merged forward to my BC char (e.g. learn a new recipe, get a new piece of gear)
---
Yall should've expected this the moment they said 1.12.
---
They are launching it late to reduce the number of people logging in so the servers don't catch fire
---
And, in one instance, when a blizzard community head it their persona character leaked to the public. lol

\`\`\`Kingsguard is a guild that was formed for World PVP. We will also have a raiding team that focuses on progressing in order to have the best gear to stay competitive in PVP. The leadership team has had many years of experience running both PVP and RP guilds in World of Warcraft so there will be a mix of both styles. Contact Lieucian on discord if interested.

Classic wow vs BFA wow is the age old story of QUALITY vs QUANTITY. 
---
BFA has a large quantity of content, but it's a hollow world. I can't stand the thought of guiding anymore turtles during world quests. For that reason alone, I'd rather play classic.
---
What private servers are you talking about? Because if you're talking about The Big One, or That One's Successor, or The One After That, that's not sharding. That's distanced-based phasing, and it didn't matter because if there was a horde mage sitting on top of hemet nesingway 1 shotting everyone then everyone could walk into that area and see him. I don't know about any other private servers, but I've played on those 3 plus one TBC server and none of them have had "sharding" in the way you're describing.
---
&gt; LOL I love it when shit players immediately claim I bought my account or something.
---
&gt; I'm a multi-Gladiator Mage as well (plus Glad on my priest).
---
I'm not saying you're lying. Just that we have a *surprising* number of posters here who claim to be multi-glad vanilla-Naxx-farming demigods who won WoW in every expansion... but who don't seem to remember much about real vanilla/TBC WoW. And I don't think they are *all* telling the truth.
---
I never had an area rating or PvP rank worth anything much, the only tier I ever fully cleared when it was cutting edge was T4, I quit in Cata before hitting the level cap and haven't played since... and I still seem to know more about it than you do. It makes you go "hmm".
---
Staysafe said it didn't work when he tried it at Blizzard HQ in his latest video.
---
Doesn’t affect me because once they flip over to TBC, I’m gone.
---
I'll do it!

I'm a CPA 2 years out of college. We get 4 weeks vacation and you can "buy" a 5th week. 10 company paid holidays and only work 1 or 2 Saturdays a year. Industry is so much better than public accounting...I'm done with that hell.
---
Like he just couldn't reset it? That has to be a bug then. You've been able to reset normal instances from vanilla till BFA
---
&gt; there's nothing stopping you from doing that on Classic's layered servers. 
---
Of course there is, They will be ghost town servers... I couldn't physicaly if I tried have to group up for a quest or chat to people whilst waiting.
---
Yes, yes, yes, and yes, respectively.
---
Free games, and chance to try it out as a review before you buy it. As far as classic beta there's a great chance to practice routes when you want to achieve a certain goal at the start of the game; ie. server first enchants, outleveling the pvp ganking, testing differences in private servers vs classic.
---
It will be three years from now when they have any semblance of a new game for us.  Plenty of time to have the max level alt you want.  Plus I want horde pally tank so I cant level anyway :P

Classic has more content then current wow. If you consider putting 0 effort into doing all the old raids/dungeons content you may enjoy the game clicking simulator. At no point do raids or most dungeons become super easy in classic. Right now you can afk follow in raid finder in retail. I would like to know what “content” retail actually has in comparison to classic. Classic is timeless that’s why we have it coming out. After a mass exodus from retail wow along the lines of 8.5% of all players how could you possibly say it has more content.

Yea its been a long while. Back when we started to head into SWTOR...and shortly after it started to fall apart. 
---
It was a wild guild...i believe parts of them are still around. I havent been with that guild in years though.
---
Pretty sure that even deleting a name makes it stuck to your account for a few weeks so someone can’t snipe your name while you remake a character.
---
Could be wrong, but I know that has been the case in the past (tried to delete a character and remake on second account)
---
I don't like the idea of Blizzard controlling the leveling process of players by removing certain things like this. Let the players of your game decide how they want to level. It all comes down to choice, nobody is putting a gun to your head to obtain a certain mount. At the end of the day, everyone is chasing something in the game.
---
Yeah, I have *way* more free time working than I ever did in college. Full time school plus working 30 hours per week managing a store was terrible. Nowadays I just come home from work and relax, not to mention having weekends off.
---
how about you play BFA if they are so amazing and capable of making good games for a decade
---
Guild master and officers decide what kind of guild the guild is going to be, ultra hardcore or more relaxed. If they allow those specs to raid, other people can either deal with it or fuck off and find another guild.
---
it was from staysafe and esfands interview with brian and patrick, and i believe i saw it in another interview as well, but at about 13:33 in the [interview](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=813) they start talking about how long it will last
---
Legalize weed and tax churches. I just fixed everything.
---
Yes... 20th,21st,22nd or 23rd these would all still be ok becasue thats still summer...
---
Am I having a stroke? Like that was a really odd question, They said summer its launching in summer. If it launched in October then words would need to be had.
---
point out my shitty logic npc
---
If it works anything like this phasing/sharding we have now, you can block it with advanced routers. I was running around alone in the world in WoD when I did this.
---
It's not elegant and it will be extremely obvious, it already was in the demo. I really don't understand how this is better than server merges.
---
I have 2 dads
---
I've got a krick in my back!

https://youtu.be/EyZzBkFRGIU
---
I was thinking this same shit,  good luck m8
---
When this game was released in 2004, it was, quite literally, the most sanitized and newbie friendly MMORPG on the market.  You'll be fine.
---
find something you are good at or have interest in and pursue that. you have your whole life ahead of you
---
Please no fuck resilience I dont want that shit
---
not to mention movies as well
---
Wish me luck... :(
---
Congratulations for your loss
---
No not at all. The knowledge we had then and even today is basically the same. Based on the best in slot gear doing the most optimal healing/dps rotations and even class stacking the boss was for all intense purposes mathematically impossible and un-killable.
---
#Oooof
---
Hitting way too close to home dude.
---
F
---
I triple majored in math, computer science, and economics in college and have worked a few different jobs since graduating several years ago.
---
Some jobs were much more demanding than college, and some jobs weren’t. Simple as that.
---
I totally get what you’re saying. Maybe if I post it you can read it and tear it apart.. maybe you would like it. 
---
I do disagree though w the expansions. I quit playing before MoP, because there was so much still from Warcraft lore that to focus on a joke... for me that killed any motivation to play the game. Also, having space blue aliens w/ flying ships was, IMO, ridiculous and personally hated the addition in TBC. It was always jarring.
---
So what happens if after Phase 1 ends you end up with an overpopulated server?
---
There's only 2 possible scenarios: An overpopulated server with massive queue times. Or layering will have to persist for that server even post Phase 1.
---
Layering has to go.
---
Physically no, but I still take their classes and follow their schedule.
---
Hopefully not a transfer. Would much prefer a character copy.
---
Are they changing classes to be more balanced than OG vanilla?
---
And there’s other places where it’s cold as fuck in September. And I don’t know where you’ve got the idea that astronomical calendar is most used, Where I live summer is June, July and august. And you can’t seriously argue that blizzard didn’t mean June, July or August when they said summer and not “it’s hot somewhere so it’s still summer somewhere.”
---
I wouldn't roll a toon on the assumption you'll have more fun in 2-3 years. Maximize your experience now and adapt to the future.
---
Thank you I appreciate it
---
Because Im that type of guy that when I have nothing to do I'll do Achievements, get mounts,pets,toys, Archaeology... So even if all those things are meaningless, it entertains be in certain way.
---
“Whatever you do don’t touch that red button!”
---
Sure lets call them the cream. The people who sit there for 24 hours a day waiting for a mob tag I mean it wouldn't be wrong to call them that.
---
I mean it's a server test. It's not like you're getting to see and test new content... if you've played on pservers any time in the last ~5 years, you know exactly what is happening.
---
Can I ask why?
---
Servers merges have a problem with player names, since layers are all in the same server when you remove the layers you dont have this problem with players having the same name.
---
No, and thats one of the reasons why they think they need sharding/layering.
---
Thats the whole point i think most of us is trying to make. If they wouldda "stuck" to no change mentality, and keep server pop similar, there wouldn't have been any need for sharding/Layering. Dont get me wrong they were gonna do it at launch anyway, and we all knew that. But the reason we were so loud about the issue is the extend they are willing to use it to make things easier on their part. Its clear now that they are willing to extend it way longer then launch day. Will they turn on the sharding whenever a new content patch comes out?
---
Well, since you asked... I'm starting my MBA Sept 3, and since I despise my current job, I'm handing in my two weeks mid July so I have all of August off to relax and play Classic WoW. That was the plan, anyways... I guess I'll still have a week after launch to play so I'm better off than most on here. Still a bummer though.
---
Never gonna fucking happen. He's explicitly stated that there *must* not be layering after Phase 1 because it would fuck with World Boss spawns.
---
No they won't lol
---
the entire point of layering is to prevent overpopulation, how would preventing overpopulation = "ghost towns" ?
---
Go troll somewhere else.
---
The demo was full of sharding which was awful, layering is a completely different system.
---
You really don’t think Blizzard told them to build hype the way they did? I’ve got a bridge to sell you.
---
I see your point, but if Blizzard really wanted to get the next generation of kids interested in WoW, they should have released it a little earlier....kids are back in school and don’t have time like they do over the summer.
---
Don’t worry gramps, I’ll be taking time off school and going 48 hours nonstop while ur feeble heart makes u go to bed after 6 hours
---
Old School RuneScape
---
Yeah this is good.  Thanks for this; I was completely avoiding the shitstorm of posts until something succinct came up. 
---
I do think it's funny how they started referring to sharding as "layering."  Inconsequential, but funny.  We already knew they were going to shard for a time.
---
rightfully so
---
should we have expected every item to be able to drop as they did in 1.12, with the correct itemization on each item too? Oh wait..
---
This is what i'm worried about. 
---
First it was "sharding only for a limited time in the starting zones"
---
Now it's "Layering, but only off the start, at the end of p1"
---
What will they change their mind too when p2 comes out?
---
Ok you're going to have to clear some of this,shit up for me. What is B2P? I know Pay to win, but I'm confused. Also, MTX? Again what does that mean? 
---
As for your friends, they just don't understand how badly they got the shaft. Get them to play some classic and encourage them to stick around for more than an hour. They will learn that it's at more rewarding.
---
Please for the love of god, if you've never played WoW classic before, DO NOT TAKE VACATION TIME unless you REALLY UNDERSTAND what you're getting yourself into.  Do your research.
---
It's a masterful game that was in a period where many were popping their MMO cherries.  That being said, it's dated in terms of quality of life.  For instance, you don't get a mount until level 40, among other things.
---
I hope so.
---
People are overestimating how hard raiding is in wow. I remember healing MC in shadow spec one or two times because I didn’t want to pay for a respec. You need a good base of players and then you’re basically just making up the numbers for the last 20 or so people. 
---
Vanilla wow isn’t about min maxing it’s about the journey, would you rather play a cookie cutter class or say you cleared MC as a feral Druid etc?
---
You would choose your layer.  If you create a character on Darkspear, you would create a character on Darkspear 1, 2, or 3 and your friends would do the same.  It would be the same as picking a server, but with the eventual merger of all of the layers.
---
I’m sure you could find an unopened unredeemed wow collectors edition. So not no chance.
---
you can choose miniservers however you can't choose layers
---
&gt;A contractor tells you he's going to come by in the afternoon and shows up at 4:30. It's still afternoon (assuming evening starts at ~6:00), but it's on the later side. Is this something to get mad about?
---
This is a bad analogy because it makes no reference to the insinuated meaning of the phrase 'Classic Summer'. Here's a more appropriate one:
---
An employee tells you he'll come to work after lunch, and that it'll be a 'Work Afternoon', but then shows up at 4:45, 15 minutes before the end of the work day. Did he come in after lunch? Absolutely. Was the term 'Work Afternoon' misleading? Absolutely.
---
TLDR: the issue a lot of people have is they lied about sharding only being limited to starter zones and launch. Now we have something that is every zone and longer time frame.
---
Where do we draw the line? Where will blizzard draw the line?
---
What about it isn’t a fresh slate?
---
Why are warriors so bad? Would not most classes be ok at 60?
---
What does the demo have to do with this? The demo had retail sharding...
---
Becasue these 99% of players will be gone in less than 2 weeks yourself included. 
---
&gt;Also, it's fucking temporary.
---
Lol there is no way of you knowing that. Blizzard said 3 weeks - 1 month but Blizzard also said "sharding only in starting zones" but here we are. 
---
The game will be almost impossible to enjoy for me without that feeling of a living world where we are all playing at the same time. Guess I just have to wait till the final phase is over to start.
---
Will playing classic take us all back in time where Metzen is still around?
---
Thanks for the video.    
---
Ion does a good job explaining their reasoning behind the decision and to me their reasoning seems sound.
---
If it was just a matter of offering a better/easier levelling experience and of avoiding login-queues, I’d be 100% against any of that (that being sharding and layering) but with the problem of hype-tourists causing a situation where some servers might be dead after the initial few weeks I see this as an acceptable solution.
---
I think this is the best solution to solve those problems (especially the last one) and I also think this solution is superior to sharding in that regard since it won’t be cross-realm and will always have a full server population per layer (which will probably mean 2-3 layers per server at most).
---
I can understand that some people doubt Blizzard will keep their promise to remove it, but so far I have not seen anything that makes me doubt the Classic team in particular. I’ve been burned before by putting my trust in Blizzard (and private server admins) before but from everything the Classic team has said so far, they have me cautiously optimistic.
---
You should probably just delete it. Anyone who doesn't read all the way through only sees a bunch of misinformation.
---
Id imagine they would be seperate games all together.  
---
No one under 58 on entire realm for example.
---
But you could copy your toon over, then having 2 active copies, one in vanilla.classic, one in tbc.classic
---
Lmfao me being a streamer has NOTHING to do with this... Im not the one thinking people are gonna be following me ruining my gaming experience... YOU'RE the one bringing up im a streamer... Im not getting insulted about anything lmfao YOU are... lmfao are you fucking mental??? "you are not one of them so there is no reason for you to get instulted" Bro take your own advice lmfao you literally think YOUR game experience is gonna be ruined because streamers are on your server... I legit can't tell if you're stupid or if you just have a mental condition. You act like because asmongold is gonna get stream sniped its gonna ruin YOUR game... please sit the fuck down and actually read what you type and think before you speak.  "you are clearly just taking offence to things that don't concern you" you're speaking about yourself lmfao...
---
If you’re playing more and being relatively efficient you’ll breeze past everyone. 15 hours is crazy. Make time for other stuff in your life!!
---
lol
---
It won't be extremely obvious unless you party with someone on a different layer, which you'd have to know them ahead of time to know they are on a different layer.
---
Layers isn't sharding in and out continuously. If you are on Layer 2 you are on Layer 2 until the full merge happens. You won't see players from other layers if you're the only one in the zone or the zone is full of people, unlike what would happen with sharding.
---
It's just like server merges except you aren't merging servers, you're just merging the layers on a single server.
---
If everyone says they want to play on "Frostbolt" because it's the new PvP hotness, then everyone will be assigned a layer in Frostbolt. When the merge happens, everyone is still in Frostbolt. You won't be phasing in and out or seeing nodes/people disappear like sharding.
---
Wrong. Watch the dev interviews. They're confident it will go flawlessly with sharding tech + beta testing.
---
here we go again with blizz trying to fuck with the way people want to play their game...
---
If it stops me from seeing other players then its no different from sharding to me, Im still being forced to not play with people who I might enjoy being around becasue of this tech. 
---
I dont see why they cant launch at least 1 proper server without all this sharding tbh.
---
Try it when it comes out. If you like it great, if not then it's OK, you have lost nothing. People can describe it but it really has to be experienced to know.
---
Wow man sorry this is happening to you.
---
This guy gets it
---
Because then only a select few would get a better experience.
---
or you're just fucking stupid
---
Psh, that would be unrealistic
---
Warriors are fucking fantastic. Highest class population, highest raid proportions, best gear scaling, viable dps spec variety, etc.
---
But OP wanted a class that is good for making gold specifically. And Warriors in Vanilla are very slow levelers who are bad at making gold. They can't engage large groups of mobs easily, they have mostly single target damage, and they have sustain issues with Rage dropoffs. Their armor also costs more to repair, which is itself a larger gold sink.
---
Since OP's primary concern is about making money for the sake of making money, rolling Warrior is perhaps the worst class choice. For all their strengths, solo moneymaking is certainly not one of them.
---
Yeah I suppose if you have the money. My guess is they will provide a way to get it down the line but who knows
---
I mean... I can play at launch (6pm is after work). But I have to go to bed early. Between my moving and convention season various other things, I've burned through all my PTO.
---
[https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w?t=104](https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w?t=104)
---
This is ion at blizzcon talking about sharding, talking about how important it is that resources need to be fought over and that sharding was a temporary solution in low level zones to alleviate congestion.  They have gone back on that, and are doing this "layering" for the entire server.  If it's more convenient for them to leave "layering" on after p2, they will.
---
Yeah thinking about getting it published.
---
Dammit....sorry I missed the sub name.  It was posted in so many I got confused. Sorry
---
this is so wholesome &lt;3 
---
go to school during the day, get your homework done, and THEN you can play wow. explain this plan to your parents and they will be SUPER impressed. 
---
good luck kiddo, see you out in Azeroth!
---
You assume too much.
---
Naw I'm just not joining your cult
---
Ever try to fit 500,000 people inside of a Walmart?
---
Downvoted for telling the truth lol
---
With sharding, if a server has 1k online and 200 packed into a single area, for a community event for example, those 200 players will start to shard off.
---
With layering, if a server has 1k online and 200 packed into a single area, those 200 people will stay together.
---
Just watched the staysafe video and he presented the information wrong. He is saying the wow devs have assured him that layering will be finished by phase 2 when the world bosses come out. They aren’t saying it will be all of phase 1, they are just making it fully clear it will have little effect on the world.
---
Ion literally says only the first few weeks, so I would go with that.
---
You're right, WoD launch was horrible for a lot of players, i even remeber they gave everyone like 5 days of free play time because it went so bad.
---
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
---
I can’t no life the game if I have a life. I’m gonna want to dump a lot of hours into the game whether I plan on managing my time played or not. I won’t have the time to get hooked on the game like that, so I probably won’t play.
---
I got a random guy in my guild to buy me cigarettes as a 17 year old. He was chill and we played together, but never interacted outside the Azeroth again after that.
---
im not really fond of any vanilla class so i was going to roll paladin/shaman/druid in hopes of future expansions regardless
---
No you wouldn't expect the same problem.  
---
The issue is that everyone starts in Valley of Trials (or the other race equivalent) as soon as they log in and create a character. 
---
When it comes to leveling out of Durotar, it wouldn't be remotely the same issue for several reasons.  First, people/classes level at different speeds.  Second, some people would spend extra time grinding in durotar for professions or otherwise.  etc.  
---
By the time you get to barrens (or westfall or wherever) the population will be distributed to a large degree.  But past the second area and it will be even more distributed, where people will choose different areas to level etc.
---
Will I see everyone on my server? No? Then the world will be empty. I dont think you know quite how large the world is. Playing in a shard or a phase or a hexagon or what ever word they want to use for it with a couple hundred people in it will be a ghost town. 
---
Simple solution release 1 authentic realm where people who enjoy the game for the game can play without any sharding at all, Then everyone else can have the other servers with tons of shards and stuff go mad have millions of them!
---
May want to read my comment that you replied to again. I have never said BfA was a good game. I believe that vanilla and BC are amazing games, since blizzard made those games, they have proven themselves capable of making great games. 
---
I look forward to classic, I hope you enjoy the game as well.
---
Not sure why they went with the old models tbh. : \
---
people will be fighting for every single quest mob. the amount of people who start raiding in 2 to 3 probable don't have to worry about getting ganked on their way to raids anyway. You're just looking for an excuse to be angry.
---
My body is ready
---
Ah, the daily "what happens after Naxx?" thread has arrived. We don't know.
---
Vanilla can create lasting appeal in their fresh new world. OSRS did it.
---
Sounds better.
---
why what? why i prefer tbc/wrath over vanilla?
---
better class design, better gameplay because of that, arenas etc.
---
u better be ready to quit when phase 2 rolls around to make room for them to remove layers cause im not moving
---
I actually think it would be dope as fuck if we could have some sort of alternate timeline series bridging from classic WoW- I don't have a lot of faith they could pull it off, though.
---
Right... that's my point. If private server engineers can create a system where 10k players can connect with bi-daily crashes and occasional lag spikes, why can't Blizzard create a more elegant solution with the same basics?
---
&gt;This is the unfortunate reality. 
---
The unfortunate reality is that you're letting people whos job it is to problem solve without affecting your experience change that experience. I don't know why you're throwing your hands up and going "well, I can't think of anything better, so great job!" when it's not your job to think of those things.
---
&gt;Pservers don't have to deal with the amount of playerinflux we will see at launch nor with the innevitable substantial drop after a few weeks.
---
Okay, well, I can tell you've never played on a private server for the first couple of weeks, then.
---
Theres so much stuff to do in vanilla, dont worry
---
&gt;you could end up with an overpopulated server
---
yes, and as i wrote before, im excited to see how they deal with it? Maybe increase the server cap temporarily?  
---
Also youre mentioning phase1 as definitive end of all phasings, which isnt true. As far as we know as lot of phasing will end before phase2 comes into play. So they just have to pick a layer-cap for which they are confident will be at around the original server cap shortly after.  
---
&gt; Without layering, you're going to suffer queue times for the first month or so, but that forces you to roll on the other server options   
---
  
---
Yes and without layering the first servers will have a really big drop in population 1-2 weeks in and we got a handfull of halffull servers which then get partly merged. One can only imagine the rage if your server remains half-empty and the other servers get merged.  
---
Both solutions have their ups and downs, i think the subjective implications of layer-switching are that keyfactor that decides which option one prefers. I think blizzard will try to make on-purpose layer-switching as inconvienent as they can
---
Because the new models look like junk, and don't belong in Classic.
---
yeah personally i never thought it would last for longer then two months, i was just saying that they confirmed that it wont exist past phase one
---
Just like it was only in starting zones to deal with people being in starting zones. 
---
Next week sharding maybe forever? Who knows!?
---
Was just curious if Blizzard said anything about it.
---
Why can’t a good game just be a good game?
---
Why can’t people understand WoW Classic was the game that launched the rest of the franchise?
---
It’s a good game; chill.
---
It invalidates 100% of the content on the ground below you. That's exactly why it's trash. 
---
&gt;Stay in Vanilla then. Flying is amazing.
---
sTaY iN rEtAiL tHeN
---
TL;DR - I want my ivory raptor Blizz!
---
&gt; I'm very concerned about the instance resetting
---
?!
---
Either way, we’re going home
---
Blizzard is not going to have two teams devoted to making two brand new expansions. If anything comes out after Vanilla, it will be BC just as they have said before.
---
Honestly, I'm not sure it's worth re-releasing anything past wrath.
---
Depends on what you find fun. Classic is a slower, more methodical game that focuses on tactical group play and medium-term resource management compared to the current retail version, which focuses much more on fast reflexes, short-term spatial awareness, and short-term/no resource management. 
---
But nostalgia is a cop-out "argument"; Almost everyone who's been playing on, erm, unofficial servers can attest to that. In fact, one of the most common reactions from people who came from retail *to* those servers is astonishment over just how engrossing "olden WoW" still is.
---
Do you still need 20 seconds to logout?
---
But not better than no sharding.
---
I liked the video.
---
Point tho: Varrak played his speedrun on a server with incorrect quest XP using older Mangos values.
---
- Varrak turning in Wastewander Justice: 5,000xp
---
- Wastewander Justice official: 3,600
---
Quests 30-60 grant something like 40% more xp. Normalized, I doubt his time would be much of an improvement over Joana's original time (and Joana just did a new 3 day 22 hour using legit OG XP values) 5 days is still a fine time.
---
Hate to be that guy, but you got the format wrong. Original is “throw? No take! Only throw”
---
So it should be “Sub? No play! Only sub”
---
I doubt they force a move.
---
Ion said a month
---
I did the same thing you did, strange a lot of people don't understand that you'll be playing immediately upon release. I live in EST so starting with the 27th was an obvious choice. 
---
Skate out a little early on the 26th, stop and get some supplies from the store, disappear from existence for a week, and so on.
---
You know, it wouldn't be a classic experience without all the server trouble during the first week or so. Hope you took that into account.
---
Yeah, why specifically do you prefer TBC/WoTLK? What expansion did you start during?
---
August is the coldest part of the year where I live. It’s a good month for a release.
---
I like alchemy for warriors because you can easily always have the buffs up which supplement you way better than bs whetstones or so. Also the healing potions will often save your Life and dying is smth very common for warriors sadly
---
Over time they realize how aids it is to play Druid and to not be able to talk to npcs while shapeshifted
---
Before then #nochanges cuz little qol things like this are ezscape, I mean retail
---
I don't think you fully understand what the difference between the two will be. 
---
You've been to school, right? Imagine having your entire school go  to lunch at the same time, but only one line. Sounds like a bad time right? 
---
Now imagine if they open up ***two*** lines. The process of getting people in and out increases by 50% but there's still a lot of people. 
---
Now imagine if they broke the students into different time blocks, AND kept the two lunch lines. Things would go much smoother, especially if the school is planning for a lot of those new students to drop out later on. 
---
When that happens they can readjust the schedule to make it easier for everyone. 
---
You don't go with the first option because "that's how they did it when I was a kid" isn't a good reason. Especially when you have the advance technology of a second lunch line and scheduling robots.
---
I know right? It's like maybe the first week will be really bad and you won't get to play a lot or leveling will be slow. But it is completely worth having no changing. I cannot believe people are defending this large form of sharding called "Layering".
---
&gt;Im not the one thinking people are gonna be following me ruining my gaming experience...
---
Please point exactly to one of my comments to the specific place where I claimed that people would follow me.
---
blizzard has said in the past that they dont want to focus on more then one mmo, so theres not much of a chance of getting newly created expansions for post vanilla. and personally i just want BC and LK back rather then taking a risk on them getting a new expansion right rather then messing it up like they have for the past few expansions. granted the "new" expansions would be designed with a different mindset and philosophy i still dont wanna risk it when we know we could get something amazing with BC and LK.
---
Who said anything about it being "good"???
---
The main hook of an MMO are updates and content additions.
---
Halo 2 is fun but I don't play it for 10  hours a week anymore.
---
[This is Ion literally today, literally declaring in no uncertain terms that there will not, cannot, and must not be layering after phase two because of World Bosses.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236) They rejected the sharding option because it was antithetical to the Classic experience to have people blink in and out of existence, and they developed it specifically to maintain session cohesion and alleviate player complaints about sharding. It wasn't because it was "more convenient for them". They've invented a new server technology specifically and only for Classic that took *more* work and *more* manpower to maintain as best they can a Vanilla experience.
---
"We will collapse down, I *promise* we will do this, a few weeks in to a single world per realm. No sharding, none of that going forward. We know that needs to happen before we do something like turn on the world bosses for example, when we have Kazzak and Azuregos. There *needs* to be only one Kazzak ever. If the entire server wants to fight over it and kill each other for five hours, that's what they should do. The answer can *never* be, "Oh we'll just have a second Kazzak." If we do that, it's not Classic."
---
Most games don't require hundreds of hours to reach end game.
---
I work for myself, so I plan on working as little as possible for a week or so.
---
&gt; which would be 100% guaranteed
---
It's thinking like this that caused Blizzard to be caught with their pants down when millions more people wanted to play their new game than anticipated, fucking up the game's launch completely. No real reason to assume the population on day 90 will be lower than the population on day 3, there's many good reasons to assume to opposite really.
---
Apart from new level 60 content, if Classic REALLY takes off, it might be an opportunity for Blizzard to fork the entire product roadmap, this time going down a more hardcore path, appealing to what makes Classic fans prefer it over retail. I've been thinking this will be a pretty huge hit, and building alternate expansions seems like the best possible scenario.
---
Literally the only one worth having. Maybe the saber. The rest are indistinguishable from the level 40 mounts for me.
---
Lol no. 
---
Cool idea...
---
I even thought it would make sense for them to do rolling servers.
---
Upgrade classic servers to TBC
---
Release new vanilla servers. 
---
And just keep it rerolling
---
Not really. Sharding is what happens when a zone on a server gets too full. They add new instances in that zone or area to reduce the load.
---
The result is that at least for me, I was never able to see any guildies and friends in the capital or out in zones unless I was in a party with them. Which sucks.
---
You don't actually see people from other realms. That's something else called cross-realm zones. And that only happens in older expansions to make them feel less dead.
---
So, doesn't that mean Layers is just completely the same thing as sharding? 
---
At least they said they won't use it in the long run, just at launch to reduce the lag.
---
Have a fall shutdown in the oil patch that starts late August.  Probably a 2 month job at least, on 12-13 hour days (up to 15 including travel).  There goes any plans of getting a head start on the path to 60.  Worst part is I’m free all summer... 
---
soon as it releases I have about zero time to play as I need at least 6 hours of sleep to function.
---
Literally could not have asked for a worse release date.  (For me personally anyways)
---
can we add cross realm dungeon finder too? i've been looking for a tank for 30 mins now and I'm tired of waiting
---
Thats cuz asmons cult follows him around everywhere he goes
---
Its hard to imagine without actually playing Vanilla, but in my experience Classic WoW will offer something which was slowly taken from yours over the years. Although the content is very easy and you know everything already it still has a remarkable replayability through the forced socialization imo!
---
Amazon.de has these in stock now btw.
---
ik im hyped, i get multple "going homes" since halo is releasing on PC this year as well, and idk which im more excited about
---
You missunderstand. Read the entire comment I made. It isn't sharding - you're still on the same server. It's a shared population of a single primary server. The additional servers cease use as the population diminishes. This way, there is no need for merging servers later in-game as populations dwindle. This means you don't destroy AH economy. This means you don't have an annoying server-name that is no longer in use attached to your characters name in-game.  This means you don't have annoying server transfers, where you lose half your friendlist as people go different ways and you lose track of who is who.  
---
You want a server community, but prevent it from dying? This is LITERALLY how you do that...
---
Nobody needs to move, because the server stresses that necessitate layering will be gone by then. Dear god, people are so fucking hysterical about this.
---
&gt;Ion said 1 to 2 weeks max and then never again
---
Just like he said starting zones only huh....
---
Just like he said warts and all huh...
---
LFG grinding Finaldo wife rep
---
It's supposed to be a remake of a great game, not a fresh slate of wow. We want the old game play back, not to start over and get up to BFA again.
---
But I really want Tbc :(. Especially tbc shadow priest.
---
the game has had a lasting appeal for the last 15 years, its not going to get old anytime soon
---
oh for sure
---
Reddit is a circle jerk of cry babies 
---
OMG NO DRUIDS CANT TALK TO NPCS WHILE SHAPESHIFTED, EXPERIENCE RUINED
---
I’d rather take this than 2+ hour wait queues and constant server crashes.
---
You won’t even notice they layering going on.
---
&gt;can't even match what some basement dwelling nerds reverse engineered?
---
I'm having the biggest issue with this part of your post. In "Real" wow, kalimdor and EK are whole seamless instances; in private servers, they just chopped up every single zone into their own instance. I've played on pservers upwards of 8 years and hosting 14k concurrent players in a single server is not a matter of: "Can we do it?" But rather "Should we do it?".  Every time there's a "FRESH" server you had better just accept that you're not gonna play for 3 weeks or skip half the quests just to squeeze by. (Don't even THINK about getting that elite quest in redridge done btw)
---
Pservers often opt for as few servers as possible for a host of reasons including things like server companies refusing and massive upkeep costs from donations only.
---
Dumb as  fuck
---
It's been hard not listening to that leaked song on youtube. I want to hear the whole album for the first time.
---
New models are total garbage.
---
When we started playing there wasn’t any “future content” we just played the game and were happy when we got patches.
---
Because it's classic WoW.
---
Rogues actually aren’t bad for gold. Pickpocket runs are decent, can also stealth to chests in instances. Not as good as the top 3 of lock/hunter/mage but they aren’t bad at all.
---
"You think you want it, you really don't." -blizzard 
---
How's that turning out
---
all the expansions up until BFA have been learning experiences. there is no if ands or buts about it.
---
At the very least they could re-release BC-BFA with all bad additions deleted.
---
imagine the old armour on the new models.
---
Perfect, plenty of time to eat a big lunch before popping an Adderall
---
Is there a source where they ever made such statements? It seems more like this sub agreed over the months that that was how they would do it.
---
You saying that brought back some memories. Especially when me and friends server jumped to Gilneas. Good ol' Nics and Casually Addicted. We were never part of CA, but still some good times..
---
"No end game."
---
"Please add more end game."
---
"BC/WoTLK/Cata/MoP/WoD/Leg/BFA end game is shallow/short/grindy/boring".
---
well i answered
---
and i started in late vanilla, about 3 months till TBC release
---
Actually they said phase 1, which can be months long.
---
The unarmormed epic mounts aren't that appealing to most, and if it adds some flavor and diversity that a select few who would rush to 60 and farm up the gold anyways get a unique mount, they should add them in
---
idk why you would think that, subs never dropped in vanilla
---
So wait until launch.
---
February 31st, 2024
---
No Ion literally says it's temporary and that by the time World Bosses launch there will be one united server and no more layering. It's basically to stop overcrowding on servers from modern WoW "tourists" who are just going to be there for a few weeks.
---
That’s my birthday! Haha!
---
We already have that now on live lol. 
---
None of the old models have updated armor either. I still rock Tier 2 on my paladin.
---
As if people wont be controlling farm spots without layering.
---
I can't believe how many people I've seen complaining about the sharding (between the same realm!). How in any way would that be a bad thing? They're trying to give it a smooth launch, not to mention they said at the absolute latest they're going to get rid of it at the end of phase 1. The argument that it's not the classic experience is also not relevant because that's such a small sample size from people who actually liked it being so overly populated you to wait to kill a boar.
---
Omg that was my absolute favorite BC raid. I would nut
---
people with knowledge from pservers will dominate the servers in 2-3 weeks and farming resources and rare spawns and because of probably 3-5 layers in a server now they can do it 3-5 times than the normal amount. And thus dominating the server more and thats what people want right. When I adress this issue I am the one looking for an excuse for being angry while you are going ape shit just because we will have a 1 week queue that won't even last 1 hour.
---
Well what specifically about class design do you think was better? I just want to understand mate.
---
Only people that play WoW retail care about those mounts.
---
No one from original vanilla cared that anyone had them. They only became a thing because the mount / pet / collectable system became a thing.
---
It's an utterly moot point.
---
I left after downing Arthus in WoTLK. Came back for Legion, but left before the end - all that drug-addict craving I had left as I realized what a stale shell of a game WoW had become.
---
When I learned about classic I started saving for a new PC. I hit $1k the other week and my body is so goddamned ready to 40 man MC in fucking strat blues. Resto druid since 2014 and I cant wait to bring her back yet again
---
I enjoy my easier rank 14 ofc
---
non wow player here from r/all .. can someone explain?
---
Most people will never clear naxx unless it heavily gets nurfed there is no need for “what’s after naxx” because we will prob get a BC server
---
Wrong
---
Ah, so are you also against them potentially adding new content that wasn't in Classic WoW too?
---
This isnt dark souls. Some looking up is good, like checking where dungeon qs are or weapon trainers, mundane things like that that dont really spoil anything to the experience
---
That’s a terrible idea. You absolutely ruin server identity when you merge realms. Layered servers will at least have some semblance of community. Consider it loosely linked, pre-merged realms.
---
I'll believe it when I see it.  Blizzard has not delivered on too many things for me to just take their word for it.
---
Well, can't argue with opinions.
---
People will phase in and out based off getting group invites though. Someone I'm trying to kill could have a friend on a different shard invite them and they disappear in front of me. People could also get invited and phase in near the guy I am ganking gang gank me. The problem is shards are able to be manipulated by the players via group invites. The new meta for finding mobs or items for your quest is having friends invite you to check other shards. The shit has no place in vanilla wow.

---
It started as "starting zones at launch" and has already progressed to until p2. They are obviously assuming the populations will go down enough that they won't need "layering" anymore by phase 2. What happens when a super high pop server that is regularly at 3-5 layers doesn't die down and p2 hits.
---
Layering doesn't fix the starter zone problem since you will still have 3k people on one continent, about 900 humans in Northshire when it launches.
---
When your game is so old you can make money by literally re-releasing it.
---
Were you there 15 years ago? I was...it was fucking awful. Only reason I could get through it was because I was 14. I have maybe 2 hours to play a day and cannot spend it in a queue. This doesn’t add the fact that multiple servers went down for hours.
---
Do whatever you want blizzard to keep the servers running. I’m not experiencing that crap again!
---
Yes I did address this in my post. I'd say they should turn retail/modern into a infinite type structure like Diablo 3 and then focus on the progression of the classic. An option is to delete all the bad additions from the expansions before re-releasing them. How do you like that?
---
I mean, I can see that argument, but I never really had an issue with dynamic spawns on [redacted] or [redacted].
---
its completely different. come phase 2 ill be doing ubrs with tons of people i never had the chance to meet while leveling.
---
But he also said sharding only in starting zones. That didn't happen.
---
He said the game would come warts and all. That didn't happen. 
---
Iv already given up. Set the goalposts back just a bit each time. 
---
Well sharding for the entirety of the game guys come on its great!
---
Aw shit, this is waking some memories.
---
I get what you are saying but when you say it like that it sounds like you are thinking the blizzard that make vanilla a decade ago is the same blizzard that made BFA.
---
If they didn't raise the level cap for one expansion it would reduce the development time SOOOO MUCH.
---
Cya
---
more abilities, better designed abilities, better balance, better synergy between classes(both allies and enemies), better pvp system with resilience gear etc.
---
... because its classic?
---
For both legion and bfa i was logged on when it launched, leveled to cap and logged off. In one sitting.
---
not really, if they eventually decide to launch TBC i have enough time to level a toon for it
---
Why? Literally every other profession works all year. Because they have to deal with life the same as everyone else?
---
ur dads gay
---
No, it hasn't "already progressed until P2", and the mere fact that you're saying this means you haven't been listening to the devs. They ideally don't even want it to be around for a single month, let alone an entire phase. They've merely stated that in the worst case scenario, they must necessarily nuke it before P2, but that's most likely not going to happen.
---
That's why no one is going to play the new Final Fantasy 7 Remake then huh.
---
Thats just entirely different
---
For a livin
---
They could try not increasing level cap...that would increase dev time...
---
I was 13 when wow hit. I begged for it that Christmas and it wasnt long (by vanilla standards before I was 60).
---
Our server was the PAA server and had, strangely, a strong oceanic presence. I joined a guild - Insane Kitties - who raided at like 11pm est to 4am est. I woke up and snuck raids for a couple months - destroying my health and grades during that time. Once I got decently geared I switched to an EST guild. But I'll always remember my first MC firing up at like midnight - I even snuck some rum from the liquor cabinet and drank it neat and almost barfed. Good times.
---
You wont stay past week number 2, Calling it now. 
---
Thats the problem you are trying to ruin the game before its even out with all these horrible horrible changes.
---
As long as it’s not ret paladin.
---
Can you imagine you are in a big world PVP battle, and you message your friend for him or her to invite you so you can PVP together in this spontaneous event....  and all of a sudden you transfer layers and miss it all? Doesn't sound like vanilla to me.
---
Depends a lot on your server. I myself was logged on when BFA launched, accepted the start quest and leveled to 120 without an issue.

Vanilla wasn't just any game.  It was the mmo formula done right.  With the updated graphics engine it will feel new to anyone who hasn't played it before.  It wont feel aged.
---
Hunter &amp; mage are the best
---
Okee dokee. Keep making up insane bullshit instead of listening to developers, like everyone else shrieking about an ultimately minuscule stopgap measure put in place to prevent 2000-person server queues.
---
lol Adam from cumtwon as a pally
---
It truely is the best solution we could have hoped for. 
---
- Smooth launch? Hell yeah
---
- Dead and imbalanced servers after 1 month? No, sir!
---
- Keeping the authentic feel while dealing with these two problems? Lok'tar o'gar.
---
Levelling as a Holy Priest is one of the hardest things I've ever done in Classic WoW :S, but it was hilarious when a level 60 Warlock couldn't kill me as he was ganking a lowbie in STV XD(I was heading to ZG). Proud Holy Priest memory :3.
---
Why not just “layer” the starting zones then?
---
Now i know you're a complete fucking retard with that statement
---
&gt;aggressive merging
---
No...you’re talking about altering the very community of a server based on population. Instantly the top guild is the four best because you just merged a server with theirs.
---
Deal with layering for a month or so and get over it. It makes much more sense in the long run.
---
I'll be honest, I think they've earned some trust.
---
Everything they say and do seems to be well thought out and they are sticking to their vision of classic being one that as close as possible replicates vanilla.
---
How is that entirely different? 
---
You either want to keep things, "because it's classic WoW", or you don't. 
---
Apparently you're willing to make some exceptions.
---
Is this your first time on this sub?
---
Can still be used to exploit rare mats and mobs. Jump around the 5 or 6 shards getting all the black lotus, Crash the economy day 5.
---
Blizzard is already done with all of the lying they were planning on doing to their playerbase.  They won't be lying any more to us.
---
There are many people who believe that flying mounts are the worst thing to ever happen to WoW.
---
None of the revelations today deters me from the game. The shitty community does tho. You people are impossible to please and look incredible ignorant.
---
What if you just want to have fun and do world PVP... even if not for HKs. Let's say there is a huge battle and your friend invites you to a group to join and all of a sudden you phase to a different layer... How is it supposed to work?
---
So is it "phase 1" or "a few weeks" ? Based on my own personal experience, I don't think it will take more than 2-3 weeks for the crowds to disperse, so having it for the entirety of phase 1 seemed excessive.
---
Prot paladin has more issues I'd argue. Their emphasis on block is kind of a big gripe because blocking reduces damage by a static amount, which is not that helpful against boss swings. They take a lot of damage.
---
To be fair, they've changed their minds on this a few times e.g. originally planning on sharding only in early zones. It's not unfair to doubt them to a small degree.
---
the biggest issue really with layering assuming it will ”port” everyone in a group to the same layer (which it should or it would be really weird) is that it disfavors solo players as the group players will possibly split into 2 different layers and you will be able to pick and choose (you want to play in the layer with the least enemies/most mobs up so your friend invites you over) but you are stuck in the one you are assigned to
---
No, not at all. It will just be nice to have a time-frame known to have a lot less of the 'under 18' crowd.
---
I don't know why, but the global population seems to forget that a LOT of the toxicity that exists on the internet today could be (and very likely is) from a significant percentage of under age humans. I'm sure I was one of them back in the 90s, talking smack on IRC, although probably relatively tame by today's standards. And I don't even blame them .. that's part of being a kid. You grow out of it, mostly. To that end, I'd like to think it will be a little tamer during weekdays because of school.
---
I played Albion online about a month ago and it was awful. So many players in a small area that I barely even knew who was an NPC or player.
---
Was not a fun experience.
---
I wish I experienced that in Vanilla, but I spent most of my time in a queue or watching the server crash.
---
So by not answering you're suggesting that you will play the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, even though it's not the "old models". 
---
And that the old game is easily available. 
---
But what's the difference? :|
---
They started the name reservation is to gauge some idea of expected player count to give them time to get servers setup. The require an active account to reserve names because they want to know people are serious before investing in servers.
---
I fully intended to go into Classic as a Feral Druid with leatherworking and engineering with a Warlock alt for mining and herbing just so if TBC Classic became a thing I could drop engineering for jewelcrafting.
---
Your minimum range is 292 days of pure gameplay. I like the way you think.
---
Im not making exceptions for anything because im not nochanges lol, im just stating that adding new content on to a game is different than changing what the game is.
---
There is 100% of the characters on the server.
---
There is 100% of the resources on the server.
---
For each additional layer, there is another +100% of the resources.
---
So in reality, there is going to be 3x the amount of resources available. That means everyone is going to have to pay / farm 1/3rd the amount they should for whatever they want.
---
This is exactly what the game has turned into now, and why it is terrible. You won't have to earn whatever you get.
---
Oh holy shit, just realized what phase 1 means... Fuck is that ever disappointing! I figured it was going to be opening weekend, maybe a week tops. TONS of people are going to hit 60 before phase 1 ends. Just gives the no lifers an extra leg up they don't need. And don't get me started on how broken the economy will be...
---
What I'd give to relive all those memories in classic... As I make my transition to medical school, I wish you all the best phat loot.
---
Potentially you can *add* sidegrades via resistances etc. Gear that's roughly par with Naxx or whatever for raw power but has the resistances you'd need to run content in X area and progress in Y raids. Gear from there could open up content in other areas and so forth, branching out.
---
You could potentially do a sort of catch-up this way years down the line when not many people are freshly going through the original raids(as Naxx could be a rough "starting point" for a Classic+. Add new content that adds gear suited the content that leads into the newest stuff so you can try and have at least the newest 2-3 "tiers" be relevant instead of just the current raid being all that matters.
---
There will not be 5 or 6 shards, considering each one holds 3000 players concurrently.
---
Wait for the stress tests after this we will get more informations.
---
Even still, it progressed from starting zones to the whole world, including BRM and Un'goro devilsaur, and black lotus zones. At blizzcon he said he understood the importance of limited resources and fighting for those spawns and not having phasing past starting zones at launch. I don't know why you are SO SURE they won't go back on their word again.
---
ehh idk if its the worst but it definitely wasnt good for the game, even blizzard has said that they regret adding them lol
---
LITERALLY LITERALLY LITERALLY
---
...with updates and expansions.
---
Because that's what these people want. If it doesn't take you 4 hours to get to level 10 then you're doing it wrong. It'll be a slap in the face for many of these people when they realize they don't have the time to play that way when they did back when they were kids.
---
Burning Crusade was an amazing expansion, I have no idea what you're talking about. A lot of people even liked it more than Vanilla (obviously that's opinionated). Not saying we ever have to have a BC re-release or follow up to Classic, but it was a great xpac.
---
Classicast + Towelliee are cancerous to the classic community
---
I feel like that'd get grating fast, lol.
---
there will be day 1 addons to invite people just like the cross realm thing in legion and you don't have to meet up with the guy to know you are on the same layer the moment you switched layer people/mobs will disappear.
---
The path to BFA was created with well intentioned ideas that had negative effects on the community elements.
---
Devs can wreck things by not foreseeing possible outcomes.
---
I'm not sure how I feel about layering, but I certainly understand why people who want community are concerned.
---
I hope you find this a satisfactory answer.
---
The population will spread out as time goes on though. You’ll have major hubs like Org, IF, etc...but the population will be fairly spread out a month in. 
---
On release you’re talking about 12k players sitting in the starting zones right when the server goes live.
---
RIP that server right when it’s turned on!
---
Don't forget your Chipotle-be-gone
---
But it doesn't matter that there is another 200 percent of the resources because you won't be on the other 2 layers? That doesn't make any sense. 
---
And if you think that's why the game the terrible now, I'm convinced you haven't been playing recently.
---
... it did. But initially! It was awesome.
---
I havent played video games in over a year and I haven't played wow since 2007.
---
I 100% will be following the forums just to laugh at the tidal wave of morons complaining about literally every aspect of the game. It is gonna be great.
---
no people have been playing VANILLA for almost 15 years, and those people are the reason were getting classic. vanilla private servers have been around since BC came out.
---
because ion said so
---
Well thank god you're not playing then huh
---
&gt;yes, and as i wrote before, im excited to see how they deal with it? Maybe increase the server cap temporarily?
---
Lol so why cant that "maybe increase server cap" be applied to the 2nd idea? That way you can avoid queue times AND avoid phasing in and out of layers, WITH the possibility of merging into another server should your server die. Best solution.
---
&gt;As far as we know as lot of phasing will end before phase2 comes into play. So they just have to pick a layer-cap for which they are confident will be at around the original server cap shortly after.
---
What does this even mean? "alot of phasings will end before phase 2"? what are you talking about?
---
They said there will be no layering after phase 1 - and I just laid out to you that's a straight fallacy as if you end up on an overpopulated server due to the layering idea, you're either going to suffer very long queue times OR layering will persist (which means layering after phase 1 won't exist - is a lie).
---
&gt;Yes and without layering the first servers will have a really big drop in population 1-2 weeks in and we got a handfull of halffull servers which then get partly merged. One can only imagine the rage if your server remains half-empty and the other servers get merged.
---
Again your response is rather illogical. If you end up on a half full server then that is by no means a dead server. It's a medium populated server. if you end up on a very low dead server after phase 1 then it gets merged to either A or B of the same realm name. Where is the problem in that?
---
Layering was not a well-thought out solution there is no dancing around it.
---
&gt; BG queues for gank avoidance
---
Like queue at a major city, Leave hope the queue dosn't pop then hope to god it pops within 60 seconds of being ganked? Only to have to go back to a major city to queue again? I mean I guess its technically possible. 
---
&gt; Rare mob farming (they were usually up on all but a few highly populated servers)
---
Yup, Now you will kill the one thats up then jump to another shard kill that one again then  jump again to another shard kill that one etc etc. 
---
&gt; Node farming isn't even worth your time if you know what you are doing.
---
Same with the rare mobs. The very rare herbs that are used to make flasks will just be all over the place.
---
&gt;  im just stating that adding new content on to a game is different than changing what the game is.
---
Yet the model doesn't actually change anything to the game itself. It's purely atheistic. 
---
Whereas adding new content literally changes the game from what it was. 
---
Because that new content has gear, effects (from trinkets,etc), and events that literally change how you approach the game which is different than "classic".
---
Basically what I am saying is that your two positions are not consistent. 
---
You can't both be, "No new models because we have to keep classic as it was" and then turn around and say "adding new content is OK."
---
Well, sharding solves both problems - so I think its a least worth comparing the two.
---
It's probably nostalgia talking, but beating the Lich King in Wrath was probably the best moment in WoW for  me. The fight is great, the cinematic is awesome, and we landed the kill - finally, I came back late in expansion and pugged - about 30 minutes before Cata launched. The time pressure made it even more epic and I'll always remember how awed I was by the whole experience.
---
Luckily our vacation is the week before. I was worried.
---
They should make the layers semi permanent. Like if I log onto server A layer 3 on day 1, for the rest of the layering days I’m a A3. 
---
They would make chat channels and AHs layer permeable.
---
And make it so if you join a group you go to leaders layer. 
---
If your layer dies off early from too many tourists—well you’re on a low pop layer till blizzard ditches the system.
---
But you can still trade and group with people.
---
Admittedly, most leveling groups form in /s /y not /1, so that’d be different dynamic. 
---
The big threat is haphazardly changing layers. I don’t want to run into nesingearys and switch layers.
---
I played with swords vanilla/TBC/wotlk and I wanna try daggers this time including leveling. I don't care about getting to 60 as quickly as possible. The final talent tree is intended to be a raiding spec, yeah.
---
I was actually wondering if I would have to evis. to dump combo points if I already have SnD up - I never PvE'd with daggers and I'm not sure what my rhythm will be like. Maybe do the Assass. points last when I am close to level cap and have a better idea.
---
Dude no offence, it’s great and all that wow is going to help you fight depression but you NEED to get outside. Exercise, eat healthy, meet new people. This has what has helped me. You are only ignoring the underlying problems by playing video games expecting them to solve your real life issues. 
---
I’ve been there man and yeah it’s great in the short term but horrible in the long term. Do these things side by side and you will make a slow but steady recovery !
---
Check the name. Boys from the future. He has seen classic start and fail and is here to make sure the timeline does not change.
---
Agreed on the speculation, is why I haven’t thought too hard or posted much on the subject. I wouldn’t mind seeing some of the class balances they’d planned for vanilla but delayed till TBC, and some content/gear to go along with existing gear. But it’s a topic for a year or two, when we see if Classic maintains a user base to support extra development (and enough interest in Classic+ vs TBC). I think there will be enough for some further extension of Classic, and the debate will rage on then.
---
once the semesters over youll be glad you were there to play, youll be able to do a bunch of dungeons and parting with others leveling at your pace itll still be fun bro dw
---
Yeah baby! Me too!
---
They didn't definitively say the entire phase, they said only phase one, which means it could last one week before they disable layering on a particular realm.
---
Fuck seeing your grandkids, amiright?
---
Might as well go single since the game is gonna take over your life! I think I am!!! Heh
---
Their only statements about shedding I saw were possible solutions that they were still working out for a smooth launch. Sharding the starting zones was an example they used and what they did in the demo. They never set a firm stance on sharding.
---
A few skirmishes for sure but not large-scale. I did one time, but it was on a private server. It was kinda neat too cause I was one of the few 60s involved and so I felt a bit like a "hero class" or what have you.
---
P servers players cared (and still care) about those mounts cause for one reason or another they couldn't play retail vanilla until after they got removed, and so they'd like to have another chance in Classic.  
---
I see no issue with that tbh
---
I'm so disgusted with the "classic" community right now. It doesn't matter what you call it or how you justify it, this isn't faithful to vanilla. Characters are still going to disappear into thin air and you're still going to be separated from other players that should be right in-front of you. What a joke.
---
This isn't fucking Vanilla, premiering in an MMO void left open by dwindling EQ subs. It's Classic. It's not going to simply have a fresh assortment of casual players who've never once played WoW and have had no recourse to do so, but rather a combination of those players *and* other people who feel like checking out the scenery for a bit.
---
It's going to have tourists, mayflies, and prairie dogs galore. It's included for free with the BfA subscription. And *yes*, online server populations *absolutely* went down on a per capita basis after launch. Some went down massively, which is why Blizzard had so many dead servers that they needed to merge into others. Launch today will have *far* more people simultaneously playing on any given server than will any time after. You're going to have people jumping in and disappearing before 30, but you're also going to have dedicated players who took PTO for a week, yet won't be able to do so long-term. There's a difference between "max players on a server" and "players currently signed in on that server". Layering is in place to prevent problems with that second group.
---
I love Vanilla WoW. I've been dreaming about August for a decade. But I'd be a goddamned fool if I thought that somehow the crowd at launch day of the most hotly debated and hyped legacy server in the history of all video games was going to be smaller than the same crowd a month later. There *will* be die-off, and there *will* be players who stick around for a while but don't maintain the same playtime they did in the first few days.
---
Jesus, it's like someone saying that the opening line at Walmart on Black Friday is going to be the same typical Walmart crowd size in the second week of December. No. No it's not. Will there be people? Absolutely. It's Walmart, and Christmas is around the corner. But it won't approach the scale or mayhem of Black Friday. Likewise, Classic servers *will* have consistent and large playerbases for a while, but never as big or chaotic as the first few weeks of launch, before some of them either can no longer make the time commitment or decide not to. If the general Classic population increases over time, Blizzard will *make new servers*, not shove people onto existing high-pop ones.
---
The demo was just sharding....
---
They will log out and log back in getting assigned to a new layer.
---
I think the incentivizing people to rush is a poor excuse.  It wouldn’t influence my play style at all.  That said, I don’t really care one way or the other.
---
The fact is the game is meant to be an open world (not worlds) where players' actions affect and influence each other. Sharding (and really, instances as a whole; one of WoW's weaker points) limit this concept entirely. Without this, there is no point in playing an MMO for me.
---
Well, I think the goal has to be to balance server populations around 2-3k active players. Setting a hard cap is going to be difficult, in order to improve player experience as players quit or re-start on other servers. Especially as some folks will consider switching to other servers for various reasons (like streamers).  
---
This means layering at the start. I actually hope they will keep layering to maximize around 6-9k players on a given server (meaning one server and 2 slaves to handle the extra layers at start). But, I think a lot of that will be determined by the resources Blizzard has made available. There simply may not be enough primary servers to keep populations low at the start. And if they are figuring only, say 20% of the population will continue playing past phase 1, then they may want to boost those numbers up (that's completely arbitrary - I have no idea what they are expecting).  
---
Now, I HOPE they have more servers available. I HOPE they only layer enough for, say, 6k pop layered, which would HOPEFULLY dwindle down to 2-3k active pop after a couple months.  
---
But, there's of hope going on here. And it's not like Blizzard is selling the game - you simply activate a subscription. So the only real way they're going to get a solid estimate is by tracking how many people intend to play Classic is by Beta requests, and then when they open character creation two weeks before launch. It's not like they're going to simply set up 400 servers in hopes a million players log in on day one - they're going to want to have a rough idea of how many players will join, and then compare that with historical activity to determine approximately how many of those players will stay active through Phase 1.  
---
I think there is a TON of planning this decision going on behind the scenes, and so far, it looks like they're doing a really good job - I'm optimistic this will work out quite well.
---
I believe you just convinced me to re-sub. Damnit.
---
I get that, but it is a separate game from live. Which means they should be starting over and let everybody experience it entirely, to me that means providing a chance to get an item that was only obtainable when the original launched. Vanilla launch=chance to get item 
---
Classic launch=chance to get same item
---
Your kid will be over a year old then, practically self sufficient.
---
It is coming out in the summer.
---
thats why he wants classic?
---
I liked all your other videos a lot! But these last two are just complaining about the release date...
---
I think you are biased into liking BC/WoTLK because of when you joined. I think the things you just listed could be used to describe BFA NOW. Hell, even Legion, WoD, MoP, Cata all claim to improve what you mentioned.
---
"More abilities" ✔, "better designed abilities" ✔, "better balance" ✔, "better synergy between classes" ✔. 
---
You're entitled to your opinion and we just disagree. However, if you do have any specific arguments to why bc or wotlk were actually better we could argue more.
---
In fact, I would say WoTLK was the LEAST balanced expansion you mentioned. Death Knights were insanely overpowered at the beginning of Wrath.
---
WOW CLASSIC &amp; THEN THE NEW TOOL ALBUM 3 DAYS LATER HOLD FUCKING SHIT
---
Attorney here - I'm told we theoretically accrue vacation, but it's using it that's the issue...
---
at least some people get it.
---
I think you're underestimating the "inconvenience" of trying to level with literal thousands of people next to you. Even with layering you'll be hard competing for mobs, quest items, and gathering nodes. If the layering is a deal breaker for you, I think you might as well just not play at all because if it matters that much to you to hold on to that nostalgic experience from original classic, you will be sorely disappointed and a fool for expecting that much of a 1:1 recreation.
---
From what I can tell, is that they hope it's only 2 weeks but might need to be all of phase 1
---
True but I think it's kind of both because the piece of art showing in that pile of what looks like 3 pieces is the new Classic WoW wallpaper with the dwarf and benediction in the bottom right.  It's definitely not marketed as the Classic WoW collectors but I think it definitely has some Classic WoW flair on purpose
---
Bit of a different situation. They decided to go with a different approach to address complaints from the community about sharding. The new approach isn’t zone based so it can’t be applied to low level zones only. It will still be temporary. 
---
I don’t see how this could be a convenience decision. It’s not more convenient to develop a new sharding implementation months before launch instead of just using a system you’ve had in place for years in Retail.
---
Immersion broken lol
---
Adding BC and Wrath is the one thing Im a little upset about. BC is what initally made me lose interest in the game in the first place.
---
Not really. There will only ever be 2 layers on any server. A second layer is only formed after 3000 players.
---
There is no such thing as "nostalgia tripping", quality is forever.
---
There are millions of people still playing old games, watching old movies, old shows and listening to old records.
---
The nostalgia argument is just a lame zoomer attempt at dismissing a better game, because he is sour that he was not around to enjoy it. Retail players are absolutely seething that Classic is going to take a sizeable portion of Retail's playerbase.
---
Because there is a large expectation that there will be a lot of people that will come to experience the game that they played/never played, but don't like it due to the slower pace and higher difficulty compared to retail/modern games.  This is also anticipated since the sub for both Classic and Retail will be tied, so you will get even more people trying it out because it is, essentially, free for them.
---
This means we can expect a large initial spike with a large dropoff after the, sorry for the pun, "wow" factor has ended.  If the drop off is much smaller than anticipated, it is also possible that there will be additional servers added with free transfers, like there was during many points in WoW's lifespan.
---
Likely, yeah, and then the queues and free transfers start.
---
How do you expect Launch to be if there are 10 thousand people in the valley of trials trying to kill boars or wake peons?
---
With layered servers, you wouldn't have to worry about getting a 30 min queue...  
---
But I think again, current servers can handle upwards of 8k players. So if they keep layering only in Phase 1, and maximize population at 9k, then in Phase 2, even if 90% of players stay active (which is probably not going to happy), you'll still be able to log in and play - you'll just be on an overcrowded server.
---
&gt;How do you coordinate if you have 0 control over what layer you are on?
---
Log out, Wait 3-5 minutes for someone to log into your space on layer 1. Log in and boom you in layer 2. Repeat as you need.
---
They threw out the idea of sharding before they even began implementing the game. The biggest complaint they got was that it ruined the Vanilla experience by making people disappear before a player's eyes. So they came up with a new, proprietary feature that serves their intended goal *better*, causes almost no sporadic in-session phasing, and won't be needed after a month because the problem it's solving won't be there in a month.
---
I know they won't go back on their word because they never had a word. They didn't *promise* there would be sharding in starting zones. They suggested it as a possible workaround for launch crowds and got pushback, so they came up with something far better. Now the head dev is on camera saying "I promise this will never be permanent, and here's a clear and obvious in-game reason why I *must* keep my promise."
---
I'm sorry but that goes along the same lines as participation trophies for me lol. Give everyone the same opportunity as I had 15 years ago. 
---
I'd rather not have my pets in the game than have blizzard give them out again. 
---
My pets are already worthless and unnoticed 99% of the time in modern wow.
---
Great? It won't ever be able to be completely the same so the sooner you realize that the less disappointed you will be. This launch will be 10x the original one. If you don't understand that I don't know what to tell you
---
They don't want to incentivize poop-socking and I'm ok with that. Anyone who wants to poop-sock just to get some imaginary so-called "status symbol" needs to re-evaluate their life choices (and really no one will notice the mount, and after you explain it to people in your desperate attempt to at fame they will realize you're a poop-socker and avoid your filthy ass, the opposite effect that you intended)
---
So much salt in this thread after such a day of great news.
---
Really, even Blizz lol.....Ya I mean they cant just bring that back haha
---
Wouldn't it be an honorable discharge to play WoW?
---
&gt; applied to the 2nd idea?
---
what? u mean increasing the cap of the miniservers? because that wouldnt be a vanilla experience lol
---
youre just renaming the same few arguments over and over again. My response wasnt illogical, infact i summarized why we disagree, which basically is "i hate seeing solid miniservers more than i hate possible layer-switching exploits". ez.
---
Well the good thing about a launch is that its also over very quickly.
---
They wont though.
---
There really is no point in arguing with you. It's happening, and if you don't like it you can enjoy a private server. Your absence will probably even make the community less toxic.
---
Invite them? I wont know they exist.
---
hahaha holy shit
---
There’s only ever going to be a max of two layers.
---
Layering won't necessarily last an entire phase, just up to one phase. There's a chance they disable it early on select realms if necessary.
---
It's also why it's important to reserve names in advance, gives them some numbers to decide how many realms to start with.
---
People are going to do it just to figure it out.
---
Big mistake by Blizzard.  one of the best things about Classic was knowing who was on your server and building those relationships / rivalries.
---
Thanks for posting this. Now I’ll only be taking 3.5 days off that week.
---
I'm surprised there are so many university-age students posting here showing interest in wow classic. You guys must have been, what, 9 when the first expansion came out? 
---
I assumed most of the fanbase would be people who played vanilla (i.e. in their late 20's/30s now), and want to relive their "glory" days. Very cool to see other people excited who never actually played vanilla.
---
that isnt the main hook at all.
---
I play private servers religiously, have done so for years. playing vanilla.
---
Will do the same here.
---
Enjoy what you have rather than always looking for the next thrill dude, life is more fun then!
---
I thought this shit came out months ago
---
nice crop
---
Servers will be fine. Every recent WoW release has been smooth and plus Classic will have sharding during phase 1.
---
But that’s the thing, you had that opportunity and used it. Why does that apply to a new launch? The one you purchased is retail. The one I want to play is a new game called classic wow
---
Nope, 15 years later i still play mostly classic.
---
yeah because linking a name database to multiple servers isn't possible in 2019
---
Didnt know there was that many types of mountain dew
---
And look where that landed us at?
---
Have you seriously not learned anything? More end game content does not make the game better. BFA has technically endless content in the form of M+. Guess what, it fucking sucks. You are running in a hamster wheel to see numerical upgrades.
---
Quality over quantity.
---
a very fun part of actual Classic and pservers is getting to know the guilds on the other team, and their raid times. quite often some guilds would get together and ambush the other team on the way to the raid after they got all their worldbuffs. Huge scraps, lot of vendetta's
---
Splitting a server into 3 or 4 layers would mean a guild might never be able to do that reliably again. One day you log on, and you're on layer 3, and the enemy is on layer 4? Tough luck, no fun to be had. 
---
Maybe you can transfer layer? But the logistics of that with the entire guild is just annoying.  Maybe you need to find a guildie who has a friend on that layer who is online, and even then, how do you know which layer the enemy is on? They are all just sitting in town doing stuff before raid so unless you have other faction alt which costs another sub per month, not gonna happen.
---
That's just one part of the game it ruins. In addition to screwing up immersion and allowing people an easy escape from PvP, it opens the door to exploiting farming mobs, resources and rare spawns. 
---
I can't believe they actually went this route when the tech to just buy a few more server blades is so cheap
---
Imagine thinking a company doesnt want more money lol
---
I'd love a go at TBC again. I was such a newb in vanilla and didn't get above level 50. TBC was "hey, there's a new expansion out!" "what's that mean?" "Uhhh you get to make an elf?" The guy I was dating at the time went hard no-life into the game, so it soured me to it once we broke up (because he was ignoring me for the game!) and I didn't come back until late Wrath. My husband and I have a much healthier relationship than that mess and I would love to try it all over again from a better mindset/place in life.
---
&gt;It’s only gonna be there for phase 1
---
Just like it was only going to be there for starting zones yeah? Just like classic wow would not be changed and come with warts and all yeah? Blizzard are not above setting the goalposts back when they cant be asked to work.
---
The only other options are to never go past Naxx and stagnate there forever, or release TBC.
---
I found this thread from 6 months ago with a few sources, so you can draw your own conclusions about what they meant: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9tuwwg/demo_sharding_megathread/
---
I do find it funny that the top voted comment on that post is effectively describing "layering," albeit with the ability to choose your own layer.
---
you're
---
Cool so you dont know thx for admitting you're talking out your ass
---
"a few weeks" and "100% gone by P2" aren't mutually exclusive.
---
yeah theyve even said similar things about stuff like LFR and LFG, but its been in the game for too long for them to just remove it so were kinda stuck with it now
---
Do you actually believe this or are you trolling? You think there aren't large groups of jobless American no-lifers who will change their sleep schedules (or already have sleep schedules) to camp Devilsaur at certain hours?
---
This guide is legit amazing!
---
Lmao it was so bad I didnt even notice it at first
---
So then just dont have it? Dont take the risk of me not finding players if we are never going to experience it.
---
Absolutely.
---
it is interesting watching retail noobs trying to downvalue/underplay how excited people are about classic because they are jealous
---
A full vanilla server was around 5k, not 3k.
---
This means that there will only ever be two layers per server.
---
Si, chupa mi verga
---
LOL.
---
You realize I'm quoting the average live player, not myself right?
---
Nice triggering.
---
you should research more into what layering exactly is before posting :)
---
Ooh, I love it
---
&gt; Splitting a server into 3 or 4 layers would mean a guild might never be able to do that reliably again
---
"Never" is a bit of an overstatement. Bruh, for like 2 or 3 weeks.
---
August 13th they will open character creation. They also said the realm names will be announced by then.
---
So enough time to get plenty of sleep, keep up a social life and still make two level 60s following leveling guides. Wonderful. This is why nochanges is a thing.
---
Yeah bro fuck me for enjoying seeing a familler friendly face. Ill go back to having no players around me at any time now.
---
One would think that after all these expansions and all these years, hardcore players would learn that end game and min-maxing is the death of a MMO. You become enslaved to numbers and being "optimal" and you begin to treat the game as a task to be performed, rather than a game to be enjoyed.
---
If end game content made games great, then Retail WoW would be a hugely successful MMO. It is not. Players quit over the years, because the constant chase for min-maxing destroyed the game.
---
WoW players can tell you the most asinine detail about the game, all the rotations, and boss mechanics and name of gear, but few can understand the simple concept of *fun*.
---
Anyone got a link to Tips’ new deep delve into why they picked this date? 😂
---
It's not a new game. It's a re-released version of the same game. 
---
You had that opportunity 15 years ago as well. Unless you're only 14 years old. If you didnt have the money back then, then shit that sucks. If you didnt know about the game, then shit that sucks. Doesnt mean my stuff should be re-released because it's not fair to other people. You just dont re release exclusive content from 15 years ago because some people didnt get in, in time. 
---
That's like me saying hey Amazon, can you sell me your stock at 5 dollars a share because I didnt have the money back in the 90s and now I do have 5 dollars?
---
People just want to bitch. It’s the new hotness.
---
actually there are more people on the server which consume items so no, its not basically doubling the ressources?
---
It’s a bug.
---
Can't wait to go big dick
---
Dude let it go ... It was 15 years ago things have changed
---
It'd be interesting to see them try to expand the game through horizontal itemization as the way for them to "adjust" classes in a kind of minimum changes way. But I wonder if like in three years the no changes crowd might go "yeah maybe give balance druids some hit chance". I feel like the main argument against changes in a late game classic would be "if you want balance druids with hit talents, go to the tbc server".
---
Yes, literally. You're providing an old link of Ion spitballing of a potential future fix. I'm providing a contemporaneous interview of him promising his much better future fix will be temporary. I trust these words, arrived at after a year of further consideration and experimentation about how best to make the vanilla world cohesive, more than an on-the-spot kneejerk response referencing a preexisting server tech. The end result is the same, the philosophy (no duplicate Kazzaks) is the same, and the solution is more in line with Vanilla experience than the (and I quote from the video you linked) "antithetical to the concept of a cohesive Classic community" implementation of retail sharding.
---
I'd like a magical world where the server launches could go super smoothly, with no max end populations, no queue times, and enough beginner zone resources and mobs for everyone but also without the dynamic spawning of later expansions. But I'm not Professor Pangloss, and this isn't the best of all possible worlds. There must be some protocol in place to handle launch crowds and not result in dead servers a month later, and time-limited layering is a better solution than both time-limited sharding and obscene queue times.
---
Google's clock app allows you to use songs from Spotify.
---
Mine is June to January. I wasn’t going to win regardless.
---
blizz has said they are aiming to avoid players phasing. and its not a server group, its a layer within that realm only.
---
Something newish for me, I would roll a paladin (my old Main), but I ain't no Alliance scum, so I'm rolling tauren warrior on the GREATEST FACTION Azeroth has ever known, the Horde. Even if I caved in (which I wouldn't) and made my old pally main, I'd lose my focus and my mind dealing with the jumping pink-hair gnomes and dwarves and breakfast club night elves. It's just not me. Now I just have to wait 3 months for this game which is basically ready to ship out after this week, but they are making us wait in EXCRUCIATING PAIN
---
So glad I won’t be competing with students who have no jobs. At least in a dad stand point
---
There won’t be 3 layers and there certainly won’t be a server with 9k population.
---
Max pop in classic vanilla was 5k.
---
Hi, /u/Dunlocke
---
&gt; There’s only ever going to be a max of two layers.   
---
Can you give me a source on that? :)
---
Imagine if they were to do both for all the expansions. Classic with Kara, mount hyjal, etc. WOTLK with the Anub Arak zone. Just create the expansions with their cut content.
---
&gt;There’s only ever going to be a max of two layers.
---
Source?
---
So much shilling and stupidity in this thread.
---
This is terrible news and shows that Blizzard wants to shoehorn retail stuff into the game as soon as possible.
---
what? Legion and WoD had way fewer abilities than wrath and worse class design than wrath/cata/mop.. also i didnt specify that i'd play cata/mop over vanilla as well..
---
also Wotlk was way more balanced than vanilla in every way.. and dks were only op in the beginning like you already said yourself 
---
im not biased into liking anything, i played and leveled to 60 in vanilla.. i played vanilla on private servers as well, i just prefer other expansions
---
Calm down mert
---
Ah well that sucks but atleast it’s not permanent
---
Decided to go visit family in another country for a week on the 27th RIIIIIIIP.
---
How many layers do you think there will be lmfao
---
Well Naxx isn't coming out for a long time to be sure. 
---
And if you're OK with adding new content aside from expansions, why would you be against new models? 
---
"Because it's classic WoW" looks contradictory. 
---
Which means you have some exceptions clearly.
---
&gt; If you want to keep crying and make a non issue into an issue, be my guest.
---
Nice gatekeeping, but it's not a non-issue. Being separated from players on the same server as you is a major issue and people are very justified in not wanting it. If you want to defend seeing people disappear like in retail, be my guest.
---
I know dara mactire was once setup as a company.
---
I wonder if i could get sued if i make that my guild when i make it lmfao
---
So if I play with my friend, and he gets placed on another layer, are we only gonna see each other if we party up?
---
Finally found a source for it, yeah tbh it doesnt seem like the end of the world. Not ideal obviously and there is room for exploiting if you coordinate with your guild, but not so badly that it outweighs the good
---
&gt;but that doesn't mean it will exist for all of phase 1
---
But it means it could, Hell they might not even take it out in the end since they have gone back on their word quite a bit so far. 
---
Im thinking ill sit classic out for half a year or so maybe, Possibly wait till the final phase so I can actually play with my server.
---
For me, it's a no. I'll never move on from Classic. I don't have any personal desire to play the Expansions. Once they added flying, it hurt my enjoyment of the game. I also didn't like how it basically made obsolete all the old raid gear. 
---
I would just roll an alt &amp; play a new character with new professions on the Classic server instead of moving to Burning Crusade.
---
That's a great story.
---
This is Parks and Recs
---
Us Australians always have the optimal time to play. 8:00AM start. Perfect.
---
Vanilla WoW is the only version of the game that I didn't quit at some point. Now that could be because the game and the MMO experience was new for me back then. Having tasted the game a bit on undocumented servers I didn't get same feeling as back then. I was 14 and confused back then. Now being an adult and feeling in control of the game was an awesome new experience.
---
Unfortunately it seems like you get put in different blocks and lines each time unless you're in the same guild/party so it cuts down on those "hey I remember that guy from my deadmines group and has a blast, maybe he wants to party up for this elite quest" moments that build friendships from seeing the same people again out in the world. 
---
But you're totally right about the huge chunk of kids dropping out that makes this necessary
---
Yes, i once got stuck between Tanaris and Ungoro.  
---
Wrote a ticket and after 10-15 minutes a female nightelf GM in a white robe ported to me and helped me out :)  
---
Still got some screenshots of that day on my old HDD i think, amazing memory! :)
---
And it was during the buggy launch where there was not even close to that many people on.
---
“Successful people”  still have voids to fill.
---
Yeah it’s bis cuz U can bandage as u gouge
---
You've missed the point.  The issue isn't about the number of people. It's about consistency and community.
---
Glad you asked! Old School Runescape. We WoWclassic fans share many qualities of those members of OSRS.
---
The reason we have classic is because of people like you who that just keeps asking for and defending these changes that ruin the most important elements of the game just  so you can have your own fun and ruining everyone elses experience. We finally get classic wow servers and you just come here to ruin it again. Btw I explain the reason why layering is bad and now I am suddenly a hater aren't I. Also thanks to you guys toxicity has lost it's meaning wow omg we have different opinions about something than you must be toxic and I am %100 percent right about everything because what you wrote hurt my feelings.
---
Yeah but her life was interesting by hiding from the Nazis. You're bitching about the release date of a video game that doesn't fit in to your schedule. Which you're trying to one-up everyone with because your life is so busy and awesome in healthcare. Yeah!!
---
North hemisphere is best hemisphere
---
There are 2 different types of fans of WoW. Those that enjoy the current version of WoW, we call this Retail. And then there are those fans that love what WoW used to be during it's heyday. We call these fans of Classic. For many years if a player wanted to have that Classic experience, they had to rely on private servers, one of the most popular of which was shut down. This server was known as Nostalrius. It was very close to the original experience, however not perfect. During the last Blizzcon, Blizzard announced that they were going to be releasing an official Classic experience. This is the release date announcement.
---
NO LOL, classic is about ti released. It's going to have none of it!
---
Cant be like that since they said people dont phase in and out of the world or at least thats what everyone tells me.
---
It looks like an unfinished meme
---
Ah shit. More content after naxx? Even shittier scaling as a hunter? Hmmmm....

---
Aug12/13, so effectively you gotta pay half a subscription in order to reserve up to 3 names (assuming you dont have an active subscription right now)
---
Not quite.
---
If you have a sub on August 13th, you can reserve your name.
---
I don't care one way or the other, but it seems to me if you're gonna have classic WoW, you're gonna have classic models.
---
Maybe those playing live currently. But there's millions that arent playing live that will play classic.
---
You can start character creation on August 13th. So if you want to reserve a name sub on August 13th
---
I feel like trying to convince alarmists like you to be chill is a waste of time. All you do is bitch. I’m gonna play on a PvE server and gonna stick to grouping with my guild so honestly I don’t give a flying fuck about Layering. They could have it enabled throughout Vanilla and I wouldn’t bat an eye.
---
So from what I understand, "Layering" means each realm will have a handful of subrealms each supporting roughly the same amount as a normal WoW server. They can be transferred between if you join groups etc but otherwise you'll stay in the same layer. Once the population from each realm drops from 10-15k to 4-5k after a few weeks, they essentially merge all the subrealms into one.
---
This does sound better than sharding, though I still have a couple of major concerns. 
---
* What happens if, say, you get out of the rush of the starting zones and into one of the higher level zones, with way fewer people. 95% of the people on your layer are still back in the starting zones, and while there are plenty of people to quest/interact with in your new zone, you can only see a fraction of them and your zone feels empty. Is there any kind of smart-changing system to ensure that we're going to see a good number of players no matter where we go?
---
* This leads me to my next point, people are probably likely to try and abuse/workaround this system in order to get on the good layers. What happens if you get to hillsbrad and somebody in general is going "This is the layer for Tarren Mill vs. Southshore, everybody join my raidgroup to transfer and then do the same for your friends so we can all get on the same layer" or if you arrive in a zone and it's empty on your layer, you ask in general chat for somebody from the "main" layer to invite you into their group so that you are in the main version with everbody else. I'm really worried this is going to create zones where there's one dedicated layer everybody in that zone wants to be in, while every other layer is going to be a ghost town because people don't want to miss out.
---
* this system sounds like it's potentially open to abuse, i.e people deliberately switching layers to avoid PvP, farm rare mobs, AoE farm. Maybe this could be fixed with a cooldown if you try to switch to often.
---
I think that's the biggest criticism you could make of these guys, a lot of their videos are *very* similar, especially ones covering news or blue posts, as well as class guides.
---
There has to be a way, Hell with some of the addons people made to server hop in MoP I wouldn't be suprised if there was a way of launching your own layer somehow.
---
Sharding is thing that make this buy to not to buy. 
---
As for now, I will wait closer to release  see how this will develop.
---
oh I thought they said enjoy a classic summer, not just launching in summer my bad
---
i was referring to modern wow not classic
---
It is such a relief to be able to put my PTO in.
---
Classes will be in their 1.12 state.
---
So no, not really.
---
If they had ye technical capabilities to do it back then they definitely would have . 
---
Would of circumvented the absolute shit show that was original release
---
I had a similar though, ServerName 1-9 and then merge them all in X time, just make sure they lock names across the numbered layers.
---
You're right that is the best part
---
Layering doesn't solve that. Each layer will have a full server worth of people and early on all of those 2.5k ish people will be in the same few areas. You'll still have player competition over mobs. It's still going to be a cluster fuck.
---
What layering solves is not having a bunch of dead servers that need to be merged 3 months after launch.
---
Say you have a bunch of non-layered realms each with a max realm pop of 2.5k players on one server, and then 3 months after launch 75% of the userbase quits, you are left with a bunch of servers with only a few hundred people playing, causing people to either have to transfer or merge realms because remember, there is no cross-realm play.
---
On the other hand instead say you have a fewer amount of layered realms each with a max realm pop of 10k players on a server. 3 months after launch 75% of the userbase quits leaving a healthy realm population right around 2.5k, and then layering is turned off for good.
---
PSA: layering will at MAX last for phase 1. Blizzard's goal with layer is as long as absolutely necessary, with the goal being 2-4 WEEKS.   
---
Layering will not ruin the economy, as it will take the vast majority of average players 4-8 weeks to hit 60. The real hardcore will be there in 2-4 weeks, leaving little time in Blizzard's estimated window for layering to be problematic.
---
That diagram shows layering.
---
So you're suggesting to fix layering.... with layering?
---
I don’t think you understand how layering works. Why don’t you read up on it some before shitposting
---
I ducking love this map
---
If you watch Ion’s interview he makes it clear that the Phase 2 deadline is being a bit misinterpreted. That’s their absolute, drop dead deadline because they only want one copy of the world bosses that will be spawned in that Phase. That does not mean that layering will be active throughout Phase 1. Their plan and expectation is that servers will shrink down to a normal population and a single layer within a few weeks of launch.
---
I love you 3000
---
Ah, this makes sense. When would you say is the cutoff from "classic" wow to retail?
---
Max pop was 2.5k.
---
Again, if they decide to cap the server at 5k in Classic, and layering tech allows more people than 5k (to avoid queue times), and if after phase 1 ends, those 5k+ people don't stop playing then you will suffer queue times regardless, or layering technology will persist after phase 1. One of the 2.
---
Layering is only going to be lasting a few weeks.
---
It's usually the basement dwelling nerds complaining about sharding. Not everyone has 10 hours a day to play an unplayable game thanks
---
Think of layering as elastic load balancing for resources, mobs, quest objectives, etc then. Concurrent population affects a lot of stuff, not just software performance
---
It happened all the time in live.
---
&gt; **Colloquially** Summer is June/July/August
---
It's all good news except the release date. That part is just news. I'm glad it's not the last day if summer but I was hoping to play the game before university started.
---
I came back to laugh.
---
Stormscale(NA not EU)!!!!
---
Ion said in the video that the plan is to reduce the layers as the weeks go by. So I imagine if the first couple days have 10+ server populations they'll split it up into 3/4/5 layers and then by the end of the first week servers are averaging 6k they'll reduce it to 2/3 layers and so on and so on till the server population stabilises and they can just pop people into one layer. So they'll slowly reduce the layers whilst slowly increasing the people who are in layer one, and as layers close, the main layer increases in population till it's the only layer. It really isn't that bad. Ion then goes on to say by phase 2 if people want to fight it out for 5 hours at world bosses they can and they won't make extra layers just so more people can access world bosses.
---
Vanilla wow made great stories - it really was one of the best experiences in the history of gaming. There was nothing quite like it.
---
I’m sorry to hear I hurt your feelings, and I’m happy to hear you think I’m the reason you have classic servers.
---
In that scenario you would be getting the stock for a second time 15 years later, and I would be getting nothing. You got yours 15 years ago. 
---
I’m not trying to sound jealous. I’m happy you got the collectors edition 15 years ago. But that item exist in retail, it should be in two places.
---
So... exactly how they've described layering to work, but without the ability to play with friends or join a guild that doesn't happen to roll the same 'layer' as you do?
---
There won’t be 3-5 layers on a server. I don’t get why you’re assuming that there will be.
---
Vanilla servers had a cap of around 5k. There will only ever be 2 layers.
---
Sorry, I did not specify that. It's also known by another name you might have heard of. Vanilla wow. This name has been around since the first expansion was released. It refers the the "base" game before any expansions come out. The version that "Classic" will be based on is patch 1.12.
---
Can be a bit of both, based on this other interview:
---
[https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=576](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=576)
---
First phases will last a couple of months, Ion also said that phase one to two will be the fastes one because they one to release dire maul, the pvp system and world bosses, so maybe the first phase just last 5 to 8 weeks?
---
The fact that you are downvoted. The fact that all the top posts in this thread are calling for changes. The fact that people still don't understand that "positive" changes have unintended consequences. I'm so disappointed right now.
---
And by your inability to back up your stupid claims I can conclude the same about you.
---
15000 concurrent players isn’t classic wow and is a fucking abomination.
---
Yeah, I’m also thinking of taking the day after release and then maybe a few more that next week.
---
Don’t want to waste a week of servers crashing and the such.
---
It's absolutely WONDERFUL news! 
---
XR Bg's for me is better news than fucking release date.
---
Larger pool of players to play against, much lower queue time, more games in any given period of time, different opponents instead of the same people ever single time, twinking has been literally saved from extinction, queue dodging is made much more difficult, factions imbalances is not a factor from server to server.... fucks sake, need I go on?
---
Wow classic is retail, it's just back dated to an old version of the game.
---
Told you...
---
B2P is buy to play. Think guild wars.
---
15000 players isn’t vanilla wow and is an abomination.
---
Ok so what is the speculation on the amount of players who will play classic? 
---
I honestly would be surprised if its less than 500k. 
---
But what if we see numbers like 3m? I mean its had over 10m before. And the only reason they stopped is because they didnt like the direction of retail.
---
Feelsbadman
---
Layering is a short term solution for a short term problem. 3 layers would also be 3x the number of players consuming 3x the number of resources. As hard as I try I can't find anything to be upset about.
---
yes. I get to play a rogue in the world of rogue-craft again.
---
1 lockout? It's going to be very common for week 2 of the launch to be a lockout.
---
I’d imagine that would just push/delay the bottleneck to the next zones while this layering thing tries to eliminate it completely.
---
&gt;I'm having the biggest issue with this part of your post. In "Real" wow, kalimdor and EK are whole seamless instances; in private servers, they just chopped up every single zone into their own instance.
---
Yeah, and that's a genius way to deal with the problem. I'm not really understanding your point here, and I'm pretty sure every single person against layering would rather have STV and Duskwood on seperate servers than be able to be in the same zone as someone and not be able to see them because they're in another instance of the same map.
---
&gt;I've played on pservers upwards of 8 years and hosting 14k concurrent players in a single server is not a matter of: "Can we do it?" But rather "Should we do it?". Every time there's a "FRESH" server you had better just accept that you're not gonna play for 3 weeks or skip half the quests just to squeeze by. (Don't even THINK about getting that elite quest in redridge done btw) plus they crash. and crash. and crash repeatedly every time a new server launches. (LOL WTF 15 MINUTE ROLL BACK REEE)
---
What is the relevance here? We're talking about networking solution for server load. You can cut the diatribe about mob supply and demand.
---
I was referring to BC being reintroduced to classic without flying.
---
Can’t wait to read all the people complaining about how hard it is and how shit it is
---
So basically theres a fresh environment for every 3000 players. I think you might find you get lucky here and there as a player who rushes to 60, but the population of players that will be roaming around at 60 early on is a very small percentage of the playerbase, they will be hogging the devilsaur leather and black lotus spawns regardless. It’s a non-issue, and it might result in *every now and then* you’re find yourself as one of the first few in a new layer and you go looking for mats to stock up on. After phase one this rare “treasure goblin” esque experience is gone, and it becomes something unique about the new classic experience people can reminisce about later. I dont see this throwing the game’s economy out of whack, though. Not many people have the time to abuse it, and it will be very luck-based.
---
No. I'd rather re-roll new characters on new Burning Crusade or Wrath realms. I am leaving all my Classic Characters on Classic Servers. 
---
The amount of time and effort to gear for end-game content is much greater than leveling from 1-60. Once you upgrade to the next expansion, all that end-game effort is obsolete.
---
what if layers have a max cap of 1k and we have 5 layers where does it say layers are around 2-3k can you send me a link

Why are people getting mad at this shit?, can any of you give any better suggestions to not have a overcrowded starter zone and so on?, how are you expecting to even tag mobs when you're competing against thousands of other people?
---
&gt;what's the difference? :|
---
between the FF7 remake and a re-release of classic wow? are you serious?
---
You won't see people disappear, you clearly don't understand how this works at all. You will not see anyone at all at first, if they are in your group they will appear. And the fact that this will only lasts for a couple of weeks makes it irrelevant anyway
---
Correct
---
They mentioned it on stream today.
---
Same for managers in public accounting except they got rid of that pesky accrual last year and now its "unlimited" which also means none depending on how you use it.
---
Ima be super happy if they treat classic like osrs, continue adding new content and balacing it while keeping the design phylosophies around hard work, community building and interaction intact.
---
Or the right company
---
Nah, max pop was around 5k.
---
Medium pop was 2.5k.
---
I’m assuming they have a minimum number of servers already planned with the ability to add on demand. I would doubt they theoretically have a  maximum server cap number since demand will ultimately determine server count. Servers have always been chosen prior to any character creation or naming.  So unless they plan on allowing 500 hunters named Legolas or allowing only 1 character named Legolas then choosing a server with the name or character creation is the only other way I can see to handle duplicate names.
---
You can say you'd rather play bc/wotlk/cata/mop over Vanilla, but without providing reasons WHY it's just an opinion. You say things like "better" or "in every way" but specifically, WHY? 
---
You aren't getting the WHY part. More abilities doesn't equal better. Balance doesn't equal better. Synergy doesn't equal better. 
---
You could argue CHOICE is better therefore more abilities is more choice, but what about the CHOICE vanilla talents give? I'd say Vanilla has the best talent system of all. Vanilla is the most social of all because no LFG, had to use world chat to group, had to actually walk to entrances of instances. Vanilla was the hardest of all because you didn't have guides on a second monitor or phone. Vanilla was the easiest to play casually, you could seriously enjoy the entire game without ever maxing. Vanilla was the "simple-est" of all. In Vanilla each class had it's own strengths and weaknesses that made it so much more satisfying to do something extraordinary.
---
Why isn't this at the top with 10 gold? This is terrifying to me... This means you have "layering" (let's just call it something different) for the ENTIRE levelling experience and all of MC / ONY.
---
Have fun with complete stupidity in STV and Black Rock Mountain ala current retail wow world PvP for months. This is the one thing that may make me step away from classic to be honest.
---
So.... Layering aside.... 
---
I wonder how addons will work? Since they are using the BFA client will current addons still function?
---
Mama, I'm comin' home
---
Be sure to inform the devs theyre wrong about the servers they ran
---
I think they are heavily anticipating a large influx of nostalgic players who will drop out around lv30-40 when they realize how much of a timesuck wow classic is again. I dont doubt that the server pops will mimick the private server community and have massive logins at fresh and dwindle to ~60% about 2-3 months in
---
Pretty close actually. 
---
You are in phase Quel'thalas 1 you cant see, interact or play with anyone from Quel'thalas 2 unless you know they are on Quel'thalas 2 and have them invite you.
---
You are on the server Quel'thalas you cant see, Interact or play with anyone from bloodmoon unless you know they are bloodmoon and have them invite you.
---
They mentioned it on stream.
---
Don’t have the time to be a Orc Warrior Main Tank this time around, so I will be rolling an Orc Shaman.
---
YOUR MISSION IS A FAILURE! YOUR LIFESTYLES TOO EXTREME!
---
I'm absolutely fucking baffled. I'm sorry but this kills world PvP for me.
---
For everyone who is /that/ butthurt about it -- just how impotent do you feel IRL that you need to nolife-poopsock the game so severely just to get what you believe to be a 'status symbol' that puts you above other players?
---
Im genuinely asking, because I hate my job, but I dont care one bit that the old epic mounts wont be there.  I played vanilla from CB to BC (heh), and it really makes no difference whatsoever if my mount is armored or unarmored, because I dont care nearly that much about what some randoms on an MMO think about me based on how little of a personal life I allowed myself in the first month of launch.
---
If they were in?  Great id be happy for those who care that much.  That they're not?  Bring on the wahhmbulance for the manchildren.
---
Only 90's kids will remember.
---
_Born in 99_
---
3000 &lt; 14000
---
Woo! Hooray for only warrior tanks and shaman, druids and paladins only being useful for healing!
---
I totally support you my friend! Unless you’re rolling Alliance... then tough titties.
---
oh, so you're just saying the base game before any expansions? I thought you were saying there was a few expansions that were still considered classic wow.
---
Isnt that easy, first you dont know what servers will be low pop and will be merge, so you want one database name for all the servers?
---
Wow, it said I am likely to get an invite, thank you for creating this helpful tool!
---
This appears to be t he same as the "Server Cluster" idea. Which has it's own issues.
---
Hundreds of folks (or more) will be wanting to roll on the same server. The same instanced/dynamic server. This doesn't fix that.
---
This also causes issues with world buffs / world bosses -- for obvious reasons. And folks from the underpopulated "servers" will have access to more resources -- and thendump them on the AH when the servers merge into a healthier server.
---
This terrible community better not fuck up having classic TBC.
---
it's literally that easy because it's exactly what is happening with layering you dope
---
and yours are just... yikes
---
I mean we don’t know if it will be used past starting zones.  They said they are planning on having it on for just a few weeks.  Do you think that there will be like 4K people at level 60 on one server in just a few weeks?
---
I've been in this racket for a while. Not even the almighty private servers with international populations get 24/7 free farm periods on devilsaur. 
---
&gt; then 24/7 camp would be unnecessary as nobody would be farming them during these hours anyway. 
---
exactly my point
---
Lol can you imagine? They’re used to 15 minute rounds of Fortnite and CoD. You can’t even get to the entrance of Deadmines in 15 minutes lol.
---
It takes 15 minutes to run back if you die 😂
---
If I'm in a realm that gets merged or consolidated at least I got to have the leveling experience with a community. Under the layering system I'm just a single dude in a 10k population multi-layer cluster fuck for the first however many months.
---
And what about servers that don't see a huge player drop off? What happens to the 8k pop server that some popular streamer is on? Will that get forced split to condense down?
---
You can play all next summer.
---
So then its even easier to abuse. Ight.
---
That doesn't make any sense though, the whole point is to have a limited number of realms but many layers so that realms won't die out even if layers are reduced and will eventually be merged. 
---
What stream?
---
If you're arms you love pulling 2 at a time- sweeping strikes, cleave and whirlwind are your friends. Even as dual wield fury pulling 2-3 is fine at most level ranges, you just demo. shout, thunderclap, rend all targets, then focus down one at a time.
---
you asked WHY I PREFER other expansion to vanilla.. now you want me to prove why its better and saying that it doesnt equal better when it does FOR ME.. 
---
in TBC you also had to do it all without lfg etc. 
---
i also care more about class design than all these things you mentioned.. yeah, i'd prefer tbc/wrath to not have flying and lfg, but i can deal with it because other things are improved dramatically.. also tbc talents were better than vanilla talents.. i'd say even wrath talents were better, tho here they made builds to bee too obvious a lot of the time
---
more abilities is better, that means the game is more complicated, takes more skill and therefore more enjoyable to play.. i think i mentioned that i prefer arenas to any other part of the game and Vanilla didnt have arenas
---
I didn't read what you said but I can promise the cost to develop layering outweighs the extra hosting costs for the first few weeks it's going to actually be in use
---
Crbgs in the phase (phase3) they're talking about is changes lol. Most people wanted it true nochanges where crbgs wouldn't be added until they were needed in the respective phase that it occurred in actual vanilla.
---
&gt;it's just as bad as sharding
---
not as bad as the OG classic launch. The Blizzard website was basically ddosed for 2 weeks because so many people was trying to create accounts to register CD keys. There was qeue's 8k deep to log in. 8 hour wait, just to get to character select. Dont take too long making your toon. You got booted back to the end of line. There was a bug that lasted damn near a decade that would make your toon get stuck on one knee in the looting position. the only fix was to log out and back in...into an 8 hour queue.  
---
Please tell me how sharding is going to fuck things up?
---
Absolutely man, the algorithm will continue to change as we find out more info, but see you in there!
---
&gt;it's not like you'll never see them again
---
Literally impossible to see them without being on the same layer.
---
This.
---
Never trust blizzard
---
The Diablo font was a nice touch.
---
No no I was trying to keep my explanation simple and left out that fact, my apologies. Blizzard is going to be hosting servers of the original game for players that enjoy that experience. Everything before The Burning Crusade essentially. Retail wow will continue to get content updates as usual.
---
It was called Darkened Skies or something, in a ravine. He has a voidwalker and it's definitely Durotar.
---
ok you can stop with these now
---
&gt;I don’t get why they’re so scared of queues
---
I have maybe 1-2 hours to play a day. Queues terrify me!
---
By the time TBC comes around, pantheon: rise of the fallen will be nearing beta. Soooooooo there choice will actually be relatively important at that time due to MMO competition for the first time. ever
---
you are so stupid you didn't get the sarcasm at all it flew over your head. " we have different opinions about something than you must be toxic and I am %100 percent right about everything because what you wrote hurt my feelings" this part is me imitating you. Imagine being so stupid someone has to explain a joke to you. With this post you have proven how stupid you and the rest of you that defend layering **blindly** are.(Since you don't have capacity to understand a thing blindly is written in bold because unlike you there are some that have a point defending layering)
---
Can someone explain to me what this is and how it’s different than current WoW? I haven’t played in a couple years and I’m generally curious.
---
Saying they lied is probanly disingenuous. I expect they told the truth as it was when they told it. 
---
Reality is that plans change, better ideas come up, solutions that they didn't think were possible were discovered. It's the nature of software development and engineering. 
---
Regardless, this is a better solution than sharding just the starting zones, 1000 people in Westfall is too many.
---
i hope you're not spreading this misinformation.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
I'm just going to ice block until aug 27
---
I see dat Arcanite Reaper
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Yeah, because low pop servers always merge with the highest pop servers, right?
---
Some stream that keeps getting linked on this sub
---
Please no extra extra custom vanilla content.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Please no.
---
With a 3 month beta this should be the final dagger in wow
---
Max pop was 2.5k. Go google it.
---
&gt;What if layering tech doesn’t allow more people than the server cap? Lol
---
If it's not there to avoid queue times then what is the point of having it? Lololol.
---
I wonder what kind of content, maybe Dragon Isles?
---
Yup
---
Thanks for sharing, OP! 
---
I think a lot of people who are currently against it, myself included, would be absolutely fine with "layering" if two things were changed or guaranteed:
---
* It should exist for weeks, not months. Ion does say "weeks" in this video and that is somewhat reassuring, but **other devs did say months, not weeks**, and Ion is known for being very good at those sweet lies á la Todd Howard. It would not be acceptable to still have layering 2-3 months down the line and have entire guilds be unable to contest each other on their way to raids, as well as duplicating all resources and rare mobs.
---
* To whatever extent possibly, these layers need to be _sticky as hell_. The current iteration has clearly been stated to be per **session**, meaning if you relog, you might end up in a different layer. The chances of you running into the same player twice in two days will be very small on a realm with several layers, because each login can apparently give you a new layer. I won't pretend like there's an easy solution there, but this means **you may log onto what is essentially a completely different server with 3000 new faces every day, for weeks.** That would be _horrible_ for the community.
---
The idea of sharding has always been championed as a way to make sure tourists do not ruin the long term server population, and is absolutely necessary. But this current iteration of it leaves some things to be desired. I understand it is jarring to see a player disappear as they go into a different zone, but no tourist will reach 30+. That's weeks of playing for a casual. Sharding everything even up to level 60 just seems like a massive amount of collateral damage to solve a problem that will only uniquely exist at lower levels.
---
It's so close to being perfect, and the Blizzard classic team has showed they "get it". I hope they get this the concerns here as well.
---
Why are you comparing playing for 10 hours to sharding?
---
I don't think they've actually confirmed that. They've confirmed it won't stay past phase 1 and that's it.
---
That's enough time for most dedicated people to make it most of the way to 60, at least. I don't want to feel like I'm getting a lesser experience by not waiting a month or two until it's phased out before i start playing.
---
I honestly wouldn't mind if i knew it was just for the 1-20 zones. I can totally understand that. I don't like the idea of it being across the whole continent though.
---
Leveling my warrior on akama I kept running into and fighting a nelf druid from like level 30 -&gt; 55, a completely wordless rivalry, it was neat
---
#wompwomp
---
&gt; premiering in an MMO void left open by dwindling EQ subs.
---
sounds a lot like today's MMO market to me
---
&gt;And yes, online server populations absolutely went down on a per capita basis after launch. Some went down massively, which is why Blizzard had so many dead servers that they needed to merge into others.
---
because people gravitate toward the high pop realms.  most people when given the choice of joining the server with a pop of 20k will pick that over a server with 1k.  blizz offered free xfers off high pop servers to try and keep other servers alive, and merged the worst ones.  overall pop went up tho. who cares if there's no layers on dead servers when all the main servers that most people are playing on are bloated as heck.
---
new servers don't do anything when the problem is getting people off high pop servers so they can remove layers.  nobody wants to take a free xfer to a dead realm.
---
Just get better and don't get ganked
---
All my claims are backed up by your statements...
---
but he PROMISED
---
If they made new raids and basically nothing else i would be down. Honestly i feel like classic wow coming out means that theyre working on a new mmo.
---
Yea... This may literally be the dagger that kills classic. A fractured community for the entirety of the levelling process and potentially all of MC / ONY? This whole thing has a real chance to ruin the levelling and community building processes that occur on vanilla. We're seriously under playing how bad this is.
---
troll
---
That would make it entirely exploitable. If im always in layer 2 even after logging out and back in then ill start selling layer 2 invites for the rare mobs and mats.
---
That also makes me wonder how quick these layers will be ghost towns, Layer 1 is popping and despite being less than the limit you cant join them without an invite becasue you are layer 2? That just does not sound right to me.
---
Bro unless you're on a bare base fob in Syria you'll have downtime and WiFi.. let's not kid ourselves 😂
---
"check to see what layers all their friends are on"
---
it's different than it was on live, since there were no 'layers'
---
I work all day Tuesdays, so its a bummer for me.  I will, however try to get the 28th off to jam all day
---
Can I get one with a dog?
---
They're still major releases in the summer, regardless of how long ago they were.  If you followed Warcraft III's development process, they certainly wanted the game out sooner, and would have released it whenever it was done.  Same thing goes for D3 and Overwatch.  Fairly certain they weren't aiming for a particular season but when it's done.
---
so everything before the burning crusade is classic wow then?
---
This just means it's going to be pointless to not roll on a faction dominated server. World PvP takes a massive hit with this news fellas. Like why wouldn't you roll on an 80/20 server now, literally no negatives to being the dominant faction. Faction balance doesn't matter anymore, just roll the dominant faction on your server so you can get a chance at world bosses.
---
Yes, I'm asking you to justify your opinion. You don't have to. You're still allowed to believe what you want. I just wanted to know if it's logical or feels based. Now I know it's feels based, and can move on.
---
&gt;and previously they said not at all.
---
And after that said only in starting zones, Pull up the goal posts boys were setting them back!
---
Don't worry guys, starting zones only for a few weeks. What? We didn't say that, we said the entire world for 5 months.
---
The best way I saw it:
---
You take a boat from place A to place B with some people.  You get there, and some/all are gone.
---
That is phasing.  
---
Layers, they quoted this situation and said layers are designed to fix this, so you will see the people you saw in the previous zone.
---
It also avoids any situations where you might see someone spontaneously phase in or out while passing zone borders. Layer transitions only happen when there would be a loading screen anyway
---
Dont do me lile this, i can only get so erect.
---
Yeah and pedantically, there isn't going to be sharding at all. "Layering", as they've tried to sell it, isn't sharding. It's an entirely different implementation.
---
I'm not convinced it's either good or bad, but it just seems like trading "people phase out in front of you in the starting zones" for "affects the whole world".
---
Nice thread OP. We just make up shit and then get angry right?  
---
WTF why are they banning bananas?!?! That sucks I really like bananas, fk BLIZZARD.  
---
Am I doing it right?
---
STOP I CAN ONLY GET SO HYPE
---
Seriously how am i going to raid on all three at the same time.
---
Is raiding a full time job?
---
" I think the things you just listed could be used to describe BFA NOW. "  
---
Are you trying to make the argument that Wotlk and BFA are anything alike?   
---
BFA has been heavily criticised due to things like even further ability pruning and poor class design. Some aspects in BFA or the later expansion in general might be better than WOTLK. But CATA for a lot of people was the first expansion which we saw major features such as LFR and transmog get implemented, and it got only worse after that (yes I am aware of the dungeon finder being added in Wotlk).  
---
What im trying to say is that Wotlk for a lot of people has the best of both worlds. Professions mattered, classes were in a relatively good state, leveling still felt good, the story was great etc.  
---
No one here is trying to say that vanilla sucked, I doubt we would all be on this subreddit if that was true. No offence, but you're coming of as a little defensive with the way you're writing.
---
This is just realm merging.
---
Then those people should wait a week till it clams down a bit rather than fracturing the server community. I had planed to wait a week before I started playing but now im not sure.
---
justify so you would just say that you dont think its the case and that you disagree with me? 
---
i already told you why and mentioned facts, none of it is feeling based outside of gameplay feelings aka the way classes feel to play
---
If it lasts more than 4 hours, consult a doctor.
---
and lets add multiboxing to that. so make it x5. lets make it BFA like
---
&gt; "Only for launch" becomes "Only for Phase 1"
---
RemindMe! 7 months "Guess we will see"
---
Ayyy I get my mini diablo!
---
Any self respecting classic player knows bigger isn't better. Having pseudo servers layered together means your not going to build organic relationships with people you meet and see consistently.
---
Oh no, you’re actually retarded :(
---
it’s ok we all have bad days

I would imagine they're also not trying to re-create the wheel.  This is a short term solution, there's no reason to over-complicate it so might as well lean on any phasing/connected-realm type stuff they already have.
---
From this video with Ion he seems to state it is only a few weeks:  [https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234)
---
Doesn’t the whole summer thing only apply to kids in school? I have to work throughout the summer. Won’t be any different for the millions of working adults
---
&gt;You're not going to know if and when one comes up, so there will be ZERO possibility of gaming this system like this.
---
Of course you will, Log in near a town if there is no one there on logging in then its a fresh shard. Or just keep logging in and out till the thing you are camping is there.
---
Actually wanted to buy this for the statue. Turns out shipping is 102 euros so literally more than the actual product. Yikes.
---
No, Blizzard did not tell them to build the hype. They don't need too. Esfand and crew have nothing else better to do currently as Classic Streamers other than build hype for the game and themselves of course. Nothing against those guys at all, theyre just milking every little bit they can. Once the beta hits they can start making fresh content instead of rambling on about an interview for a 6hr stream.
---
Those two songs are my favorite bits of music of all time. I dont know what it is, but I just close my eyes and go into a trance while listening to it.
---
I actively dont listen to it unless I have 10 minutes to spare to do absolutely nothing but focus on that song, lol
---
Is it though
---
The layers will be 3k but actual servers will be much much larger.
---
Game’s got sharding.
---
Game over man. Game over. Gg all though—we tried. No hate from me.
---
I don't know how my comment came off but I am generally unaffected by the layering and my only questions about it are simply if they are going to be used in conjunction with early zone sharding. A lot of the original issues they talked about as the reasons for sharding don't seem addressed with this new layering. It feels like this is a separate issue and separate solution so I wonder if the original sharding in beginner locations is still going to happen.
---
Frustration aside this is so anti classic my head might explode. People are seriously undermining how terrible this is.
---
Sharding is likely gonna be removed from Classic after the first month anyway and it might not even be in at all so not sure what this post is for.
---
post naxx content would be fine if its done on a separate set of servers and not forced onto people who dont want it, and im sure when BC and LK come out itll be optional to copy your character to those servers while keeping your character on vanilla
---
Thought I would toss this link up in case anyone comes here and wants to read through the old guide.
---
The whole excuse is honestly quite dumb, for lack of a better word.  
---
  It goes against everything vanilla stands for, you reward those willing to no life, that effort and time investment results in prestige and awe, because that person succeeded.  
---
  That's what makes the world feel alive, and also keep them available for a limited time, just like they did back then.  
---
  Stop with this "content for everyone" bullshit, this isn't retail, vanilla is content for those willing to obtain it.
---
A remake is with updated graphics. A re-release is the same thing from before.
---
Think WCIII Reforged - that's a remake. Classic is a re-release.
---
is this satire?
---
WoW was a notorious relationship killer....
---
...So sharding your own server?
---
yea.. checkmate. you win this one!
---
No, you misunderstand my position. My argument is that every expansion in comparison TO VANILLA has expanded on his criteria of: "More abilities" ✔, "better designed abilities" ✔, "better balance" ✔, "better synergy between classes" ✔.
---
Pretty good for me. Wife is a teacher and all my kids are in school. Falls on the first of my normal 5 days off. Going to be cracking out on some wow with no worries.
---
*layered
---
wouldn't that just cause 2 layers to merge into 1 at point? 
---
Opposing faction could easily sit on one layer waiting for spawns in condensed zone. This would result in you walking through an invisible wall and then getting frostbolted from an instance you cant reach or see. Then they pursue you and if they need to just run back into Layer 2. Now imagine if a fight ensued and they ran back and your team of misfits chased them but everyone else was on layer 1 and you and the party of opposing faction are on 2. Your help just warped away.
---
All of my Sharding threads get locked so I guess Im in time out.
---
Rip
---
I genuinely believe there's a lot of non vanilla players in here accepting it. It makes me sick to my stomach knowing this is the path they're choosing. This is coming from the person who would wait 45 minutes for a server que.
---
This is going to destroy the game.
---
Unlikely because players spead out.  Have you ever watched the start of a cross country race.  There is tons of congestion at first because everyone is starting from the same point.  After that, the crowd thins out.
---
Same for leveling.  It's bad in the valley of trials and durotar (or Goldshire Abbey and Elwynn forest or whatever), because literally everyone starts there basically at the same time. 
---
But after the start it will spread out.  Some people will level very fast.  Some will grind mobs.  Some will level gathering or start crafting professions.  Some will just take it slow.  By the time you get to Barrens the group will be thinned out greatly.  
---
And even if it was still too much in the Barrens they could surely limit the sharding to the Barrens because after Barrens people will split up, some will level in stonetalon, or ashenvale, or southshore, and some people would move laterally to places like Silverpine etc.  
---
There's really no reason that the high level areas need to be sharded too.
---
The real hardcore will be level 60 in 8ish days from release. If the layering lasts 3-4 weeks, they will get ever further ahead with access to 2-3x the resources in the world.
---
Hell, I remember queues of 6 hours when MoP released and I took the free server transfer Blizz offered to reduce queue times.
---
Go outside instead
---
They all gave me a Yugioh duel links vibe
---
I would not disagree with you if you brought up valid specifics, which is why I'm asking for them in the first place.
---
What are these logos for ants? It needs to be at least three times this size!
---
People really oversell the 'homogenization' in wrath, specs still had very unique roles, abilities, and gameplay.  Cata was kind of the big start of the overlap of abilities especially in regards to healers basically all having a similar kit(big heal, small heal, fast heal, unique heal, unique instant), even then I think some of it was for the better(all healers having a baseline dispel that they can balance dungeons around, plus a 'unique' dispel to the heal spec was a good change imo).
---
You will still have 550-900 people in each starting zone upon launch, layering has nothing to do with fixing that &amp; it will still be overcrowded. Layering is a safety measure for them in order not to release to few/many realms.
---
Star Wars Galaxies is coming back too?
---
For Tanking Warriors:
---
\- Look at the mob that drops Band of the Steadfast Hero and what quest it is spawned in. It's T0.5, which is not phase 1.
---
\- A shoulder enchant that requires Exalted with AD is asking a lot for phase 1 prebis tanks. Also, this may not be in phase 1 if it's a Naxx thing (I'm not sure).
---
\- Listing several BoE items may be technically correct but nobody is going to be able to afford that. It might be worth listing a free drop equivalent next to each of those expensive BoEs.
---
the point i was making was that this sub wtf raged against starting zone sharding, a far superior solution, because #nochanges, but refuse to even consider that layering might actually be worse. though ofc, in pointing out that the point is being lost on everyone, i should've expected that noone would get the point. #hindsight shouldve just given up on this sub when the meme army arrived.
---
I am intrigued by you, yet at the same time fear you.
---
I believe they said it’s because they didn’t want people to feel like they had to rush to 60. In my opinion, the people who don’t want to rush to 60 wouldn’t rush either way. I really wanted the ivory raptor... so sad :(
---
[https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234) here Ion says that it will last a few weeks.
---
Yes.
---
At the moment, mine is somewhere between unranked and a 3-day ban.
---
Amen, people who are arguing for this don't realize its going to be a isolated retail experience. You're going to be in a sea of people you feel disconnected with and can't build relationships. You can't have your cake an eat it to, gloating about 10 servers into one cluster fuck can't create a community, it's impossible. Sad days ahead for classic.
---
Dont play?
---
This quote isn't going to age well if they decide to "adjust course"
---
IT ENDS ON PHASE 2 STOP CRY LOL
---
Why do so many people dont get the memo that its only like that for a few weeks?
---
There are not more people. There are the same amount of people just 'spread out'.
---
Your speculation is as good as anyone else's. No need to belittle others.
---
Honestly, I’d be completely okay with a TBC and WotLK release, and nothing after. I’m aware this is probably an unpopular opinion with some, but to me, those were the absolute best times in WoW.  
---
If the developers are contemplating adding new level 60 content, then they could easily add level 70 and 80 as well.
---
It is encouraging to hear how they plan to cut down the amount of layers progressively. And even though I'm in principle against any sort of changes like this, I recognize the benefits this method will provide.
---
HOWEVER, this explanation from Ion still doesn't answer some of the concerns I, and it appears others, have in regards to layering. My biggest concern is how layering can be abused. Is it possible to switch from one layer to another in order to farm more mobs, resources, avoid ganks and crowded areas etc. How will the player distribution take place - is it possible to end up in a layer with significantly fewer players, thus giving access to more mobs and resources, possibly leading to faster leveling and moneymaking? 
---
These are my concerns. I hope we they will be addressed in a blue post or in the coming beta.
---
pretty sure he means it absolutely is guaranteed it won't persist past phase 1, not that they can't turn it off earlier if they want to
---
there's no real basis for that expectation, especially considering subs only went down after they started making the game 'modern' ez.  other retro games on the rise as well.  
---
huge spike and dropoff?  sure.  doesn't mean we won't end up with a huge population after the release.  to believe that the biggest servers will drop below 3k players after less than a month is legit stupid tho.
---
free xfers are useless too.  maybe paid xfers could convince people to play on a dead realm.
---
Can you explain to me how classic wow, the devs of which have described as a historic recreation, will have ANY shaping and molding during the beta process? Beta testers are there to find bugs and stress test, not provide feedback on any of the old features. Also the idea that people who like retail but not classic are going to sign up for the beta, actively participate, and attempt to subvert the entire project by providing feedback that calls for changes, all while they could just be playing BFA, is fucking hilarious. I'm not a shill, I'm just not retarded,
---
That is what happens when you’ve lurked an echo chamber Reddit for months on end. Your brain turns to mush enough to think that anyone outside maybe 100,000 people actually care about a 15 yo game. It’s sad! 
---
And I’m the biggest vanilla fanatic there is. I’m just realistic.
---
401k cashing out so I can play , then I will be homeless . Whatever it’s worth it .
---
TBC/Wrath would make a Warlock main even more awesome.
---
The fact that you even believe what you just typed means that you are, indeed, retarded
---
What would you do to address the problem? If the community provides constructive feedback - the CMs and devs are listening. Everyone wants the same thing here.
---
Let's be real here , I'm taking some time off work to play and im probs gonna be playing more than 10 hours a day on launch.
---
My argument is too the people below complaining that layering Is gonna make the game too easy ... It's moronic
---
ah, u mean after a while?
---
Yeah it may look like 2/3k 2/3k and 1,5/3k after a while but i think they will keep the numbers of layers as small as possible so the upper example would be converted to 2,75/3k and 2,75/3k very quickly..
---
That is mostly because they were INSANELY overpowered(number balance wise) during the entirety of wrath.  They *couldnt* be bad at any roles they had, basically.  Tuning numbers can help tune the flavour balance in that regard as well.
---
Which TBC server are you on, do you recommend it? Looking for something to pass the time till August and I dont want to spoil classic
---
Cheers, I must have missed that one. Good to know it'll only be a few weeks, but that's still time for people to get pretty deep in the leveling process even playing casually.
---
“Fuck no” is the only right answer.
---
You mean that thing that was said to only last for a little while after release to protect server stability and not make it so 2000 people are all in one zone grinding the same 20 mobs?
---
MoP, WoD, Legion and BFA had more abilities than vanilla? You could argue that synergy is a matter of opinion as some people hate BFA class design while absolutely loving TBC class design for an example. And when  it comes to balancing im not even going to argue as everyone seems to be having their own opinion about that.
---
Is there a list for those changes ? Anywhere i can read up on it?
---
Actually it's not. Think of it like a path through the woods. You've walked this path long ago, and you want to walk it again. You don't want the park district to pave the path and landscape the periphery, you want a simple walk through the woods.
---
Once you get to the end of the path, then you can can choose how you want to go from there. But the path as it is is a discreet entity that has fixed properties: the roughness of the terrain, the winding path, the hills, the vegetation, the start and finish.
---
People who want classic WoW want the path to be the same: leave the tree roots and overgrowth and everything just as it was. They don't want the path to be paved over and manicured. But once they have finished walking the path, then they go along their way (past Naxx if they want).
---
Not getting very goodvibes from that post, maybe classic just isnt for you?
---
You are not taking into account that they said Line 2 wouldn't open until Line 1 was full.
---
So those people near the end of Line 1 are shit out of luck and the people are the start of Line 2 have it nice and breezy.
---
Starter zones will still be overcrowded with 3k people a continent, sharding starter zone's would fix it. Also the whole point of the layering is that Blizzard seems 100% sure that population will decline rapidly after launch so the layer cap will be very high(too high for a regular server to be playable) otherwise they could just release regular realms with around 7k pop and starter zone sharding.
---
&gt; Anyone familiar with game releases should take anything release related with a grain of salt, anytime a company gives a time frame (Summer, First half of the year, 2019, Q3 etc.) you should ALWAYS assume the end of whatever the timeframe is because more often than not they're going to land at the end of that timeframe.
---
That's why they should have just said Q3 release instead of bs like "a classic summer". Q3 doesn't leave room for interpretation. August 27th wouldn't even felt that bad since it'd be just slightly over the midway of Q3, infact I'm sure it'd have been a happy surprise to those expecting the last weeks of Q3.
---
which considering you change layer everytime you group with someone, log in/log off, or spend any length in an instance...
---
will happen very often.
---
if ure thinking about layering:  
---
you think 4hour queues, hundreds of players in 1 spot and empty servers after 2 months are authentic?
---
You need the level cap increase as by the time you add that much content you will have stat caps being hit without even trying, there needs to be some sort of stat reset between the expacs to bring the power level back down.
---
Sí\*, la verga\*
---
ÁNDALE, GÜEY.
---
That's not exactly "new" content, is it? What about a Scarlet Crusade raid beyond those Hearthglen doors? Those poor guys never got the love they deserved, especially in WotLK.
---
Re-do BC and Wotlk
---
replace wotlk Nax with new raid
---
O_O
---
except it does happen on retail, you can still talk to all of them, you can still join their layer, the big names will still get recognized..
---
Would you like to actually say what changes you’re talking about, or is this just asking for to much?
---
Well, those minds are wrong.  The seasons aren't subjective, they do in fact have official starts and ends.
---
This is effectively what layers are doing, just without the names.
---
I would assume no. Using the beta+release I'm sure people will make updated versions of them (for the most popular ones.
---
hot damn that edit is fire. big facts
---
thanks! I thought i'd watched all the interviews. that makes me feel a little better about it.
---
I could never handle more than a couple RFK runs. SM and DM I could do for days though
---
Just saw them in Hampton on friday, show was incredible. They also played 2 new songs.
---
I’m going to see Tool in October, and see Ghost in September, I’m really excited for both. Not excited about the plane cost but I like to see concerts with my old crew.
---
You want longer layering than currently planned? Ion said it's going to be the first few weeks.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236
---
My main in vanilla was a Human Male Priest...... fuck no, I’m rolling something different. (FEM DWARF HPALLY &lt;3)
---
I love Chevelle, but damn they are boring in concert.
---
I think the people getting upset at this news. didn't actually experience the OG launch of WoW 15 years ago.  
---
The Blizzard website was basically ddosed for 2 weeks because so many people was trying to create accounts to register CD keys. There was qeue's 1k deep to log in. 8 hour wait, just to get to character select. Dont take too long making your toon. You got booted back to the end of line. There was a bug that lasted damn near a decade that would make your toon get stuck on one knee in the looting position. the only fix was to log out and back in...into an 8 hour queue.
---
Please tell me how sharding is going to fuck things up? This seems like blizzard is learning from their mistake, last time they launched this game it was a huge fuster cluck.  
---
 [http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft](http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft)   
---
&gt;At launch, things took a turn for the bizarre. Blizzard’s forecasts for the game were dead wrong, the swell of players flooding servers was too much for them to handle. Stores were selling out of the game fast and online vendors were taking orders left and right. When they flipped the servers on, the little light flicked from “on” to “burning on fire please help” as server queues reached the 1000s. The servers were crashing harder than burning ship trying to walk into Mordor.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If you got past the queues, you were greeted with latency issues, including the infamous “kneel and loot stuff for half an hour” and the even more infamous “disconnect because Internet was really sketchy back then compared to now” and be greeted by the 1,000 person queue. Blizzard issued game time credits for lost playtime and the rocky ride lasted over a month. Afterward, the servers were plagued with dilapidated hardware that wasn’t optimized to run the game and the entire issue wasn’t “perfected” until all the servers were upgraded.
---
Depending on the quality of the Ragnaros statue it might pay for itself.
---
Is this a good time to get into WoW?
---
Well you're not wrong with starter zones, but the tourists aren't going to keep moving up to higher level zones forever (if they do, they were hardly tourists). There is definitely a balance to be struck between "only starter areas" and "entire continents", imo.
---
Is your first question sarcastic? I did not play all of those expansions and literally assumed they did introduce abilities during these expansions? Do they have more abilities then vanilla?
---
Yes, synergy, balance is probably an opinion. His criteria, not mine.
---
will I be ok running this on a 2013ish macbook pro laptop? 
---
I think I’ll take it to Apple to get it cleaned out first someone help me out please
---
The #nochanges crowd does not talk for the majority of the WoW Classic community. Get over it.
---
&gt;4hour queues - empty servers
---
Pick one. I don't think Blizzard would make the mistake of releasing too many servers this time around so most likely we would have queues instead.
---
Daily reminder that Molten Core will be phased.
---
This is why they are doing what they are doing..

[http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft](http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft)
---
If you got past the queues, you were greeted with latency issues, including the infamous “kneel and loot stuff for half an hour” and the even more infamous “disconnect because Internet was really sketchy back then compared to now” and be greeted by the 1,000 person queue. Blizzard issued game time credits for lost playtime and the rocky ride lasted over a month. Afterward, the servers were plagued with dilapidated hardware that wasn’t optimized to run the game and the entire issue wasn’t “perfected” until all the servers were upgraded.
---
I hope it’s closer to two weeks rather than three. You’re right, the longer it lasts the more chances it creates to break certain things with the economy, world pvp, etc.
---
Touche! SWG was my 1st MMO and although I really like a lot of it's systems WoW really spoke to me more. 
---
Cheers!
---
Either people forgot to mature as they aged or they're all 12 years old.
---
what valid specifics? i already mentioned class design, abilities, balance etc. 
---
if you think that some later expansions having better class design is subjective and isnt true at all then i have nothing to add, cuz its really stupid if you actually think that way
---
Lmao these comments treating the classic economy like their savings are in it. The economy will survive the 20 people bothering to switch layers so they can get a second copper vein every 10 minutes.
---
Ah yes, I remember in Vanilla when you formed your friends after your cleared ONY and MC for months. The golden age of delayed community building.
---
Can’t wait to put life on hold for long while. How liberating,
---
Layering is permanent for phase 1, which could last a very long time.
---
I'd like to feel the touch of a woman at least once.
---
Should probably stop arguing then if you werent around to actually play any of the expansions you're making claims about.
---
no, people confirmed on streams earlier with screenshots and videos that theres still weather effects
---
It's a shitty solution to a problem they created by making it a shared sub.
---
This isn't EQ or SW:ToR where every area is a separate zone.  There are two zones. Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor.
---
Oh, so they're going to do it to limit it to 3000 people per zone?  That's fine... except it isn't.  1000 people per newbie zone, per shard, is as bad as 10,000.  One hundred would be too many.  So either they ~~shard~~ layer more aggressively at the beginning (say, a max pop of 1000 per zone), at which point it might as well be sharding or it makes no visible difference in the initial zones where sharding was initially intended to be limited.  With of course the massive drawback of saddling the game with ~~sharding~~ layers until phase 2 drops.
---
Sharding would be preferable to this since it could have been limited the six newbie zones, and both are terrible solutions to a problem that \*they\* created by trying to make classic pull double duty as filler for retail.
---
I went from "I can't wait til we get a launch date!" to "Nope." even faster.
---
Well, that's on them for hearing what they wanted to hear rather than what was said.
---
So now you can meet new people. And as stated before, if you don’t like it just don’t play classic :)
---
Why are you against it?  You still have to earn the gear to be able to transmog it.
---
Literally several pieces of evidence that 1.12 weather is present in the client.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Tech requirements guys? Would it run as it use to run classic in 2011 MBP ? 😂
---
Can rp as a NE female for you
---
Weather was still in the game files even after they nerfed them a decade ago.
---
&gt;its only like that for a few weeks
---
They said they'd use sharding for only a few weeks. When they described layering they said it could last for the entirety of Phase 1. You can argue that they might cut the layering before then, but they've said they're prepared to do it for all of Phase 1, so that is a possibility.
---
Let the mob be upset about nothing lol
---
A rogue/warrior with a thunderfury getting those lighting procs are an elemental shaman's best friend.
---
20% more is 20%!
---
Your post is intentionally inflammatory. 
---
I'm sure you'd be fine if you get your server and if Blizz also makes other servers with more content post Naxx. Lots of other peoplr will want that too. The only reason you might lose your precious "#nochanges" server is if blizz actually managed to make quality content in a post naxx server that undebatedly improves the game. Which is still a plus for you.
---
EPL BRM Winterspring??
---
It’s a bit more complicated than that. It would be one thing if they just said “nah lol sharding in all zones” but they didn’t. They developed a new implementation that legitimately solves some of the issues. Obviously this approach can’t be zone limited because it’s not a zone by zone system. It’s not so much lying as it’s deciding to do something you think is better. Whether or not it’s actually better overall is up for debate but they are at least attempting to address things people were complaining about. 
---
The time frame hasn’t changed. The whole Phase 2 thing has been a bit misinterpreted.  He explains in the video that the intention is still very much to have layering gone in few weeks after launch like they said at Blizzcon.
---
I remember doing my first instance and thinking "that's it??".  So I started a new character and got her to 50, mostly with dungeon runs.  Seemed fun enough to do once, but it felt weird to have to start a new character just to really play the stuff that I'd skipped.
---
Ever since they started expanding the game, they should've done something to make content that you hadn't done on each character hard to enough to be interesting.  Keep some sense of progression, sure.  But don't let the game be a pushover when you first come upon a new place.
---
I'm not going to make your argument for you. I asked you specifics so you could convince me either TBC or WOTLK were better then Vanilla. So far you haven't.
---
Just tried to preorder in US and already sold out. Any know if they will open it up for more at some point?
---
I played a lot of "classic" freeshards... the nostalgia wear of for most people afer 1-3 months. Second wave around 3-6 months. Population then is stable until late endgame when  there is another drop and the final pop is reached until something better comes along or a new freeshard.
---
I expect about the same in wow classic. So i give it 6 months MAX until phase 1 is done.
---
Alone from the reactions and the writing style from some people here i expect it to be way way sooner even.
---
Do you think most people who already dont get the memo about the layering will survive in classic ? :D
---
I just came back to live ( got a sub after 10 years for more beta invite chance tomorrow ) 
---
They massacred WoW so much and made it SO easy none of the latecomers will survive classic. 
---
Like iam only using 2 casts with my holy priest all else got taken from me damage wise and iam still 100 % mana and health all the time. Its a joke.
---
People who like this will be turned to shreds in classic and quit after a few days.
---
I can only get so erect.
---
based
---
i'm playing pvp so no
---
How about Q3 2019 like businesses normally give timeframes?
---
Lmao all this misinformation. They said a few weeks to a month at most. Fucking relax
---
But if Blizzard makes post 60 content.. isn't that.. blizzlike..? :thinking:
---
People tend to hear what they want to hear no matter what you do.
---
Yeah from past expirience i say phase 1 will run max 6 months if at all. I expect the first dropout of many people after 1-3 months from my previous playing on differen freeshards in different mmos that went back to classic.
---
Not everything can be “MAJOR” that’s why... if everything is then every issue is equally important or... not important.
---
Noooooo!
---
Better not force us lmao.
---
3019.
---
What would you suggest otherwise? People happily pay to secure names if it’s important to them.
---
fuck I clicked it
---
Why quote it at all if you don’t want someone to respond to it?
---
You wouldn’t of quoted it unless you agreed to some degree, otherwise what are you doing?  Just trolling and trying to aggravate people?
---
Fool me once, shame on you
---
Fool me twice, shame on me
---
Fool me thrice...   Yeah no.  Don't believe you.
---
i already realized that it doesnt matter what i say you'll keep repeating your bullshit
---
peace
---
When I say client I mean the beta which is plastered all over YouTube/twitch right now. There was a picture circulating showing intense rain weather earlier today. It will be fine.
---
Wake me up in 2030 when MoP hits the live again, cant wait to yeet garrosh with my bros Thrall and Taran Zhu
---
I'm still in queue for TBC server
---
Burt Macklin on the case.
---
I know right! Almost feels weird to have a decent launch hour
---
shit you're right
---
But this will affect the top 1% of raid guilds! It must be a MAJOR ISSUE!
---
bruh look at this dude
---
LOOK AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AHAHAH OH NO NO NO
---
NO I'll just be quitting, if I play a classic server and they add an expansion to it.
---
&gt; we could argue more.
---
So you're not really interested in his opinion, you just want to tell him why he's wrong.
---
I’ll be honest, I was extremely disappointed to see August 27th as the launch date. So much for playing WoW over the course of summer break I guess.
---
Genius really! Oh.. No it's not "sharding", it's "layering"!
---
Yeah, asking you to use things like 'facts' and 'examples' to make a coherent argument is bullshit? DEUCES, BOY. 
---
Your opinion holds no weight to me.
---
Relevant -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y8tZi7PjKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y8tZi7PjKM)
---
The new content doesn't even need loot stronger than Tier 3. Make the new content around the same difficulty and quality of loot as naxx but make the tier drops benefit a different spec.
---
So tier 3 warrior gear from naxx is designed for tanking but you could make a tier 3b set that benefits fury warriors and stick it in a new troll raid and make it troll berserker themed armor.
---
It's called horizontal progression.
---
blizz is complicating it
---
bro i just wanna play with everyone on my realm
---
not just see 1/4th of the players
---
It's not as much about the load on the servers, it's about 200 level 1 humans trying to kill the same kobold.
---
A very short lifespan.
---
They did state that you will be “stickied” to a layer upon spawning in. So you will see the people you are leveling with as long as you’re leveling with them and not logging off for days at a time. 
---
If the layers are large enough, you’ll see the same people over and over every day.
---
This is new technology, so honestly we have no clue what’s going to happen.
---
You know, you say that, but those people you're talking shit about have literally proven you wrong over every single private server they've played on.
---
Cancel the release, this won’t be able to continue. Imagine... all the problems they solved 25 years ago happening again... as if these dudes didn’t already address these childish acts before won’t be able to handle them happening again!!! 🤭

They can't help it, it's human nature. It's the frog in the boiling pot shit. For instance:

6 months later: "Bitch! You wanna see the back of my hand again?! I don't give a fuck if you're tired, go make me some money!"

Gotta have ideals or you'll just be led along into whatever ugly bullshit, like those poor SOBs still playing retail.

it was also stated your layer is assigned on each log in, you and your friends could still relog to try and match layers.  A bit of a pain in the ass but there is no permanently assigned layers.

Upvote this man! Or ignore him and continue spreading false information!
---
You’re doing gods work!
---
Same, I'm excited for the possibility of TBC and Wrath. TBC was my favorite expansion. 
---
I like the raids more, more specs were viable, I loved the Outlands and overall I have more nostalgia for it I think than vanilla.
---
As someone who hasn't played since WotLK, I agree.
---
Actually I was extremely interested in his opinion because it's a take I NEVER hear. That's why I was asking for coherent arguments in favor of his position. He failed to provide any. If you arrive at a conclusion without proper reasoning, your argument is a [formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy).
---
It's going to be unfortunate when you go to gank someone and they phase away by joining a friends group on a different layer. Or when the economy gets wrecked due to multiple layers worth of nodes. I am personally not a fan of this at all. Especially for ***4-6 MONTHS***
---
**Formal fallacy**
---
In philosophy, a formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, logical fallacy or non sequitur (Latin for "it does not follow") is a pattern of reasoning rendered invalid by a flaw in its logical structure that can neatly be expressed in a standard logic system, for example propositional logic. It is defined as a deductive argument that is invalid. The argument itself could have true premises, but still have a false conclusion. Thus, a formal fallacy is a fallacy where deduction goes wrong, and is no longer a logical process.

&gt;But if you log off and log back on
---
better than logging off into an 8 hour queue.  
---
&gt;At launch, things took a turn for the bizarre. Blizzard’s forecasts for the game were dead wrong, the swell of players flooding servers was too much for them to handle. Stores were selling out of the game fast and online vendors were taking orders left and right. When they flipped the servers on, the little light flicked from “on” to “burning on fire please help” as server queues reached the 1000s. The servers were crashing harder than burning ship trying to walk into Mordor.If you got past the queues, you were greeted with latency issues, including the infamous “kneel and loot stuff for half an hour” and the even more infamous “disconnect because Internet was really sketchy back then compared to now” and be greeted by the 1,000 person queue. Blizzard issued game time credits for lost playtime and the rocky ride lasted over a month. Afterward, the servers were plagued with dilapidated hardware that wasn’t optimized to run the game and the entire issue wasn’t “perfected” until all the servers were upgraded.
---
With the release date being announced I'm sure we have a bunch of new people here from the main sub.
---
blizzard defending white knights out in full force.
---
The dude isn't interested in a discussion, he's interested int telling you why you're wrong. Just bail dude
---
Username does not check out 🤨
---
Lmao im just saying it was inconvenient and disapointing to people who expected a earlier release. Youre the one who decided to get butt hurt that people had differing opinions than yours. Plus the guy deleted his comments so you have no odea what I was actually replying.
---
Disappointment does not equal complaining.
---
Complaing about someones disapointment does equal complaining.
---
Then you're just re-releasing wow. I want to stay 60 in classic. new content is fine so long as level cap doesn't increase and invalidate everything.
---
If they wanna just release BC, then make separate servers for it and leave classic alone.
---
It's not really complicating it. You are going to have 10-15k people minimum per realm. That's a day long queue. You won't even get to play. Besides, the layering will last a few weeks at most per Ion:  [https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=234)
---
He gave his opinions, each time you just go “lol no” and then demand he give other reasons.
---
You’re a joke.
---
I don’t think there will be many layers. In some interviews they mentioned that you will still have a TON of players running around.
---
Each layer might be like 1-2k players, so jumping from layer to layer may be harder than you think.
---
Yes, but he is not the only person running the game.  He is the figurehead and gets a lot of flak for what is done, but he does not make the decisions alone.  He is also the guy who put a lot of work into a high level guild in bc that understood the ins and outs of the game to a very high degree.
---
New content itself would be far from vanilla for purists, so you may as well lean into it.
---
You're looking at it wrong, they have made "Classic Summer: Lite! Now with 72% less summer; for a slimmer summer feel!"
---
Fucking agree.
---
what facts? the ones that you would still call "my opinion"?
---
i already came up with facts, like more abilities, better designed abilities, better class design overall.. its all facts, and if its not then nothing is a fact for you, anything can be seen as an opinion
---
Well. To chip in my two cents, I'm a bit split on the issue. There's a few different ways they could have dealt with huge launch populations. Have a few straight up normal servers, which could mean that a lot of players wouldn't be able to log in for X amount of time(and some might be so turned off by this that they just decide to not play the game, ), sharding (which is cross-realm and kinda ruins realm identity, so... bleh, but makes it so that queues are virtually non-existent and everyone would be able to play), having a TON of servers (which will allow everyone a spot to play in the start, but once the initial rush of people are gone, you stand a high chance of having empty servers with very few players, necessitating server merges, which also might ruin realm communities and established identities), or... this solution. "Layering". Benefits of layering: for the most part, you'll have a full servers worth of people around you at most times, except ironically enough probably around peak hours. You have some of the same issues as sharding, namely not being able to see your friends if you log on after them and a new layer generates. However, people won't randomly disappear for you, and server identity should roughly be preserved (I don't think that you're going to have people championing "layer first" boss kills in raids, because it scales to the number of players and it's all happening on the same server). So, this kinda acts like a series of constantly occurring server merges of mini-servers all running on one bigger server. I personally think that this is an OK compromise between the two major methods of launches (servers vs. sharding) while also making it so that the player base doesn't have to wait on queue times. I'm cautiously optimistic.
---
Oh no, you’re illiterate *and* a snowflake :(
---
Opinions are worthless if they are not logical. Do you agree or disagree?
---
Someone will make an addon for it.
---
Not everyone in your guild will be on the same layer.
---
There will be discord groups for realms.
---
If it can be abused to gain an edge in leveling or gold farming, someone will put in the extra effort to do it.
---
Gotta take the training wheels off some time. Overpopulation is what launches are all about.
---

See ya in Azeroth!
---
Hope you like it.  
---
Bless!
---
The only abuse I could see is for a Tauren to be invited or invite an undead. One of them joins the layer that is on the other continent, and essentially no one will be leveling around them.
---
However, I truly don’t know how layering works and I feel many of us are just talking out of our asses.
---
No you're bitching. I'm just making fun of you for bitching at dumb things.
---
 I'm totally going to save a toon with the blood plague to unleash upon unsuspecting players when they least expect it...
---
My algorithm isn't perfect, but it's actually leaning in the direction that you'll be getting beta access. 
---
Haha, in all seriousness man thanks for the hype today. Got my Legion beta key from you a few years ago and a fan of the stream. Can't wait to see it all in action tomorrow.
---
Ah shit here we go again...
---
Considering an opinion isn’t all about logic, rather than personal preference, disagree entirely.
---
My favorite color is blue, my friends is red.
---
Is there a logical reason as to either one of us have the better opinion?  No.  Because it’s an opinion.
---
It's real easy mate, how about you say something like this: in BURNING CRUDE [x] occurred which is better then [Y] in VANILLA.
---
Gatekeeping, huh? I think you need to read what the subreddit is actually for.   
---
Not participating does indeed not invalidate your argument. Writing "I did not play all of those expansions and literally assumed they did introduce abilities during these expansions?" does however. At this point you're just writing fiction to fit your own narrative. And thats also why im done arguing with you.
---
Starting a subscription 2 weeks early to have access to a name? How is that shady lol
---
You're completely talking out of your ass.  Dynamic respawns on Blizzard servers didn't exist until TBC.
---
I think one thing we can agree on is that Blizzard’s decision to announce some of the most important Classic news in months through a bunch of individual streamers has been a giant clusterfuck. How exactly did they picture today going?
---
Why not just post a big dev watercooler in the morning, let people digest the information instead of “this guy said that”. Then lift the NDA and let the streamers post their videos in the afternoon.
---
Definitely, but at least we can take time off work with this much advance
---
To be fair, the team that decided Classic and BfA should share a subscription is probably completely removed from the Classic team. I doubt they had any say in the sub model at all.
---
"The first **few** weeks"  
---
And I thought one week of sharding was pushing it. Two weeks, yeah that'd not vanilla wow, there arew lvl 60s by then. A **few** weeks??? Blizzard you are literally so dumb I can't stand it.
---
I haven't had a single issue aside from zone overpopulation since Cata.  I know a lot of people had problems with WoD and such, but that wasn't universal, so I'm not particularly worried.
---
Yeh, the shittiest thing about this for me is that there isn't a reason to not roll on an extremely one sided server as the dominant faction. It could ruin server dynamics.
---
&gt; Or when the economy gets wrecked due to multiple layers worth of nodes. 
---
It would be wrecked one way or another regardless of which way they do this. Depopulated servers have the same problem, and overpopulated servers have an entirely different but arguably worse problem. 
---
&gt;Especially for 4-6 MONTHS
---
He says they expect it to only last for a few weeks. And they have stated it will not last longer than phase one regardless of populations. Phase 1 will not last 4-6 months, it could be as short as one month.
---
Yes.  Well there are to me, anyway.
---
&gt;Forget alternate timeline. Do BC and LK again but in the style of vanilla without level cap increase. (Or skip BC and just do vanilla LK.)
---
Certainly seems like we are talking about rereleasing the content.  You need some sort of reset or the stats just get out of line, there is absolutely no way they can release that much content without having an increase in power of some sort, too many people are motivated by making their character more powerful and without that incentive you just won't be able to have the raids be successful.  I like how you just think its also just when you are the one talking about in vanilla style, which I never implied or said we couldnt do that.  There still needs to be some sort of reset between them or we will run into walls with stats.
---
1. World PvP is not going to ramp up significantly until honor rewards in Phase 2 (when layering is done).
---
2. Without layering or some other magical solution, we are all going to be in a massive shitstorm on release day/week. Every single person on the server is going to be crowding one of only about 4 starting zones.
---
oh shit you were close as hell
---
If you want to cry go to your shrink
---
um, how "classic" are we talking?
---
I wouldn't mind new models and textures.
---
I hope you're right
---
Hmmm, a post with 15 points shows up below a ton of posts with 3-6 points... Just so happens to be the post that perfectly explains the situation too.
---
Just check your email. 
---
If you get one it will be there.
---
Nobody knows when they will send them exactly.
---
My guess is around noon EST.
---
maybe you should ask on a runes of magic forum
---
Came back here to say rip
---
If you’re raiding when layering is going on, your biggest threat will be not tripping in the lava.
---
You’ll be bulldozing lower levels as you walk into MC.
---
I DID play Vanilla, BC, WoTLK, and Cata. And I've kept up to date with the other expansions. Simply not knowing how many abilities are introduced past this point is redundant if we're arguing about Vanilla, BC, WOTLK. That's why your argument is a non-sequitir.
---
Will take years to get to that point but maybe? A lot of things can happen
---
Cross-realm BGs are an authentic part of Vanilla.  So why would anyone ever want to go without them?  What's the downside of always having a robust, busy queue for all BGs with minimal waits or none at all?
---
Is there some boner that we're supposed to have for being restricted to only fighting against opposing faction players from our own server??

Battlegroups were introduced in patch 1.12.  Classic is based on 1.12.  There is no logical reason to hate on cross-realm BGs...only some fanatical, nostalgic clinging to old pre-1.12 Vanilla.  That's something you'll just have to get past.
---
So you're telling me there's a chance!
---
Why do you say this? 
---
Why wouldnt it be a shared sub? You would get less people interested if it required a separate sub.
---
Not only that...already a lot of people are upset there is a sub at all.
---
Always knew the Maelstorm has to be somewhere near South East Asia and India... always fucking turbulence when flying over India.
---
The reason, as explained, is to avoid phasing in and out of zones, these layers make it so that everyone you see around will stick around and not phase out unless they leave the continent, log out, or get invited by someone in a different layer. It's the best possible solution.
---
Was not expecting that lol fucking lost it
---
"The first few weeks..."  
---
Thats like.. borderline unacceptable. One week, pushing it. Two weeks, yeah that's not Vanilla WoW. A FEW WEEKS??? WHAAAAT THE FFFFFFFFFFFF
---
I agree, but like you say, theres nothing specific at all about it, so I find it worrying.
---
Lmao make sure to read that edit.
---
its not about things occurring in the game, i dont care about that all that much, im not a lore guy
---
You're a good friend.
---
Normally I'd agree with you but sharding/layering/phasing or whatever you want to call it is a massive issue. This isn't just some generic blah blah is underpowered whine. People have voiced their concerns over this since the moment Vanilla was announced.
---
You can check my post history, 99% defending Blizzard but this is a genuine concern and one that shouldn't be dismissed.
---
Sharding kills games.
---
If they are going through all this work to have higher server pop I don’t know why they are doing cross-realm BGs.
---
&gt; new models and assets to make the game look like it was released in 2019 not 2004
---
I was hoping for a bit more "HD Remake" at least as an option, new character models and animations and upscaled textures.
---
I'd honestly rather just skip some quests + add to server cap than have sharding but will play either way.
---
I don't think you understood how the layers work, there is no phasing in and out, each layer covers an entire continent.
---
Oh no, you’re illiterate :(
---
I’m gonna try one last time to explain this to you one last time: NO, the layering size is NOT 100% set in stone. This is the point you seem to be sperging over and are unable to comprehend. 
---
Now, there *have* been reports from the streamer videos that the layers will be around 2-2.5k
---
Could they be wrong? Sure!
---
**NOW ASSUMING THEYRE NOT WRONG ——WHICH, AGAIN, THEY COULD BE BUT PROBABLY ARE NOT—— **
---
That therefore would mean layers are the functional equivalent of servers because the size of a layer is the size of server 
---
Good luck!
---
Like I said earlier, if he conceeds his position is a result of personal preference, I hold no weight in his opinion. If I told you BLUE IS THE BEST COLOR and you asked me why, but I couldn't tell you why, would you believe me? No. He thinks blue is the best color and I asked him why.
---
Nah, it's not a classic wow collectors anyway. It has in game flying mounts
---
You got me. Totally trying to troll with this post.
---
Confirmed that it won’t happen
---
for the bfa beta it just went through client no email.
---
It’s definitely Chipotle-away
---
Damn it, know I am going to waste money! But I can't get mad with you!
---
Yet you still can't find a point where I claimed that streaner fanboys would follow me around. You make claims that you know you can't back up and when asked to back them up you play dumb.
---
That's a really good point. Flavor balance is the most important thing, imo. There's always gonna be a 'best' spec, even in retail they don't have a huge variety of specs performing top notch stuff. Mythic Dungeon Invitational only saw Blood DKs as tanks, for example. So numbers balance isn't super important to me, as long as there are no outliers, but flavor balance in retail is shit because the specs are so homogenized and they had all their cool stuff gutted
---
Nobody knows
---
And battlegroups were a giant improvement which we will all enjoy throughout Classic.
---
Some updated models even could be nice on some armor sets
---
Content helped shift the DK specs. I was an unholy DK tank to start but switched to frosty because of the armor and lol-dualwield in Ulduar and ToC, then ran Blood as offspec until maining that in ICC.
---
OK. We've reached our conclusion right here folks.
---
It would be dope if they split your character once you crossed the portal. That way you can still play on vanilla server (with possibly new content in future years) or play on the BC server.
---
Wait, are we getting BC era stuff? I can flex pretty hard with mini tyrael
---
A lot of that wasn't just the content, but the massive balance changes they had for DKs as well.
---
That's the effect of something being a net gain. There's no escaping negatives from any solution they choose so you choose one that has more positives. What would you propose to fix what you deem unacceptable?
---
I am. Yes, I do hate myself
---
Except for killing proper guild recruitment and likely being the cause of future realm splits. They're essentially saying "if my calculations are correct far less people will be playing on day 60 then on day 7." Based on what, exactly? "You think you do but you don't?" One can only assume. The last time they underestimated classic's launch the early experience was ruined for millions of players.
---
Did you read the comment I replied to?
---
I didn't make any judgement at all about whether a shared sub should or shouldn't be a thing, I don't really care either way. I'm just saying that the classic devs are probably not the ones who made that decision (thus responsible for the 'problem' of day 1 tourism), Blizzard almost certainly has some other group that decides that sort of thing.
---
Yeah imagine paying for 3 months to be subbed all summer to BFA just to have a chance of playing beta and then having to buy a fourth month to actually play when it releases.
---
Why are you acting like he made a statement along the lines of “BC and WoTLK are 100% better than vanilla and no one can disagree”
---
The dude gave his opinion.  His personal preference.  You want him to provide a fucking scientific report on why he holds his opinion.
---
You’re being a gigantic twat because someone has a different opinion than you.  Way to go.
---
What does this mean?
---
So many people complaining that dont even have a sub currently .... be more entitled
---
I sometimes questions if these people were around during release....holy fuck those queue times.
---
Since you probably wont read it. 
---
After seeing about all your post getting mad at people stating that the release is simply inconvenient for them, and all your "cool" hotwheels I can come to the conclusion that you have done little with your life. So its natrual for you to get mad at someone whos actually taking care of themselves and trying to better theor lives.
---
I did not say anything about being cool because I was in health care I simply argued against the other poster pointing out that people in college have a lot more free time than highschool students. In my reply i explained how rigours some college programs be.
---
It didn't have to be lore related. It could really be anything.
---
OK, I think we've reached the pinnacle of our disagreement. Lets agree to disagree.
---
The majority of this sub doesn't want a faithful vanilla server. They'll get whatever they want, sadly.
---
LOL!! Exactly how are battlegroups, rapid BG queuing and a much wider variety of opponents to fight "fucking trash" which make the game worse?
---
I get the feeling that any reasons you fart out are going to be extremely stupid.
---
And accountants 😢
---
CE was about 100 USD at vanilla launch, fyi. I expect any new vanilla wow pets to be no less than that. (I am aware the ebay editions are much higher)
---
I agree number balance is not super important, but IMO everything should be *viable* where you do not feel like you are a massive detriment to the group by playing what you are playing in a casual-semihardcore level(note, this does not mean homogenized either).  At the hardcore and superhardcore level there will always be absolute minmaxing, and that cannot be avoided.
---
Heck yeah, brother! Way to echo the REAL supporters of Classic WoW's sentiments! In fact, I'm going to go buy some stuff on the retail shop just to support them. Another knock out of the park, Ion and co.!
---
Some new lower level content could make rolling alts more fun. I know I don’t have time for multiple Alts but if there were new quest lines could be fun
---
I think that’s probably how they wanted you to experience it. If you really wanna up your game you need to snag one of the “Judith” bottles from his vineyard. The grapes were grown from the land where her ashes were spread.
---
Sorry for the crap resolution, I played on 800x600 back then.
---
Like Zul'Aman, a tough dungeon that supplemented without usurping raid items.
---
I really enjoyed ZA because my raid team want amazing at 25, but we had a seriously good 10 man team.
---
Seriously. I'm thinking of learning Russian so I can actually play this fucking game again.
---
like what? 
---
arenas happening is good enough?
---
Hell yeah can’t wait for Vanilla Jad
---
By my rough calculations I'll have time to listen to this on a 24/7 loop one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight times before the launch of classic.
---
Oof! I’m actually considering playing a hunter if all of my friends want to roll horde (paladin if alliance), partially for the relative ease of levelling since I won’t have too much time.
---
Thanks for this. I was prepared to lose sleep tonight over it but now immsleepign like a babggyktotf
---
I never played the game in its prime so these are exciting times.
---
Because they plan on cramming a ton of people into one server. It's not at all about solving the "problem" with starting zone populations on normal vanilla-sized servers, it's about fitting more total people on one server at launch without sacrificing the overall gameplay experience. Having 10000+ people on a normal server would screw things up regardless of which zone you are in, not just the starting zones. 
---
They do this because they predict a lot of people won't play the game for very long, and they don't want "dead" servers after only a few weeks due to all the "tourists" leaving. So they overload the servers at launch, and then hopefully the populations will stabilise to somewhat normal levels after a few weeks (or whenever phase 1 ends), if they are still overpopulated by then they could do things like opening up free transfers to new servers and stuff like that. 
---
In my opinion it's a much better solution than having a bunch of depopulated realms (and if they merge them, that *really* fucks up the community building), or having totally overcrowded realms.
---
Sorry to hear you’re losing your family. Just think of all the sick gear you’ll have though
---
I'm not acting like that. He stated his opinion was bc and wotlk were better, and I just asked why. He gave his answer, it was completely illogical, and now you're white knighting with pathetic color arguments I can easily destroy.
---
If he had a good argument, as I've stated before, MAYBE I would've changed my opinion.
---
Saved. Thanks for all your hard work!
---
Not like college is that difficult. There’s no real exams until a month or so in. But social life will take a hit. That’s mostly why I left WoW when I was a senior in hs
---
Anyone hoping for a queue-less launch is laughable.  Hype is high.  Survive the hype and keep playing.
---
assuming i want grandkids? i actually never wanna be called grandad, thats fucking depressing. dad would be good enough.
---
Haha yeah right OP. As soon as the game is released, both of us are never checking this crybaby sub again!
---
I thought they are including the new models with a toggle in the options for old models?  Been a while since the blizzcon test so I forget if that was in there.
---
Yes, every class is wanted in a raid. Even by the guilds that manage to clear Naxxramas in under 90 minutes.
---
The key difference is how many of each of these classes are brought to raid. Extra optimized raids might only bring 1 druid, 1 hunter and 12+ warriors. More casual raids will bring in more druids/hunters and worry less about bringing the optimal number of classes/the optimal specs.
---
How was his answers illogical?  Please tell.  
---
You’re using your personal opinion as “logic” and if what someone says doesn’t line up with your personal opinion, it’s then “illogical”
---
You’re a joke
---
Hi, /u/Ultima1221
---
No because classic WOW raiding is part of the game not some end game, there are also other things to do in the game. I still remember one of my friend who acted like a merchant and stayed level 30 but had more gold by collecting materials and selling them, while I was fighting mobs as a Max level player with him.
---
Uhh I don't think that logic holds up at all. Are you expecting to find a raiding guild by level 30? They are absolutely not saying that. It makes total sense that the mad rush of people will be over after a month and it will be more stable and the playerbase should be far more spread out by that stage (which is the reason they're doing this..)
---
There arent any even left there
---
Could add abilities with Librams and Relics, too.
---
!remindme 80days wow classic
---
Most people prefer not to spend their vacation days to play WoW
---
Its going to be online. Just join some Discords, those release events are always fucking hilarious and spectacular.
---
Don't expect any 'official' IRL release events.
---
LOL! Bullshit bullshit bullshit!
---
Constant server crashes and queues. I don’t want to relive that.
---
No [they shouldnt just re-release TBC/Wrath]. They are open to doing post-Naxx content, they should do that with what they got right in TBC/Wrath. They could easily add Jewelcrafting and sockets for new gear sets.
---
For the love of FUCK don’t CRBG us OCE players with US servers...
---
Standing in a queue is a terrible analogy for playing a game.
---
I had over 168 days played before the first xpac. That's what I'm afraid of. On the plus side I'll be in a world class guild with that kind of commitment.
---
Canyourunit
---
Google that and see if you can run any of the versions of the client
---
Can someone explain the difference between sharding and layering to me?
---
did you watch the video? Ion says that within a few weeks, depending on players spreading out layering could be gone. I doubt it will last for months.
---
His answer was illogical because he didn't have any specifics to justify why he arrived at the answer "blue is better".
---
I am both consistent and logical because I do not care about the answer. I only care about the logical reasoning to arrive at the answer. So, if he provides superior reasoning why he things bc/wotlk were better, and I can't out reason him, he changes my mind. He couldn't, so following, I didn't change my opinion.
---
What good is having an opinion if you aren't willing to challenge it? 🤔
---
"If you really want to not get ganked your best bet is to be a higher level" lol that's probably the stupidest thing I've heard today. But yea play warlock/hunter. Tbh most classes are ok vs rogue unless he gets a nasty open with prep.
---
Ion lied. He said it was only going to be in the first starting zones for maybe a week or two. Wrong. It will be a for a month or more, across ALL zones. This is incredibly exploitable. Not only can the exploitable nature of layering damage server economies, it will severely hurt server communities. It's almost like Stockholm syndrome at this point.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
LMAO. This is literally *exactly* the kind of thing people pushing for the changes that ruined Retail were saying on the Blizz forums circa 2005-2009. "Us cajoowulz who are the majority want ez epixx and LFR and transmog and you're just a grouchy neckbeard".  You people are going to ruin the game all over again, I can't believe it.
---
I’m sure they’ll turn it back on for these events.
---
Retail will definitely be using layering over sharding from now on. They’ll use the code for large events in both games.
---
I will be on a cruise ship on release.  Won’t be able to play until the 7th of Sep.
---
great picture
---
Yes, arenas could be a good example. If that's something you believe was better then classic, that's a valid point!
---
This is a lie, layering can still phase you in and out, it's just on a bigger scale than sharding. It's basically the same thing.
---
Here's what I mean.
---
Classic WoW, most of the game was pretty new to Warcraft lore, besides the Undead zones, for obvious reasons.
---
You had a lot of threats and characters we didn't see before. The Qiraji, Ragnaros,  Nefarian, Onyxia, etc. It brought a lot new to the table.
---
TBC and Wrath used a lot of War3 characters and locations. Most of the big bosses in TBC was just War3 characters, and the worst raid in TBC was regurigating the last ROC mission.
---
Cata.... was mostly regurgitated stuff from Classic and War2. They way they brought back Nefarian and Onyxia was just really stupid, imo, even for Warcraft standards.
---
I liked Mists of Pandaria for that. It didn't use War3 nearly as much as previous expansions, at least not character wise. It brought a lot of cool new stuff. It probably added the most new stuff to the Warcraft canon since Classic. 
---
Warlords, regurgitated War2/TBC, tiny bit of War3.
---
You think you want it but we know better
---
You will fall behind the ppl who already did play it.
---
But that shouldnt and wont matter really to your game experiences
---
**NOW ASSUMING THEYRE NOT WRONG ——WHICH, AGAIN, THEY COULD BE BUT PROBABLY ARE NOT——**
---
That **therefore** would mean layers are the functional equivalent of servers because the size of a layer is the size of server 
---
This is the classic community we are talking about. Not known for being reasonable about solutions to server issues. Half the people here think Blizz should just let it roll and let launch be an absolute disaster cause #nochanges
---
Layering seems like a solid fix for the tourist phase. By week 4 my bet is most servers won't even have more than 1 layer. Sure some streamer servers will be fucked. But classic was never met to accommodate streamer sperg populations. Just avoid those and you good.
---
3-4K is manageable. You gotta remember that it’s being released on a Tuesday also. Many people won’t be able to get on in time and will be spread out over the evening and week.
---
10k is awful...you’d literally be waiting in lines.
---
I think I somehow got used to the 4am or 11pm launches. This is easy mode.
---
This might actually get me to start playing again. Will I be allowed to have an SM/Ruin lock again??
---
your whole fucking post, the fact you're bitching... all these things of these streamers you claim is gonna affect YOUR game play. that is your points and claims... its within your whole fucking post you idiot. You're the only one making claims out of thin air...
---
If you have to sub, then Ill have to pass on that. They'll get my money when the game goes live.
---
&gt; wPVP is pointless
---
I agree it needs more. This is why I'm for post-Naxx content, because it creates chances for that.
---
&gt; even ground 
---
That isnt how war works. These arent friendly exercises, it's a goddamn faction conflict. 
---
&gt; flying gets you exactly what you want
---
Which is the world as little easily digested bits. Which is the precursor to retail. So thanks for confirming flying is part of what's wrong with retail, I guess.
---
How long is phase 1? A month of layering will severely impact overall economy for servers and community. People are forgetting this is for every zone, not like when Ion said it would only be in the starting zones for a week or two. He lied directly to your face and you delusional slaves keep eating whatever Blizzard shit's in your plate.
---
Golden.
---
I'm not either, I was hoping the /s was obvious
---
I already call it modern WoW for exactly that reason, although if I'm talking to someone who calls it retail I adjust accordingly to cause as little confusion as possible :)
---
Everyone is talking about new raid content, but what's wrong with adding new content for sub-60 play?  Something to keep leveling alts fresh?  Better crafting recipes for low levels, new 5 mans, etc.
---
Yeah, stuff that "undebatedly" makes the game better, like transmog and LFR. We heard the same story throughout Vanilla, TBC, and Wotlk until you guys finally completely ruined the game, like you are going to do again this time around. This sucks so much.
---
I feel for EU. But your right there is a silver lining if you can nolife.
---
As a Retail scum let me tell you something. People do not abuse sharding as often as you think in world pvp. Intentionally at least. Every single person you try to poke in the bum bum will not mystically whoosh away. You will only see it MAYBE once up to a few times ever, especially due to the differences Layering introduces. Getting a friend on another layer wont be incredibly easy to replicate
---
So you are sad there were many people? If they had a cap like 3k om pretty sure you would not feel that way.
---
We've known about sharding for months. What's with all the sudden outrage?
---
Nostalgia overload
---
"be grateful" They can be "grateful" when they receive my hard earned money. You blizzdrones are some of the most spineless, pathetic people I've ever come across. Truly the best consumer slave to exist on this planet.
---
Does anyone know if Classic will be using the updated models? If not will there be an option to toggle between new and old?
---
How am I going to stave off wanting to kill myself that much longer?
---
Okay so let’s say you’re right.
---
Wtf is the point of having layers able to interact with each other then?
---
Practice casually you should be able to get to rank 10.
---
People are over reacting and being stupid. Now they are crying about a sub for classic and sharding when both were known months ago.
---
Wow thats Burning Legion, Beastlyben was in my guild. I was a young kid named Aurorisper
---
WRONG. You're interested in white-knighting because you both agree wotlk is better then Vanilla. SAD!
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
I can't relate tbh but I would think that anything that you and your son can do together and enjoy will be a huge impact on both his life and yours. World of warcraft can be played simply. You and your son can dive into numerous different tasks like fishing, exploration, crafting, fighting, ect. There is a TON of content. I believe your son can learn a lot from the game with player interactions and buying/selling items in the market place. Believe it or not WOW can be very educational. I think it would be a great addition for you and your son to enjoy. I'd love to hear how it goes if you do choose to give it a try.
---
That has nothing to do with it though. Many people believe sharding/layering/phasing killed server communities. I tend to agree.
---
Just for a laugh guys. If we end Phase 1 with max pops on all servers it will be a happy problem to have.
---
Shantus in that screenshot is a long time friend, wtf...
---
Yes, that was kinda my point.
---
I like to go on an angry rant in the forums on how I paid my hard earned money for this game and I finally had time outside of work to sit down and play for the first time in ages, and then the servers are down and that the game is junk and I want my money back.
---
There's still guilds that chat? Lul I've not seen any since Wotlk guess it's my server
---
The leveling period is where layering is most noticeable. Still very disappointing to hear Blizzard is implementing it.
---
Looks interesting. Thanks
---
I thought this as well lol. I was at the tool show in Birmingham AL when they first announced the release date. Amazing show.
---
I kinda like the collection. I'm considering buying this as a way of voting with my wallet for more WoW classic styled products.
---
Played WoW in Vanilla/TBC/WOTLK starting in 2005 and can confirm it did consume my life :) happily so, great memories.
---
Layering is just sharding on a bigger scale. You can still phase in and out. This will severely impact the server economy and overall community. I was hyped about Classic, not anymore. And no one knows how long phase 1 will last, the game could have layering for months.
---
&gt;you can just merge regular servers when they get low enough population
---
Great! Your top raiding guild just fell down to #5 because you were merged with medium population US-Leroy Jenkins. Also, your name was already taken on that server, so you will need to change that. Additionally, the economy was a little inflated on that other server, so now you are immensely behind all the other players in gold.
---
With layering you’re already taking care of those items. You can track other guilds even though they are zoning in and out of your layer. Your name is reserved, and the economy doesn’t change because it’s the server economy.
---
It's over BTW. Looks like the majority of people in this subreddit, the supposed vanguard and champions of Vanilla WoW, want a shit ton of changes to the game, including class balancing, new raid tiers, and all the QoL garbage from retail.
---
It was indeed Burning Legion, holy crap small world!
---
You should watch the video, the devs are talking on camera - it's not 'this guy said that'
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo&amp;t=0s
---
My biggest fear is that blizzard will underestimate the proportion of players that will stay on a server in the long run and create too many layers per server. Resulting in some servers being extremely overpopulated when the layers are merged as promised.
---
What guild were you in??
---
You're an idiot. Vanilla was the best version of WoW for the community. Layering/sharding kills server community, along with potentially damaging an economy.
---
I’m 18 in college on break after my first year. Never got to experience the craze since I was a wee lad then, but I’m going to chose grades since I did bad this past 2 semesters.
---
If she's the one she'd join you.
---
Not yet actually, they made profiles but have yet to allow any of their songs to be streamed.
---
I'm in the same situation and had the same aspirations. I'm not convinced I'll play either.
---
Any way you spin it, a clarification on this would most likely lose them money
---
Perfect.. love your posts!
---
are they going to balance it equal to what it actually was?  Like Undead rouges everywhere?
---
Didn't know this existed.  Will be nice to revisit for my Paladin alt when I wanna keep the AFK smacking with a hammer to a minimum.  Thanks for sharing!
---
\^\^
---
3-4K without dynamic respawns will be an absolute nightmare. That's like 900 humans(Most popular race) in Northshire Abbey.
---
They would never had done 10k without sharding, which is much preferable over this for a smooth launch.
---
Student here, classes start week prior to release. Its some bullshit. And not summer...
---
I would love a separate TBC server and would probably split my time 50/50 between Vanilla and TBC if they did that.
---
Sadly, I am 99% sure the expansions and new content will be forced on the existing Vanilla servers. It looks like the majority of this sub just did not learn the lesson of Retail.
---
The only thing I could see someone doing is creating a Tauren and having their Undead friend add them to a group. So the Tauren is added to the under city area layer.
---
I guess the Tauren has an easier way to level and farm mats?
---
But if this is only being created for the first month or so, will those mats really be valuable? Also, you’ll be missing out on playing with other newbies.
---
I just realistically don’t see a way to exploit this.
---
2021... it’s going to be a ‘Burning Summer’.
---
Blizzard announced the classic wow release, and you could buy classic collectors edition.
---
FREE DOMESTIC SHIPPING ON ALL ORDERS OVER $100 USD. 
---
Collectors edition cost is $99.99
---
&gt; And I don’t know where you’ve got the idea that astronomical calendar is most used
---
Have you ever looked at a calendar? Seasons on every calendar use the astronomical seasons. Or Google? Google gives you that, too. Anywhere you look, official dates for seasons use the astronomical calendar. Just because school starts or weather changes or whatever else people want to use is happening every September, that doesn't make September autumn. It just means that you have a month of school at the end of Summer, or a cold end of summer, etc.
---
404 = not found.
---
You're right though, classic may not be for me. I'm more of a Vanilla Wow guy.
---
Im pretty positive i have receieved emails for all beta access i have gotten through blizzard.
---
Overwatch, diablo 3, HOTS, starcraft 2
---
But maybe not for a wow expansion? Idk. I havent gotten a beta for wow since...patch 0.6 i think it was? And i dont even remember how exclusive that beta was lol irs been so damn long and i was like 12 and my neighbors dad got beta invites.
---
Blizz makes a fatal mistake and cheaps out on hardware and user experience.
---
I was in a handful, but the most prominent ones were probably Frozen/Eternal Prophets, Defiance who later split and became Exodus I believe, Ascension. And of course I remember all the top ones from our server like AEnigma and on horde side Ropetown and Og
---
yeah, i think so
---
The whole point of Classic is server permanence and community. Before Cross realm bg’s you would only face people on your server. This is important to see people outside of bg’s in the world and develop rivalries which blend into bg’s. You are either dumb or a troll based on your replies to this thread so far.
---
Then so be it. I’ll take someone abusing the system over queue times and server crashes any day of the week.
---
&gt;edge in leveling
---
lol I have like 6 hours total a week to play....yeah I really care about someone cheating to out level me.
---
Wisdom for the ages, and why we should all DURID!
---
You really were that upset that you looked through my history. Lol. You are truly pathetic. Wow. 
---
If it makes you happy, you will notice that my post/comment karma is around 1.5k each but I keep a very small number of posts and delete after a few months or so and keep only the most recent interests because of fucking weird people on the internet like yourself. 
---
It's also very mature of you to assume my life and compare that to prop yourself up to be the one "actually taking care of themselves and trying to better their lives." 
---
You called the guy's Computer Science major a "relatively tame" major compared to your "rigorous" work. You come off as incredibly entitled and spoiled. You downplay and judge others while picturing yourself as the downtrodden hero. I hope the best for you and get over yourself sooner than later.

Also just for you, joined this year - https://imgur.com/Rt9tzP1

Cool ad hominem bud.

Sharding is a per zone thing. So say you enter Westfall, youd be in shard 1. Then if you went back into another zone, then back into Westfall you could be in shard 5. Also it doesn't care about when you logged in or anything, or on your guild. You could be shifted at any time the zone is deemed to have to many people in it.            
---
Layering however is the ENTIRE world. If you go from one zone to the other, you'll still be in the same layer. You also stay in the same layer when you log in, unless you join groups in a different layer. They also said you'd be favoured to be put into layers that your guild is in as well. Also I don't think you could randomly phase into a different layer unless you join a group, compared to sharding.       
---

---
There's a ion video that explains it well, but thats how I understand it from an unbiased pov from shitting on either.
---
a year long journey to see if it could be done on modern infrastructure. that's what he's said in an interview elsewhere
---
I think it's just a modified sharding - instead of sharding only locally, they're extending it to the entire game world.
---
Sharding - puts you in a different dimension if there is more than ?40? People in your area, meaning the people around you are irrelevant and forgettable.
---
Layering - everyone on the server is put into a layer, say the first 3000 people get placed into layer one, once that is full layer 2 continues to get filled up and so on. You are stuck to the layer you are in, except if you are invited to a party from some one in a different layer then you change to theirs temporarily.
---
You cannot just change at will, and guilds will be prioritized into the same layer. 
---
It's basically an easier way to control the massive population at the start and when the tourists leave, layers get collapsed into one another. The idea is to have this at the start to avoid servers dieing. 
---
Eventually once the core playerbase is established they will hopefully have collapsed all layers and most servers will have a healthy, give or take, population without the need of mass server xfers from overcrowded to dead servers.
---
That's the best I got.
---
Shaman for me. Ghost form will be prime time for me!
---
I’ll level my alt that was my main in Classic (Orc Warrior) around February when I have more time.
---
I am more hyped for this than I was for Clegane Bowl, circa season 6
---
I'm a college student who was a grown man when Vanilla released.  While it may not be optimal for my playtime, it's fine.  I work full time and go to school, so I'll just modulate my playtime to a few hours a week. I'm glad Blizzard is supporting the Classic Wow movement by releasing the original game.  
---
Certainly I get it that "Classic Summer" implies that a large chunk of summer would be available for players.  But that's the breaks, and I'd rather have the game than not.  I don't mean to minimize someone's frustration, but what are you going to do?
---
I recall 2002-2003, renting a house with a bunch of friends, all of us ssalivating over the possibilities for World of Warcraft.  Release dates seemed to vanish in the wind - perhaps that's just a poor memory talking, but it seemed like we'd get the game before November.  Yet it was released what, after Thanksgiving?
---
It's fine.  My playtime for a long while won't be what I would probably maintain during the summer but as an oldie McOldster I'm just glad to have the chance to play classic on an official server.
---
You know these choices aren't mutually exclusive, right?
---
Awesome! Do you perhaps have a source stating this?
---
I’m all for realm community but I also played on a realm that slowly dwindled into insanely low pop.  That wasn’t fun at all, and if your guys’ answer to the problem that layering is attempting to fix is “have a lot of realms and merge them later” then where is that sense of community you’re also adamant about?  I’m not pumped on this layering thing either but you can’t have your cake and eat it too, there has to be some kind of compromise.
---
Are you fit real? Go play the latest version of the game instead please, your mentality lines up better with that design...
---
r/wow
---
This is where you belong, bud.
---
cat is for FITE
---
No I know the info is coming from legit sources. I just think this was a bad way to spread it.
---
I’m not going to say it isn’t rough, but imagine if they don’t do layering? Fucking chaos....it’ll be fucking chaos.
---
It would be rough for anyone who hasn't planned well and isn't ahead of the pack.
---
Layering will help new and casual players for sure.
---
Glad to hear that's who Blizzards priority is for what is supposed to be Vanilla Wow. 
---
Definitely what the hardcore Vanilla community has been lobbying for for the past decade. Totally.
---
Wow cool, Shantus and a bunch of guys from my LAN Center were in Eternal Prophets. I didn't join Eternal Prophets until BC. Heres one of my old screenshots https://i.imgur.com/LNeErTk.png
---
It will just ruin and make the entire experience cheaper tho.
---
Look up what that term means, read my post and then look in the mirror.
---
Assume they are not using as many servers rather than inferior servers
---
I don't and the fact that I seem to be in the minority here is literally crushing my heart. I'm kind of devastated at how pro-changes this sub ended up being.
---
Server communities were long dead before sharding though. Unless you're trying to say layering is going to already kill the community single handedly by just existing
---
Sorry, im not quite understanding. So can you redeem exclusives from the 2004 collectors edition into this new Classic WoW server if you still have the code? (Like the zergling/panda/diablo pets)?
---
EXACTLY THIS. the economy is going to be completely ruined my this. Let alone world pvp :(
---
This is the definition of a ^(minor) issue.
---
Oh yes, because I don’t believe people need to deliver a 10 page report on why they have their opinions, to be able to acknowledge that it’s simply an opinion.
---
Thanks for making me feel better about myself.  Sorry you’re such a sad person.  
---
Cheers.
---
You're right
---
No prob
---
Can’t you just be happy that this is even happening in the first place? I don’t want to see this go down the same way as retail either but they now have two separate products. Live and classic. They both have very clear design guidelines and the pessimism about this launch is getting whack, do yourself a favour and just breathe for a second
---
See this is actual quality trolling. This I can respect.
---
I wonder if it's going to be exactly like classic or like Classic Plus with like quality of life adjustments that we've seen. Also I wonder if it go up to Burning Crusade eventually, that was the best expansion and I would play it again lol.
---
there's some way to do it, I don't know the specifics, but yeah if you had classic back in the day
---
I promise, ill be at the game son. *shows up as the kids shake hands at the end* 
---
Being technically right doesn't help your case. The end of August is barely summer. Id rather them not say anything until they had a proper date.
---
Would you not be upset if a company said 2019 an released it December 31th?
---
Classic wow doesn’t have a retail folder?
---
Can you tell me your magical strat that new 60s will have a RELIABLE way to hop into every layer to gain this huge advantage in resources?
---
Rofl what the fuck?  So if you’re a no lifer you’re the only one allowed to enjoy vanilla wow now?  What a joke.
---
hey for real your grades are more important for right now
---
... but try at least to get laid some, ya know?
---
But people can only get separated from you if they get an invite from a person in a different layer than them.. that doesn't sound like a common occurrence at all
---
Why would you ask us and not blizzard support?
---
This is so MAJOR!
---
Sheesh people are hard to please
---
Spread out? Every player with a few hours a night who follows a guide'll be level 60. It's a game that you know if you want to play after a few days, maybe a week. If you make it past level 10 players are usually hooked. A month is WAY too damn long. First two zones and a week is what we were promised and it made about a million times more sense. Guilds should be able to level together before raiding together. You can weed out the people you don't want in the guild in instances so they don't. Besides, PvP guilds may as well form at level 1.
---
Someone didn't get his tendies today.

Found it. Looks like anyone can do it. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=806
---
It’s been sold out for a while now. If you really want it, you can always get it on eBay for like 3x the price after Blizzard ships them to the scalpers.
---
I think you're honestly trying to explain stuff to a brick wall. It's not going to suddenly understand no matter how hard you try, or how you break down the information
---
And you're an idiot to assume that everyone will be playing a PvP server and actively searching for the same enemies they faced in BGs out in the open world.  Nice narrow view of WoW.
---
Are battlegroups supposed to somehow threaten "server permanence"?  Do you have any idea how retarded you sound?
---
As for the community aspect, I get the feeling that open world gameplay experience, guilds, public chat channels, and dungeon/raid groups will provide PLENTY of opportunity to give players the old community that Vanilla players coveted so much.  If you think cross-realm BGs are going to somehow damage this, then you truly are as mentally deficient as you sound.
---
If you don't like battlegroups, don't play Classic.  It's that simple.
---
almost the best scenario, means u wont have a fucked up sleep schedule lol
---
the reason wow became the way it did was because of "Quality of Life" changes that lazy/shitty players whined for on the forum. if you think that taking the OSRS route for wow will lead to anything different than exactly the same shit we have with retail... i dont know what to tell you.
---
Outrage comes in waves, because not everybody browses reddit every day of the week. Window shoppers agree with the memes that reflect the most recent piece of news they've heard (even if its old news being reiterated on).
---
$1000 pm me
---
Check the cliff notes of the presentation at BlizzCon this last year, pretty sure they said you can't. You can redeem on retail though.
---
The second layer is only going to have 2000 people?
---
You still haven't provided a source, I watched tips and read/seen short clips all day, have yet to hear 2 layers max per server.
---
no, they existed in vanilla too. I remember a friend telling me he refused to play retail when he could play for free. this was in High school. I was in college when BC came out.
---
Do we know if it’s all at once tomorrow or in waves of invites over the next months?
---
I like many will be checking my e-mail incessantly, every single minute. This would be relieving to clarify.
---
Does that mean the zergling/panda/diablo pets will carry over to classic wow?
---
They should add it in as an optional boss with mount or tabard for guilds who can manage it. I'd be interested in seeing what people come up with to get it done.
---
It's literally not as bad as sharding. Not sure why people keep trying to bias people when they don't understand it LOL
---
Got me!
---
As that skull rogue pops out of cloak and is about to hit me for 300 more than my total health, I’ll have a whisper already sent to my guild mate to add me to his layer (hoping that he’s in a different layer). I’ll send the whisper and be added to the new layer all in .0001 second!
---
It's 3000 players per layer and a new one will be automatically created when the first one hits the cap. Why do you think Blizzard would create more layers if they are underestimating how many players there will be?
---
So are anti-layers people somehow in belief that they’d get to level at all the first week of classic release if there was no form of sharding? Must not be actual old school players, or have never played WoW when it was populated. I’d never waste my time if there weren’t sharding in place. Millions of people are going to come back for classic, who cares about a shared sub? If it was $15 standalone people would gladly fork over another sub fee just to play it.
---
I seriously think you overestimate how much people care about this shit.  Why the fuck would people go through all that work everyday to attempt to avoid getting ganked?  Sounds like you’re trying to apply the worst case scenario try hards mindset on entire servers.  I guarantee 99% of people could care less about “later hopping” while they’re trying to level.
---
Are you really going to compare a private server launch with what's probably going to be the biggest launch of an mmo in the last decade?
---
&gt; The unfortunate reality is that you're letting people whos job it is to problem solve without affecting your experience change that experience. I don't know why you're throwing your hands up and going "well, I can't think of anything better, so great job!" when it's not your job to think of those things.
---
So all medicine with side effects are created by incompetent people? Just because you want a cure for cancer, doesn't make it possible.
---
I don't think your second point makes any sense. If you log off and log back in the next day, the people in the new layer are now part of are not going to be 3000 completely new faces, they will still be people from the same server. It might not be the same 3000 people from yesterday, but probably some of the ones from yesterday are logging on back like you and will be put into the same layer (since its not full yet).
---
Also, I don't think there will be more than 6,000 people one one server after normalization and dispersion, and so if each layer holds 3000 people (which im not sure is confirmed), the chance of you seeing the same player twice in two days is 25% which is not that low and is not even that simple. 
---
The people in your layer everyday might be regulars, because you all happen to have the same schedules in your lives and are logging on at the same time of day, so the majority of you will fall into the same layer that isnt full  yet.
---
Do not play a pure game of probablity and numbers with this because it is a dynamic system and is determined by a lot of convulted variables which we have no idea of.
---
I FUCKING CALLED IT
---
I thought it was the macro? Or I mightve missed part of the discussion
---
You honestly believe servers in 2019 would have the same problems servers had in 2004?
---
I imagined you were sounding Mario in "here we goooo" and then I thought of the "waaaaaah" death sound
---
A little late but as a person who doesn’t play WoW, can anyone explain to me why everyone is really excited for this?
---
It doesn't say it lasts the whole phase 1....
---
Calm down Mert, you’re all over this thread being scared.
---
Wouldn’t the resources just be realm wide regardless of what layer you are technically on?
---
Lol calm down bud, thinking is hard for you. I don’t know why you’re so fervently for cross realm bg’s. They can add them in if queue’s are a problem,  but initially in phase 3 there will be no need for cross realm bg’s. 
---
If you don’t like battlegroups, don’t play Classic. Now that is just full retard. You could have said the same thing about loot trading or many other things that upset the community. I and many others will push for getting a genuine Classic experience.
---
Please don’t respond because you have proven incapable of rationale thought.
---
I wonder if Naxx gear would have been enough of a boost for it to be possible.
---
It's "intents and purposes" by the way - a lot of people get that wrong.
---
Name reservations are occurring prior to launch - does this imply we'll get a realm list and have to choose a realm at the time we reserve a name? 
---
Aside from specifying a realm, I can't think of a way this name reservation service would be possible.
---
For example if servers are allowed to have six layers of 3000 players each on launch week and the server still has a population of 9000 players after four months then the server will be overpopulated.
---
Honestly, it seems like a reasonable compromise. You'll still be able to talk to people on your server, you just won't have 30 people on top of each other competing for the same mobs for quests. Especially since multiple people can't tag the same mobs in classic. As someone who's been playing on a private server that's absolutely insanely overcrowded, I can personally attest as to how frustrating it is to have way too many people in one area trying to quest.
---
That’s what I don’t get about people throwing a fit about the layering and over abundance of mats.
---
I could run around Azeroth and find fresh nodes and the such everywhere on a regular server....you know why? Because you fucks are lazy when it comes to farming. There’s always been an abundance of mats in the world, everyone just chose not to farm them.
---
September 16th here
---
I hope we have focus target as a healer. I don't use focus target macros but I do just like having the boss focus targeted so I can see the progress since I'm always targeting players.
---
On that note, I wonder if they'll have the  ability to have nameplates turned on in combat only? Did Vanilla have that? That's super useful to me as well.
---
He explained it really well. I agree with him. We can sit here with our #nochanges and big dreams for what it should be like but Blizzard is handling this realistically. I think this is a great idea to kick things off in a stable fashion.
---
Yeah and I would venture that Vanilla is in that state. You can bring a few oomkin, an ele sham and still clear raids
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060713000428/http://wow.allakhazam.com/dyn/mobs/rare.html
---
The character models will be the 1.12 version, as you can see if you check out any of the beta footage. 
---
As far as a toggle, I don't think anyone has straight out said there will not be one, but I highly doubt there will be.
---
That's completely untrue. If you are referring to realm population then that's an entirely different argument.
---
A decent pop server with no phasing was so much tighter that servers are today. It was a pub where you knew everyone, even the assholes. Compare that to the current state of servers where it feels like public transport where there's a new face every time you hop on.
---
I remember back in the day my friend used to level with a black book. Every time we got ganked he put that person's name in his book and if we were them again it was on. Good luck ever being able to do that with phasing implemented.
---
And what if they get their Spectral Tigers too?
---
2004 servers had 2-3k. These servers will be running 10-12k
---
I played on a underpopulated server in WoW Vanilla and will never return to that.
---
This was a huge goal of mine when I got to 60, man all that planning down the drain.
---
I really, honestly, believe that people will see how badly WoW has aged and detest going backwards.  I fully believe classic population will quickly dwindle leaving only 1-3 servers left after a year or so.
---
It will either be altered beyond the expectations of real classic fans, or people will quickly remember how abhorrently awful and time consuming it was organizing dungeons and raids without QoL additions.
---
It will be negatively impacted by South American players in a way that classic WoW wasn't.  Gold farming will be worse.  Time commitment is double or greater.  The content has been played and covered ad nauseum.
---
I am happy it exists for the handful of people interested elitists.  But truly expect a quick honeymoon phase.
---
Obviously # of layers == # of shards on live./s
---
The majority of people want that?  You sure?  You seem mighty confident with that assertion.
---
Same. Although I never played Cata onwards so I'm curious.
---
you can seriously sell it for $1k+
---
i am desperate for you to be right
---
I mean they have said each layer will hold 2000-3000 people. 
---
if you base it off this poll:
---
https://i.imgur.com/JojLGnM.png
---
Then the most popular race is human with 22.2%, which would be 444-666 people in the human starting zone. 
---
So yeah it would probably be pretty bad to begin with but surely no worse than when the game actually was released?
---
Am I the only person who thought current content Uld in wotlk was the perfect balance of challenge and fun?  I'd love to see a lvl 60 version but, tbh I would still play a wotlk version again.
---
When they bring back the bug but not actual classic content.
---
If people want to grind for the mount let them smh. I know a lot of people had those mounts as a goal.
---
Yeah, no.
---
Agreed. They knew they had to get it done before classic otherwise they'd all get immersed into the game and never finish it.
---
Strong agree. If you want "balanced" (almost the exact same) classes, new content every month, transmog and other "QoL" changes, just play Retail. Because that is almost certainly what they mean by "new content". The same garbage from retail.
---
I can play for 30 minutes until I have to go to work...
---
“Summer”
---
Wow, the world keeps getting smaller! Sorry, keep switching usernames on you because I'm going back and forth between phone and computer.
---
But was Eternal Prophets being run by Chundee (NE Priest) or Shayker (NE Hunter) at the point you joined? So When I initially joined Frozen Prophets, Stow (dwarf hunter) was the leader, and he and all his officers were still pre-level 60. I fondly remember running 15 man raid groups on some of the end game 5 man dungeons like LBRS to get dungeon set 1 gear lol. Anyway, at some point, Frozen Prophets disbanded for reasons I forget, but not too long after they came back and made Eternal Prophets. Stow was the leader once again and I rejoined, and then some time after that he decided to quit but as a guild Eternal Prophets kept going, so that's when I left for the last time. Does any of that sound vaguely familiar? This was like 13 years ago and I was 17 at the time so I may have some details a bit off
---
To be frank Retail should be called standard, and classic should be called modern or legacy.
---
It will have the updated graphics but also a "classic mode" that will make the graphics the same as they were back then so people have an option.
---
This is what I like to see.
---
He's playing one of the most survivable classes in the game and he nearly dies several times and ends the fight low on HP and even lower on Mana.
---
Yes super easy omg it's going to suck. 
---
/s
---
Because they're all going to get merged into 1 server after phase 1 ends...
---
It's there to avoid people sitting in queues during the first phase cuz of influx of players. But it can easily be exploited. Plus if that influx of players doesn't die down after phase 1, then you're going to have an overpopulated server once they merge and you will see long queue times trying to login to that server. Or layering will extend beyond phase 1.
---
So much for a classic summer
---
It's just vanilla wow, the original that was released back in 2004 before the expansions.
---
Cool shitpost, take your downvote.
---
Chill bud been playing private servers for the last 5 years
---
As cute as libram of the taunting crusader would be, I can't imagine them adding full on abilities, especially not through items.
---
Was this you in modelviewer or at the end of vanilla
---
This would be the way to do it. Vanilla servers, TBC servers, Wotlk servers - separate. Don't force Vanilla servers to move to TBC/Wotlk or force "new content" changes on Vanilla servers. 
---
If Blizz is feeling generous, they can give people the option to clone/move to the new expansion servers. Otherwise we can just re-roll on the new servers and keep our Vanilla servers intact. I would love to level a Belf rogue on a TBC server. I would quit the game if my Vanilla toons were forced to TBC/Wotlk though.
---
I play the class I like playing, and don't particularly care what's the most "optimal"
---
Tekneek?
---
Keep crying nerd they might just can it all together if people like you get your way
---
Six days ago.  Stop fellating yourself.
---
The layers are for the entire world so it wouldn't effect travel at all.
---
Thank you!
---
Not necessarily. My understanding is that they want to reduce players in the same area. So those 9000 players will be spread out across Azeroth, so the server can handle that many people. Or for instance, they break into 4K on Kalimdor and 4K on Eastern Kingdoms. You’re not interacting with the people in Eastern Kingdoms if you’re in Kalimdor, so why should you care what they are doing?
---
You're kidding right? Its the whole continent that is layered, your level doesn't matter.
---
Log in a level 1 alt, invite a level 60. Job done.
---
Yeah classic is just wow before any expansions came out.
---
no problem :)
---
Loot trading
---
There is a difference between 'can still clear the raid' and 'feel like I contributed a reasonable amount' though, and I also feel those do not meet that second definition enough.
---
Wowhead bought it and basically shut it down. All the relevant data got migrated to Wowhead
---
Yes. But please figure something else outside of a man-made thing to make you happy. Do what you do, but that's my recommendation.
---
Of course there open to it. ClassicWow garnered more interest/hype than their last expansion.
---
Yet you make such a stupid comment...
---
You want the "retail guys" to be involved in new content for WoW classic?
---
Alright I am now convinced that a lot of the posters in this thread are Blizz plants.
---
i hope not but i doubt they give a shit
---
I think layers are shared between EK and kalimdor right? So in that case, joining the undeads group could cause you to join a different layer, but it could also still be the same. Leaving you in a no different spot.       
---
However I remember one interview was talking about taking a zeppelin from across the continents, people on that zepp would be still in the same layer as eachother when they switch over.            
---
But worst case what could happen is that you  and your friend are in different layers, you leave a layer that has 100 people in that zone for one that could have 80. Or it could have more and now you're fucked
---
I think it's that they just don't understand layering.
---
Thats so sad...
---
People just want to be mad to be mad.
---
99.9% of players won't fuck with r14. Let us have pvp whenever we log on that's all I want to play wow for. Hate playing private servers where there's no pvp for NA times because everyone is asleep.
---
Death doesn't happen that quickly in vanilla unless of course there's a vast level gap like in your example. Please use your head before responding next time
---
Being forced to spend a while putting a group together to spend an hour or longer running a dungeon, while spending fifteen+ minutes getting to the dungeon led to a lot of casual chat coupled with a premium placed on good, competent people.
---
If you were good, you quickly gained a harem of friends who would readily run dungeons with you, and you had regular casual banter with them.
---
AKA you had friends who were fun to hang out with.
---
The LFG system that was brought in largely destroyed that, especially once it crossed servers. Couple that with the instant port to the dungeon and dungeons that lasted no longer than 15 minutes made it so that there were no lasting connections made.
---
This is what people talk about when they lament the loss of community.
---
Proof of 10-12k pop?
---
Wowhead absorbed it.
---
I bet there will be a new site that comes out that is reminiscent of original Wowhead, which was a clean site with a Google like minimalist style. Now it isn't so great - none of the current database sites are.
---
Data was mined by people running software while playing the game and uploading it.
---
Layering seems like an awfully large-scale system to implement for such a short duration, especially at a sensitive time like launch. I'd prefer sharding because it's a known entity. The exploits have already been dealt with, and it can be restricted to a handful of zones rather than affecting the whole world. Don't like sharding? Then hit level 10 and it's not an issue anymore.
---
Where does it say you can reserve names?
---
Eh, the pets would be cooler
---
Bet you've never played a F r e s h before .... Your gonna change your mind real quick 😂
---
I wouldn’t know. My server crashed multiple times and I was sitting in 2 hour queues during release.
---
Anyone who complains about layering wasn’t there for the initial release.
---
Yeah people are going to get bored after a year, that's why everyone stopped playing Vanilla 15 years ago and we are all currently enjoying Retail and Blizzard isn't making WoW Classic.
---
Oh, wait.
---
Exactly. Problems are going to happen and they need to be solved or at least worked on. Blizz can't just say fuck it because then they wouldn't care about their own game.
---
Layering will be gone by the time farming starts.
---
I have, and your just willing to sack the community for being able to do your quests in peace. Does not impress :)
---
They’re creating layering for server population. That’s the endgame here. They don’t want to have 150 dead servers with 1500 players running around, while other servers are maxed.
---
They have said in a few interviews that these servers will be holding much more than the initial 2004 servers.
---
Still doesn't excuse their behavior. It's not that hard to logically think about something.
---
All of this was true for vanilla also. Xrealm came during 1.12 and there was still plenty of folks trying to get the R14 grind done.
---
R14 in and of itself is a terrible design, and going from a 4 hour downtime to a 0 hour downtime changes nothing since only like 1% of players can dedicate 20 hours a day to a game.
---
This really isn’t an issue
---
My college classes start on the 26th! Ugh
---
1.) Your examples are terrible. There was debate about those features since they were announced, which was months before they were ever implemented. Tons of players expressed concern about LFR and as much so for transmog.
---
2.) Your use of a second person pronoun as if I specifically am at fault for the decline of Modern WoW is more evidence of you just looking for a fight, being inflammatory. 
---
I stopped playing Modern WoW after Firelands dude. I got sick of that shit long ago, but there are some things that Blizzard has gotten right since Vanilla and to deny that is like saying water isn't wet. The evidence is right in front of you in the fact that there still exists a Modern WoW. Modern isnt the same game that Classic will be, but the slippery slope fallacy isnt valid either in saying that any change down the road will eventually lead to current Modem WoW. Logic indicates that if we're to be much more selective about the changes implemented down the road, A WoW:Remastered server could be better than either Classic or Modern.
---
My argument also still doesn't dismiss you getting what you want, but rather unearths the underlying fear you're trying to use to rally a mob.
---
It really is a dick move to hate people just because they dont have toes.
---
oh neat, thanks   ('-')b

Wasnt that bannable?

AUS here. It's gone. I stood no chance.

Original launch date post https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule:

&gt;If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13
---
shill thread
---
HE LITERALLY SAYS FOR A FEW WEEKS. A single world per realm after afew weeks.
---
So you try and release a game to millions of people. You just gonna sit back and not try to address the issue that many people will be connecting at once? This is going to happen no matter what and it's best blizz finds a solution that works or else why should they even try and release the servers? At least they care enough to be open with the community on how they want to handle it.
---
Skipped school to play WoW back in the day......This Fall will be my first time teaching. I can't skip anymore. Feels bad. T-T
---
Damn that's a shame. I don't think the years 2004-2006 are ever coming back.
---
More buyable mount choices in the style of classic is not a bad thing imo. It's just simply more choice.
---
he cant, you're a retard
---
Exactly! It's not like they'll magically know they're on Layer 4 and you're on Layer 1. And you attack someone and they're fast enough to ask their friend to invite them, the friend does that, and they whoosh away before you kill them? Pretty unlikely I think
---
How much would it cost?
---
We are already outnumbered right now. Look at the top posts in this thread. They're going to ruin the game for a second time. At least we have a guaranteed \~2 years of a good game, then we can go back to the non-Blizz alternatives and these people can vote for their QoL and welfare epix and make the game a piece of crap again.
---
So, I’m being chased by a level 60 warrior as my level 45. I message my guildie to add me to a group to get me out of my layer. He adds me....but oh shit I’m still in the same layer as the level 60. I reach out to another friend not in my guild to add me to his party now and he adds me and poof I’m gone!
---
Do you really think during this exchange I’m going to be doing this? If this does become a problem, couldn’t the devs write a line of code saying:
---
If in combat != added to party
---
Dude, this isn’t going to be a problem. Y’all need to stop getting angry about pointless things.
---
Also, it seems that you don't change shards unless forced through grouping with friends on a different layer.
---
It's like giant shards that are fixed until you log out/group with someone on another shard.
---
This joke has layers
---
I can't tell if you're trolling.  You literally just described how they wanted to implement sharding.  Everyone bitched about it, so now we get layering.
---
Make up your damn mind.
---
Why? Why is it unfair that somebody that's put in time and effort could absolutely demolish someone that hasn't? 
---
That's like saying Khalil Mack shouldn't be able to beat me in a fight because we're both 6'3".
---
I think they're cool, if I had the choice between armored and unarmored nightsabers at the same time, I'd still take unarmored
---
oh good point
---
If you login to wowhead via battle net you can have access to the thottbot theme, not the same but it's pretty close

Let's say it lasts 3 months. In one year you probably won't even give a shit how it happened because you'll be raiding and actually playing the game. Dice fucked up bf4's launch and one year later people didn't care because it had solid gameplay and it all worked out.
---
Mine starts August 8 :(
---
I know you made this as a meme, but do we know if keys have even been sent out at all? Or is the start of beta tomorrow coming along with the idea that keys are sent out tomorrow?
---
And I am aware they just activate accounts, not send keys :)
---
Cya in a couple of years when you vote on garbage that ruins the game again, dork.
---
You'll still be able to play with your friends won't you ? 😂 It's only for a few weeks dude gets grip
---
r/wowthanksimcured
---
exactly
---
It's crucial that they create the right amount of servers or there will be empty ones regardless. I trust they will.
---
nah model is wod , cant go back to old model now i think
---
So your level 1 alt is going to GAURANTEE getting into a different layer than the 60 you want to invite?       
---
Pretty sure its not going to work out that way. Now sure, you could have a lot of alts to start cycling through hoping you could hit the layer you want. But you wouldn't be able to, unless you have multiple people commited to just doing nothing but sitting there for you to swap
---
I know. Look how respectful his post is and he was -15 before I upvoted. The amount of pro-changes opinions suddenly showing up is... suspicious.
---
This is the right opinion. You didn't miss anything. Cata was the shark jump.
---
Don't need to necessarily add ability, could just make an ability do something extra.  Libram of the Taunting Crusader - when you judge with seal of the x you taunt the target.  Or something.  Don't judge the wording I have there it is pretty awful, I am sure they could figure something out.
---
This guy put out a non-hunter focused, written guide with an accompanying video.  He will also be updating/improving it before classic launches.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bnvj92/alliance_160_guide_as_war_5days_w_4x300prof
---
They said that this *might be* the only service they provide. They did not go in depth. They did not share details.
---
Don't jump overboard until you are sure that the ship is sinking.
---
I feel like this is not the hill to die on over vanilla WoW. 
---
It's not ideal but this is one of the smaller things to complain about.
---
Yeah, no one was playing Vanilla in 2017 because everyone got bored of it years ago. Right?
---
I think its great. Less people will participate in the launch that way. A lot of people probably just say fuck it and start in the morning.
---
This way the launch is more smooth and not as crowded for people that are cool with playing at midnight.
---
Yeah, I did see a really bad explanation. Layering is great!
---
Why are we crying about this, just wait a few weeks when sharding/layering is switched off then start your game ?
---
many old comments that people made on thottbot are actually available on classic wowhead now
---
I'm with you my friend. I'm disabled and have PTSD so I don't get out much. None of that will matter when I awaken in Deathknell as an undead warlock ready to kill alliance scum
---
If you look closely, it seems like all 8 Alliance classes (and all 4 races) are represented, from left to right:
---
Human Mage
---
Human Paladin
---
Human Warrior
---
Night Elf Rogue
---
Night Elf Hunter (background)
---
Night Elf Druid
---
Gnome Warlock
---
Dwarf Priest
---
That's funny. I started playing just as TBC was launching. I was questing in plaguelands when some Samaritan whispered me and basically said "Dude wtf are you doing, go to outlands."
---
My wife and I played together briefly from wrath through cata before life got hectic. Now that everything's settled down it's gonna be great to start from the beginning again.
---
Largely cause they were free.
---
How long are people going to pay a sucb to play a 16yr old game that will never advance.
---
Eventually everyone will want a TBC server.
---
Still waiting to see if we even get oceanic servers
---
believe it or not, new content doesn't have to be balance changes, it can just be a new dungeon or an event.
---
Don’t have the link, But Ion and Calia interview dropped today where he said each layer will have same cap as actual vanilla servers.
---
The fact that there will be less people on a Tuesday that late playing is a dream for those who want to level faster
---
&gt;With layered servers, you wouldn't have to worry about getting a 30 min queue...
---
With layered servers more then 10% of the population can stick around and give such high queues because now its far more then 3k concurrent players trying to login...  
---
Also 10% of 9k is 9 hundred players, that is hardly considered a overcrowded server if the peak times have 900 people online.
---
I got u
---
If they add LFR, then they will have to make yet another classic classic wow
---
If you're the one who invites them, they will phase to your layer if you're on different ones and vice versa. It's like sharding but supposedly isn't as zealous about redistributing players continuously - it's "stickier" than sharding.
---
 Keeping unarmored mounts in the game permanently is a better solution than removing them entirely.
---
📷
---
Hmm roughly $7.50 worth of sub time in order to save 3 names...
---
Seems worth it to me.
---
They were removed in 1.4.  I told you all at the start that they wouldn't be in because it was based on 1.12.
---
This is funny but uncomfortable to read.
---
Casuals who are willing to change the game because "its just phase 1" don't value the first few weeks anyway. 
---
Meanwhile No-Lifers are the reason Classic is even a thing. 
---
Regardless of what I think, you and the rest of the majority win. 
---
This is just one out of dozens of QOL changes to "Vanilla".
---
Its incredible that private servers, despite their flaws, are more blizz-like than what Blizzard itself can produce in 2019.
---
It’s basically wow with all the quality of life stuff ripped out and very little endgame content. I get why people are excited but deep down it’s not going to bring back the wonderment people felt first playing it.
---
So now we don't want classic? Cause that was a part of classic.
---
They confirmed today that there will be new server names so there is no confusion between classic and retail wow.
---
Yeah although I've heard the raiding was good so I would give it a go. Not really fussed either way.
---
It's not free farm because other non-mafia people are competing but there are mafia there 24/7, or at least there were around the peak days of the server that rebooted the original popular private server. I was involved in the Devilsaur shit fairly intensely (12-16 hours per day) for a few months so I know how it was at least on the server I was on. As an American, I was staying up at very unusual times when I was on the losing end of the cartel-mafia war (hard to be on the winning end with 100+ ping), in order to have less (but still some) competition. There will be plenty of people sleeping abnormal hours for their time zone in order to maintain their farm.
---
Blizzard GMs have been forbidden from doing this for years now.  So it’s not gonna just change now for nostalgia purposes.
---
they literally say first few weeks in the dev interviews, it wont be in for months.
---
I have no problem with it, i support it, but how is (REALM1LAYER1+REALM1LAYER2+REALM1LAYER4+REALM1LAYER4) different from (REALM1 REALM2 REALM3 REALM4) if the final result is (realm1=realm1layer1)?
---
Each realm gets layers, so less over all "realms".  Same amount of mergers BUT less people mad for losing their realm names.
---
the textures and whatnot are better because of higher graphic engine or w/e other techincal term, but they didnt change it. it just looks more polished because of the higher tech available.
---
Yeah we just enjoy different aspects. I literally laughed out loud when they announced MoP. We just go our separate ways.
---
So many people are going to be disappointed when that nostalgic feeling disappears.
---
By that logic all the raids and content should be released on the day of release.
---
Yup thats ringing a bell! Chundee sounds familiar, do you remember Fuzzsickle? He was an FP/EP dwarf priest that went to my LAN center. What a fun time! I was even younger then that but I loved it
---
Uh huh, and it was at one time only in the starting zones at release.
---
Now it's server wide for a few weeks.
---
3k visible players and like 10k on world chat is not a sacked community by any means.
---
So if I've never played this game before, is this where I should start?
---
There was a post not even 2 hours ago saying the Layering will last AT MOST until phase two but is expected to last only 2-3 weeks. No its not going to let you phase out in front of someone. It only happens on loading screens and when you join a group on a different layer. Stop bitching like a spoiled child that got sprinkles instead of oreo dust on their icecream.
---
how having 3k visible people kills the community if vanilla servers capped at 2.5k. lmao. you have no idea what you are talking about
---
Would love a confirmation on this too. Hoping that because we have a release time on their schedule that it’s a good sign for us.
---
&gt;Layers hold thousands of people, I wouldn't be too worried about this. 
---
It's not about the number of people. It's simple probability. Say you meet someone on a server that has two layers. You both log off for the day. Tomorrow when you both log in there is a 50% chance that you both end up in the same layer. If you don't, then you wont be able to interact even if you're in the same area resulting in a missed opportunity. This gets progressively worse with more layers. Three layers? 33% chance of being on the same layer. Four? 25%. This is going to be especially damaging because I always liked to meet people in starting zones.
---
&gt;Without this you would see so many hordes of players I doubt there would be so much close interaction.
---
WoW's peak player base numbers were during WotLK and this was never a problem. Some people loved playing hugely popular servers and some people liked more quiet ones. You always had your options. I loved seeing servers full of life, even if it meant queuing up for things.
---
Already said that guilds will be in the same layer. So no you won’t.
---
You know they dont give a shit becuase it's cosmetic and does not effect gameplay.
---
They've been going the cheapest rout all the way through straight into maintenance.
---
They dont care about real classic.
---
Plus with the first week of leveling I’ll at least be able to do SOMETHING, so it works.
---
I really wish I had more screenshots saved :( The 4-5 I have are because I uploaded them to photobucket to show friends, but I had an entire folder of screenshots that got lost when we got rid of our old computer. What I'd give to have that entire folder back today...
---
If you were around for the changes that ruined WoW, then you know that those changes were done with the intention of making the game better. That it took months/years for the negative effects of flying to be apparent. That "casuals" will 100% force the issue of easy raiding, instant travel, and other immersion breaking anti-social garbage like that. So on and so forth.
---
I argued against those changes back in the day and I can see it as clear as day from the "changes" being suggested on this subreddit are in the same vain as the ones that led to Retail WoW. There is an upvoted post in one of the threads about doing class balancing. Already. Before the game is out.
---
It's over.
---
There you go with your arbitrarily ridiculous level gaps again. a much more likely scenario is that two people who are very close to the same level, one engages the other in PvP combat, one doesn't like that it's happening and has more than enough time to message his friend to invite him really quick, thus teleporting him away to a different layer, and thus ruining world PVP
---
&gt; Death doesn't happen that quickly in vanilla unless of course there's a vast level gap like in your example.
---
It doesn’t happen unless of course it does happen.
---
So should we re-skin all the Tier 2 armor back to it's pre-refresh state?
---
You guys need to shut the fuck up already.
---
Not sure yet. Trying to save for computer.
---
And different countries have different definitions of the seasons. 
---
In Australia winter goes from 1st of June to 31st of August. And as our seasons are the opposite of the northern hemisphere when we hear summer from you those are the dates we think of.
---
Yeah, he's wrong. The fallacy you were actually using in your original post was the "no true Scotsman".
---
Well, then there’s the problem solved right there!
---
All mine are lost too. I'd give anything to see them all. My oldest I can find are from TBC.
---
It's almost like people value things differently and aren't exactly the same.... Weird.
---
Cause there's no other site like discord to discuss things across layers.
---
Yes I do remember that name! My hope with classic wow is that moments like this will happen, if people make characters of the same race/class/name and run into people they played with 15+ years ago.

He was in a guild called "Primodial Fury" on the Mithaniel Marr server. Those were the good days.

Yup exactly! I have a few on hard drives, but the core of my screenshots are totally gone
---
That's why I said "at the moment."
---
This is the main thing that people are not getting about layering.
---
It's not entirely like sharding. It's nothing like sharding on retail. It's like mega-scale fixed sharding to ensure server longevity after the tourists leave.
---
Right when busy season at work starts. Thanks Blizz.
---
I bet Blizz actually gets more subs due to all the fuss. People will bitch about it to everyone they know and spread the word about the game.
---
Are you for real kid? You dont even have your gallon bottles for water and relief lined up next to your grime encrusted battle station. Listen Carefully
---
The. Layering. Makes. Zero. Difference. After. Three. Weeks. If you honestly plan on maxing a toon, and getting MC/Devilsaurs on farm within the first month of release you're either a massive neckbeard (and your opinion doesnt matter because you'll play anyway) or you plan on playing like modern wow, treating end-game post-60 content as the only content. Either way you're acting like an entitled child. Chill out and play the game. And i better not hear a single complaint in Trade chat or barrens chat until phase 3.
---
CLASSES START 20 AUG THO
---
But couldn't you assume that with 3-5x the amount of farmable resources, comes 3-5x population and the amount of hardcore players increases by 3-5x? More resources being farmed by more hardcore players?
---
Not at all.  They aren't going to put in things they removed earlier.  They aren't un-nerfing AV and slowly nerfing it over time.  It was a changed product in 1.12, and that's what you are getting.  
---
Loot that was no longer available in 1.12 isn't going to be in at release.
---
I really don't understand these posts.  Blizz doesn't care about students playing for the first time, nor vanilla veteran adults.
---
The release date is to simply catch people after the hype of patch 8.2 cools off.  I'd imagine that after launch, Classic phase releases and Retail patches will be spaced out perfectly to maximize MAU's.  It's literally all they talk about in their earnings calls.
---
Can a paladin break a trap by running over it with freedom on?
---
I wouldn't mind new elite quest areas that reward extra attributes, recipe upgrades, maybe a talent point or two. Would be a good way to scale our characters up in way other than gear... I love raiding but it would be fun to do some challenging quest lines out in the world.
---
However, Blizzard developers have said that you will be “stickied” to the same layers as your guildies and friends. How many of your friends were also not in your guild? Additionally, are you going to be fast enough to message your friend, have them un-AFK and add you to a group....only hoping that you do not share the same layer as that person you are pvping?
---
How do we even know that once you initiate a PvP you’re stuck in that layer with them? We seriously don’t know....
---
Nope he literally has 20 odd parts about an hour long giving a literally walk through 1-60, mind blowing effort on his part tbh

Holy shit you sound like a piece of shit hahahaha can you count your friends on one hand?

---
I got sheet music of the intro tattooed on my arm. Such a good song, definitely worth naming a toon after.
---
Addons killed it...
---
That's exactly what I was thinking! I want to main a Troll Priest so I'll level that myself but when she's available to play for a bit she wanted to be an Undead Warlock so I'll level an Undead Mage to eventually use for DM farming. :D
---
Goodluck to yourself and the two of you!
---
The whole reason they had to expand is because people losing interest and running out of content. Genius
---
No. Its just another mount to buy. They can just up the price to 1000g for them. More options.
---
Just note though that Horde will be your only option, since there's no Alliance shamans in Classic. Likewise, no Horde Paladins. (Unless I missed something)
---
Yes you can you will be playing with the same people on your layer day in day out then eventually a bunch more people will be on your server too including all the old people.
---
pretty much how i read it. atleast i got to block off my schedule for release =\\
---
I get it, layering will make the launch days a more pleasant experience as you will actually be able to kill mobs and complete quests instead of hanging out with literally thousands of players. But isn't that what you want for the launch days? Ok, so I can get across the logic for the start phase. Perhaps 1-2 weeks but for the whole of phase 1? Crazy...
---
Like many have mentioned the resources (especially on higher levels) will be multiplied by the number of layers which will affect some players ability to farm more successfully, but some of these mats will only be available to the hardcore player base who rush to high levels quickly anyway, leaving them virtually unobtainable for the majority of the player base for however long it takes gen pop to get levels. This being said though, it will be quite un-vanilla when it comes to rare BoE blues (often BiS for long periods of time for many classes) and other exciting world drops. By the time layering is over there will be 3-4x as many of these items available on AH because for the first month there were 3-x as many of the mobs available to kill. This will skew the economy and players with these items hugely, don't you think?
---
You are chosen a layer and you stay within that layer from what ion said in the dec interview
---
ad hominem means attacking the person not the argument
---
how is this an ad hominem?
---
Please don't try and sound educated when ya ain't brother.
---
Yeah - better option is to just make an alt for farming stuff.
---
Aww or else? Entitled child? Your the dumb customer that blizz loves, accepting everything and question nothing. Good job your a sheep :)

“Fortunate Son” by CCR if it’s a PVP server

Wowhead has restored the old thottbot comments it's pretty cool

You can also check the archvied version of thottbot  [https://web.archive.org/web/20061209213304/http://www.thottbot.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20061209213304/http://www.thottbot.com/)
---
It's scummy but I'm honestly hoping they're monitising this much to avoid implementing a Store... but who knows at this point. I'll still play, but Im expecting a store to ruin it a year in or so.
---
Naturally i whipped up the thottbot, looked at the rewards. Scryer had a freaking epic EPIC mage ring!
---
Grandir was cool actually
---
I believe you are correct. Layering is worse than sharing, because it doesn't even fix the issue of gridlocks at certain points during leveling while even a 3,000 player shard is going to have these bottlenecks.
---
If vanilla has a 5k maximum population, it doesn't need to be specifically stated. 3000 per layer. 2 layers. One number is larger than the other.
---
yeah, if you want to ruin your future lol.  Its better to focus hard in college and then play when you just have a typical 9-5 and weekends
---
Pretty sure new stuff after naxx isn't vanilla.
---
I thought we all wanted vanilla wow?
---
They should remove gear from the game and just have classes balanced like Overwatch. Right brobeans?
---
I am fine with the concept of layering... but I’m worried it may overstay it’s welcome. Ion mentioned that it will NEVER exist after phase one, but he’s also alluded to the possibility it will only be here for a week or three. I get that it’s a necessity, but the shorter wait the better.
---
By those standards there are only a few days left, which will hardly be a Classic summer...
---
A while back, asmongold did a project 60 event where he  and a few other streamers leveled to 60 In bfa using as much as vanilla rules as they could. About 5 minutes into this event, I logged into a nelf I had waiting in the human starting area to see the carnage. I couldn't even tag a mob to get my quest done. It was insane. Luckily I decided to record it. 
---
So I thought this might add some insight to the layering debate.

That's what they are saying

I can’t stop laughing at this post 
---
Thanks for the laugh and for sharing 
---
🙌🏽
---
Because this thread is either being heavily astroturfed or a lot of people from r/wow are posting here right now.
---
&gt; It was a changed product in 1.12, and that's what you are getting.
---
None of what you said disputed my point.   
---
If you spergs that are so die hard about everything should be 1.12 then the content of 1.12 should be in from the getgo by that same logic.   
---
But its not. So clearly things are up for discussion as for what is best for the health of the game.   
---
More variety in mount choice is not a bad thing.
---
That’s not what it is at all. 
---
Shit post is shit.
---
Why is everyone using the "I want to make friends" argument?  There will still be plenty of people.  Would you whine if you were on a lower population server after a while because there are less players to make friends with?  Most people who are going to last in this game are not going to be wanting to be your friend at low levels.  Go ahead and add whoever you want to your friends list.  Within a few weeks there will be a huge level disparity and there will be no point.  Most of them will probably never log on again after a week.  The tradeoff for your "potential lost friends" is a more playable game, with more meaningful encounters with players rather than a faceless mob. (imagine the chat log on a popular stream.  More people to make friends with there right? Except its so crowded its completely flooded...)
---
He used the specific phrase 'a few weeks' like 4+ times in the interview I saw. (Ion)
---
People need to start rethinking what layering is.
---
It's basically just having more servers and merging them autonomously, without having multiple names and allowing for more reasonable queue times and having it scale with both launch and a year down the line.
---
People suggesting you "just merge servers later if populations become an issue" doesn't seem to be making an effort to understand what layering is
---
lol, -13 for a #nochanges statement.

---
Alright, let's do this. LEERRROOOOYYY JENKINS!!!!!!!
---
Uhhhh, he was actually the GM of a guild called Afterlife before WoW.
---
Yeah, like I said, that's why everyone is currently playing BfA and WoW has 50 million subs and no one plays or wants to play Vanilla anymore. You're right Zack.
---
Great...but all that it will do is maybe allow people to do what? "Hey rare spawn on me....no clue what layer I am in." Join their group and great. But travelling fast isn't really a thing on classic. So the server could literally fill by on run time alone.
---
Oh snap that's right. Afterlife was the shit!
---
Noooopppppeeeeee
---
Just add the unarmored ones to a cash/token-shop... ":)"
---
And you people are why retail wow is such a cesspool of cow manure.
---
There are several things that could be changed that wouldn't hurt the integrity of the game.  
---
Dual spec, mass loot, tracking on mini map not cancelling on death(think mining nodes)
---
&gt; And even though I'm in principle against any sort of changes like this
---
Why? Nothing about having massive queue times or being incapable to quest or having dead realms was ever a highlight of vanilla.
---
Yeah, but yeah.
---
Shoot yea its sounds like a real technical puzzle. If only they hadn't auctioned off the original server blades from a decade ago. Maybe the current private server crew can let them look at their servers or something.
---
I'm kidding obviously, but there's always a rationalization for changes. Casuals won't have a chance at unarmored mounts, so blizz decided that wasn't fair and took them out for everyone. Retail wow players won't like old graphics, so now we get updated worlds with better ground clutter and shadows. Casuals won't like hardcore original AV, so now we don't get summonable raid bosses in AV. Retail wow players have lots of battle.net friends they're used to communicating with, so now in-game x-faction communication is a thing.  On and on and on it goes.
---
It all reminds me of the minority of players that tried to warn everyone before LFG and LFR came out, or any of the other "necessary" changes to retail over the years. Same concerns, same dismissive replies.
---
Just keep an eye on it then. If this layering ends up only lasting a handful of weeks shit just might normalize itself to an acceptable level for you
---
I mean that's my point. It may be easy if you can tell your layer. And that you always join theirs. All they would need to do is make it completely random who's layer you join. To slow abuse down. I dunno. I don't think it will be a big issue. Most people aren't going to be working to abuse it.
---
someone called this a few days ago, was it you?
---
either way, well done
---
We've been calling modern retail much longer than blizz has been calling retail modern. By virtue of first come first served it stays.
---
Works pretty well.
---
Layers are just servers without a name. The only problem is layer hopping
---
A good point, sir! A cool video to back up you point aswell.  
---
But would this not be an insanely fun time to look back to?
---
I believe in you my dude.
---
I was under the impression that vanilla servers where 2.5-3k, and we have been told layers are 3k each?
---
They didn't exist in 1.12, they won't exist in Classic.
---
Get. The Fuck. Over it.
---
Kralnor was a way better meme than Alamo.
---
He does look rather satisfied with himself, doesn't he?
---
A.  Let's say there's 3x the number of players Blizz wants on a server so they create 3 layers.
---
B.  This means that there will be 3x the quantity of sellable items collected.
---
C.  However, because each layer has the same amount of people as a normal server would, there will be an equal amount of competition for resources in each layer.
---
D.  There will additionally be 3x the number of people (demand - see point A) trying to buy 3x the quantity of goods (supply - see point B).
---
With equal competition in each layer, and a proportionate amount of demand to counter the increased supply, you're a fucking idiot.
---
I had a blast! The video wasnt trying to prove anything. Just to show a recent glimpse of a starter zone hellscape. I also love as I'm recording someone says " we're going to burn this place to the ground!"
---
Considering I have a 4 days /played to 60 and will be in one of the first guilds to kill Rag, you really can't call me a casual.
---
I'm waiting faster!
---
Bruh... sell it... or better yet, get 60 and the best gear possible and then sell it
---
Cata was probably one of the worst expansions for the game given the design philosophy it started. They started the trend of destroying old zones and old content to drive a storyline that nobody cared about. The time shenanigans are out of control now too, and you have the confusing aspect of there being multiple copies of the same city, Dalaran being the prime example given that you can have more than one hearthstone set to it, each pointing to a different location and xpac.
---
r/WoW has over 1 million subscribers and we have 88k. I'd say not only is Retail more popular but their sub is astronomically so.
---
My friends called me thottbot cuz I knew every quest
---
No I don't
---
that's called sharding. And not only the starting zoens would be affected, i'm sure it would be like that for the first 3 zones
---
Doesn't excuse you from having stupid ass ideas.
---
The fact that people don't understand that new changes can have unintended and devastating consequences... after what we saw in Retail. I'm at a loss.
---
Honestly I'm extremely disappointed... I'm a PhD student with barely any free time, I was really looking forward to using my small amount of extra free time this summer to grind :(
---
that looks awesome
---
2-3 months is best imo, but realistically i think they are gonna do 4-5 months
---
Hope you're right.
---
If you really think that flying is the sole reason that Retail sucks, I don't know what to tell you.
---
For any kiwis here... 10am NZST.
---
They will force you to move, and that is where Classic WoW ends for me and I get back to other games.
---
Unfortunately the first couple weeks is the part of classic (and any expansion) that I am most excited for.
---
My main thing is speed leveling and hardcore preparation + execution of the first few weeks in order to separate myself from the pack economically and in progression.
---
That is all jeopardized by layering unless they're able to identify and address all possible means of exploitation, which is doubtful. 
---
Also, with their announcement that unarmored mounts are being removed for everyone so that casual levelers won't feel rushed to get to 60, they have set a precedent for removing realm-first achievements in later expansions. 
---
Its fine though. At this point I am used to being in the small minority of players that Blizzard disregards in favor of appeasing the masses. It started in WOTLK and obviously its still the prevailing attitude at Blizzard to this day.
---
I'm enjoying retail right now so I can double dip anyway!
---
Make sure you opt in to specifically classic beta and have an active sub or whatever their rule is
---
"We are still considering options on RP-PVP realms"
---
-7:00
---
&gt; A re-release is the same thing from before.
---
I would say WoW Classic is going to be more of a remake, especially considering they are streamlining some features (like gear). 
---
And they also mentioned that they might add new content to the game (aside from TBC, Wrath, etc). 
---
You would, given your stance, be strictly opposed to this, right?
---
If they were all separate servers I could see myself having characters on each purely because I loved raiding from UBRS to Ulduar.
---
What stupid-ass ideas have I put forward?
---
I'm not die hard about what should be in Classic.  I want Old AV.  I'm not getting it.  You aren't getting mounts that were removed from availability in 1.4 in Classic.
---
&gt; char copy, not transfer 
---
Four words that completely change how I feel about it. I am 99% sure Blizz will force the expansions on Vanilla servers and not give us a choice.
---
You cared enough to make a post on a fucking subreddit.
---
Pffft, as your on a reddit sub discussing WoW. We all have voids dude, every successful person I know, including myself,  has something. Denial will get you no where.
---
It looks like you have 0 karma for a reason.
---
&gt; Get over it.
---
They will definitely force you to move and not copy/clone your character while maintaining the Vanilla servers. Main reasons why I don't want this. If they maintain all the servers and let us clone I would play the shit out of a TBC server.
---
Elwynn forest honeymoon
---
Doing the lords work. Thanks for this.
---
Poll won't work. Phase 1-2 should be way less than 2-3 for example.
---
ikr. Shortsighted.
---
 CBT? Cock and Ball Torture? Sign me up
---
Nope game is perfect
---
True. He was busy hunting vampires.
---
If they force the Vanilla servers to eventually go to Cata or Wotlk, that isn't us getting our favorite WoW anymore. That's just everyone going through the same cycle of turning a good game into a piece of trash.
---
What time does beta start tomorrow ?
---
What word do you suggest then? Loot perhaps?  Or drop rates?
---
We werent getting vanilla untill people started fucking bitching about it and playing private servers either.
---
I mean, we're lucky to get what we have, you have a point. But what do you get out of being an apologist for Blizzard? Why are you defending a multi-million dollar corporation? They don't need your help.
---
Warrior/ Shaman will destroy a Warrior/ Priest though....
---
I really don't put much in what rank people attained,  because it's the amount you really played... not skill level. 
---
I was also pretty decent on my server and played competitively from vanilla through Wrath
---
This. I actually have time, this summer, where I could contribute for once.
---
They didnt say all of phase 1. They only said that phase 2 was the hard cutoff, and it would go away sooner if no longer necessary. Secondly, a new layer will only be created once the previous one gets to 3000 or so people. I think you are seriously overestimating how this will effect people. Most people probably wouldn't even notice if they weren't told about the system. Honestly if you can think of a better system than this to handle launch while trying not to have hellish queue times and horrendous leveling experience for the first 2 weeks after launch, I'm sure Blizz would love to hear it. Honestly it seems to me like you're looking for things to be mad at.
---
I had a Dwarf Hunter and Undead Rogue in Vanilla, but always wanted to be a Troll Rogue, so I’ll be playing that this time around, in addition to a female Tauren Warrior and an Orc Warlock
---
Advice isn't an idea.
---
I’d be curious if that polished vanilla models look is achievable with graphics settings we see in the beta soon
---
You’re a fuckn idiot
---
Not getting into philosophy.
---
Sounds like you are enjoying retail and there is nothing wrong with that. But I enjoyed vanilla a whole lot back in the day. Every accomplishment felt more meaningful to me. Don’t stop doing what you love but give it a shot. If you are already subbed it’s free to try.
---
K. Then don't play. Problem solved.
---
Supposedly there was a project lead a while back stating there was a concurrent cap of 2.5k that was dynamic, but the hardware had a maximum limit of around 4k. But that is for concurrent players, so getting 6k players on at the same time, on the same server, to trigger a third layer, assuming they have a server cap higher than 5k, is going to be a feat all to its own.
---
I like how you're making fun of someone complaining about the MASSIVE queue times that would ensue without sharding, as if that's invalid at all.
---
Yeah, I wonder when they’re being sent out time-wise. I guess We’ll see PSA posts on the Reddit tomorrow
---
Stop ✋
---
I would play a TBC server if they did that. Sadly, I am almost 100% sure that they mean they will force Vanilla servers to go to TBC, and then those go to Wotlk. In which case I will simply quit the game, because that wasn't the deal.
---
yeah but people still acknowledge that dice fucked 
---
if what you're saying is yeah they fucked up but hey eventually it won't matter so don't worry about it, just doesn't seem like a good argument. Not only that but seemingly a lot of people don't even think we should be upset before hand, before it's even happened. it feels crazy to be honest
---
They literally said there will be no sharding after phase 1. How am I changing my mind? I agree that at launch sharding/layering/whatever is the best option. You’re a fucking moron too. Learn to comprehend things before you say something.
---
where is Wetlands ?
---
Meh.... they all have weaknesses.
---
you know that won't change with layers right? a layer holds 3000 people, you will still be fighting vs 500+ other people in the starter zone with layers. Layers is for reducing queues and long term server population health, it won't reduce the competition for quests/mobs.
---
No Ivory Raptor? What's the point of being a Troll then? ... I'm really sad.
---
&gt;  don't oversaturate the game and leave its roots
---
Necro, but I want to mention one other thing - your offhand has the same miss chance as your mainhand on white swings. The act of equipping a second weapon *increases* white miss rate by 19% (to 24% against same-level target), so the only difference between mh and offhand at that point is the damage reduction. Doesn't change the conclusion, but just fyi since your phrasing seemed to imply that you were just now (re)learning these mechanics.
---
Still avaible at Amazon.
---
I will, thanks for your reply, I really appreciate it.
---
And they're all replying to you saying exactly that hahahaha, this is like a fucking sitcom, man. ^^Nice ^^username ^^btw
---
Guys, layering **ISN'T EVEN GOING TO LAST ALL THE WAY THROUGH PHASE 1, CALM YOUR SHIT. YOU CAN FIND THAT DWARF HUNTER AGAIN.**
---
Why, are you looking to solidify my position?
---
I’m guessing that means the newest mount patch then? Cheap mounts, but expensive training
---
People like you are the reason that they call the classic community spergs.   
---
Your post history is the most toxic shit ive ever seen.
---
**\[LFG\]**
---
*Looking for a guild (introduction):*
---
Hello my dudes, I'm interested in an **Alliance** **(NA | PVP)** guild for Classic. I'm not a hardcore player, but I still like to experience raids and larger content in a more casual (at least not all that stressful) setting. I plan on rolling a human warrior, and tanking. I've been playing off and on since the middle of TBC - so I have quite a bit of experience under my belt among both DPS and tanking roles.
---
*What do I want to accomplish:*
---
During Classic, I'd like to get my human tank to 60 and occasionally raid with the guild. I'm attending university and have a job, so I won't be available consistently throughout the week. I would, on the other hand, like to achieve the title (figuratively, considering there aren't titles) of Scarab Lord during the opening of the gates. I would like to take part in the content as it is rolled out, so I do intent to get to 60 within the first few months.
---
*What am I looking for in a guild:*
---
In a guild, I'd like it to be relatively casual and accepting of any playstyle. Adaptive, you could say. I'd prefer for there to not be requirements to raiding other than simply being knowledgably prepared and geared to a certain standard. I'd also appreciate a guild that accepts the fact that I don't have the time to sink my life into Classic, nor would I want to dedicate that much time.
---
***Thank ye for reading, would appreciate offers.***
---
I hope you're right. I have a feeling they will force all Vanilla servers to progress :(
---
Ah, the world before layering
---
I love how my trolls blood potions stay cheap af because no one knows how cheap they are... leave them in the dark about regen time ;(
---
Dude, they literally said it's not even going to last through phase 1. I love classic nerds but you people are the biggest bunch of fucking cry babies I've ever witnessed in a gaming community. Get your shit together and be grateful Blizzard put in the work to feed your nostalgia boner.
---
As far as I know, they have only said they would "try" to keep it around 2-3k, which is different from current retail servers. Obviously they don't have all their old hardware laying around, so the servers they are most likely going to be using are capable of 8k or more. (Likely there are a bunch of unused retail servers available...)  
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I may not understand what you're saying about the high queues, as connection queues are a direct result of a server being maxed out. Handling connection requests isn't the issue. There's actually a seperate server for that, you just get "patched in" to your "realm" server after initial connection/authentication. A queue simply means the server is full, and you will have to wait until other players disconnect, or log off so you can join.
---
just roll a pve server bro, whats the big deal bro.
---
no seriously, its ridiculous they cant throw just one in there
---
Yeah my biggest beef is literally just that windfury totem got changed to a flat 10% haste buff in Wrath (that I believe didn't stack with other identical buffs). As a combat rogue this made my raid gameplay a lot less entertaining.
---
i was waiting for this post lol
---
Have vacation booked ;( I wake up on the beach Aug 26th w family.  Thinking of excuses but my wife just wont have it.
---
If they're going to have reserved names then the active sub makes sense. Otherwise people could just make like 100 trial accounts and reserve 300 names.
---
Nope. You asked me if their late summer releases might indicate a late classic release, and I told you it might. So if anything, I told you.. I’ve always believed it’d be a mid-late August release. In fact, I’ve got a screenshot of discord with my mates on my PC from way back, predicting either 13th or 20th August, so 27th was well within my expectations. All I meant to say in previous posts was facts, hence the ”it might, it might not indicate the release date”.
---
Please Blizzard don't do this! 
---
Trolls are already unappealing aesthetically, the Ivory Raptor was the only reason I was going to overlook the feet for the racials. If they don't have the mounts in, I'll just go Undead I guess...
---
literally the day uni starts again :)
---
I never played a warrior so I can't comment on the validity of this but I just want to say that prepare for downvotes. You aren't allowed to criticize Blizzard or layering because we have a release date and a beta now.
---
I realize it's not perfect, which is why I said "on average." I didn't want the poll to get too lengthy/complex.
---
Interestingly, if you look at the content in phase 2 - those pieces of content (averaged out) released 129 days after the US Vanilla WoW release. And then if you look at the phase 3 content (averaged out), they released 102 days after the averaged date of the phase 2 content. So in Vanilla, phase 1-2 was longer than 2-3. You can see the backup date [here](https://i.imgur.com/p9vaJro.png).
---
 I have really fond memories of raiding BWL while listening to 10,000 Days
---
Can you imagine the amount of ooze farming?? lol
---
[I mean cross realm battlegrounds came in during 1.12.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0)
---
There’s an article on Wowhead. They are bringing back Thottbot as Wowhead classic and are also including old Thottbot comments. You will even be able to change the GUI to look like Thottbot.
---
Given a single layer is going to be the size of a server population from what I understand, do you really think you'd have grouped up with everyone you possibly could have?  If there were no layering and the server was just at 3x capacity, you'd still end up grouping with a ton of people you've never had the chance to meet.
---
But if they want to allow people to reserve names before launch how else would you have them do it?
---
If you let non active accounts do it then people will just create 100s of trial accounts and reserve all the names.
---
5 week vacation ends aug 19th and Im starting a new  position at work. Gonna have to up my discipline for real. Luckily once Im warmed up at work I can work from home :D
---
I was looking for it as well and noticed in a shacknews video that it's raining during the transition going to duskwood.  
---
[https://youtu.be/hdWHQGj\_yuo?t=524](https://youtu.be/hdWHQGj_yuo?t=524)
---
Steamers tested it.
---
In my humble opinion it's a grower; rather than the immediate brilliance of Lateralus
---
Just add them til Phase two. If you didn't know about them or didn't care to get one that's on you. But to those who do care it seems ridiculous to remove content that WAS in the game in that Patch...
---
Perhaps current patch vs classic
---
They should be in until phase 3 starts IMHO
---
I'd rather they just make new 60 content.
---
Implying I would ever give an anti-consumer company like Activision money.
---
I believe they will easily be able to get 7-10k people on ONE realm in each region EU/US that is. I really don't feel like rerolling after investing a ton of time into a character either.
---
One problem with releasing a RP-PvP server later on is that a lot of people will reroll on it coming from regular PvP realms with no intention of following it's rules at all and just choose it because they want a fresh start.
---
My unemployed ass cant wait 3 more months. Got nothing to do.
---
Same. I never got an email for BFA beta. Just a drop down that had the beta.
---
I just went and found my original guide. Was already excited and then opening it again was a real nostalgia kick. HYPE TRAIN.
---
If the timegate part was the problem then why not keep them in permanently but have them cost the same as the armored epic mounts.   
---
More options for variety in picking your mount for everyone rather than taking them out entirely.
---
The BFA beta def had an email. My buddy who wasn't even subbed or playing got one
---
The release date, that is.
---
OP didn't say that they expected them to be in game. He was simply asking the community if they think they should be.
---
"each of which [the layers] will have similar capacity to what the original servers did at launch"
---
also:
---
"There will never be layering after Phase 1, period." ~ Ion Hazzikostas
---
at least do your research properly instead of moaning about stuff
---
So are you denying what i said, or just trying to make false accusations based upon a argument i made while making everything i said valid? Have fun playing with the fake cars youll never own
---
No chance, they came in future expansions so it wouldn't make sense
---
I think the biggest cause for concern may be overpopulation. Outside of that, there really is nothing to worry about here, and more than likely, I doubt it will even be all that noticeable. Unlike sharding, which was/is... disturbing.
---
I see a few possibilities:
---
1) There's a shared name pool across all servers. Only one Leeroy in the whole world, etc. This kind of suggests that they could be planning ahead for some kind of social media integration.
---
2) There's a relatively small number of servers due to layering, like 3 PvP/2 PvE/1 RP or something, and you can reserve a name on all three of the PvP or PvE servers with your three character allowance.
---
3) There's plenty of servers but you just only get to reserve three names, so you need to know ahead of time which realm you'll be playing on. This is probably the actual answer.
---
So then how do we know people will be able to interact with other layers?
---
Annyong!
---
Technically the entire world will be a "starting zone" until we begin end-game content... ;-)
---
These are the exact same people you're talking about. They just wont say the N word in trade anymore, they're still edgy racist kids.
---
To be fair, if youve done everything on one of the legacy versions, I dont see the point in playing again.
---
I missed out on finishing Naxx, Twin Emp and Cthun in vanilla, Sunwell in BC. I killed every fight in Wrath from HLK to Yogg0. 
---
As much as I dont like the retail gear treadmill, m+10 and mythic raids are still great. So long as im not pushing for top region wowprogress anymore, I dont feel compelled to "do all the things" everyday on live. 
---
Vanilla and BC (dependent on pre or post leveling nerf) has good leveling...Northrend is cool--but we can do that on live. 
---
So that said, my plan at least is to play this classic cycle, hope I can xfer my character to BC, play that again. then probably put down live, legacy, all wow. Thats like me at 35--you know when its really time to consider doing the family thing.
---
Except the post literally states there will be NO sharding
---
I believe there will be starter zone sharding on top of the layering system. That's what Staysafes interview with the devs made it sound like.
---
Yup last 3 day weekend pretty much for everyone before school starts and summer over feels like. So retail jobs are can be busy.
---
They change their mind constantly, and you expect people to find this info inside the middle of a YouTube clip? Pretty much confirms blizz is cheaping out on hardware like I said.
---
It takes ages. It's not just exalted, you need to complete every quest chain in Zuldazar and finish the war campaign.
---
There wasn’t mush-room for them.
---
Maybe they just want to get all that extra realm transfer money when they release an RP-PvP realm 6 months after launch
---
Depending on my mood (or when I look at my cumulative /played) it was one of the best days of my life or the worst.
---
&gt; there's no real basis for that expectation...
---
That is literally what Ion has stated is their expectation and what they are planning around.  [Watch the video posted by /u/SockofBadKarma for a source](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bor8uf/ion_at_end_of_phase_1/enjo05f/).
---
&gt; especially considering subs only went down after they started making the game 'modern' ez.
---
Wrath was the peak of WoW sub counts.  WotLK was, by many metrics of the time, considered to be 'ez mode'.  Then Cata came and ramped the difficulty back up.  Do you know what happened?  They started hemorrhaging subs, and well before LFR/content drought became a serious issue.  "Ez mode" didn't kill the game or WotLK wouldn't have continued to grow the subscriber base, even with all of its problems.
---
&gt; ...other retro games on the rise as well.
---
And for various reasons.  Many of which are *because they were good games*.  However, many people also find those great games to be unplayable due to controls or game mechanics.  Those games also often have a *smaller, tight niche community* that is comprised of people who have been playing the game for a long time.  New player growth in those retro communities is small, especially when compared to any modern game.
---
&gt; doesn't mean we won't end up with a huge population after the release.
---
And I addressed this by providing an alternate solution that they would provide, and have provided in the past, but you think that is "useless".  I don't know what else I could say since you are downplaying a very valid solution that has had impact in the past.  I know since I played on one of the target servers for those free transfers.  Do you know what happened?  My guild merged with a transfer guild and we pushed into the top 300 for progression in the world.  
---
&gt; to believe that the biggest servers will drop below 3k players after less than a month is legit stupid tho.
---
I never claimed that the **biggest**, or any, server would drop below any number, in any given time frame, so stop putting words in my mouth.  And to suggest that there would be no server population issues *at all* is legit stupid as well.  I would rather they plan for an outcome and not need it than have that outcome and have no solution at all.
---
Lol ppl complained levelling was hard on bfa, then they happy to jump on vanilla to grind shit like a dumbass
---
They could always start with the continent and scale back as needed.
---
Funny meme, I'm still mad as hell though.
---
Go back to teaching August 19th.
---
Are you that generic though? This reserving thing seems more important to get more friends on the same server at release
---
You will transfer to the group leaders layer. Whoever invites you will stay.
---
It says to need an active sub to participate not to be invited.
---
It will as opposed to having 6k players all trying to level up at the same time. Especially in your more popular zones like Elwynn forest or the badlands.  
---
I'd be more interested to find out if they will always have a static layering system, or if the layers will kick in as population increases, then phase back out if the primary server can handle the full population load.
---
Haha, you knew about the Stress Tests didn't you? 
---
xD
---
That seems fairly solvable though. Keep flying BC only and make it so you can only take off from certain areas in outland instead of having flying available all the time.
---
right when school starts...
---
I 100% knew about everything yes
---
This was actually a very good explanation of the mechanic, and i feel like it's a better option compared to merging servers later on, where a fuckton of people would be forced to rename their characters. Also feels better than zone-based sharding where people would keep randomly zoning in and out in front of you mid-interaction. When i first heard of this i let out a very faint ree, but explained well enough it kinda makes sense for the longevity of servers.
---
Please learn from jagex and Oldschool Runescape, new content to an older version can work
---
Well my primary response to this is, He said its only going to be like that for the 'first few weeks' even if we assume that that means 2-3 weeks. Most AVERAGE players will take about 30 days to even get to 60. So by the time the world first happens, all the layers should be gone.

Moving on to the second question player distribution. Its probably going to be the same (Slightly modified) as sharding as it is now except there will be no realm names. for example you wont have to type /invite Illidan-layer2 because the name 'Illidan' will be secured across all servers. So it will fill to the player cap (For example 3000) Then keep building up till around (3999) then when it hits 4000 it'll create a new layer and poop the 1000 people into layer 2. No matter if you have access to mobs all the time or not, Leveling WILL NOT GO FASTER. There was practically zero classes that could take on more than one mob at a time anyway.
---
This is just an educated guess as i work in IT, It could work entirely different the beta will clear most of this up.
---
Bad for them, great for me and my dumb adult job with 200 hours of time off stacked up.
---
Some of which will be thrown at the altar of WOW.
---
Total server population is a very very important number and dividing it in half doesn't change that. There are a finite number of spaces and mobs available, which is essentially the point of this part of the interview. If it's similar to pserver coding, there are a total of 6 black lotus spawns every 6 hours. With 9k server population there will probably be *at least* 50 raiding guilds. That's 3 black lotuses per guild per week, which is not even enough to put titans on the tanks for an entire raid.
---
I care very much what they are doing on Eastern Kingdom while I'm in Kalimdor. I don't know what your recent vanilla experience may be like, but I suspect you have not experienced the difference between a 1k pop server and a 5k pop server.
---
However, I don't think OP's concern is well-founded. I believe the devs may be overestimating the tourist population, but it will still probably be at least a 60% dropoff in the 2nd month. Vanilla is very much not for everyone (which is a lot of why we love it), and the fact that it's being made available to retail players for free will make it uniquely likely for someone other than its target audience to try it out.
---
For real. Don’t try to escape reality. I’ve dropped out of school while playing wow. I’ve lost touch with a bunch of friends while playing wow. I’ve let my job performance slip while playing wow. At some point, while still playing wow, that changed and things are going pretty great now. 
---
The thing is that it’s not wow that caused these problems, it’s using wow as an escape that caused them.
---
Stay engaged, stay motivated. Prioritize your irl bis over your in game bis. Where wow comes full circle and can be used in a productive manner is when you need help navigating your free time. 
---
Practicing your trade or studying your subject takes a ton time. Not all of this time necessarily involves being actively engaged in whatever your goal is. Use wow to navigate those down times. It’s cheap, it’s chill, and it’s quasi social.
---
Let classic enable you by helping you cope with the stress rather than avoid it. If you are stressing it should suck, that’s a sign that you want things to change. Playing wow won’t change that, but it will help you navigate it in your down time. Think about the bigger pictures and figure it out while playing game’s with your soon to be internet buds. We’re all in this world together and some of us will play classic while we’re at it.
---
And here you are, bitching that you can't play the same game faster. Lol stop spewing bullshit and re-read the replies and reevaluate yourself.
---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I LOVED SITTING IN QUEUE THEN GETTING BOOTED CUZ MOM ANSWERED THE PHONE AND SITTING FOR ANOTHER 45MINS
---
Literally the best time to launch. Wake up at 7, dick around for a bit and then swarm the servers.
---
A meme of astronomical importance
---
If there is only ONE rp-pvp server at launch then that would solve the problems.   
---
People that want to RP that will ALL go on one server.   
---
And a lot of other people will roll onto it because they know that server will always have a consistent community on it, whereas if you roll on one of the myriads of PvP realms you run the risk of rolling on a server that dies halfway during the games lifespan due to people going onto other more popular PvP realms.   
---
A lot of people also play on RP-PvP because they find it more immersive, with other players using in-game lorebased names and doing live events around the capital cities, despite never participating in any RP themselves.
---
I *highly* doubt phase 1 is going to be 4-6 months. Ion said that phase 1 was going to be a short one. Even 4 months is too long if it's considered short. 
---
Dire maul launched less than 2 months after retail WoW release in the US. If you really think that they would wait to release dire maul 4 months after classic releases, you just aren't using your brain.
---
I'd give it maybe 2 months max for phase 1, and even that is pushing it.
---
How is it? It's just truth.
---
There will be, they just changed it a bit and slapped a different label on it cuz everyone goes batshit when they hear the word sharding.
---
Those were added in TBC
---
And? Physical oceanic realms didn't exist back then so this situation is completely outside what vanilla was like.
---
My ex husband was in the Naval Reserves and was called to active duty back in '05. He was stationed in GITMO for 15 months, but found a way to play WOW during his deployment!
---
Nope!
---
Because they've already stated you're going to be assigned a random layer every time you login. If you and I get assigned the same layer and we add each other on friends list, I can invite you to my layer the next time you're on a different layer when you log in.
---
How about offer a free transfer when such a server comes out ?
---
I'm not convinced. So will we have more black lotus on a server now?
---
It may sound familiar, but the social aspect of layering and it's short life span makes it completely different than sharding
---
the fact that you would play both is both an argument for and against having separate servers for them
---
i am some what lucky. I already had 2 weeks off planned from the beginning of september so woot. after 5 days of work i get to go all ass
---
This whole sub was full of "Why not just make a bunch of servers and merge the dead ones later?" posts a few weeks ago. That is *literally* what they are doing without needing the extra overhead of upsetting people that like their server name. Instead of launching "Kazzak", "Azuregos", "Ysera", "Emerald Dream" and needing to merge them later, just launch 4 layers inside "Kazzak" and seamlessly merge them into a single server as the population dies down.
---
&gt; and you expect people to find this info inside the middle of a YouTube clip?
---
I expect people to not talk about something that they do not know anything about. But, its 2019. ''rioting'' is edgy cool i guess.
---
When it comes down to it the biggest problems of sharding also exist in layering. You can still get invited to a different layer to avoid getting ganked, to avoid dying to mobs, to find gathering nodes, or to find rare mobs. And that short life span remains to be seen. Before this event they said sharding would only exist in starting zones.
---
Which streamer? Do you have a link?
---
Also, did they try resetting the instance by right-clicking their portrait?
---
Ahhhh. I understand now thank you. It's funny because I did actually play the game back then but couldn't remember this
---
What exploit was that?
---
I'm not going to die on it, it just takes me from being 100% sure I want to make a permanent home on Classic to 95% sure.
---
Conversely, I was 100% sure I would never need a vanilla private server again, and now I could actually see myself playing on those since they would have more content from vanilla than the official servers.
---
listen to this guy
---
Literally just posted this before reading your comment. It's the exact same as launching multiple servers and merging them, except they get to do the mergers behind the curtain effectively seamlessly for the players. It really is an ideal solution in my mind. The PServer doomsayers will cry about slippery slope all they want, but I think the Classic team has earned enough trust so far for us to give them the benefit of the doubt on this one.
---
The past two expansion launches have been very smooth. I would be surprised if this launch has more than just minor problems
---
Barely, and you know it. Why are you being a douche about it?
---
I think that someday we will, not til a bc expansion though.  But I'm trying to stay positive after getting pissed off that there will not be the clean slate I thought classic would be.
---
Incoming freshman :(
---
Boohoo.
---
Hahaha
---
I put my pto in for the first two weeks but a few people already requested Labor Day off (sept 2). So I have to break my wow grind for a day to work in the middle of my vacation lol
---
You chose, wisely
---
Watch this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;list=WL&amp;index=3&amp;t=238s
---
They go into more detail. Everyone seems to put a lot of stock into this statement from Tips, claiming that Ion said "Phase 1". Im going to put more stock into Ion actually saying "few weeks", than some random sell out streamer, who has no proof of what Ion said.
---
Thanks
---
Isn't that kind of sort of what led to the clusterfuck that is retail?  Buld a game trying to appeal to all?
---
Do you have a link for this?
---

---
Im sure that what i said was called for in the situation. Despite being able to play the game or not i still have a life outside of it. Just because I decided to share an experience that contradicts someone else does not mean that Im begging for acceptance. What i see from what youve said so far you still haven't denied anything that ive said nor argued against it. So i still can only assume that youre just a sad persin thats sad they decided to do nothing but play a game thier whole life and decide to collect cars thet will never own due to not doing anything with their life. It didnt take long looking into your profile to come up with these assumptions either.
---
The classic team is hitting it off so hard. You can trust the classic team and not trust the retail wow team.
---
I'd agree. I remember Nostralious opening and it being an absolute mess for 2 weeks. Game was unplayable. So I kind of can concede on layering but ya know, give an inch..
---
It is something for everybody.  For me it is bringing retail items back into classic.  I think most people don't care but I hate that classic is not going to be a clean slate where everyone has an equal start.  That said I think layering is the a good, creative answer that will bring a fresh perspective the lauch.  It's not sharding which people hated, it's not crazy que times which people would also hate, the answer is usually a middle ground.
---
Why, Alliance is the objectively better faction in classic PvE wise? Only idiots dispute this btw.
---
I just booked 3 weeks off. My work knows I’m a recluse and will likely be just playing video games.
---
AV... I mourn your loss.
---
Username checks the FUCK out
---
Imho i think these people are what ruined the modern WoW they complained it to death until it was 0 challenge anymore and now they complain about that.
---
Classic servers will be infested with those for a few weeks and then they are back to modern WoW.
---
Seriously i came back after nearly 10 years ( end of wotlk ) and they nerved holy priest so hard i only have 2 offense spells ... still i kill quick AF and never run out of mana or health.
---
How did this happen? Answer : Those people ruined it.
---
So get a buddy who's on a different layer to invite you. It's really not that hard. People absolutely will find ways to exploit layering.
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=376
---
Like 2 months until phase 2, 1 month until Phase 3, 4 months until Phase 4, 4-5 months until Phase 5, 6 months until Phase 6, at least 7-8 more months until new content of any kind
---
late august is fall.
---
Oh I memeber
---
Not being able to join a group due to being in combat would be a pretty big change from vanilla, but yeah, change that to you can't move to a different layer while you're in combat and that should take care of it.
---
Tldr is that they are doing sharding realm wide, which means you run the risk of never seeing your friends even if you picked the same realm. If you are more than 5 people you will not see the other poor guy who gets left behind, yeah great solution.
---
Last thing blizz said in a blue post was they would use sharding so why don't you take that self righteous attitude and stick it somewhere mmkay? Thanks.
---
\-Bye bye all you salty nerds who dont want layering
---
\-bye bye all you salty nerds who dont want dumbed down raiding for ez epix, you fuckin nolifers
---
\-bye bye all you salty nerds who dont want LFG/LFR some of us have lives and dont want to look for groups all day
---
\-b-bye you salty nerds who dont want transmog
---
\-b-bye... um... hello? Oh, no one is playing the game any more. Damn it.
---
Wait what's this about retail items in classic?
---
Nope, PvE servers have a different ruleset. It was always possible to create characters for both factions on a PvE server.
---
Yeah man I'm with you, only thing that hurts is that subs that get invited get to reserve names :/
---
You are not wrong :)
---
I mean.. Take a hint, maybe? If the majority of people think you're wrong.. You're probably wrong.
---
Just be honest, you didnt watch the video.
---
Why would this be fake? This is the original wow content re-release from back before TBC.
---
This makes sense to me, as long as it is consistent.  I know how it is just gonna bug me more and more especially if they do go the route of new post Naxx stuff and I will never get my Tyrael.  lol really I just want to talk about classic and this is the thing I'm most passionate about.  Classic HYPE!
---
And? You’re acting like a late August release date is game over... it doesn’t matter how long it takes to level. If the game is compelling and rewarding as you level (which it is) it won’t matter.
---
I feel like the Ret might be a fem dwarf paladin but I could be mistaken haha
---
I’m an anti-layer because some person some where once said that layers give you autism.
---
Its releasing on my BIRTHDAY
---
There should really be a "Are-you-a-streamer" button. It would have a... certain effect on chances, shall we say.
---
&gt; flying is the sole reason that Retail sucks 
---
said no one
---
obligatory /r/Notakeonlythrow
---
lol don't worry it is super small.  If you have the old pets you get them in classic.  That said it bugs the fuck out of me lol
---
Thunderfury, Blessed Horse of the Dankmaster?
---
They've solved overpopulation in the past by opening free transfers to low-pop realms, I see no reason they couldn't do the same here if necessary. They'd have to be careful about it, though, because that caused massive faction imbalances when the lesser-populated faction just transferred off en-masse.
---
To be fair it takes a very high I.Q to understand poorly photoshopped rick and morty memes about laying.....
---
Mandatory as it, it will GREATLY increase the efficiency of your raids. The more engineers the better.
---
That being said, not having it will not stop you from clearing content.
---
-Make a snarky overly pedantic post about "UGH, this COMMUNITY am I right?"
---
-Comments call you out for being a pedantic jackass. 
---
-*shocked Pikachu face*
---
I think that's how the meme works, right?
---
Game releases in 2019 are completely different than they were in 2004. Instead of stores opening at different times across the world (with people having different travel times home and download speeds), you now have everyone with their mouse over the log in button with the game fully loaded waiting for the server to go up. 
---
On private server releases with sub 2.5k population, launches still don't really work without dynamic respawns. Layering fixes nothing.
---
I have an Asus phone and it was an integrated feature. :-)

i would not take tips word for anything recently
---
mOrE cOnTeNt aFtEr NaXx would result in much worse shit than flying mounts buddy. You are certainly right that flying didn't ruin the game, it was the anti-social and EZ-mode crap that they will definitely put in the game if you guys let them with this "moar content after Naxx" nonsense.
---
Cata would be okay, if they launched the version from towards the end of the expac like they're doing with classic... Only problem would be the hard dungeons that many people liked were made much easier by then.
---
Anyway, I'm rambling. Cata would be okay, because my main complaint is just how long Dragon Soul dragged on for.
---
There’s always money in the banana stand Michael
---
They will now that it’s easier of a system to ABUSE.
---
I'm super lucky and can play as much as I want but I feel for you people.
---
That's not the logic that Blizzard is following for not implementing them. In fact, Blizzard is implementing the old riding skill, where each race had a different riding skill and mounts cost 80/1000g.
---
The reason why Blizzard doesn't want to put unarmored mounts is, and I quote, *"We know some people are interested in them, but we don't want to put them in for a limited period of time, because we didn't want to influence people through their first leveling experience. Especially people coming back for the first time. **We don't want people to feel like they have to rush.**"*
---
WotLK "welfare" epics still took work. Cata is what gave us truly welfare epics.
---
If they stick to their word I'm good. No bitching here.
---
it takes about 4-5days for a "hardcore" to hit 60.
---
played vanilla as an 8yo played through wotlk and stopped playing after the pvp turned to shit or what i thought was shit
---
Is Blizzard really going to remake their mmorpg as it’s own sequel?
---
What a lazy fucken corporate capitalist company.
---
Does anyone remember a few weeks before SWTOR released they had a huge open beta to stress test the servers?  It was literally an open invite for anyone who wanted to check it out.  One can hope.
---
Zeds name was Robert Paulson...
---
&gt; my brother botting
---
::thinking::
---
it most certainly would not, buddy 
---
again, the devs themselves have stated they wish they never added flying. multiple things came together to help ruin the game, flying included
---
Well, then you still have a problem with an RP ,and unofficial RP-PvP server people will roll on, having a big chunk of the player base being removed from their server.
---
Which is what blizzard IS concerned about. Realm pop.
---
Complaining is part of being passionate about something (within restraint).  That said I think it is so silly to quit over something creative like layering.  There are quite a few things that I strongly dislike about some of the information we got today but I still want to just have fun and am looking forward to classic more than any game I have played in years.
---
LFD was good. Especially when they added Tank/Healer/DPS role to it.
---
When they made it Dungeon Finder (to make pugs and teleport in)... yeah, less great. But it was still really highly requested.
---
How would you even know that you and a buddy were in different layers without taking the time to try and meet up first? And then what, they inv you to their layer and now you're on the same layer and it wont work again.
---
Great book name "UBRS to Ulduar, with love"
---
That as well, didn't think of it. It'll for sure be used as a fresh realm for regular players.
---
Wrong. They came out in the Collector's Edition and will be included in Classic WoW
---
They know what they are doing.
---
Marketing team has always been decent.
---
I miss when Blizzard wasn’t chained to a corporation...capitalism sucks.
---
Phase 1 is where the no lifers separate themselves from the casuals. It matters. And don't be surprised if layering returns for other patches. A few weeks ago they said sharding would only be in the starting zones, and now the entire realm will effectively be sharded for the entirety of phase-1. What they say and what they do are often different. 
---
&gt; stop crying and be grateful
---
Literally the same response as every other time we tried to warn Blizzard about when things like LFR were implemented. A decade later and they don't even report sub-numbers because they're so bad.
---
Ah, I see you're part of the "its just nostalgia" crew. No surprise there.
---
JANET
---
LFD/Group Finder was in TBC. They added roles (Tank/Healer/DPS) in early Wrath. It became Dungeon Finder in late WotLK, when it built a pug group for you.
---
It is. And I don't expect to always get what I want. However Blizzard did say "a classic summer" which implied that we'd be playing classic this summer, not that it'd release at the end of summer, so my hopes were up and the naturally I got a bit dissapointed.
---
I think your thinking is pretty spot on and is around what I have seem streamers talk about today (plus /r/theydidthemath lol).  Still it would be nice if they did round it up.
---
&gt;3 layers would also be 3x the number of players consuming 3x the number of resources
---
What? What does this mean? The # of players is the same either way. The variable we're talking about is how many shards (if any) and what impact that will have.
---
The guy you're responding to is correct: there will be way more resources/items flooding the AH (or being hoarded) for those first few weeks. That's a long time, for the hardcore.
---
It's not game taking but it's reasonable to be unhappy about this. It's not authentic to Vanilla, and if you're okay setting that aside for the sake of a better launch, might there be better ways of handling this? Why not just up the respawn rates on everything for a while and ensure your servers are ready to handle the early throngs? They'll have a huge preview of what to expect when we all create our characters. It'll have a similar effect on the economy, but at least we'll all be together in one world. I like seeing a crowded world.
---
I'd much prefer to just struggle through the first zone or two until people start spreading out like I've always done in this game.
---
tbh I don't like most of the ingame music in WoW. Almost all of the zone music is just boring ambient music.
---
Probably because the previous two MMOs I played before WoW (Ragnarok, Maple Story) both had...uh, actual music, instead of ambient music.
---
I wonder how hard it would be, and how popular it could be to set up an old school message board where people join guilds in preparation for classic launch.
---
This!
---
i hate the epic horses id much rather a nice simple steed
---
and for when i need to get serious time to summon my CHARGERRRR
---
Oh fun!
---
but the server cap would be 3k either way, with or without layering. After that there'd be queues. So layering or no layering, it's 3000 people you're competing with regardless.
---
I haven't had an active sub to WoW since August of last year. You don't like the layering, don't play until they turn it off after 2-4 weeks.
---
They never said 3000 people did they? Kz i would assume its nowhere near that. More like 100-200people on each layer. It is literally sharding without cross realm
---
I came back to Normal WoW a few months ago just to see about finding good people to game with in Classic, heh.
---
Reason is: Account was made last week.
---
watch the video -.-
---
it's not for the whole phase 1...
---
Try harder. "Vast majority" and "some" do not mean "all" or "none".
---
That would mean that classic is popular enough to require extra servers, and while a cash grab, would be amazing!
---
And the troll population declines...
---
Gee thanks for contributing by making a negative toxic post and shitting up the community more than any gripes about layering ever will.
---
I'm with you, dunno why you got downvoted
---
You should look up what freeshards are and how many players they have for the clusterfuck the liveservers are lol.
---
Lol no. Especially not on Reddit.
---
Except Blizzard literally caved on Classic because the numbers between Retail and people playing Vanilla illegally became dangerously close.
---
Different
---
allow purchase of both and everyone can be happy
---
even if forever
---
But what the hell will their max server pop size be?
---
You both going to play together? My husband and I were only vaguely friends back then, so I'm really excited to rediscover WoW with him!
---
Who said anything about forcing Vanilla servers to be updated? We are talking merely about possibility of TBC and WotLK, not to mention that Blizzard themselves said that new Vanilla content is on the board too if there will be demand. We can have both updated Vanilla and TBC/WotLK.
---
Honestly I think 2021 too soon. I think spring/early summer 2022 is probably closer.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bothev/we_can_guess_how_many_servers_will_exist_based_on/  did some math that may explain the thinking behind why there is no rp pvp, but I really hope they make one.
---
Thanks! Yea he does: https://instagram.com/michielstenderart
---
Oh, I assumed those pets were from later expansions since I already had said the rewards carry through, my bad
---
Is there list of streamers invited to Blizz to test the beta? Just wondering who were there. Can't see a video about it from Frostie.
---
Of course they will, but it won't be some absurdly easy and consistent thing to do.       
---
You'd need a lot of buddies, that aren't doing anything and are able to invite you. Which are also not in your guild to improve your odds of them being on a different layer.
---
dumb, it was never a problem in vanilla with under pop servers.
---
&gt; Its not sharding, Yes ok it works exactly the same as sharding but its not sharding though!
---
It doesn't work exactly the same as sharding does, though.  I don't love the idea either, but it's disingenuous to act as if they aren't different things.
---
How can you gank him while im around 24/7 😃
---
That’s basically how I feel about anything post 60. I like the idea of new content and I love TBC but it should not be on the same server as classic. It should be a seperate server if done.
---
I'd rather see X-realm BGs for servers that need it rather than on every server. On both I played on in vanilla both factions had very fast queues and the PvP community was amazing. That totally died out when X-realm BGs was released.
---
But I'm just happy to have vanilla again anyway! :) Hopefully the people who want that PvP community will help me and others that do bring some cool PvP events to the server instead.
---
I like 3-4months 
---
allow time for people to max gear out and chill a bit instead of get best gear then do it again right after
---
&gt; If you are more than 5 people you will not see the other poor guy who gets left behind, yeah great solution.
---
TIL raid groups don't exist
---
&gt; You expect everyone to read a German news site? And follow their small YouTube channel...
---
nope, just don't talk about the subject you don't know of.
---
Idk why you're so stuck on level cap increase as a stat fix. All of that is adjustable.
---
That is a huge amount of time though, for some. I don't want to hit 60 knowing I'm essentially going to be merged into what amounts to another server full of people I've never even had the chance to encounter.
---
I don't want to hit 60 knowing I could have had way more PvP fights if layering wasn't there.
---
I don't want to be thinking about the people I can't see. I just want to play the game that we've all been begging them to bring back *as is.*
---
Not without lowering other peoples power.
---
I did play vanilla, which is why I'm puzzled by the people who seem to *want* pserver launches with massive crowds and e.g. 500 people all trying to tag Hogger. Vanilla was nothing like that; the playerbase was spread out.
---
If you are completely against layers, just join a low pop server.
---
The layers will be gone quicker on them, than high pop servers. 
---
Personally I'm okay with this as a compromise to sharding.
---
In one of the interviews, they said that there will be a classic forums with separate realm threads.
---
I don't think that getting days off work to play WoW on 27.08 would be a great idea. If tech problems or queues don't happen, too many people will be fighting over mob spawns, making your free time not very effective. 
---
Personally, I'm gonna take my time while leveling, probably will want to stay a little behind the initial huge pack. I'm gonna use my time off when I hit lvl 60, to gear up faster and get ready for endgame.
---
For the Horde!
---
I really have no idea (and don't think anyone does) of the best way to get in an amazing guild now.  I joined a private server guild that was going to move when classic launched, and have stayed in contact with my old Free Company leader from FFXIV but I think I'll still need to work on getting into a top tier guild.  A lot of people quit wow recently but you can prob find people in current wow if you look hard!
---
Bu but you don't have to study...
---
Literally just nostalgia
---
After thinking on it I think I would switch form 2-3 months to 4-5 on average.
---
You're missing the point. The population is as much a part of the experience as quests and mobs.
---
You won't be building the same rivalries and alliances with players you meet along the way if the population gets constantly divided and segregated.
---
Ahh shit I knew I would get in!!
---
Absolutely correct. People should inform themselves.
---
I don't want to play on ghostservers.
---
To be totally honest if that's your mind set then maybe classic as a long term game isn't for you. I dont mean that as an insult either, just if you are looking for a constant state of progression play retail.
---
The point of classic is to relive a game that doesn't officially exist anymore. Will it be super popular in lime 2 or 3 years? Probably not. There will be a handful of dedicated players though constantly leveling alts and such though. This is the experience that was asked for.
---
All they have to do is raise the boss levels and make all the new gear with higher levels of +hit on it.
---
The whole tuesday
---
Oh I see now. On my phone it's a panda but blown up nicely on a computer its a dwarf.
---
I suppose some people will try to be realm firsts, and some will have guild websites up before release.
---
You are correct.
---
I'm already unable to go 30 minutes without thinking about this and now I can listen to the music on top of that? Why have you done this to me?
---
You obviously have no idea what i'm talking about..
---
They just want to make sure we are prepared! (mixed metaphor I know)
---
Thank you :)
---
12 am should be midday
---
12 pm would be midnight
---
So what is the difference between Classic and Retail in the case that they start adding new content to Classic?
---
I don't mind TBC or Wotlk servers as long as they don't force the Vanilla servers to progress to them.
---
You're asking if a game made in 2004 can run on your 2013 mac? Is that a joke? Only limiting factor to you playing classic is if aren't any mac clients
---
Is there going to be a tracker somehow that measures time jumping around in circles?
---
At the end of Monday night for you my man.
---
I've already been disappointed by GoT this year... don't you fucking dare Blizzard.
---
I've been saying this for years.
---
where in the client was it?  I know there is like no chance I get in but I have not played in a long time and would love to know where to look.
---
I'll be on a cruise ship from 6th of Sep to 21st Sep on a fam holiday. Might have to smuggle a laptop onboard
---
Hearing the way he talks about wow classic I can tell
---
He prefers the game the way it is now and doesn’t believe in wow classic a viable beyond a niche player base. He seems to be under the impression that bfa&gt;classic and their current active player base will only play classic out of curiosity and go running back to retail.  
---
I’m honestly disappointed in this whole video and layering.
---
Nice!  I must have missed that one today.  Thanks
---
Thanks!
---
The layers will be differently on low and high pop servers.
---
So for low pop servers like rp servers the layers will be gone quicker than on high pop pvp servers. 
---
You can't make them equally long. And that's also why everyone has a different idea how long the layer will be. Weeks, months, they probably don't know either.
---
&gt;  Fairly certain they weren't aiming for a particular season but when it's done.
---
Yeah it's a multi million dollar product, i am sure they don't really mind when they release it to produce the best result. I am sure they just release willy nilly whenever they feel like it.
---
If you don’t have a fucked sleep schedule, you’re not trying hard enough haha
---
I wouldn't say it's great. Personally, I'd rather have dynamic respawning coupled with a tight view on the economy in the first phase. But that is certainly more upkeep and doesn't scale well with unexpected demand.
---
As for solutions that are realistic, layering is probably a very good one.
---
Depends first mmo or not
---
You're an asshole for purposely misrepresenting the opinions of a lot of people. We have a point, you're apparently just too stupid to grasp it.
---
I don't understand something about layering. People keep saying there will be 2000-3000 people per layer. If that's the case, why not just make the server cap 3000? It would literally be the same thing. If there's 3000 people per layer you're still gonna have a lot of people at the same time.
---
Also, when they eventually merge layers this would mean that server caps could reach as high as 9000-12000. That seems like a lot. A LOT.
---
Be the change you want, set up a massive LAN (I know its not really lan) event where a ton of people get together for launch!  There is zero chance of something like that happening in my area (southern Missouri) and think it would be so cool if you did.
---
Ok neck beard you go and enjoy the rest of your sad incel life while I try and better myself
---
As much as I hate waking up early and as much as I love going straight into an all nighter in launch, I know deep down that this is probably the best time to launch
---
Love your work.
---
There are already guild recruitment discord’s set up and specific guild discord’s for classic, for us and eu guilds.
---
Lmao
---
Not in 1.12. Not in Classic.
---
Streamers have a lot of "buddies"
---
Didn’t blizzard say layering isn’t going to be around for all that long. If that’s the truth I doubt having it around for the first month of the game will have that much of an impact on anything. Layering won’t be around when world bosses are released and that would be the main point against it that would affect gameplay heavily.
---
One specific oozling pet gave you a debuff when you summoned it. Mainly for flavor. But since it had no CD, the debuff would keep reapplying, and players had limited debuff slots too... you could use it to clear your debuffs, even the non-dispellable ones. 
---
The problem? It was rare as shit to get
---
how fucked up is that though?
---
&gt;	No-Lifers are the reason Classic is even a thing. 
---
No they aren’t lol.  Also, this isn’t a quality of life change... it’s a preventative measure.  Would you rather having more servers that will end up a ghost land after a few months?  It’s the same thing from people like you, you whine about anything and everything but you don’t pose any sort of solution.
---
We most definitely will be getting oceanic servers haha. Even if it’s just a few, they have the infrastructure.
---
Having 10k players online on one server also isn´t Vanilla.
---
We take you on 2v2, duh
---
Since they want layers to feel as persistent as possible, you should only be kicked into other layers in edge cases where your own layer is already full. For instance during peaks when there is already a queue. If you log out and get through the queue, you might be bumped to another layer. You also might stay in the same one. So it would be a gamble on your part that you can neither fully measure the odds of, nor game in a meaningful way.
---
I'd say if you want to suffer queue's to avoid being camped, it's not so different than just logging to an alt to avoid being camped.
---
August 26th Americas 3pm.
---
Wait, what. It releases Tuesday night at midnight. That is all day Wednesday for EU.
---
Well, I guess the big whirlpool in the Indian Ocean explains MH370
---
Is it a timing thing with cross realms where you suddenly see a bunch of Korean and it reduces immersion?  Dilution of ranking (make it harder to rank cause you can bg like 24hrs a day)?  What do you think would be the worst part of this?
---
Found this in my emails.
---
http://imgur.com/ceWremG
---
The last beta I was in I received an email so it may be similar.
---
Don't think I even tested this one haha.
---
I will never agree with the last part.
---
But as people who scream the loades always get their way, even if it's not in the best interest of Wow, I'm just going to enjoy 6 phases. 
---
I got screwed by the community once, the community will not screw me over a second time. 
---
What a shame I really wanted play for years.
---
I purposely didn’t spend any sick time this school year for classic wow, yeah I’m that person so was hoping to go out for two weeks and neck beard
---
Only 5? I got 7,5 weeks a year.
---
good goyim, keep accepting everything activision shove it up your mouth
---
While I do agree that the leveling up and world traversing processes were rather lengthy and slow in vanilla and that this should be preserver; this was *not* due to always being surrounded by hundreds of players killing your mobs or grabbing your quest objectives. As someone who played vanilla, player density just wasn't as high as it eventually became during the later expansion launches and even more during some pserver launches. You'd of course run into other players a lot, but not in huge crowds. 
---
So, I would rather they preserved this (and the playability that comes along with it) rather than go for some kind of welcome-to-vanilla shock and awe effect with no connection to *actual* vanilla.
---
Clearly not a mage player. I wanted to AOE farm and layering is a blessing
---
You're not taking into account natural decline of the playerbase. 
---
It's pretty obvious, I'd think, that a lot of players will simply have a look and see rather than commit to playing Classic long-term. It's the same sub as retail, so a ton of retail players will try it out and likely get disenfranchised fast. 
---
So no, once they remove the layering the result wont just be all layers summed up. Presumably there will be fewer and fewer layers going forward, as the playerbase declines and settles on a core group. 
---
This is also their justification for doing it this way rather than opening up more servers, as more servers would mean a lot of ghost servers once the playerbase declines and then you get into the mess of realm mergers.
---
Yeah I’m honestly not that concerned about it cause it won’t be around long, but I’ve seen plenty of people talk about abusing it. I thought of this and figured I’d share. 
---
Also happy cake day :)
---
4-5 for my vote, but I'd be ok with 5+
---
Even though I'll be trying to speed level my main, I'd like them to draw the phases out. I want them to carrot on a stick a bit so people have things to look forward to. Once we hit phase 6/Naxx, that's it*. No need to rush it imo.
---
*For hopefully a few years until TBC
---
They did exist in 1.12, so you're wrong.
---
I do not get how people have a problem with this. It is better than sharding by a good bit, and is only there temporarily to ensure a smooth launch. No reason to complain.
---
If they manage to keep classic spirit then I'm all up to it. After all we know that a lot of content was scrapped from original Vanilla (Emerald Dream, Hellfire Peninsula etc.) I would live to see these kind of things to happen now that they have a tons of experience and time and money.
---
I really do hope Classic will mean new era for WoW. I am already quite fed up with current direction of retail. I hope Classic and possible new content will be huge success and it will effect retail as well, making developers to look back what WoW was all about.
---
A lot more information will be available today after the beta launches so I think just be patient.  That said I would love to try my hand at addon development in the Beta, but they said it is going to be super tiny so I hope just a few developers get in at all.   Do you know of any streamers that do add on development cause I know they all got in?
---
Yea it’s a good idea. I hope people don’t figure out other ways to abuse it and ruin the gameplay for everyone else. And thanks I didn’t even notice haha
---
I don't understand how *you* don't understand why someone might not be okay with their server being "seamlessly" merged with another full of people they've never even had the opportunity to interact with.
---
It undermines the sense of community.
---
People will find ways to exploit it, *even if it's temporary.*
---
4 weeks is long enough for a ton of people to hit 60. I'd be much more receptive to this if it was for opening day and maybe one or two after. Beyond that, let it be a crowded, authentic server.
---
This changes the leveling experience in a noticeable way, and I'm disappointed.
---
I think this post was directed at you.
---
Take my down vote
---
Because, even beyond the people who will give Classic a wholehearted attempt and give up, there’s going to be a LOT of people who just kind of try it out because they think it’s somewhat interesting. Everyone who pays for retail WoW is going to suddenly have another game option available to them that they’ve already paid for, and it’s sort of disingenuous to even call them “tourists”, they’re literally just logging in to run around a bit.
---
The problem is that if there were a 3000 person server cap, then that server would be filled up within a day, and most of the people would never be around, or would just run around starting zones at level 5 every few months. It would really ruin the game for the other people on that server.
---
but it's the original pets as part of the original vanilla... why would that bug you? It's a nod to those who were OG enough to have a VANILLA collectors edition.
---
For me, the best part of this is that I don’t have to stuff around picking my character visuals on launch and can just go straight in
---
Shhh!
---
No, it's quite a bit worse.  Especially when it comes to resource scarcity.  You're going to have several times as much ore/cloth/etc saturating the AH than there should be because there are multiple instances of each continent running on a given realm.
---
Yeah I agree 100%.  The way they are currently bringing retail items over to classic would work this way better too.  I would love to buy the collector pets but c'est la vie.
---
No wow tokens...?? They're...really not gonna do microtransactions? It's gonna be the honest to god classic fucking experience? Is this real? Fucking sold me on it GOD DAMN
---
4-5 days PLAYED time, and that's using an optimal class and spec, assuming little to no competition on mobs, and while skipping all dungeons.  4 days 20 hours is the record as far as I've seen, which will probably not be possible this time around with the level of competition.  
---
I predict we'll see the first group of hardcore players hitting 60 around 8 -10 RL days (with a few lucky/mega-hardcore outliers in 6-8 days).  It's pointless though unless you have other 60's to run content with or buy your wares.
---
You too friend :)
---
I lol'd
---
This made me smile
---
I am 30 while going back to school. Sometimes your and idiot and party your 20s away and start life to late. This launch sucks for me, but you bet ill be playing regardless. I just wish i could of hit 60 before life get busy again. Btw i work at the same time lol
---
Yeah it sucks.  If you're trying to gank someone, they can just get an invite from someone in a different layer and escape.  It's like flying but worse.
---
What ever you do don't show them this meme... they will put you in extra classes and tutoring every day.
---
Fuck you on about?
---
This post is directed towards people that are not apart of this sub...?
---
Good math but one important thing is that RP PvP would be a lot bigger if it was released with RP servers
---
People didn't want to reroll and friends joined their RP server when they started playing etc.
---
Also, to my point. Sternwheedle Cartel died out when RP PvP severs started. Lost a major portion of players.
---
&gt; World PvP is not going to ramp up significantly until honor rewards in Phase 2 (when layering is done).
---
Did you not play in early vanilla?
---
Staysafe, esfand, tipsout are 3 i can name atm
---
This made me think of a question, do you guys think blizz will still allow payment of monthly sub through in game gold even in classic? 
---
They'd have to value classic gold differently, I wonder if they will do it eventually.
---
Yes that's i'm currently banned from r/wow for holding this opinion so i posted it here
---
Good video, and as should be obvious to most people, this kind of player density didn't really exist in vanilla. Neither the servers nor people's computers would do a very good job of handling it. Beyond not providing for an enjoyable playing experience, it's not something classic should attempt to emulate because it just isn't accurate.
---
&gt; Thats the whole point i think most of us is trying to make. If they wouldda "stuck" to no change mentality, and keep server pop similar, there wouldn't have been any need for sharding/Layering.
---
I understand now.
---
Though with layering they have the ability to cut down a layer to well below the 2-3k player mark. Even with "just" 2-3k players if 1-1.5k start in the first 2-3 days, the level 1-20 zones will not be a great experience at all. People at the summit tested and gave an average respawn time per normal mob of ~5 minutes. Quick napkin math:
---
If the 1-10 zones have at total of 300 mobs (I suspect there are less), this means there are 1800 mobs in all 1-10 starting zones. Assuming further a perfect racial and starting zone split (impossible due to orcs, trolls as well as dwarves and gnomes) and 900 players active in the 1-10 zones in first 5 hours (a good estimate to get out of 1-10 if you play casually). Last assumption is perfect spread of these 900 players over the level brackets and the subzones of the 1-10 zones. This leaves 2 mobs per player and brings the average time to kill 1 mob to about 2 1/2 minutes.
---
I deliberately chose conservative values here. Respawn time is probably more closely to 5.5 minutes. Players will not distribute evenly in starting zones and subzones. 900 players in the first 5 hours seems not terribly high. Imagine having to kill the Scarlett Messenger in Deathknell. The vast majority of players will skip questing at least until they are level 10 or higher. Just because doing quest chains gets you stuck at parts where you have to kill specific mobs. This just doesn't check out for me and would also make for a terrible public impression.
---
Overall, I still prefer higher pop servers as they offer a higher chance of activity into the later phases and beyond. Also loging queues will be shorter this way.
---
Well I’m saying it as a backup if they don’t do what we want which is release with one
---
Also the 2000-3000 cap is concurrent players. At launch everyone will be playing a lot at once, but within a few days to a few weeks, people's playing time will spread out so it's not all overlapping. This will lower the number of concurrent players even if they are all still playing (which they won't be).
---
4-5 days of /played. This is 96 to 120 hours, which, while possible within a week, is unlikely (this would mean 14 to 17 hours of played time per day for the whole week), except for maybe one or two players.
---
A week and a half is my guess for the more "hardcore" player (that's still 8 to 12 hours a day), and up to a month for the more normal / casual player that hasn't optimized anything.
---
Oh god, that has to be at least 40% of my post-60 playtime
---
They might just make them extremely expensive, like 10k of gold per one mount (/gasps). I'll gladly farm for it.
---

Level: 0
---
I was going to try to go all out and get everything.  I know I would never happen, just bugs me that before the game even starts I can't get everything no matter how hard I try.  Like I said it's a small thing and I still want to get all classes to max level with BiS Naxx gear (like I said I know it's never going to happen but I like long term goals like that, I'll never hike the whole Appalacian trail but wanting to got me motivated to hike a lot more in the parks in my area, it's that kind of thinking)
---
If they wanted a cash grab they would have sold another annual pass like they did with mop beta.  Sub for a year and get access to wow classic beta! Or they would have a "deluxe edition" of classic that gives you access to beta.
---
The community has never been able to vote on any content, not sure what you're on about. Current retail is 100% blizzard's vision developed over time. Influenced by marketing, user feedback and metrics, sure, but it's always been the vocal minorities. Never had the full demographic of wow got to voice their say on future content.
---
Its not a rumor.
---
It is stated specifically by blizzard.
---
You will never receive access without a sub.
---
Right.   
---
So rather than remove them completely from the game, keep them permanently available.   
---
That way people dont have to rush to get them.
---
No
---
No, you're thinking of the Classic Demo. Classic WoW will (and currently is) on the most current Retail Client version.
---
No.
---
You must own the base game and I think if you get selected for the beta you will be prompted to buy a sub, might be wrong though.
---
Jesse Cox, Towellie, Chinglish
---
If they do expansions, they should make the numbers normalized. I dont want to see a lvl 61 green outranking a lvl 60 purple.. the expansions essentially killed the content of previous games except for some of the leveling. Especially flying....
---
This combined with a cool down are the best ideas to handle layering I have seen so far.  Also I view a lot of the discussion as passionate people worrying about the by far biggest change they have announced yet, they will calm down as time goes on.
---
because now i can reserve my favorite name Vinticore.
---
It takes far longer than 3-4 months to max gear.
---
Retail is fucking trash... What crack you smoking bro?
---
&gt;This will skew the economy and players with these items hugely, don't you think?
---
Remember, vanilla wasn't a hyper-competitive environment. People took their time, there wasn't a lot of organization done to speedlevel a premade guild to 60 to claim all the nodes or 'corner the market' on certain resources. A vast majority went in knowing nothing about flasks, lotuses, arcanite bars, BiS or the earning potential of the AH -- but by the time they were 60, they could still get it on it. It wasn't only attainable to a select few, hardcore players.
---
If they just make it to where you don't phase into the other layer unless at least 1 person from the group you joined is somewhat near you it would cut down on potential abuse by a lot.  You couldn't just invite someone from a different layer, you'd have to get someone in the same area of the same zone you are currently in.
---
hindsight really is 20/20 i guess. this is a great chance to go down an alternate path with the benefit of hindsight though
---
Took a week off work
---
I was so excited for a “classic summer”...I have classes starting back up on August 26th with 18 credits, an internship, and tutoring. It was fun being hyped, but now I’m just lost 😂 Good things are coming though, I feel it!
---
can you link it? i cant find it
---
Nobody knows if we are being honest. The post by blizzard was vague
---
Cant fuckin wait. Cant ruin my life any more. Its already fucked up so yay! :D
---
Ion literally says in an interview it's just for afew weeks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236
---
Thanks for the link.
---
Nothing there was said about “being assigned a random layer when you log in”.
---
so you can come home from an office and then watch people in an office?
---
No they dont, every sub will be able to reserve his name on the 13. of August
---
It's there in the blog post, it's not my words.
---
How is this an issue? It's super temporary and a better alternative to normal sharding.
---
Seems like an extremely naive mindset to think people won’t abuse it. Of course they will, people will design their entire farming strategies around layering
---
Hey! I can melee!
---
Well if you want the game to end up like Anthem it could have a BETA 1 month before release.
---
Its only for a week or 2
---
BURN HIM
---
Now I’ll finally get the references behind the classic cards in hearthstone.
---
&gt; and you can expect world PvP in every layer.
---
If you're lucky enough to be in a populous layer.  Maybe it doesn't happen in your layer at all, though.  If it were a coherent world, you'd get _all_ of the wPvP, _all_ of the time.  That's how it should be, but that's not how it is in Classic.
---
&gt; Ressource : you'll have X times the ressource and X times the player. supply and demand remain balanced.
---
That's not how it works, bud.
---
&gt; Population : doesn't happen on live server where there's sharding everywhere.
---
Layering doesn't work like sharding does.  Sharding actively re-allocates players to different shards to compensate for population fluctuations.  Layers do not.  Unless your entire layer despawns, you stay in that layer indefinitely-- for better or worse.  That's one of the major ways layers differ from shards-- you trade active load balancing for a degree of coherence.
---
&gt; next argument? none of those even come remotely close to the downside of having no sharding
---
I'm not interested in "arguing" with you.  These are real issues, whether you can wrap your head around them or not.  Cheers and muted.
---
ITT: you can’t say anything the echo chamber, if you do you’re toxic!
---
&gt;If it was just a matter of offering a better/easier levelling experience and of avoiding login-queues, I’d be 100% against any of that (that being sharding and layering)
---
Why would you be against it? Vanilla, as it were, did not have 1k players launching into Elwynn Forest. If that's what you want, maybe a pserver launch would be a better option.
---
So i have all the way up to bfa purchased already. All i have to do is get a 1 month sub and i can play?
---
Incorrect. It is stated very clearly.
---
I'm expecting top tier memes from you guys over the next couple of days.
---
It is stated very clearly on their website. You need a sub.
---
I hope not
---
I played horde on Burning Legion for the first 8 months or so of the game before I rerolled on Frostmane.
---
Was that bastard Octavian around on Alliance while you played? He had a pretty negative rep among the Horde and I always went out of my way to harass him with my rogue when I saw him around Blackrock Mountain.
---
I heard the same thing but couldn't find a source before when I went looking a couple hours ago.  You have a time stamp (there have been so many videos I couldn't find it myself)?
---
Why not play BFA If that’s what you want
---
I'm hoping that phases 1 3 and 5 will last much longer than the other phases since they add by far the most content. I'd be fine with 6 months on each of those phases.  No point in rushing it
---
No way, although you will still be able to pay for your sub with retail gold, so there will probably be people trading vanilla gold for retail gold
---
I definitely got an email for the BFA beta. I just checked and it's still in my inbox. I don't see a Legion one though, and I know I got into that one as well.
---
&gt;The guy you're responding to is correct: there will be way more resources/items flooding the AH (or being hoarded) for those first few weeks. That's a long time, for the hardcore. 
---
Statistically, this also means you would have roughly 3x the number of high level players, and also roughly 3x the amount of hardcore people. So, yes, there would be more ressources available, but also more players to fight for them. I don't think layering will be an issue for the economy, as offer and demand should still be somewhat balanced. 
---
I'm worried about the layering in the long term though. They will have to be somewhat aggressive with the removal of layers if they want the economy to stay healthy. Let's say a normal server cap is 3000 and that, at launch, you have 9000 players on 3 different layers. A few weeks in, you're now at 7500 players. If you don't remove one of the layers, or redistribute players evenly accross those layers, you could start having a layer with more ressources than the other ones. 
---
Another thing I am a bit worried about, is if WoW Classic is ***very*** popular. Let's say you have, I don't know, 15 000 people shared accross 5 layers. A few weeks in, this number stabilizes at 9000 and doesn't go down. You went from 5 layers down to 3, but what do you do with the remaining 3 layers? Ion said he wants to remove them for when thel world bosses get patched in. If you remove them, you suddenly have a very unbalanced economy (compared to before) as there are a lot of players for the amount of available ressources. This is basically the reverse of the ghost servers they are trying to avoid, and I don't see an easy solution for that, besides opening new servers and offering free transfers.
---
I guess time will tell.
---
Where does it say when phase 1 ends? Because that's it, phase 1 will never end!
---
Thought they wanted to shard the starting zones for a week or two so fighting over mobs won’t be a big deal? 3000 people split at the starting zones doesn’t solve any problems. Might as well not use layers either
---
There will not be an option to toggle the character model, I'm pretty sure I've read that.
---
Keep trying asshole you've got a long way to go
---
I **really** like the idea that people can only group up in Major cities. So much so, that I actually want it to stay after layering lol
---
Addons are being pretty restricted though.

German Shop, it’s the same with UK Shop
---
Not to sign up for the beta, which I did without a sub. If you get selected I assume you're gonna have to purchase a sub in order to play.
---
Glad I could help and know you're not alone. Many will be gaming with you that feel the same way
---
not yet
---
oh darn i was looking for NA
---
I've played since beta. Layering is absolutely something to gripe about.... if it wasn't temporary. But it is. So....?
---
Wait.. how are the people clamouring for long queue times and massive competition for resources the same people who dumbed down retail?
---
Looks like it doesn’t exist out of Europe at Amazon 🤔
---
They might just make them extremely expensive, like 10-15k of gold.
---
Its not a video. Stop watching youtube and falling for clickbait.
---
Its right on their website if you would read.

---
It says participants which could mean that you would need an active account to actually log in but they might send you an invite if you played a ton back in the day.  There is only a small amount of wiggle room and most likely only retail players will get an invite but who knows.
---
Also just so anyone knows they said it was going to be tiny, so don't sub for some small chance to get in, wait for the stress tests when I assume everyone can try.
---
&gt;Vanilla servers had 5k max pop. 
---
No, they didn't.
---
It's not really about a few dollars, it's just how they are trying to earn it from you. The Blizzard I grew up with gave us so much value for every penny we spent. I mean, look at the support they give to games that are twenty years old like Starcraft.
---
But most of us are grown adults with plenty of disposable income. We may easily spend tens if not hundreds of dollars on cool Blizzard merchandise. But they are basically nickle and diming people for two weeks of subscription just to have a fair shot at a screen name. That's not the way to do it in my opinion, but I understand others like you may not care or already play bfa so it does not affect you.
---
People do not read.
---
Ignorance is a choice.
---
Mate, you are grasping at straws to try and prove your point. It will be no problem to change layer unless they add in something to stop you.
---
I would not be surprised if there was an addon to do it for you.
---
Being a belligerent asshole might have something to do with it too.
---
I think playing retail requires you to buy the expansion. But I honestly have no interest in playing it even if it were free. I don't really have a connection to modern WoW, and the only reason I even think about WoW is because of Classic.
---
Yup, he was definitely around then. He was the leader of the super large zerg guild, Arcanus and Vas Arcanus. Here are some old school names you may or may not remember:  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/old-school-players-guilds/63287](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/old-school-players-guilds/63287)
---
I can’t wait to see people realize how hard getting good gear actually was back in the days when they were not dropping from every other trash mob and dungeons. :D
---
Isn't the whole point of layering to avoid 600 people in Elwynn? That would only be solved if they had fewer players in each layer. Like a thousand or less.
---
Lol the ret paladin in that photo
---
True, Hunters were the fastest though.
---
" We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!" so I assume so
---
&gt;A full vanilla server was around 5k, not 3k.
---
Are you drunk?
---
That sounds awesome!   
---
Where did you hear/read that?   
---
I'm sorry to sound suspicious but you know how it is with the Internet - we've all been let down so many times...   
---
(like, you know, 'get ready for a Classic summer!' followed by 'release Aug 27th)...
---
wtf
---
kek. That would certainly keep it as a statussymbol, but it doesnt really make sense that an unarmored mount costs more than an armored one.
---
If layers are filled with the people you eventually will be locked with, I'd say it's not that bad. Hope they will disable it earlier though.
---
user experience is better with layering though..?
---
It's not good enough, and no. Of course we don't believe it. It's fucking Blizzard. if you trust Blizzard at this point, you are stupid at best.
---
Is this a trick? I can't find the dog.
---
One of my earliest memories was of a WSG match against devs and GMs. It was pure fun to see a gnome the size of ragnaros running with our flag midfield with a treant healing him.
---
There aren't the same number of players. The alternative to layering would be login queues or additional realms.
---
After watching the devs talk about layering, and reading the majority of the posts about layering, I have realized that 99% of people don’t know what the fuck layering is. Hahahahah
---
I'm so sorry, Mr. Fox, that you can't reach the grapes. But can't you let those of us who can enjoy them?
---
The hardest part about playing Alliance is telling your father your gay, only idiots dont realize this.
---
 And that's the rare case when you happen to be on deferent layers from your friends. People you see in the starting zone, you're stuck with. You'll see the same people.
---
Honestly this is a minor inconvenience.
---
omg that was always the highlight is finding some new pattern to jump around. That is one thing I will be looking forward to in classic org, jumping around the top of the bank again.
---
One of Tips mods? Sorry, must be thinking of someone else.
---
Nice! Considering posting this on /r/ClassicAddOns , I hope to see a lot more addons there once people get Beta access. Even if you don't, maybe someone could test it out for you there, before launch.
---
Ahhh, yes, Arcanus. That's the one.
---
Ogers are like onions!!
---
It will matter server by server really.  I know it is said all the time but just play what you want and try to make your server the one you want it to be.
---
Personally I'm gonna roll Horde and start a leveling guild, before transitioning to hopefully a council spot or class leader spot in a raiding guild.  If the ratio is super far to the alliance to my server I'll focus more on PvP (the rank grind will be easier this way) and make my mark that way.  Even if you are on a imbalanced server (and it does suck I had a human death knight on Illidan and let me tell you that was a nightmare to raid at all) you might still find it easier to make your name in a uncrowded field.
---
Ion actually said "we'll collapse before phase 2 because there should ever only be 1 kazzak, and if people wanna spend 5 hours pvping over him that's what should happen"
---
Where do the devs state that you will be manually able to transfer layers???
---
I just got goosebumps. 3 months boys and girls. 3 months.
---
It's terrible practice, and will abused to shit. 
---
I know I'll be waiting for the emptier layer to pop up, get a friend to log and invite me, and bim bam. Ez Black lotuses for me, with 0 competition.
---
Because they didnt learn and dont understand they are the reason it went to shit.
---
He doesn't own you. Do what you want.
---
Who said there was laying in vanilla? Lmfao.
---
And people who watch/share videos related to asmongold shouldnt be taken seriously.
---
Nobody is mentioning the extremely temporary nature of this though. They said end of phase one maximum but several times said they thought a few weeks. Such a short amount of time compared to the life of the game.
---
Only the sweats and tists are concerned about this.
---
Pretty sure there were several problems during the 2004 launch. There will probably be even more players this time around. From what I've gathered, the technological improvements won't help too much. There's simply going to be too many players in one place.
---
There are a few interviews on Youtube now with the devs where they stress some of the stuff you mentioned. There is one with Ion where he basically said that TBC and WOTLK is possible if vanilla Is successful enough, but it is not decided yet, just as an example. There is another one with Top... something talking to a couple of other devs that discuss the layering and features like realm transfers etc. 
---
Sorry, but I have no links.
---
TipsOut posted an interview with Jon Hight and the lead dev today (can't link as I'm on my phone but it's on his YouTube) where they confirmed it
---
I played from vanilla's beta up through BFA without missing an expansion. I don't currently play.
---
That's an incredible skill you have, to be able to know what someone thinks and feels.
---
I got super lucky I picked 2 weeks starting August 27. I had to pick my vacation by oct of last year.
---
Except it exists, even on pservers. Playing PVP there is terrific, learning all the different teammates and opponents to know throughout repeated battles.
---
Are "Layers" equal to phasing? I'm quite confused.
---
Been playing the video games I love since 1979. Literally no idea what you’re talking about.
---
It's nice because it gives a bit of context, but it's miles and miles less than what happened for vanilla launch. Remember Garrick padfoot or w/e in elwynn? 2 to 5 mins respawn, literally a queue of 50 ppl trying to tag him first. And that's only the people who didn't opt to just forfeit that quest altogether
---
This playlist mostly contains rock and numetal songs since those seem to be popular with pvp videos, but I tried to make it more eclectic by including multiple genres. Most songs range from 1999-2006.
---
Enjoy!
---
Shameless plug of my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/cooleobrad) &amp; [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cooleobrad) where I'll be making Classic WoW content upon release. I already have some videos up now!
---
Rofl the druid part just kept going it was amazing
---
I'm not so sure relogging used to work in vanilla. Did he try running outside, reset, and then enter again? That's how I remember it being done.
---
Yeah,  they'll for sure release one if they see classic growing. But it's like hitting that part of their fan base in the face with "nah, you'll have to wait until you can really commit".
---
I'm damn positive they'll change their minds though =)!

---
It was never there. But it belongs there now right? LFR was never in Vanilla. Why not add that, too?
---
you knew that sharding was going to last all the way through phase 1 for months ?
---
The only thing I saw was that layers will be quite static so that the same players will be in the same layer until they merge. Not so much dynamic except for grouping with bnet friends in another layer. No idea about the other stuff though.
---
The jimi or Bob version?
---
I have spare deodorant in my truck - and have been planning to play rogue.
---
What the shit?
---
It most likely is if you listen to Ion's exact words. Remember that "a few weeks" could be over a month
---
I'm split on the issue.
---
I really appreciate that they're thinking about long-term sustainability for each realm. Meanwhile I still think there will be tons of exploiting the layer system.
---
Either way, I'm just psyched to return to old-school WoW. Major lol @ everyone who plans so stick to private servers because the first phase of Classic won't be 100% what they imagined. Have fun getting fucked by Crogge &amp; Co.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion, but as someone who played classic from the moment servers went live, this is literally the first time I ever hear of something called "unarmored mounts". Couldn't care less.
---
Are you having a stroke or do you not understand what this is about?
---
Its supposed to smooth out server load so you dont end up with dead servers.
---
Some people are just dumb as fuck.
---
&gt; How dynamic is layering ?
---
They said it will be as little dynamic as possible with you seeing the same people as you level up.
---
&gt; Are layer created day 1 and are then stuck until removed manually ? or are they rather added and removed dynamically depending of how many player are log in the realm ?
---
I could be wrong but I think you get assigned a layer as you create your character, this is the only way I can see you continuing to see the same people over and over as you level.  Then as more people are made they make another layer when the first fills up.
---
&gt; Are chat channel shared between the layers ? (I guess not)
---
I would guess not too, but who knows.  It would be weird to hear a call out on /WorldDefence and then get there and see no one.
---
&gt; Is AH shared between the layers ? (I hope so)
---
This is what I think is the most interesting question, with the unsaid part being how will this affect the economy.  No word yet.
---
More info will come out as the streamers play around with it tomorrow but the layering is actually becoming one of the things I am most interested in.
---
To be fair they didn't state whether you needed an active sub to be invited. They only stated that "Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account." which makes sense in order to play the game.
---
I decided to take the Tuesday off to relive the launch in the way it was supposed to work!
---
Then I thought, man I'll be tired on Wednesday. So I took that day off as well.
---
Now I'm for some odd reason free all week!
---
And they didn't even lie. It was never a promise. They just said that it was a current solution that they were considering. This community (not you) just wants to be butthurt.
---
&gt; I don't think having to be subscribed 2 weeks before go live actually matters when you're expecting to be subscribed for 6 months or more.
---
I think even you would agree that this logically does matter. It's true that in terms of nominal value, few of us care about a few dollars. But it is a bad practice.
---
Imagine you buy a 6 week cruise and they ask you to pay an addition half a day of cruise to get access to some basic but fairly impactful feature. That half a day you pay will be absolutely useless to you except for getting a feature that used to come with the cruise for free.
---
It's not a perfect analogy but as a matter of principle, this matters. We're all going to be paying customers on launch day, just let people make their names on launch day. Classic should have nothing to do with retail, so doing something like letting retail players reserve names 2 weeks in advance is just a really petty thing to do.
---
Where they mention that you can hop from one layer to another via party invites
---
Probably should be 24h hours after the announcement. Would make the most sense
---
They had that in wow too, last day of open beta was a giant event with demons too
---
Maybe I'm reading a different comment section but it seems like 90% of everyone is perfectly fine with 2 weeks of layering, I've yet to see someone give a valid complaint against it...
---
I mamaged to buy one from the store. Sold out in an hour too
---
You should try decaf
---
Actually, they explicitly said in the dev interview that this would not happen.
---
You will always see the same players.
---
The simple answer (which is usually a bad one) is that I don't think they have made up their minds yet.  They have a small feeling that this could be huge, it also could be a time sink that investors blame a failed retail on.  Time will just have to tell.
---
So happy to see Jesse still rocking it in the WoW community, he got me through a lot of sad times as a teen with his videos. WoWcrendor as well I believe has an invite.
---
Except you weren't told that. You were told that it was one of the possible solutions that they were considering. They even stated in the comments where you're likely sourcing from that they still hadn't decided on a final solution.
---
They didn't learn.. what, exactly?
---
How did the people who said "keep literally everything the same" ruin old WoW and lead to what we have in modern WoW?
---
Closed beta has been confirmed
---
Hey what if it's too hard for me to find raid members in Classic WoW? That's why LFR is a good thing. Same logic really.
---
You severely underestimate how many people will be pushing 60 asap. A lot more than 1-2 ppl per server. Around 100 per server would be more realistic
---
hol up... new tool album????
---
All it says is that you need a sub to participate, most likely meaning you are correct. But there is also room for it to mean you can get access -&gt; buy a sub and play.
---
I'm a noob but think he is talking about sharding?
---
If i clear MC as a bad Feral Druid.. then cookie cutter class. If i'm a good Feral Druid, then Feral Druid. and that's exactly what i'm going to do, Feral DPS. I have to push classic to it's limits to compete with top DPS, but i'm able to.
---
I’m talking about feeling, I still remember playing vanilla wow and that amazement I felt playing it for the first time, the wonderment of seeing all theses people in a game and the enjoyment from it. It’s something that’s very hard to get back and I get why people like vanilla it was much harder but I think the bulk of the excitement for it has to do with nostalgia more than anything.
---
Prep your Chuck Norris barrens chat jokes
---
Thanks for covering the reply. It is def vague, especially since this is the first time ever a Blizzard beta has mentioned a subscription
---
Deliver to people who play wow all day
---
Lupos will have the 1.12 physical damage.
---
Hunter, Druid, Warlock, Mage, Priest, Shaman, Rogue, Paladin, Warrior.
---
Exactly
---
Yeah but what is "a few weeks"? 2 weeks, 4 weeks, more?  The only definite piece of info we have is the fact he said they would do it before the end of phase 1 in regards to world bosses
---
Funny story....The priest Inner Fire buff used to also increase melee attack power, so I'd be up there meleeing with the rest of them(and jumping because lol). I'd get yelled at to go in the back and heal, though...
---
I dont get why they wouldnt use layering on retail though
---
I stopped following him a while back since he got all grumpy grandpa kinda type, but I was surprised to see he actually enjoyed classic and is now hyped for it. He is living proof that the game actually *feels* good to play, for anyone who still says it's just nostalgia/rose tinted goggles. If he was turned anyone can be.
---
I don't think you need to let anyone reserve their names before the launch day. We're all the same, we'll all be paying customers. No need for preferential treatment. Especially not introducing semi microtransactions type preferential treatment.
---
And the problem with their plan is there's millions of subscribers who don't have interest in Classic who can reserve any name they want. And there will be few servers to choose from (although lots of "layering"). That means there will almost certainly be a ton of names being reserved by people who don't even touch the game since Classic shares a sub with BFA
---
Because of the in game economy. This means you can just layer hop and have 0 competition for e.g. Black Lotus or rare Ores.
---
I forget which private server it was, but I remember reading about players forming queues and waiting in line all organized for a turn to kill him.
---
You fucking bastard.
---
I hope the guy that made server hop addon will make one with layer hop
---
It's also an option for me. Although the Druid is my favorite right now. I saw a couple of videos on the Rogue and I'm tempted to go back to my old main.
---
One of the devs said in an interview that you would be in any given layer for a “play session” which implies you’re assigned a layer every time you log in.
---
Layering "shards" a whole continent (fx. Kalimdor) as opposed to sharding that would phase an area (fx Valley of trails)
---
Hi, /u/Darkblade93
---
Just wanted to point out that saying there will not be layering past phase 1 is not the same as saying layering will exist for the entirety of phase 1.
---
They could have layering for just 1 week and the statement would still be correct.
---
Anyone coordinated enough to get invited to a different layer to avoid dying to a mob honestly deserves to live.  
---
Personally, I'll just take the corpse run.
---
I was about 12 at the time using his PC, both our accounts were on that and off of his bank.

The unarmoured mounts were just placeholders because they didn't have time to create the epic mount models for launch. I don't have a problem with them not existing.
---
Like the white horse saving Arya In the latest GoT episode. I get it m8, you had no hostile intent, my apologies for coming off harsh. Still, that makes it no less demeaning. The moment anyone has something to say not in line with the classic fanbois already forming, it’s time to get told. I really hope the community stays wiser than that - so far, so good. Looks like they know what classic should be. Looks like being the operative part. It could still easily be screwed over by corporate ppl, and if it is we need to not excuse it away out of blind fanboi desire.
---
is that a poll though, or his opinion?
---
Yes it will!
---
awesome
---
https://i.imgur.com/1bs9Of1.png
---
His opinion, he has made very detailed levelling guides for each class, by consulting the best players of each class.
---
I grinded to rank 13 back in the day(mage one handers didn't exist and staff was not worth rank 14) and I could name all the hardcore PVPers and other rank 13/14 people. It was a good feeling getting in that WSG or AB and seeing (insert name) team is against us. I hate the idea of cross realm and would rather it be server only. It blows my mind how they pick and choose what 1.12 features they want to use.
---
You think you do, but you don’t. Except I do. Honestly the dramatic bit is how adamantly people take offence to me.
---
Wow 4 comments but only 2 appear... are #NoChanges people being shadowbanned?
---
It’s not as clear cut as that. You won’t get to choose which layer you join it’s auto determine based on population cap on a layer. Player A joins player B on layer C only if Layer A and layer B is full at the time of grouping. You may join the wrong layer. Only way to exploit it is to have lots of people in each layer and for each layer bar the one  you want to join being empty which is a lot of variables. Too much time to waste. Once your I a layer you have a hidden lock to that layer as well, and only move if it’s full when you rejoin it.
---
Layering is really very different to sharding, and totally different to phasing.
---
Also just booked 3 weeks. Straight up said - classic wow is releasing. Nobody raised an eyebrow.
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
The servers won't be dead after 1 month. They'll just quietly keep the sharding on, and it'll be there forever, permanently fucking up the game and the economy.
---
For absolutely no reason I grouped them up by two to try to come at the problem from a different angle than I have thought about before.
---
1.Pet classes like hunter and lock.  Easy reasoning, you can fight more mobs faster when you have you pet shielding you, plus if you are good or geared you can solo some elite quests.
---
3.Mage or other self sustainers like druid.  Reducing the amount of time you need to sit or heal or get back to town for food really helps with speed leveling.
---
5.Priest and Rouge.   The odd ones out.  They don't really have a lot in common I remember wanding mainly to level priest, and I didn't have a max level rouge til Cata so my knowlege there is worthless.
---
7.The Hybrids like Pally and Shaman.  Fun classes and the Shaman would prob be higher with spirit wolf but I remember always having a hard time finding a weapon.
---
.
---
9.War
---
But how am I supposed to get mad over something that is basically what people asked for?
---
What the fuck have they done to earn trust? 
---
They just went: "No changes? Nah. Enjoy sharding everywhere. Forever, unless the game fails."
---
Yup, 5.5m to be more accurate. I keep saying it and people keep bitching at me like it's going to be fine to have hundreds of people fighting for these long respawns. It won't be.
---
Well yeah. Apart from them saying that they might even relaunch tbc and wotlk. If people want it - ok. Activision Blizzard is a business after all.  But the item reset from tbc killed every sense in raiding and playing after vanilla for me.
---
The moment they decide to scrub past accomplishments its over for me. Sad but true.
---
No, you can't. 
---
This literally proves it.
---
Thanks. :)  
---
Will check it out when I get home from work.
---
Yes, i want to play the beta. Fortunately, I also have an active sub, so this is actually a non-issue.
---
Yup. I was already subbed personally because I still play retail, but I'd definitely be against doing so if I wasn't.
---
Starting zones always meant up to level 20.
---
I think they might be able to if they get super lucky with the tentacle spawns.
---
I agree with you, but trying to stay positive maybe try to focus on the PvE side, that is still going to be super server identity related!  It does also bug me that low pop people will have an easier time ranking but people are all out the challenge in WoW, think of it as hard mode.
---
Indeed the most important news from all of the info. Ill be reunited with my panda cub.
---
Might as well post this shit to any other sub
---
I'll always upvote for sourcing.
---
Dont know that one off the top of my head. Pretty sure you can spell reflect a trap with  the engineering trinket
---
Fucking terrible release date lmao.
---
1. No one knows how long this layering thing is going to last.  By the time it's taken out people might not even be starting to farm black lotus yet.
---
2. How are you going to easily layer hop to unpopulated layers?  Let's assume your guild coordinates with another guild on a different layer so you guys can switch back and forth (lot's of assumptions here because who knows if this is even feasible).  What's to say their layer isn't just as populated as yours?  There's so many factors at play with this system compared to sharding that I don't think the abuse that people are scared about is going to be as easy as they make it seem.
---
One week was pushing it, but I wasn't about to riot in the streets. Two weeks, yeah thats not vanilla WoW. A FEW WEEKS? WHAT THE FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
I’m sure people will. Would it be considered exploiting the game for people to use layering to farm nodes and mobs to get ahead in the game? It’s definitely not how blizzard intended them to be used and sounds like something that could potentially lead to suspensions or bans. I’ve heard of tons of people getting suspended/banned for using game mechanics in a way they weren’t intended to be used.
---
I think you missunderstood me.. the people who wanted everything easier and easier ( like getting epics via daily quests ) are the same that complain about the newest addon .. are the same that cant read and complain about the layers that are a none issue either way because they are not permanent.
---
It really isnt. You are just a dumbass who has to fake outrage for attention.
---
Yep, I requested a week off today "because I'm going home for my dad's birthday"
---
Uh the last 2 major wow expansions had near flawless releases my dude.
---
The harder it is to say the words, the worse the disease is. So yours must be horrendous. Wish you the best of luck and as much success as possible, both irl and in-game.
---
Nope, you'll stay on the same layer. Only guilds and grouping will switch layers (and there wont be many of them) and you'll then stay on that layer. 
---
It's also a bannable offense to abuse the sharding-system, people got banned for having alt accounts and inviting their main to switch shard for rare spawns. It'll for sure be a bannable offense if you find a way to exploit layering.
---
I am upset of the late August release date but from I think I get it why this layering is needed. No matter who you are playing with you are supposed to feel that you are in a server. When the initial boom dies down you will meet the same amount of people and it will be constant from there onward.  Guildies and friends will be preferred to put on the same layer.
---
Perhaps they say "until Phase 2" just to give themselves enough time to figure out the final numbers but I wouldn't be surprised if after the first 1-2 months layering would be switched off. 
---
Leveling slowly in Vanilla will not be everyone's cup of tea. Even I am scared a bit about it as I will not have much time to grind daily...
---
Alright have fun with nu-vanilla.
---
The hope is that in a few weeks they won't have to layer, but they're prepared to layer for as long as the entirety of Phase 1.
---
I knew I should have looked up a video of it..
---
For what i expirienced its rouge followed by hunt/mage.
---
What happens on July the 16th? I'm ootl
---
No, it’s not the same logic really. 
---
Layering allows them to have several times more players online at a time per server so that when the huge drop off of tourists happens most of the servers should be consistently at the typical realm population of vanilla servers, which is when they would remove layering. 
---
Having 9k server pops without any sharding to achieve the same outcome is obviously not an option for them. The world just can’t hold that many players in the same area at the same time. 
---
Starting with 3k pops would mean either huge day long queue times or making 3x as many servers and many servers would just be dead after tourists leave. 
---
They’re literally implementing this system to achieve a game that is more vanilla than it otherwise would be. You no-changes people only look at these things at a surface level and it makes me want to shit.
---
Haha no. A lot of classes could take two or sometimes three mobs at a time. Warlock, hunter, mage - just to name the best examples. Of course that was depending on skill!
---
If you like it or not Something had to be done about population management (especially at launch)
---
The first couple of week (or even longer) will be artificially bloated but "tourists" people (basicaly all the players from BfA with an active abo will be able to give it a shot for free).
---
that means the first days A LOT of people will be joining the game but not necessarily to stay. 
---
Without the Layering you will find yourself in a FULL server at launch BUT after some time a lot of people who were just crious about the game but found it not to their likes will leave the server.
---
So now you are on a dead server ! Sux to be you. What do you do now ? Continue playing on an empty server ? Or rerol on another one ?
---
Maybe Layering is not perfect and what people expected but it a good solution to server load balacing since thay can merge the layers and smoothen the population gaps/spikes on launch.
---
No its literally sharding except there is one giga server so you dont sharded with other server players.
---
It shit for gameplay. The whole fucking point of a server is to be able to interact with everyone else on that server always. Oh its a world but not really a world.
---
How the fuck do world bosses (or general mobs) even work with this system?
---
Where is the source?
---
They already said no in the interview guys come on...
---
Applied and approved. August 27 to September 6
---
I think the issue for some people (not me) is that you can just hop between "Kazzak", "Azuregos", "Ysera", "Emerald Dream" when you want.
---
I bet each layer is a docker container and we are all running on a huge multi region Kubernetes cluster.
---
I play on Stormrage US, its one of the like top 5 most populated servers. We had like idk 2 hours of downtime total, it really wasn't a big deal
---
I'll try to take advantage of layering if I can (no exploit of course) but it seems pretty hard.  Still it will be something fun to muk around with once I get my alt around to leveling up.  I think it will be gone before then though even for a no lifer like myself.
---
The arena event will come in Phase 2 or 3 (don't remember witch) so that's no problem.
---
Anything that was in 1.12 is fair game to those bastard devs. Any little chance they get to make the game easier and more enticing for casuals like retail, THEY WILL TAKE IT.

---
I mean I see where most people are coming from with certain realm identity functions like seeing the same opponents often. However, I know that dead severs or one faction dominated servers those players suffer more than anyone can imagine. Extremely long ques or none all together is way more impactful than playing in crosslisted BGs. 
---
However, I believe blizzard should take a look at battle groups and make it so only a few servers compete with each other, this will help que times and create a sense of community but also reduce the servers that are having issues with server pop or one faction dominated servers. I think this is the best solution, a middle ground.

It was out of stock within a few hours, gotta be way quicker than that. Probably no more directly from Blizzard, you'll need to pony up on eBay
---
Yeah going between "layers" is so vanilla like. I can't wait to not play. Nu-vanilla is not vanilla.
---
So what you're saying is that I will have to make an entirely new account for classic? If needs must.
---
It's better not to be guaranteed to see the people in the world who picked the same realm? Ok
---
I agree totally. I never liked x-realm anything
---
It doesn't work without the absurd population density and international time-zones on private servers, sorry.  
---
Layers will be capped at less than a third of big server's concurrent players so non-mafia will be getting to farm spawns all they want and the fixed price will be driven down.
---
You are a fucking retard.
---
The Player Count of Classic will decrease, not increase like vanilla.
---
Without layering everyone would play on a ghost server after 4 weeks.
---
&gt; Hunter, Druid, Warlock, Mage

I think u underestimate the mage AOE capacity, it literary cut at lvl 40 the lvl uptime in half (from 2 hours to just 1hour), for example bombing humans in Tanaris.

Number 3# will not happen at all.  This company fired hundreds of none essential employees to appease stockholders and paid money for others to quit.  There should be NO in-game report feature and if it does make it to the final product I will not bother with this game at all.  Classic WOW had none at the time and was just fine, and lastly, the game will die with its existence.  The report feature will be abused.  It will likely be a computer.  
---
To sum up, they are lying they will not hire anyone nor do I trust whoever they hire, if they do, to pass judgment fairly at what people say in the game.  There should be NO judgment period on what people say in the game period.  The report feature WILL ruin the game.  The game does not need one.
---
It's fall. Nice shitpost with your shitmeme though. Almost as bad as August 27th summer meme but not quite.
---
Time difference, On peak for US is literally midnight/early morning for OCE. Latency turns to shit once we connect to a US server. OCE players are constantly thrown into US battleground servers for retail and it's fucking woeful. Try playing any melee class on 200-250ms and have your character constantly telling you you're out of range.
---
Well, technically World of Warcraft already exists yes, but so much has changed and been added in 13 years that most of the people who were playing 13 years ago want to go back to the game at that point in time. If you were to come back to the game today it'd waaay different than how it was in Vanilla or Wrath. 
---
As far as I know they won't be updating it but there will be an option to have better graphics settings.
---
they still have no one to pve with, are massively outnumbered out in the world which makes it barely playable, and it actively rewards the players who all decided to play the overpopulated faction
---
it does nothing to solve the real problem and instead addresses a small symptom
---
In software principles if they have followed one of the design patterns you would have the layer ID linked to your character when you zone in. Once that layer is full a new layer is spawned with another ID. You will always connect to your layer ID except in two situations. One when you log back in your layer is full, you will be assigned the next available layer ID (thus being your new Layer ID) or you join another layer ID via invite. The invite has to be in a less populated Layer than the one your in or your invitee will join your layer ID - this is done automatically so you don’t get to choose if you join them or they join you it’s all done on population and server rules.
---
Other possible solution is just FIFO but this negates what the devs are saying about playing with the same names over and over. (Anyone disprove this?)
---
I agree that many people will be pushing to 60, but a lot of them won't have the capacity or fortitude to play 17 hours a day for multiple days in a row. I see them playing maybe 12 hours a day, which means they wouldn't make it within the first week. Some of them will, but they will be a minority. A week and half of real life time is still super fast for level 60, and those I still classify as hardcore.
---
Im not really pro-layering, but you're really going out of your way to misinterpret. Theyve clearly stated that it wont exist past phase 1, and is likely to be 2 weeks - 1 month tops. Id rather zero sharding/layering, but you're really off the mark there.
---
I hope they bring this into BFA as well. Sharding is the biggest piece of shit system
---
How does it actively reward one side overpopulation
---
Rest assured, theyre not forcing people into BC. 99% sure, they are going to release TBC, fresh Classic servers, and merge the remaining Vanilla fully progressed servers so youre not on a dead realm.
---
Wish your post was higher, cause this is EXACTLY the main reasoning. It's either this or half dead servers after a month..
---
Still in stock at amazon germany
---
ohh, yeah that is a real problem.  I hope you guys get OCE servers!
---
Everyone will be able to reserve names, its not something "just for the beta players"
---
Not really.
---
Layering is like, a miniserver, like for example:
---
- Ragnaros Server ( Latin America ) : 2000 players at launch(obviously this number will be larger than this but just for this example).
---
 * Ragnaros-1: 500 players.
---
 * Ragnaros-2: 500 players.
---
 * Ragnaros-3: 500 players.
---
 * Ragnaros-4: 500 players.
---
For the first couple of weeks you'll stick to Ragnaros-1 and see the same people and you'll play with other people that were assigned the Ragnaros-1 Server. When the population levels spread and the Ragnaros 1, 2 3 and 4 servers population stabilize, they'll all join and become a single Ragnaros Server. 
---
If this wasnt the case you wouldnt be able to kill any boars for example if you started playing right when the servers went online, you'd have to compete with all other 1999 dudes trying to kill boars.
---
&gt;Thanks, so they will eventually just merge this into one Layer instead of 5?
---
I doubt any server will have more than 2 or 3 layers. Each layer is 2k-3k players.
---
&gt;Wonder how will they combat overpopulation, or we will simply wait the Queue.
---
I believe they said that in Phase 2, the layers will be removed, and if a server reaches the max number of concurrent players, they will need to wait in the queue.
---
With the version of AV we're getting I'm already pretty meh about BGs, but this is something I don't understand at all. Shouldn't they wait until we get to battle grounds before making this decision? If the servers have a healthy population there's no need for cross realm.
---
Oh shut the fuck up already, we all know how much you live in a society and hate chad, we don’t care.

Classic dev shill: *Deploying misdirection tactics*
---
Email
---
It's a physical key for that Beta Lock you've been hanging on to this whole time, wondering what it was for.
---
You arent taking into account that each of the CONTINENT layer can hold up 3k ppl. Meaning without layering ever being used (if you factor in somewhat even split of players on both continent), you can have 5-6k ppl on a server and nobody is still using layering.
---
But on lets say raid reset day, when the focus is in example MC, you can get 2 layers on eastern.
---
Again, this is a way for them to having like 10k population servers in one that when people quit will dwindle down to the 5k mark. But the REAL question here is... whats their population cap going to be. If its like 6-8k in launch, you might only see layering at launch. Because they are saying 100% sure no layering in phase 2, it means the serverd need to be in the 5-6k range at that stage, right ? 
---
Ps. Vanilla had this same system in smaller scale. Certain map edges ppl/npcs/gathering items would disappear. Now they just scaled it to include ALL of the continent. So in that regard its much better than vanilla.
---
When you are working,  it doesn't matter much,  if it's summer or not.  By the way,  it's not a race who will level up faster.  Everyone will stop at level 60 anyway :)
---
you need to run to blizzard hq and go through ion hazzakooses mailbox to get one

Would by sub be considered to be active if I unsubbed, but still have playtime?
---

This
---
It's what they should have done in the beginning, instead of expansions. Dont get me wrong, I loved TBC and WOTLK, but I knew where the game was heading and always wished they just kept WoW in classic, and just kept adding more and more end game content.
---
If it is a success, let there be TBC, but they should be really careful about the possibility of splitting people too thin.
---
Then there is OSRS, whose idea i despise, there are not 2 threads about "changes" in which 2 people agree with each other propositions, let alone turning it into a Mob rule.
---
Classic with the possibility ot TBC and WoTLK is enough, you cant make everyone happy, and even if you release all 3 of these, you still have to worry about the community being split too thin. You want CRZ again? Doubt it... 
---
I mean what's next OSRS treatment for TBC and WotLK?
---
Might as well release a server of every individual.
---
It depends on how the community feels two years from now... especially with post-naxx. You can't predict that kind of thing without having experienced it so they're releasing it how everyone asked and will be exploring possibilities later on depending how they and the community feel.
---
It's amazing how quick this community is to believe that 10 or 20 levels of travel speed advantage completely and decisively overrides 40 or 50 levels of considerable mob grinding/questing efficiency advantage.
---
Just wait until they find out Azeroth is round! :o
---
no one thinks of summer and thinks of september or the end of august since school starts that day
---
summer is always thought of as May(??)-June-July
---
Agreed for the duration. 10 days IRL sounds about right for most people. But still, even on 12h a day, if you have a plan for your leveling, you'll be ahead of the curve. So it's not unrealistic to think there'll be roughly a 100 ppl per server that'll hit 60 in 7-8 days
---
Sure. What if players dont drop as fast. Imagine questing without much issues then you join STV and whole giga server is questing there. They absolutely will keep it until world bosses at least because they dont a have solution for that yet apparently.
---
 A day may come when the courage of men fails,

---
I will be concerned if the sharding lasts longer than a couple weeks. By that point the majority of genuine tourists will have left, there will be a few 60s running around and some NEET guilds will have cleared MC.
---
It's a delicate balance. I wholeheartedly agree that sharding is required initially for long term server health, but if they don't get the numbers and timing right it could go very wrong.
---
Seriously, just don't play. You're one of those people that will never be happy. Just don't play it.
---
Autoloot wasn't in vanilla. Widescreen wasn't in vanilla. Colorblind mode wasn't in Vanilla. "B-but they're not the same as LFR!" Yeah, neither is layering. It's several thousand people on one layer for a few weeks while the tourists go away. That's it.
---
I will. Lmfao. Its gonna be great!
---
Travel speed is questing efficiency advantage though? and I'm not sure what you're referring too. Since hunters get travel speed &amp; considerable mob grinding, and druids get travel speed &amp; considerably low downtime while grinding.
---
Dear lord do not speak of such darkness
---
Can we just say: hunter and druid are top, paladin and worrior are bottom of the list and the great is something in between?
---
It all comes down to which class makes more damage and can heal
---
Cheers for the clarity!
---
Oh so it's not just the case of you disliking two separate groups of people and lumping them together
---
bUt iTs a SlIpPeRy sLoPe
---
Yes they are. And call it whatever you want; semantics won't invalidate the point. Merging dying servers is better than layering because at least only some of the servers would fail and require merging, whereas all servers will be affected by layering, especially the healthiest ones. Its always the same thing from people like you, you fail to observe the consequences of seemingly 'trivial' and 'necessary' ideas, and over time something great gets ruined. Then when that happens you go "its just an old game, there's nothing they could have done". Enthusiasts can never have anything good anymore thanks to the filthy casual masses.

I’ve been there with every launch. Was able to play the hour it launched at least the last 3 expansions. Not that I stayed long save for legion :/
---
Shhhh!.. don't tell anyone!
---
So no invites are send yet by Blizzard?
---
Well they are dumbass Alliance
---
Not at all. Most average people level at average speed. Mid level zones have huge level range compare to starter zones and that level range takes longer to get past. And theres enemy faction now too.
---
Honestly, probably alchemy/herbalism for consumes if you’re planning on healing.  The mana points are nice for chain drinking.  Eng is good, but largely for pvp or playing prof/ret late game, but an argument could still be made for alchemy and herbs in either prot or Ret.  you could probably level an alt to farm mats for you though.
---
  prot especially since threat is tied to spell damage and mana use.  More mana (via pots) lets you do more damage (but eng gives you bombs to aoe threat).
---
Another thing blown way out of proportion is the old weather effects. They were nice, but nothing like what’s being described on this sub. For 95% of your playtime, it wouldn’t snow or rain. It would simply be night or day. 
---
When it did rain, it looked ... Okay, exactly like it does in the beta client.
---
As someone who recently joined a private server to try vanilla. I can say the game has changed so much its basically unrecognizable. I play bfa as well currently. I enjoy it. But what you are saying is such a clear cut oversimplification its hilarious. 
---
Vanilla wow has clear cut rpg mechanics. You need ammo for your ranged weapons. Pets need to be happy or they abandon you. I actually have to watch my mana bar as a mage. Questing is really important and a core part of the game. I cant just sit in town and spam dungeon que until I’m lvl 120. 
---
And you know what? Its fucking fun as hell. Theres a reason why this game still has a huge following. Its a milestone for mmos. Because its an amazing game.
---
Your to well written to pull this troll off :p
---
There is no sharding :) and they’re not corrupt? It’s design decisions for reasons.
---
I love this post.
---
are u actually this dense or are u pretending for karma
---
New models? Are you fucking srs?
---
They dont have to layer AT ALL. Multiple layers of mine/herb nodes being filtered into the same auction house? Join different layers by way of friend invite to avoid ganks? They are fucking up BIG TIME.
---
- Great, thanks. Didn't know that about the ring. Corrected the sheet.
---
- That shoulder enchant is... Heh! ...kind of hard to get at that stage, ye. But at the same time, which are the alternatives? ;-)
---
- BoE's is just about gold and patience. Farming gold has never been easier. They're nothing compared to getting BoP dungeon epics. Those are hard ones! 
---
For every slot there are plenty of alternatives embedded in the links at the top of each character column.
---
None that are credible.
---
Not being able to afford a computer hasn’t hurt until now
---
The true question is what is a troll?
---
Booked these EXACT dates myself as well :DDDDDDD
---
I don't think they should be available indefinitely but saying that they have to be removed to keep people from rushing is infuriatingly dumb. 
---
Mounts are *not* the main reason why people rush through leveling. If you're going for another faction's mount it'll probably take longer because you'll have to zig-zag across the world in search of rep quests.
---
In the style of classic. Otherwise its flying pigs and robocop mounts
---
What? How does this prove it? This is literally what people suggested but more refined.
---
People wanted x server 1-9 and then merge them.. that is what layering is except you can still interact with the players in servers 2-9.
---
Yeah, it's almost like people have expectations and aren't happy with anything that's put on their plate.
---
If you never have expectations or want more in life.. You'll never stop working your 9-5 since you dropped out of high school.
---
I heard layer designation will be determined as pr play session. That would mean that logging out and back in again could place you in a different less populated layer.  
---
I think we need way more details on layering before anything can be said for certain..
---
Layers. Sharding. I'm not going to dignify that with an explanation. Do you think multiple layers of herb/mining nodes filtering into the same auction house is a good idea? Do you think its good for people to be able to change layers by way of a friend invite to avoid being ganked? They are messing up BIG TIME.
---
A layer spans one continent, so it’d be 3k people across the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
If you can't even understand what you write then I can't help you. Just play a private server and tell us about the nightmare we would have without sharding.
---
Are you “stuck” on a layer from when you first log in? Or do you get a layer everytime you login depending on the pop?
---
It's not though.
---
It might actually make the armoured mounts more interesting just because not everyone has them.
---
Sure but at least if you see something while playing it can't disappear.
---
PC version is all I have for now at  [https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/](https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/)
---
&gt;Just play a private server
---
Already have. Next time try making an argument.
---
Arthas is a banned name so you'd have to change it anyway
---
They say they want the right mix of players in the beta. And the actual right mix would probably include people that aren't currently subbed. So they probably should invite some of those people.
---
Plus that would literally be inviting people to give them money, no-brainer.
---
&gt; No, it's quite a bit worse. Especially when it comes to resource scarcity. You're going to have several times as much ore/cloth/etc saturating the AH
---
It's not that dramatic, it just means that each 3k player group get a set of resources.
---
We are talking 2 or 3 layers (4-9k players / realm), and for each layer demand for resources increases because each layer represents 2-3k players.
---
They will most likely store the layer you are on on your [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) account to prevent having alts on different layers.
---
Falls exactly in line with my uni break week, see you all in deadmines
---
depends though right? If we compare it to the other solutions, like having a 10k person realm. In which case layering is a better UX, or if you add dynamic respawning, layering is going to still be a better UX than it. If you want to go the "hur I'm fine with 1 hour queues which would realistically be 3-5+ hours during prime time, esp launch", again its shittier if you have to wait in queue because not seeing billy occasionally is such a big deal. Well, maybe in cause of hardware you "cheap out" by having less server. Sure, you have more servers, then some die. The people on the dead realms just have a MUCH worse UX because "can't see some people 24/7".
---
Blessing of sanctuary is an underrated blessing, and significantly helps a raid (but obviously only need one :D).
---
Queue timers I hope.
---
What did that add on do?
---
1 week ago : "Im terrified of ending up on a dead server!!! What should i do!!!???"
---
Today : "Fuck layering they should just make servers!!!"
---
These comments are hilarious. This post can’t have been serious XD
---
Dont worry about it being unstable. Spots wont be overcamped either because of the initial layering. I mean there is a beta test starting today and going on for months + stress tests in between.
---
No. Layering balances at the server level not zone. The first 3k people go to layer 1... regardless of what zone they are in. So 3k people / x starter zones. That's about what you can expect unless they throttle logins or also use sharding for per zone balancing.
---
the one downside to being on a faction that dominates every other aspect of the server is you have bad queue times
---
Tips said Ion told him that his favourite version of the game is classic and tbc, so..

This is true
---
I'm a filthy millennial, I get 10 days a year and thank avocado toast for that at least.
---
I've heard (can anyone confirm?) that the only way to move is to be invited to a group by someone on another layer.
---
It says 15th, I took that to mean sometime by end of day on the 15th.
---
On private servers :^)
---
More jpeg
---
I think sharing occurs across realms, but layering occurs only within each realm.
---
They have a fixed timeline. The hope is that within the first few weeks they won't have to layer anymore and can just flip that switch off.
---
The absolute date when layering will end is the start of Phase 2. They're prepared to have layering for the entirety of Phase 1 if the population is still high throughout.
---
That would be acceptable
---
Pretty spot on, you can get moved around based on two factors (how they implement queues after layer cap, and invites from other layers) but seems legit to me.
---
It’s not a new layer that your moved to, you can join his or his to yours. This is server decided by population and or space at that time. This stops the abuse of being able to switch back and forth.
---
Rouge followed by hunter
---
Yes if they lowered the players per layer, zone density would decrease, but they stated 2-3k likely and the purpose of the layering tech is not primarily zone population control. It's to balance overall load on their servers.... 
---
and to make merging easier when people leave because character names will have to be unique per server not layer. So they can merge layers without telling people they are being moved to a new server or worry about character naming conflicts. My guess that is a big motivation for their choice to use this approach.
---
My buddies and I are taking the Friday, and first week in September) off. We’re worried about it being over crowded too.
---
What is your problem with layering in the first weeks? After that you got your closed community per realm like at was in vanilla. Im a vanilla player and i‘m pro layering for the first weeks. Back in 2005 (EU) the release was a mess with overpopulated zones/realms.
---
So you want the first weeks of classic like that, because vanilla got that back in the days?
---
But blizz need to disable layering as soon as possible so we have one realm community, like vanilla.
---
I have too, and your "15 FPS and 200 ping" are nowhere to be found, even with 10k players on the same server.
---
I mean they had to give a shit ton of refunded game time in first few months, so not really.
---
Not sure how, made the new account because its a name I'd like to grab in Classic. I hope my existence isn't a PROBLEM for you. Legit just stop making a massive deal over something when you have literally zero experience with the technology first hand.

Yeah, that's not happening for the release of Classic. There's always gonna be people who, like me, will do anything to get ahead and I have absolutely no qualms about ninja tagging a quest mob. Nor should anybody really. Most people that will choose to wait forever for a quest are people that either very casual or people here to try the game out with no clear cut plan to stay. So all in all, not being in the same category of players, there's little chance our paths will cross again. Especially what with the layering thing.
---
Only thing I'm really gonna struggle with is making sure I get my name on 3 servers on the 13th, coz depending on exactly when on the 13th they open character creation, I might just have to play at work.
---
Quite true, but I'm not sure on this one. From Ion's interview I kinda got the idea that they will start with a high number of shards and then progressively reduce it in the first few weeks, but they won't actually change that number hour by hour depending on the population. Not sure on this one.
---
Thats why blizz is using the layering for the beginning. Worry not.
---
But what is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
---
I’m taking 4 weeks off
---
Nice troll.
---
And if you're really not trolling, google's your friend
---
Looks fine. Im probably going deeper into disc instead of holy. Inner focus is really strong, meditation is good, as are imp pws and mental agi.
---
Essentially yes, but sharding is usually per zone but layering will be the entire server.
---
Bring on the post Naxx content. Follow the OSRS route!
---
And its the dumbest reason imagineable. Mounts are not the primary reason people rush.
---
False Advertising!!
---
Call me crazy but "someone might not like their server name" is pretty insignificant compared to layer hopping exploits and overpopulated servers after layer merge.
---
Yeah horde won’t have any ret pallys
---
&gt;But blizz need to disable layering as soon as possible so we have one realm community, like vanilla.
---
What if they don't? Which is a real possibility. I don't care what any developer says they have lied before and they can lie again.
---
Take release day off for sure -- It'll be super unproductive but rememberable af.
---
Then take off some Fridays/Mondays and get a bunch of 3 day weekends in. 4 days of work and 3 days of wow for 3 weeks. The perfect balance.
---
You can leap it with a Vengeance DH or another Warrior.
---
Thanks dude!
---
It also released in November. Just start playing in November and you wont have to deal with layering.
---
Didn’t know you could do that... fuck I’ve missed out
---
Nice :D i only took 3 for the release and 3 more in the end of the year xD
---
Alliance like now? What game are you playing?
---
Because one was epic and made bosses feel bigger than they actually were, the other was a calculated attempt at making the game easier to raid in for the sake of it.
---
I'm thinking we start out with ten-ish 1k layers, go to four 2k layers once everyone spreads out a bit, two 3k layers a few weeks in and then settle where it settles at  one layer. Something like that is the general idea.
---
You can't, though. It's not like retail where you can just jump into group finder and hunt a rare on a different shard. The only reason you can even cross layers is, I assume, to prevent issues like two friends being unable to play together. You have to actually know someone on your target layer to get into it, and people are just foaming at the mouth as if it's trivial
---
I hope you are right. I'm still expecting at least some kind of shit show on release no matter how much they test in advance.
---
Its to handle the *immediate* launch rush of players. There will be WAY more people playing on week 1, than month 2. And on top of that, people will be spread out throughout the world, not just 1-20 zones. 
---
So the subs will spike, dip a bit, and then over a few months it will continually rise to reach that original peak number. By then, Blizzard will have released new servers, if that demand is still there. They won't just let the game be unplayable and do nothing about it. Theyve addressed, they know sharding is antithetical to Classic.
---
Again, I'd rather not have it at all, and I think 1 month is still WAY too long for any sharding mechanism in WoW. But even if it does stay in for a month, thats a far cry from "No changes? Nah. Enjoy sharding everywhere. Forever, unless the game fails."
---
With traditional merges you're as well put with people you've never met before. With additional problems like having dead servers for days maybe weeks before the actual merge occurs and having to rename characters and guilds.
---
Doesn't that undermine the sense of community too?
---
Layers will be authentically crowded since they'll hold a whole server cap pop similar to the cap back then.
---
Exploiting could be a possibility. I don't think it will be that easy since you won't have LFG to server hop nor dozens of servers to hop to like you can do on retail.
---
I agree it's important for Blizzard to think this in advance and intervene if necessary.
---
Layering. I'm just surprised that so many people were all for sharding back when that was announced. Layering is the lesser of two evils as far as I'm concerned.
---
Comparing chess with an MMO makes no sense. Once you've reached the highest tier in an mmo, there isn't much point in replaying  other things, especially once they've become easy.
---
Chess is a competitive game where you start fresh every match. Unless you're talking about rerolling and going through the leveling and tiers all over again every time you clear Naxx...
---
Speaking about soundtracks: can someone tell me how this intro song from madseasons video about tbc is called? I think its from vanilla but I can‘t find it and shazam doesn‘t work. 
---
This is the vid https://youtu.be/JjV1E4Tj27U
---
Also, don't forget to sub for a CHANCE to get in. 
---
I swear, this is the dumbest fucking shit and lifts lootboxes to a whole new level.
---
If you are purely interested in Classic only: You know you will get game time, it's 100% drop.
---
x chance to get a Beta invite. It's the item you wan't but won't get.
---
Game time is worth shit if you can't use it for what you want.
---
Best ripoff ever...
---
&gt; Doesnt this mean starting zones are going to have 1000+ characters on launch?
---
Yeah, but those 1000+ will be divided over 1000+ servers so it's only 10 - 100 people at the starting zone.
---
Lucky you, when I informed my wife about this yesterday she was only semi happy with me spending a week of vacation on a game.
---
New content gonna be bad if its not horizontal
---
I dont want more gear inflation
---
Do you know if they are they doing it for the starting zones (1-10) or all zones for the first week?
---
I shit you not, the launch is planned EXACTLY the first day of my 2 week training/certification.
---
I mean i love how this opportunity it will be a boon to my career (and i will learn a lot of new stuff) but…
---
Aaaaaah missing those couple of first magical weeks … sux … it"s a kind of one (second :p ) in a lifetime experience.
---
On the other hand here are the advantages to reduce the :
---
* No (or small) quest competition, you dont need to rush to be ahead of the zerg
---
* After couple of weeks we will know on whitch servers all the streamers are (if you want to avoid those)
---
* You can ask some help from higher lvl player for a better lvling experience (looking at you whirlwind axe :D)
---
* this is a personal one : I always tend to rush things not te be behind, but since i already will be, why not just take sings slowly 
---
* and many more 
---
So dont feel too bad about this guys and girls :) 
---
As one once said:
---
&gt; You usually have to wait for that which is worth waiting for.
---
Even at those levels the travel speed efficiency of Travel Form and Aspect of The Cheetah are still better than level 40 Mounts for short distances. If you can reach where you want to be within 25 seconds, Travel Form and Cheetah are faster than mounting up.
---
So its usefulness is quite a bit longer than 10-20 levels.
---
fair enough!
---
Then invent a time machine.
---
It's one servers worth and the. The layers merge after 2 months you fucking drama queen.
---
&gt; but I feel bad for the college students.
---
Welfare is the new cool yo.
---
I have 3 kids at home so having time off during the week is much more valuable for me since on weekends they demand (rightfully so) my attention.
---
Good point regarding taking off the release day. Have an upvote!
---
Glad it's launching, but so much for summer release. I know August is summer time, but it's near the end of summer... and when I think of "summer release" I think "Yay early June/July release" ... But nope. Blizzard's pulling a "technically the end of August when the FALL academic calendar starts is technically summer for everyone else. /Rantover
---
I know right! RIP in pieces
---
Keep going Im almost there
---
As opposed to getting stuck on a dead server when the tourist population drops, and needing to merge anyway..? Except this way you have to deal with the drama involved in killing a server instead of it just organically integrating people already on the server that you've probably grouped with over the lifetime of your account.
---
Well with layering and all in mind i cant think of anything that could stop this. Not even a DDOS could make issues then.
---
But be prepared for new age players that will die A LOT.. especially in instances. Iam still not sure how i can avoid this. Maybe iam lucky and get into closed beta and have lots of time to find a guild before everything is restarting on live.
---
No, it's people who don't bother to actively understand the issue, but give the loudest answers. It's a type of person, the actual issues aren't what he's talking about.
---
Actually, the whole world will be layered for the duration of Phase 1.
---
That is probably one extremely stupid question now, but does classic need to be purchased separately, as any addon, or do you just sub and play it?
---
Of course everyone can decide for themselves. Most people might enjoy the game perfectly fine looking up a few things. However the general feeling if you are new to any game (not just WoW) is to be pressured into "researching" and "learning" it extensively to the point that it doesn't even occur to people to actually play and enjoy it. I'm rallying against that prevailing attitude.
---
Finding dungeons and weapon trainers can be a (very fun!) adventure in itself. You can of course speedrun the game and it can be greatly enjoyable. But if you are completely new to it, it can equally be enjoyable to really take your time and take in everything the game has to offer.
---
Also equally important is to talk to people. Don't know where something is? Have been trying to find it for a while? Ask in game! You might find people who help and it can lead to playing together and friends. (And that's how people originally come up with all those guides and information.)
---
As long as they give people the time to clear naxx
---
Yeah, I joined WotLK late and was shocked at how many epics I got for doing super easy content. I played a Shadow Priest and didn't barely had time to apply any DoTs before the bosses were dead. Then I stepped into a raid and none of the drops were upgrades.
---
The game had sure changed by then.
---
I was in that boat the whole time cuz they said summer about legion and legion released in August too lol
---
Plus 20 levels of a solid advantage in terms of speed means you hit 40 significantly faster, which means you also get the benefit of mount much quicker, which means you can extend the gap even further. Less competition for mobs / quest objectives &amp; less pvp also means you will go faster. Makes sense to me.
---
Filters out the low iq mongoloids
---
Ah, bad call then. At least the release date is at the end of August -- so the kids should be in school? Silver linings.
---
Nah mate.
---
Obviously people remember it
---
I have no clue. But if they have half a brain they do it for every zone. Last freeshard i played was around 7-8 k players 24/7 and on horde literally every mob was permadead. Until you reached 40-50+.
---
So is UK 26th too? (By an hour)
---
literally no lol
---
No, they really aren't lol.  Your idea is also pretty shit because telling people they don't get to have a good community, a good classic experience, because they chose the wrong server at the start is insane.  Whether you like it or not, layering is the answer to a problem that is not trivial.  Dying servers are not fun to play with and when you merge them it's pretty much exactly what layering is, except it's what's called a corrective measure.  Why fix something after the fact instead of stopping it from happening in the first place?
---
I hadn't touched WoW since mid/end of Cata. When they announced the Summer release date I caved and joined one of the forbidden servers in preparation. Most of the levelling guild that I am a part of there is going to transition to classic so hopefully we will quickly reform there and do instance runs within the guild.
---
You could try and join a dedicated discord server to find some experienced and likeminded people in advance?
---
Time to deevolve and grow back your virginity.. its classic afterall =)
---
No, phase 1 is going to be more around 2 months, 3 tops. And that's taking a very conservative approach to most player's leveling time.
---
Yes, as a) it’s only for phase 1 b) it’s not all zones and c) it’s basic economics more population than vanilla. 
---
Private servers increase spawn times to offset increased population.
---
This is no different. Only way as you put it would be to go back to 2500 server caps, then merge servers in phase 2 which is pointless. You can’t have it both ways. It’s tail off will be greater than original launch, like it or not.
---
What about mage single target  ?
---
There's a popular private vanilla server that I played on when they did a full server reset... The first day in the starter zones was hilarious. There was a dozen people in a queue to pickup the buckets of tools in the gnome/dwarf starting zone. Someone would come along and cut in line and everyone lost their mind.
---
That’s true, that’s why we gather old guilds to discuss server balance issues, as well as getting some guiding notes for mafias, AH abusers, world bosses etc.
---
We used to make a lane and wait for each guild’s turn for worlds bosses and we were in a pvp environment. Some servers had good gaming culture and I want to play with those players again .
---
I guess around the same hour we got yesterday's info. I'd say between 4-6 PM (EU)
---
Like it matters if 3 weeks of extra herbs are AH'd. they'll be consumed by BWL.
---
You are just flat out wrong. Damn I dont get this..
---
Lets keep it vanilla like and only play the game on a computer from 06 etc. I mean is it vanilla to have widescreen and 100/100mbs internet speed ? Bring back dial-in man!
---
The kids last day of summer break is August 27th. Almost perfect timing for me.
---
Typical retail trash attitude
---
Ahh iam not sweating it for now.. i will see if i even get a beta invite. If not i prepare something like you suggested until the live servers launch. 
---
I mean i bet were talking about the same forbidden server here and thats gonna turn off when live classic launches.
---
Blizz kinda set a timer on it though. Phase 2, world bosses no matter what Layering is gone by then.
---
The Alpha-Omega problem with Classic is that likely there will be millions of players at launch but 6 months down the road 80% of them might have left. Layering deals with this problem.
---
A lesson from Pservers: Only servers with 10-15k players on launch have avoided becomeing ghost towns 12months later. Even among the diehard pserver comunity there is atleast a 50% player drop off  in the months after launch. 
---
Problem solved with as few downsides as possible as far as i can see.
---
Enjoy Nu-vanilla
---
Don’t mages have to eat and drink all the time
---
Dunno, need to see the regen rate to figure out if its better to get wand before spirit tap. But i doubt ill again play a priest.
---
And if your rotation is the one you said, i dont see ANY point in spending 2p in improved SW:P. Would make some sense if you at least did SW:P before MB/smite. With cast times and global, thats one extra tick of the dot. Maybe at level 20 see if you actually kill the mob before SW:P runs out without the talents.
---
hahah, spot on. @hobbyisdrinkin burnt to a crisp.
---
So why even play their game? If you dont trust Them? 
---
Maybe they will cancel the game on aug 26, dont trust them even though they promised X!
---
Server Arthas launched day 1. On day one 20.000 people play on this server. We will have 7isch shards. Each player will stick on there shard.
---
Week 3 only 15.000 people play. Still 7 shards to "see the same names".
---
Week 6 two of the shards gets played less on and got merged. We now have 6 shards with 12.000 players. Shards keep merging once they are low. In the end we have 5000 player wanting to play on the server with only 1 shard left. We have 3500 online in total and 1500 in queue.
---
I think its something like this.
---
you're saying vanilla did not do well? Hahahahhahahahahahahaha
---
What the fuck are you talking about, assuming things blindly and taking them for the truth? Seems like a true #nochanges player.
---
Layering has literally no down-sides, and keeps the leveling experience pretty much lag free.
---
Hunters are the “ez mode” of leveling and gold farming . Definitely worth getting one to 60 first to boost with gold and items your other characters .

After today's update it looks like I will never play this abomination.
---
In the cells where there are multiple items, it's the first item which is linked. It's not possible to embed more than one link.
---
Hunter, mage If you can AoE uninterrupted, Druid/warlock are about even imo, priest, shammy, rogue, pally, warrior. 
---
If mage has to single target it’s behind warlock
---
You're failing to take into account natural player distribution. There will be a portion of players exactly as you described, but they're a drop in the bucket compared to the average player. I fully understand that playerbase exists, we just get a skewed perception of how large it is. For every "hardcore" player, there will be a ton of casual players.
---
Layer hopping exploits? Can you explain what you want to exploit by that?
---
The only non classic thing layering brings that I can think of (Which I can kind of agree that people might think is that you can layer hop once or twice if you have a friend who is on the other layer that you can get invited by, or if some kind of addon arises (Find quest mobs, veins etc)
---
Still, its a pretty miniscule problem compared to insane lag and unplayabiity, dont you think?
---
Fair. So Druid/Hunter saves ~5 seconds on short runs while the Warlock saves ~30 seconds or more (much more when comparing against druids) on every mob pack. Straight grinding results in even bigger gains from chain pulls, kiting and melting 3-5 mobs simultaneously at all times. Also, any time the Warlock can continue to kill during travel with DoT kiting, not only is the travel advantage of Druid/Hunter eliminated, but the Warlock comes out ahead again.
---
All that, and your point still cuts both ways; The Warlock's higher combat efficiency is still undermining the advantage conferred by the speed boost during the levels where Druid/Hunter are faster than Warlock. That is, they're more efficient overall, but the warlock is still killing more efficiently, countering some of their advantage.
---
Can’t wait to have a bag slot for arrows bro. Actually stoked to tame a rare mob.
---
"Earned trust"... how exactly. This "info" we've been getting second hand through streamers with some random dev interviews here and there. They'll earn trust when they put this shit in writing and explain how the layering system cannot be exploited across the whole world for a million different things. 
---
How will the AH work, rare spawns, resources, chat channels...etc. They need to release official statements with details. It's funny you say "everything they say"... They've been silent for months on anything that mattered. Today we learned beta schedule and release date. That's all.
---
All other info being thrown around might as well not be considered verified fact. Even if the lead dev says something, its just his opinion which can be overruled by management easily until an official Blizzard statement is made stating that thing. That's probably why they are releasing info through streamers, they dont have to be held accountable for any of it.
---
Where the hell did you get 108 days from? That's more than 3 and a half months.   
---
How would it make sense for one season to last almost a third of the year? Is winter only one month now or something?
---
It's not meant to fix the 'overcrowded starting zones' problem, but the 'dead servers once the tourists leave' problem.
---
No, you cant "just hop" between layers. You can get invited, but good look setting that up unless you have friends on other layers.
---
Its just as usual, people complain for the sake of complaining
---
I'm not the mod who did it, but I'd imagine it's because we have a sticky on sharding at the moment. When there's a sticky please try to use that. If everyone makes a thread to soapbox there is no opportunity for anyone's viewpoint to get seen as the sub gets flooded.
---
No it's not. If you login you get assigned to a layer. Unless you switch groups, you won't switch your layer. If you raid a city, nothing changes. Nothing happens when the "crossroads erupts". Sharding optimized player populations for small local areas and switches you through various phases based on how many people are where. It's also crossrealm.
---
If you are in a layer with 3k people and those 3k people raid a city, there will be 3k people.
---
Is this the burning crusade?
---
LEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOYYYY JJJJJJEEENNNNKINSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!
---
Dont mind him and the other #nochanges noobs we have here. Let them stay away from classic due to a seamless solution, just so they can prove their point (Somehow, idk)
---
People are odd man
---
Fuck off eu
---
Okay, you are just dumb. Stop spamming you dim-wit
---
yea its bad right, but we all kind of knew this was going to happen for launch right. Atleast this is a tiny bit better than sharding is what I think.
---
lol log off. filthy casual.
---
Yeah, raising Unarmed (and Defense, if not a tank) to 300 used to be such a PITA.
---
The algorithm is perfection.
---
They already put in layering in order to help servers maintain a healthy population so putting in X-realm BGs makes no sence to me either. 
---
We can still change Blizzards mind. No BGs in Phase 1 and 2 so we still have time.
---
Hmmmm, the reason I dot last is because by the time I finish casting smite the mob is about to be in melee range so if I dot first then they’ll knock back my smite casting. 
---
Silence is amazing for PvP but I feel going holy is better spent since 90-95% of your time will be leveling. Also no BG’s for a while after launch :(
---
lolwut
---
Retail players are the incels buddy. You go ahead and keep grinding 20 hours per day for a different color on your armor.
---
A pretty big key difference is that sharding is cross realm, layering is not.
---
1. While there is some truth, in my point of view its reasonable. first of all it's business, They need to make extra money, cause remember they pretty much wont get anything from it apart extra subscriptions.
---
2. The name reservation is fair too, i would be pissed if some kid messes with trial accounts or dad buys 1 month sub cause he was good boy and creates 3 characters with random names and never plays with them above level 10.
---
There is some chance one of these random names will be yours.
---
Now, there will be s*itload of people playing and messing with classic in starting zone, first 2 weeks till they get bored or its nothing they have imagined.
---
I guess its only fair, people who will commit to classic have a fair chance to take their iconic names, and jump into azeroth with all their nostalgia and memories, or jump in adventure ahead of them.
---
Go back to private server sub. That's where you can spam that word with other like minded drooling retards.
---
Loled irl. 
---
And fwiw I feel like this guy deserves some props for firing up the Classic movement. Thank you, Chance :)
---
yeah mages wont be able to aoe farm on classic.. they are gunna change the frost tree! good call!!
---
Just go to the official Classic website there's a countdown at the bottom...
---
Where are you getting 2 weeks of layering from? Every interview I've watched and read has said it'll be for Phase One which could be 1 day and it could be 4 months.
---
Time and distance do not work that way. Both classes have to accrue the same amount of XP after reaching lvl 40 and getting their mount; getting there first doesn't convey any additional advantage other than how far ahead you already are. Your second point is more relevant, but I can make the same argument about reaching level 20, which the Warlock will do first.
---
Then where is the upside to having layering?
---
^
---
Gatekeeping and a lover of gore.
---
This ~~man~~ boy knows what he is talking about...
---
I agree, you need to be invited to a new layer , so it's a dumb arguement, but it doesn't mean it's impossible. The possibility for abuse is so small that it's worth the 2 weeks of some people maybe gaining some small advantage for a small amount of time in order to have a better launch.
---
Sameeeee, it will be my first year teaching, WoW is a great game to play while teaching imo, you just play casually and you can nolife during holidays, but the first few weeks of release are so good it’s sad we won’t be able to nolife it

---
Nope, once you change layers your stuck there from my understanding. You wont return to layer 1 unless you group up with someone from layer 1.
---
Yeah I have about 7 other people who are planning on playing from different friend groups and I'm trying to bring them all together for Classic.
---
Not anymore, as it seems. UK still has it, snatched one.
---
SOunds good. its like servers within servers.
---
Indeed. It was already a slippery slope when they stated "only in start zones" and as you said...here we are.
---
It'll just get worse.
---
The feeling of playing in the same world, seeing the same people as you levelled is what made the social aspect and perhaps it even resulted in joining same guild.
---
With layering (basically sharding), that will be gone.
---
Layering will be removed when the retail kids has gone back to retail, hobbyisdrinkin included.
---
I agree, but people don't see it like that, they think the worst of every situation.
---
There is no need to be upset, we don't know for absolute certainty how long it will last but ion has now said a few weeks multiple times now, hopefully it's gone sooner rather than later :-)
---
Overpopulated? Yes fucking please. We have private servers that average 13k at peak, and that is NOT bad. Even though these servers DO have dynamic respawning and it DOESN'T always work, it is still a way better solution than normal spawns for 3k max players like it was in Classic. 
---
I'll take overpopulated over normal any fucking day.
---
Sleeveless T-Shirt was the most OP item in Vanilla.
---
A lesson from Pservers: Only servers with 10-15k players on launch have avoided becomeing ghost towns 12months later. Even among the diehard pserver comunity there is atleast a 50% player drop off in the months after launch.
---
Problem alleviated with as few downsides as possible as far as i can see.
---
You can exploit layer hopping to avoid people or guilds, gain access to resources, rare mobs and so on. Use your imagination.
---
&gt; Still, its a pretty miniscule problem compared to insane lag and unplayabiity, dont you think?
---
A 2-3k player layer is not any more or less playable than a 2-3k player real server, the only difference is that allows new exploits .
---
Oh c’mon lickmygrundle69! I’m sure there’s a WoW lady out there for you!
---
I appreciate that, thank you!
---
There already is an answer to this... And its no... Hard to figure things out for yourself?
---
Again, people don't understand what's happening here. We all know what Layering/Sharding is,what it does and why, we all know. No matter how many times you explain it in a crystal clear voice, there is STILL a problem.
---
Blizzard is sacrificing server communities for a better first experience so people are able to play a perfectly working game. When in reality, the people who wanted classic in the first place, know that server issues are to be expected or you'll have to wait for the quest npc to respawn or wait before quest mobs respawn. 
---
"Oh but it's only in effect for the first phase." We only get 60 levels here folks, community begins as soon as you move out of the pile of players as soon as you join the server. The guy purposely tagging every mob even though he doesn't need it, ya we'll remember you later on. Or the guy who saved your butt from dying while trying to quest, we'll remember that fella, and I'll trade him some goodies when I see him later on down the road.
---
That stuff is gone with layering/sharding. All because blizzard is catering to a playerbase that didn't even know vanilla was ever a thing. I just find it completely fucked, that all those people put so much effort into getting blizzard to bring back classic realms......R E A L M S. To have it all fade away between layers of different instances for every server released.
---
It just makes me super freaking nervous. Waiting all this time just to hear blizzard mention the single most destructive technology to be greeting us soon as we connect to CLASSIC REALMS. 
---
I just hope I am wrong.
---
(Oh and before anyone says "Why do you think this is for a certain playerbase? Who made you so freaking special?" None of this wouldn't of happened if it wasn't for a very dedicated community of gamers who CONTINUED to fight for this, year after year. So yea, again, it's fucked, because this should of been for that community and right off the get go, I feel like it's blizzard just selling another game.)
---
Exactly, and what's more in the style of classic than mounts that were available in classic. I'm all for the old mounts being purchasable.
---
Is it really possible to hit max level in 2 weeks?
---
&gt;If I'm saying something misleading please let me know, but this is what I think layering is
---
it is unfortunetely wrong. 
---
&gt;For the first couple of weeks you'll stick to Ragnaros-1 and see the same people and you'll play with other people that were assigned the Ragnaros-1 Server.
---
every time you log in a layer will be chosen at random, you are not assigned one. 
---
&gt;If this wasnt the case you wouldnt be able to kill any boars for example if you started playing right when the servers went online, you'd have to compete with all other 1999 dudes trying to kill boars.
---
yea but layers will hold 3000 people anyway (which would have been the cap before queues started happening if they had no layering), and now without any sharding but layering instead, you will be competing with 3000 other people for mobs and quests on launch, layering won't alleviate that.
---
This is not how it should work. Launch day will have the most layers, I would guess 10+ of 1k each to make sure the starting zone are somewhat functional (but still packed). Overnight the number of layers will decrease a bit but the number of people allowed on each layer will increase as population spreads out over the world. The layers won't automatically trip when they are over or under by 1 person, they'll work within a band so that each layer has a similar number of players. This gives Blizz the ability to manage and distribute the load. Over time, they will continue to reduce the number of layers while simultaneously increasing the number of players per layer until only one is left. At least that's how I would do it.
---
The economy will be fine, supply and demand will remain in balance as if there was just one normal-sized server. Predicting starting vs. final population is the only variable that could screw this up, resulting in over or underpopulated servers once the dust settles. They have a lot of data to go off of for that though.
---
You're very welcome.
---
Didn't they promise us way back that there would only be sharding in the starting areas? And only them? Why the hell did they suddenly flip that to two entire continents being "layered". Come on, really? Tourists won't get past The Barrens, so the population decline will only be in those starter-ish areas. Why layer things like Un'Goro crater where you need to be around level 50 to quest there? Why layer Stranglethorn Vale? It makes no sense since you basically throw the community aspect of vanilla that we all know and love in the ditch. Seriously, they just need to layer the starting zones as they said they would some time ago.
---
It's better to not be queue up in lines of 50-100 people all waiting to kill one named mob in a starter zone.
---
Im going to travel for 1 month on the 22th of august and when im back university already started . RIP me
---
Yes, most likely.
---
Nothing confirmed of course but from my understanding there’s no problem releasing on both platforms at the same time.

Not an exploit, so that falls flat on its arse. 
---
So when no exploits exists, no problems exist. Please stay away from classic, we dont want players like you there.
---
When will we know?
---
Streamers are the new celebrities for the demographics they believe WoW appeals to most: teenagers.
---
As much as this subreddit and pservers are mostly mid-20s people who remember Vanilla, Blizzard aren't making Classic for *just* the 100k or so people who regularly play pservers.
---
Frustrating to read some "complains" as they seemingly do not understand the difference between layer and shard, but the most infuriating thing is that some do not want to understand.
---
This is by far a better approach than the way classic launched back in 2004.
---
Anyone remember the talk about "hardcore / lagacy" servers for retail? Maybe this paves the way for community focused servers for retail wow, which would be a great thing imo.
---
That's exactly what I mean. Leveling, all the tiers, and clearing Naxx is one game of WoW. People who love Vanilla have been doing this for years already on private servers. Doing everything on one server, then starting over again with everyone on a fresh one.
---
remember that time a private server launched with 14k player peaks with no lag? :forehead:
---
It's possible to hit 60 in less than a week
---
You might want to save a few days if you're able to book later in the year. Having a day to do nothing but run dungeons when you first hit 60 is really nice, you won't get all the gear you want, but more then enough to step into MC.
---
Half life 2 released same day my school's ACT testing was scheduled... You don't even know...
---
If you meet someone in an area, you can stick with them and follow them around through different areas. The world is continuous for everyone in your layer. So no people/mobs/questgivers fading in and out like sharding does.

Yes. On fresh private servers MC has been cleared in second week.
---
Kind of sad about no option for new models to be honest. It would have been a pretty easy client-side toggle for them with basically zero impact on the people who don't want them. Coming from a pserver where I did the model swap manually, the quality difference is crazy. Like to the level where I don't particularly want to play some of the old races (gnome etc) because they're so ugly; and the new ones are so nice.
---
Good point. Considering layers will hold a whole server cap similar to the cap back then, on low pop servers there may be no layering at all or maybe 2 at most, merging into 1 quite quickly.
---
I too believe this is a better solution than sharding.
---
I'm not sure, why everyone thinks this is a troll post.
---
There is no dynamic spawning in vanilla, so yes overpopulated.
---
This is not how it should work. Launch day will have the most layers, I would guess 10+ of 1k each to make sure the starting zones are somewhat functional (but still packed). Overnight the number of layers will decrease a bit but the number of people allowed on each layer will increase as population spreads out over the world.

This gives Blizz the ability to manage and distribute the load. Over time, they will continue to reduce the number of layers while simultaneously increasing the number of players per layer until only one is left. At least that's how I would do it. There won't be any very small layers.
---
Not the same thing at all. You can't just hop servers by joining group on another server. You can't join that group at all.
---
[Here's Ion discussing layering.](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=236)
---
Couldn't find the source I quoted in the edit, but based on the above link, I'm cautiously optimistic. (Info starts at the 4:00 mark)
---
the invite should show up as notification/pop up in the bnet app + you'll receive an email information that you received one
---
I bought a month of playtime just for a shot at beta-invite. If I end up not getting one I will punish myself for my stupidity by punching myself in the nutsack. You have my word.
---
Point me to the official Blizzard statement that says it will be removed please. Dont confuse secondhand info or even dev interviews as fact. If management turns around and wants it left in...guess what... the devs cannot do anything about it.
---
I must have missed that post/interview. But if what you say is true, then I'm satisfied.  
---
Thanks.
---
No expansion has been released sooner than in august. Most of them were actually released prior to or during midterms in school, how is that not worse. Real men score As while raiding 3 days a week, suckers.

---
Some servers will be one before phase 2. Some will be one when phase2 releases.
---
Depents on the population of each server.
---
Once fully merged queue times will come.
---
Wow... I guess times change, as Garrosh puts it.
---
Phase 1 is projected to be 6 months. How is that starter zones only?
---
...did you watch the move on layering as explained by Blizzard? I have yet to watch it myself, but that’s not how layering works.
---
So how do i join my differents friends if they will be in differents layers if we dont log at the same time.?
---
👌🏻🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Because they just developed it for Classic. If it's a hit, maybe they do the same for retail down the line...
---
i tried both before and improved wanding had way more value, ill go wand first and then spirit tap again
---
I hope the layers will be static with split up chat channels. The only option to switch should be with a group invite. There is also no reason to change layers when you log off or to a different character.
---
Ok what would you call it? In vanilla you could not just pick up another black lotus after finding one, you had to wait 1-2 hours or change area. Now you can just phase into another layer and pick up another? What do you call that if not an exploit?
---
They very fact you think it's going to be 6000-12000 people contesting for the same mob is just laughable.
---
This is not an issue, if there are two layers then there are two servers worth of people to fill the demand for two servers worth of devilsaur leather. Same with all other resources.
---
I never disagreed with that, I just said that I doubt many people besides a few crazy guys will hit 60 within the first week, and that a week and a half to 2 weeks is more realistic for the hardcore crowd in general. Regardless, these guys and gals will be way ahead of the curve of the general playerbase, yes.
---
They could use queues to limit the number of layers allowed per server, for example, after a given amount of layers you start putting people in queues to "signal" the server is "full" so people can choose a different server and avoid extra-overpopulation, unless they want to stay in queues for hours but that's up to them.
---
You didn't get banned for your opinion and you know it.         
---
You got banned for being kind of a dick towards everyone who wasn't agreeing with you.           
---
You say people over on /wow are glorifying the game the sub is about(no shit) and complain about how biased their views and arguments are, all the while on this sub you call Bfa "hot garbage" while claiming classic is the best mmo around.         
---
It almost seems like a biased opinion.
---
Did anyone get a classic beta in email yet?
---
i personally don't give a shit if i don't use corporate approved language
---
So all you need to do is have a few active players in the guild and you get layer locked. Now do that in 3 guilds. If one guild gets on the same layer, just have everyone log out for a couple mins and try again. 
---
This seems easily exploitable. Though of course Blizz hasn't released official info on how any of this will work. So maybe they've taken steps to prevent... but I haven't seen any statement proving that.
---
"just the starter zones"
---
"just phase 1"
---
Do you see where this is going?
---
That happened on launch with ArcheAge as well. There was a quest to talk to someone before lvl 10 and it spawned once every minute or so. So people formed a queue to talk to him. Ofcourse people jumped in front of the queue sometimes, but mostly it was a neat queue. People talked to each other etc.
---
Good raid leaders, class leaders etc knows that healing meters does not really tell the whole picture so no one will use them to decide who the “best” healer is. So if you are stressed out by healing meters, you should learn to stop caring about them and play the class to its full potential. 
---
Raid leaders etc care more about people ressing fast etc, so that down time is reduced.

---
Hi, /u/bdc92
---
Meanwhile the only Q I've had is: Does each layer have its own AH environment, or is it server wide? I don't hate one or love the other, but the implications are pretty massive.
---
It's 2005. You zone into WSG. The enemy is the same premade team who won the last 3 games. The same team you've been running into for weeks. They are not doing insane tricks, their gear isn't insane, but 3 or more people on your team will refuse to play because 'premades always win'.
---
Except layering doesn’t work that way. You’re still on the same server as everyone you’re layered with. As long as Blizzard doesn’t massively underestimate how many players will continue to play, once they remove the layering for Phase 2, it won’t hardly be noticeable
---
Is it confirmed OG server cap per layer on day 1? I would think 10+ 1k servers where both the number of layers decreases and pop per layer increases quickly would be better. That's still more than were on most vanilla servers at original launch once the lag subsided.
---
I'm just gonna take that Friday off for a 3 day weekend. Hopefully, if they end up having server issues at launch, they'll be solved by the weekend. I'll still have plenty of time to play before the weekend though, hopefully I get to level 20 so I can straight up no life grind for 3 days straight. I'm gonna be on an IV drip of caffeine.
---
Awesome, I really wanted crbg’s glad we got them
---
Its bank holiday here on the 26th, so ive booked the 27-30th off (4 days). I end up with 9 days off in total, 3 before launch, 6 with launch :)
---
it really is worth watching through at least once
---
When was this? What was the starting areas like? This is a genuine question, I can't imagine how the Vanilla starting areas could handle that many players, respawns were slow then, I imagine there was lots of fighting over mobs.
---
Yeah sadly not what i expirienced back then in classic. But i was also on a total newb server where alliance ( my side back then ) didnt even manage to clear MC when horde was running in full tier 2 gear :( .They were like a year behind and even dodged stratholme/scholomance mostly because it was to hard ( lol )
---
"Classic summer" my fuckin arse
---
It maybe sounds like a douche and I'm sorry for it but in my experience everyone ever complaining about DPS/HPS addons is either a terrible player or doesn't know at all how to use it.
---
Yeah. I found this annoying though as I'm basically paying 14 days of gametime for a name.
---
I'd much rather it was on the 25th or something.
---
*insert original funny asmongold comment here*
---
From the time they said that Classic would release in the Summer, I made jokes how they were gonna time-gate and wait until August 31st to release it. Now we have an official release date of August 27th. Not really much of a "Summer" left.
---
I've watched every piece of info blizzard has released so far. That is how layering is currently gonna work. It's essentially one giant shard of 3000 people that spans the entire continent, it's for reducing queues and for long term server population health, it won't reduce how many people you are competing with in the launch period, even with layering you will still be camping 5 min respawn timer mob spawns in competition with 500 others
---
People don't read
---
First, this is only for Phase 1.
---
Second, layering means you’ll still play with all the same players, you simply may not always be on the same layer, even if you don’t realize it.
---
In this way, there may actually BE someone there to interact with two years from now, as opposed to logging in and finding you’re the only one there...
---
They're mad cuz they're so entitled that they think the release date should be perfect for them lol
---
Nah no worry i understand that you would think that =)
---
Also i know iam very good later on i made stuff like the haigan dance with me and the tank alone because everyone was learn resistant.
---
Pservers had dynamic respawns...
---
You underestimate how far some hardcore players are willing to go.
---
They'll create new servers then and allow a free trasnfer
---
Apparently noone does, lol at downvotes :X
---
"Classic summer"
---
People are bummed out because they were lied to. In what way does a release date at the very end of summer constitute a "Classic summer"? I for one feel fucking baited
---
I use [this simple app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/countdown-widget-track-events/id917514700?mt=8).
---
Good news
---
But why go to “play retail” ... how about I just stop playing wow when I get bored, or go back to playing other decent iterations of WoW on private servers? And how about I decide what is and is not for me? Even if you didn’t mean it as an insult, it still is very arrogant assumption to make.
---
ignore hobbyisdrinkin. He's trying to troll everyone as soon as he starts losing the argument
---
But each layer is the size of a vanilla server, so would that not balance out the additional resources?
---
The gank thing is a good point though, easy get out of jail free card
---
Well it doesn't even need an armor to run at big boy speeds.
---
It's clearly a superior breed.
---
All hail this man for his passion and work for Classic WoW.
---
That aged well. I don't mind either way.
---
Guess what time classes start...August 27th 😣
---
Well, storywise, isn't Classic's whole thing just Chromie playing around? They've got a perfect out for an alternate timeline with that.
---
ED was great until Blizzard removed the label from servers.
---
Who gives a fuck about classes I give a fuck about being led on with the "Classic summer" lie
---
People need to educate themselves before they post dumb shit, Firstly this is for the first month while classic is full of new players, Secondly, if they didn't do this the servers would be unplayable, We don't realize how much sharding helps with wow lunches, because we haven't had a lunch without it in a while. It would be blue nameplates clogging up with the screen, no mobs and wod like sever Queues. Most of us know nothing about wow servers and the stress they can handle without sharding, however, Blizzard does and thats likely why they made this decision. If Blizzard does go back on their sharding free promise after lunch then we can all get mad.
---
&gt;it's three months
---
It's the last uni vacation of my life that I was hoping to spend playing classic.
---
Why dont they just give us details then. I think people are just as riled up because we are hearing this info through non official Blizzard statements or secondhand through streamers. If they had announced layers with an official statement and document explaining exactly how it works. Not just basic 3k fill, new layer created. Rumors out there that being in a guild will impact your layer. 
---
So what else will? Are chat channels layer specific? What about rare spawns, AH. Does switching characters switch layers or only full logout...etc. We'll mine a bunch of this info in the beta, but if Blizz wanted to actually look professional it would have all been laid out for the announcement. And people would be calmer about it.
---
Hi, /u/Onewaye21
---
You are lying, if you had really watched all you'd know, it's closer to 1 month.
---
/startattack should be present.
---
From the post it seems that you did not get the concept at all
---
They could do a no layering server. Ghost town after 2 months.
---
In classic not everyone knew that overhealing is a thing and if that was a case for officers in your guild then damn bro, that must have sucked. I wouldn't worry abou that nowdays though.
---
Malware Chinese gold farmers launching preemptive attacks.
---
This is a 15th anniversary special edition, not classic collectors.
---
Bye, I hope you can find some other cool games to play.
---
Druids and Hunters will be the overall least-brought classes, and even the hardcore guilds will have 2-3 of each of them, so you'll be fine. If you want to play druid, there will be 2-3 resto slots and probably a feral OT spot for in a reasonable guild. If they're short on healers and you prove yourself, bringing you as a 4th resto isn't going to be the cause of wipes because you weren't a priest.
---
It's releasing at end of summer, so you literally can't. Classic autumn is more like it
---
I think that was always the plan - we’d all be up against 3k other players regardless. 3k per continent still seems a little overcrowded, but things should calm down by phase 2 I think. Seems reasonable that about half of the population will be gone by then, for whatever reasons.
---
Duplicate name issue for one...
---
Air Force here, and my shifts fall on top of the release date. Gonna take some leave I guess.
---
Hey I’m a non WoW player and was wondering what this is? A new game WoW game altogether? I’ve been looking for new games to get into and want to know if this is it chief
---
Dps meters and boss mods were part of vanilla.
---
If I may ask the following: Where are you from? How many hours a week do you work? And when do you spend those 10 days?
---
Just dont create the guild until you are 60 then ?
---
And what if your guildmate is actually in another layer because he is in a group.?
---
Uh, yikes?
---
Excuse me?
---
Youre an idiot, and if they keep layering on that long people will be pissed af.
---
It’s WoW but just as it was released without any expansions
---
Glad we're getting our information through such reliable methods. Plausable deniability for Blizzard that way.
---
Purification
---
That hits way too close to home
---
Lying about what, dumbass?
---
Too bad
---
Ion said in one of the interviews https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=646
---
 that beta will be very small. So, chances to get a beta key are pretty slim.
---
no dynamic respawn
---
Servers in Antarctica, a fan the size of Texas, nd 5000 over clocked Xeons should do it.
---
Of course they can lie about it, but the backlash and shitestorm will be huge. And the classic players will join the hate train of the retail players.
---
But i take the risk for the joy of playing classic.
---
Our release time comes after NA so I would say so.
---
But if there is no layering or sharding you have that already.
---
No, the most important difference is that sharding is cross-realm and layering is not cross-realm. You will never meet people from other servers with layering essentiallly. And this is why it is much better.
---
Im in a group of about 100 people that will join the same server, pretty sure it will be pretty easy for us to switch layers at will.
---
White Reddit.. Would you kindly go to your settings and turn on night mode ?
---
They said we would enjoy a classic summer. Yeah, the whole fuckin 4 days of it
---
Fuck off
---
Lying about having seen all the media about the layering, if you had, you'd know they said it would be for 1 month at max.
---
Neither is old mount system
---
They should and they will, as far as DBM is concerned. As far as dps/heal meters are concerned, parsers show a way more complete picture so that's what good RL will use.
---
This has got to be one of the whiniest posts I've ever seen. You're getting an indefinite classic server.... QQ
---
Hum, I hope not. I mean, it would against the idea of seeing the same dudes over and over.
---
In this case Layer is just a big Shard.
---
It's like people were told one thing and got another
---
They said they're keeping the old mount system all the way through the phases. That wasn't in 1.12 though????
---
Wait, surely there would be no way to switch layers/shards in combat? Like, that just seems incredibly silly and abusable.
---
 Even getting 'forced' into a new shard seems pretty bad. Imagine clearing a good way into a cave, getting switched into a new shard/layer, and spawning among a herd of cave yetis through no fault of your own.
---
The only way they could conceivably pull this off is through player action, like joining a group with characters on another layer/shard. Possibly with a warning, 'Joining this group will move you to Server-2. Confirm?'.
---
This is Activision/Blizzard we are talking about. The backlash and shitestorms are common place at this point.
---
Hmm man iam outdated didnt even hear about parser. Well i shall see
---
Yeah but they do it for free. Other classes have to be conservative about it, thus increasing downtime, because it can get costy doing it all the time. Downtime also means being dead and mages not only have best kiting toolkit, they got ton of survivability and mobility. Also, fucking city teleports ftw.
---
Yea I don’t think you are even somewhat understanding the implications this would have...
---
summer is summer, lmao
---
Getting wand specialization before spirit tap is more optimal. Won’t make a huge difference though.
---
Invite to party to get in same layer
---
So how do you join people you don't know in other layers? You don't, just like on another server. The only issue is with people you know through a third party app (reddit, discord, ...).
---
 My vacation time starts on 20th August, 3 weeks long. Fuck yeah
---
Fun time to look back to? Sure.
---
But if I'm taking a week off work for launch I'd atleast like to make it out of the starting zone...
---
People in this reddit loves the idea of sharding these days, don't know what happened.
---
But then you have way too many people in the same area. The point of layering is that many people can be on the same server (technically) while still having no population issues because 100 people want to tag the same mob.
---
Once the hype dies down and at least half the playerbase quits (because that will happen), layers can be removed and the server population will be "normal" again.
---
same
---
Only way to beat your boss is  to assemble a raid in your workplace.
---
Dont forget to cap your vacations to resist most of a dmg.
---
No... starting zones ALWAYS meant the actual starting zones. Such as Northshire Valley, Valley of Trials, etc.
---
Fair enough, but very small is still around a thousand players. And you know most of these are bad testers who won't give proper feedback and report bugs like they should.
---
Sadly most people who get in betas are more concerned with playing the game than doing proper reporting of the small issues and stuff, and more often than not just report the "big" bugs that have already been documented by others. Which is why we end up with bugged games at release :/
---
You won't get to Arathi in the first few weeks. Hehehueuheuhu
---
Yes, the only sustain mages have is evocation on a long CD.
---
20 gold? What the hell, you were born into a rich family, aint ya?
---
The ret is secret underdog which will be top dps...
---
Ps. Atleast i hope so...
---
When can we see if we got invited today?
---
&gt; Layering has literally no down-sides, and keeps the leveling experience pretty much lag free.
---
It does have quite substantial downsides in theory, and we don't know how they're going to handle These. You can escape world PvP by switching layers via an invite, you can farm resources in an exponentially higher rate by logging in during odd Hours and farming layer after layer (Black Lotus, Devilsaur Leather come to mind immediately), and it's going to be incredibly impactful to the economy of the server assuming AHs are realmwide instead of layer-wide, just because for every creature and every node that you could farm, there are X copies, depending on the amount of layers.
---
Now, I don't want to say layering is inherently a bad thing, but I think we should keep an open mind either way until we know more details.
---
Assuming the resources, rare mobs, whatever aren't farmed or killed by one of the other x thousand people on that layer.
---
Time to quit job.
---
You must be ESL to think that anything in my post was implying I have "seen all the media on layering". Dumbass.
---
So, instead of competing with 9000 other players I'm just competing with 3000. Sounds like an improvement to me.
---
I'm with you on this but seems this reddit nowadays is filled with people are pro sharding, rip.
---
Is BFA not hot garbage????
---
And this is with dynamic respawns, which vanilla doesn't have.
---
I doubt Docker. Containerized realm instances certainly, but no one in an enterprise environment is going to using Docker as their runtime for a new product these days. I wouldn't be surprised if the entire Classic infrastructure is being facilitated via OpenShift.
---
Layering is a solution for server scope issues. It doesn't help with zone balance directly. Though indirectly it can sorta help. 
---
Do 1k layers for day 1, then once toons are spread out both in area and logon time, push them up to 3k per. But honestly sharding works better for zone balance because that is the scale it is built to work on. 
---
1k layers is hoping that means spread out, but it could mean 1000 people in a zone. The layering tech doesn't care where they are, so its just probability they are counting on to avoid too much zone congestion using just layering.
---
If you're going to rush to 60, for real, in a hardcore way, you're better off taking 10 days off straight away.
---
If you're not, don't take time off it's not gonna make a difference.
---
Aoe mage will be faster if they can exploit layering to not wait for mobs respawn.
---
And before no old epic mounts. I'm so depressed now.
---
Assuming the lotus is there and not picked by someone before you. Also assuming the spawns in every layer are the same. Which should be testable in beta. Which is also fixable probably.
---
I'm lucky enough to be off the night of the 26th, so I'll be able to get a feel for how the servers are doing. I'm optimistic that layering will prevent the servers from crashing too much, but regardless, I'll be taking that Friday off for a 3 day weekend. I'm going to play pretty much 72 hours straight. Hoping to have a level 60 in the first 2 weeks. I'll never be a server first 60, but I'll definitely be up there with the first hundred or so.
---
&gt; Am I a delusional player just by expecting a comeback of all vanilla time-gated OG status symbols?
---
Yes. What are you talking about? No will be able to "easily" get AQ mount, R14 or especially the "old" epic mounts (because they won't be available :). Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill...
---
Are you insane
---
Lol I don't follow WoW it was on my popular feed. In any case it was a joke that only I got apparently haha
---
"Time Until" is pretty good.
---
Of someone is willing to trash their reputation so badly they need to buy their way off the server then more power too then, I no longer have to play with them. Win win.
---
Another waste of time semantics argument, the point is you get X chances of opportunity at resource instead of 1.
---
So... Tips asks about the TCG rewards and Collectors Edition reward in one breath. They confirm they will include the collectors edition rewards but stay silent on the TCG rewards... really hope I can mount my Swift Spectral Tiger in classic.
---
This is not how it should work. Launch day will have the most layers, I would guess 10+ of 1k each to make sure the starting zones are somewhat functional (but still packed). Then it will start to queue. Overnight the number of layers will decrease a bit but the number of people allowed on each layer will increase as population spreads out over the world. The layers won't automatically trip when they are over or under by 1 person, they'll work within a band so that each layer has a similar number of players. Queue and slow decay gives Blizz the ability to manage and distribute the load. Over time, they will continue to reduce the number of layers while simultaneously increasing the number of players per layer until only one is left. At least that's how I would do it.
---
People get R14 on private servers without account sharing, people got R14 in vanilla without account sharing.
---
I mean you could buy a code but yeah
---
Is warrior that atrocious of a leveling experience in classic? Planned to have that as my first toon
---
&gt; It is something for everybody.
---
Well said. We got so much information at once that everyone has soemthing to be depressed about. For me it's the unarmoured mounts.
---
&gt; Assuming the lotus is there and not picked by someone before you.
---
Another waste of time semantics argument, the point is you get X chances of opportunity at resource instead of 1. 
---
&gt; Also assuming the spawns in every layer are the same. Which should be testable in beta. Which is also fixable probably.
---
If layers share resources what's the point of layers? Seeing mobs tagged and resources disappear by invisible forces is somehow better than seeing the actual players doing it?
---
You don't get the joke?
---
Not considerably though. Bear form still gives druids some pretty good grinding with no downtime. You're slightly faster 10-20 will be quickly outshined by my 15% ms at 20, and 30% ms 21-30, and then 40% ms at 30-40, all of which require a lot more XP then your slight advantage from 10-20.
---
username checks out
---
Yep, invite to party.
---
They are mainly to prevent dead servers and server merge after the pop dies down, but can be used to solve the initial quest jam as well.
---
the ONLY meter that matters is the threat meter.  IF you going OOM mid fight then maybe analyse your own logs, but never compare yourself to others in your raid.  You cannot compare healing done and over healing to different classes, and a MT healer will obviously have greater values for both than someone spot healing the casters.
---
How many layers go to the same auction house is what I want to know. How do I switch layers to loot a blotus? Can I see people spamming LFG in a different layer? Depending on the answer it might feel like a 3k serverless architecture, or a 9k server.
---
a man of culture, i see
---
Warlocks have downtime, which is a part of combat efficiency, drinking etc. Plus druids can kill while kiting too, just not as many mobs.
---
I still don't geti it, when people says it's superior to realm merge. It can be abused, and won't solve the problem. What if on one realm stays 10k active player, while on the other it's just 1k after phase1. After this, the first realm still stays overpopulated, now with bonues queue times, while the second one still remains unpopulated. Realm merges, and transfers will still be needed after that, so it did not resolved any problem.
---
&gt;balance of the game.
---
What balance you're talking about, this is Classic...
---
To me, retail is seriously lacking that mmorpg feel, especially with BfA.
---
When i play classic, I feel involved and it feels satisfying to loot my kills, team up with friends and try out dungeons as we level together. Every item truly feels like it has a purpose and the rotation/order of my abilities matter.
---
In retail, it feels so dumbed down, you could run around wherever you want, headbutt your keyboard and gain levels quickly. It feels like an arcade hack and slash with little variety. Gold means nothing and you can boost your way instantly to 120.
---
Old school rune scape is extremely popular
---
Its impossible in my eyes. You need level 3 to kill defias at elwynn. The biggest problem is the hit chance.
---
The lack of any precision ("few" weeks might end up extending too much)  and, well, the chance for it to last the whole phase one is there, albeit quite unlikely.  But if you take into account we were told and promised sharding/layering would be limited to starting zones... now it's the whole world. They've changed their mind and it's unlikely to be their last time doing so. 
---
Honestly, this has been a letdown for me. This hurts wPvP the most, the core reason I got interested in it.
---
Yay. Good idea leave the start quests to me
---
Layering will be gone by phase2. World bosses won’t exist when layering is in. When world bosses come layering will be long gone.  
---
90% of players won’t have even reached un’goro by the time layering is gone and you’re worrying about people abusing it to farm high end mats lmfao.
---
Username does not check out
---
Is this a fucking *joke*? You just enable the Classic WoW beta opt-in and register your FAX number. 
---
Jesus Christ this subreddit, I swear.
---
I agree. To me vanilla is all about the server community. It's great to see people out in the world, group with them for a dungeon and later encounter them in a BG. Besides that by only having people from your server I feel like it will make battlegrounds more spread out skill wise which encourages less frequent pvpers to play aswell. More worried about this than layering.
---
I think that's too much effort. I will just wait until the chaos is gone and then somehow level. Probably some tryhards will grind the starting zones out and go to the next zone.
---
| server being "seamlessly" merged with another full of people they've never even had the opportunity to interact with
---
You want to tell me that you knew everyone on your vanilla server you leveled with? And if you see someone you don't know it's not because the played at different times before?
---
k ur boring lmao bye
---
Also dm and songflowers worlds buffs werent used in raiding back then for example
---
All layers will have the same AH from what I understand. You’re technically still playing on the same server. However, each layer will have its own Black Lotus spawns.
---
I gotta agree that I am pretty nervous about it... I was really hoping that there stupid cross realm tech would not even touch classic....
---
We dont fully know because everything said today except the beta and release dates are essentially speculation. My guess, they will need to merge servers once the rush dies down. If those are 4 servers with unique names and player names which are unique only by their server, then merging is a pain. Server name changes and dup character name issues. 
---
So instead name the 4 servers the same thing, differenciate them with a layer number and require character names to be unique across all layers. Now they can merge layers whenever they want. No server name changes or character name changes needed.
---
Noon gmt+1 👌 those who know they know
---
Isn't #nochanges out the window since we know it's the legion client?
---
On every login
---
Everyone soothe your mamaries. It will be fine. Let’s give them a chance.
---
At this point idk anymore i just want to play a proper mmorpg that’s not anime. There is NOTHING out there.
---
I've quit my high profile job in the London insurance market in order to start a street food stall. What couldn't work out? ;)
---
This isn't about fixing the starting zones, it's for 2 months down the road when 70% of the people quit.
---
I don't follow any of these worthless piece of shit *influencers*. 
---
Can you please link the exact video for that?
---
This is along the lines of what I was thinking about - they could have gear that is slightly worse than Naxx but is more obtainable due to 10/20-man raids
---
They will spread the people into different layers. Youll be fine.
---
Because if you'd just taken 5 mins to read through the front page of this sub, you'd know the answer.
---
I've been in ever blizzard beta (and public alphas) since cata for all their games so I'm pretty hopeful
---
Fuuuuuck I have 3 weeks vacation in July!
---
and
---
Yeeeeeesss a release date!!!
---
Theres plenty more to kill in Elwynn like lvl 3-5 wolves,boars,spiders
---
Also we are Warrior/Paladin duo so heals are there if needed.
---
&gt; there are a total of 6 black lotus spawns every 6 hours
---
That doesn't sound like vanilla.
---
If you have 3k people in the same layer you still have that problem.
---
Yeah the ‘lil fuckin goodie bags’ part is good. Good amount of heart.
---
Well they do have to protect themselves a little, if everyone without a sub could reserve names it would become a disaster.
---
They will probably just allow you to prepay the sub in advance is my guess.
---
This is very interesting and great to hear. Was there anything said about class balancing u/HealingPantsTV ? I would assume that if Blizzard are willing to create new 60 content down the road then they also would want to make Ret viable, Prot Paladin a capable tank and other specs?
---
Gonna be twice as many people crying as in the bfv reddit aren't there?
---
There will be abuse for sure. Fortunately it's just a temporary solution. Once half the playerbase inevitably quits they can reduce 3x3000 layers to 1x4500 server
---
There’s typically a class you can skip each semester, just have to wait and see. Unless you are going for your masters / doctorate than you’re fucked.
---
They can handle 12k now if spread across the world, but it isn't ideal for gameplay. Free transfers off were mentioned as a last resort.
---
I agree. The people most benefiting from this will be tourists and streamers. People looking to see what all the hype is about will be able to have a nice, smooth leveling experience on launch day.  And quit anyway, after a few hours or weeks.
---
Everyone else will be stuck with the remnants of this for a long time. Like, what will they do if one 'layer group' stays highly populated for months? Login queues? Non-vanilla population cap? Or just leave the layering system in place running longer and longer?
---
Yes, they can. And we've seen the results of the changes they did make. Do we want them to repeat those just because we know the outcome even when it's bad?
---
We'll see. "Few" weeks can be from 2-3 to the whole phase 1. The only thing we have for sure is it'll be during launch and some time after it.
---
This was a common way for attempted scams in the AH. And it sometimes worked.
---
You're the one gatekeeping
---
No the knowledge wasnt the same, just the fact that kungen said they didnt even think about using dm world buff for raiding back then make already a huge difference, lets not talk about all the obscure buffs that can be stacked.
---
I mean if you don't wanna be a badass, you could go alli.... (just a joke)
---
But really it depends on what you found the most fun. Or if you intend to raid (hardcore), in which both sides have their benefits. Personally, i've been playing horde since i started in BC and im gonna stick with it. But i will make a human palli at some point to get the corrupted ashbringer. Yes i understand how slim my odds are of getting one, but it's been my goal since it was removed. And yes I know you can get it as horde, i just want it on a palli for reasons.
---
So TL;DR: For the Horde Brother!
---
Trust me neither will I, that's if I can get any sleep at all.
---
Well I found it but 100 pounds might be too much for 30 days of game time, mouse pad and Ragnaros figure. I still need to think about it.
---
Not gaming but maybe lose a couple of kilos before the game releases
---
you would never be competing with 9000 players. Without layers it would just be capped at 3000 and then you'd be queued if it went above that. In both scenarios you are in game with 3000 other people concurrently. Layering is for improving queue times and long term server population health.
---
No one off payment, no buy.
---
People are always complaining about 'games as service', with constant payment, yet Blizzard have gotten away with it for years. How ironic. 
---
Overwatch - one off payment and hundreds of hours enjoyed.
---
well private server HAD TO COMPENSATE for this though by increasing the spawn rates by like %4000 percent...   
---
and since blizzard will NOT increase spawn rates. you get layering...  
---
I would take layering over dynamic spawns any day.. the ONLY people mad at not getting dynamic spawns are people who like to abuse it
---
That’s objectively wrong
---
classic classic server?
---
What the hell do you mean? Like on retail I play with all the players in the world except im only sharded together with like a few. yeah, thats exactly what I do not like.
---
Private servers always die after Naxx has been out for a while. Classic will be no different.
---
Hey man stop using common sense and logic, only SUPER ELITE and CRAZY gamers are in discords with other people who they game with.
---
&gt; If layers share resources what's the point of layers? Seeing mobs tagged and resources disappear by invisible forces is somehow better than seeing the actual players doing it?
---
Let's say you have a zone with 6 possible black lotus spawn locations. You're in layer 1 at spawn 1 and pick it. Why are we assuming spawn 1 in layer 'whatever' also has the lotus? And not one of the other 5 possible spawns?
---
100% agree world buffs should be tied to the world.
---
Why is druid fast? Hunter i can see why but not for druid
---
Like I said. Your problem isn’t the strength of various mobs. It’s the hit chance. Every mob 3-4 level about yours have a much higher dodge chance. You simply cannot kill it, without much luck😅. I think the layer system will do this job for you. Enjoy the start area.
---
Jokes on you, I already got my invite
---
Tidal charm is bop
---
100% this, it’s going to completely fuck up world pvp for months... I did not want their stupid sharping BS near classic at all, so disappointing.
---
Good idea 😅
---
Thats a big fucking assumption to say that servers will lose 50% or whatever players in first week and even bigger assumption that blizz will make new servers instead of keeping sharding tech if population rises.
---
Can you genuinely claim that you consider September to be a part of summer in a normal conversation? Are you an astronomer? It is very typical to consider June, July and August to be the summer months.
---
I don't think it's an unpopular opinion. People do it because it's optimal and you're hurting your raidmates by not getting them. I think most people would love to see em gone.
---
"Give me Crusader Strike. Or give me Blücher."
---
August 27th is too fucking late
---
Amazing to look, horrible to play...
---
Yes, mate you're set. Have an active sub on 26/27th of August and you're good to go.
---
I swear i saw this here on this subreddit like 12 hrs ago
---
Red Dead 2 100%,  
---
I'm at 92% right now.
---
Im tryin to get as many "+" points with my significant other so I dont have to worry about her during the first couple of days after release.   
---
Preparation is key :D  
---
And to get some sun before heading into my man cave for a couple of weeks of HC vanilla gaming.
---
Two weeks to a month out of Classic's whole lifetime won't ruin the experience, relax.
---
I could hear your  superiority complex through your post.
---
By the time you are in STV there will be 2, maybe 3 layers max. You'll have a decent shot at developing your bromance with sneakyboi and others on different layers.
---
Where is your workplace? I have to change my job 😬
---
Any news about LazyPeon? Would be so happy to see him return to wow
---
Phasing, or sharding, is more "dynamic" than layering will be. With layering you will be assigned to one layer each time you log in. For the duration of your session you will remain in that layer unless you group up with someone in another layer (and even then you might remain in the same layer, in which case your friend would be moved to your layer).  With sharding you move from "shard" to "shard" as you move from zone to zone.
---
This seems to be their compromise between no sharding and trying to keep realms stable and balanced.
---
We're not assuming that. If there is 4 layers you can get 4 opportunities to get black lotus from the zone whereas normally you would get only 1. So if in vanilla you got 2 black lotus per day you can now expect to get 8, because 4 layers give 4x more opportunities to get it.
---
Play on a low pop server then.
---
Maybe it is possible to abuse black lotus spawns etc. but hopefully the beta test will show what is actually possible to abuse so that the devs will do the necessary changes. The game is not released yet, and if there is to be any point of having a beta, such things will hopefully get tested by the beta testers.
---
This is the big question
---
Looks amazing until you actually want to progress with your character
---
Raid leaders choose what is mandatory for their Raiders. If you don't like what they choose, seek another guild that caters to your play style.
---
Its part of the game. Kill onyxia before do the next end content part. It doesn’t ruin it, it’s uncomfortable.
---
No, this is the original game without any expansions just like it launched ~15 years ago.
---
Get tons of car parts and work a bunch
---
CAN YOU SAY RELEASE DATE BABY??!!?
---
Blizzard finally delivers the news that everyone had been eager to hear with a release date for World of Warcraft Classic, and brings a number of other huge news items along with it.
---
A handful of dedicated listeners get on the line to breakdown the news while it was piping hot and fresh, and the group discusses sharding’s lesser known cousin ‘layering’, closed beta, and cross-realm battlegrounds amongst other topics that came to light.
---
After that, former vanilla WoW class/talents/abilities designer Kevin Jordan is back for his final class breakdown as we rip through the design history of Rogues in vanilla WoW.
---
Finally, we hear from a few listeners all about what the predicted reception of Classic will be from the retail crowd who haven’t already made the commitment to try the game out.
---
Highlights Below:
---
* Calling Countdown #1 – Release Date, Closed Beta, Layering, Cross-Realm Battlegrounds w/ Ayle, Jamie, Jhakobi, Jigantor &amp; Viv- 5:30
---
* Calling Countdown #2 – Kevin Jordan on Rogues w/ Kyle – 1:06:40
---
* Calling Countdown #3 – Retail Reception of WoW Classic w/ Axtel, Taladril &amp; Trabadab – 2:06:05
---

Cheers,

\- Josh.
---
You're running around doing long jumps with flying mounts. What did you think was gonna happen?!
---
Sidegrades are possible, some items can be better than other depending on the situation or the other gear you have.
---
Example : there are differents bis lists for each classes depending of the world buffs you have.
---
Also weird items with weird proc/on use effects are always gonna be used in pvp.
---
Makes no difference at launch 😅
---
Assuming you know someone in the other layer. I get the argument. Wouldn't it be easier to just let your guild farm in every layer?
---
At least I have the first few laggy days off work 🙃
---
It's dynamic and not based on zone. Launch day will have the most layers, I would guess 10+ of 1k each to make sure the starting zones are somewhat functional (but still packed). Overnight the number of layers will decrease a bit but the number of people allowed on each layer will increase as population spreads out over the world. The layers won't automatically trip when they are over or under by 1 person, they'll work within a band so that each layer has a similar number of players. This gives Blizz the ability to manage and distribute the load. Over time, they will continue to reduce the number of layers while simultaneously increasing the number of players per layer until only one is left. These numbers are all illustrative but hopefully you get the idea.
---
thats one of the 1% of posts in that sub that actually are cool / funny.
---
&gt;I invite my buddy who's in the same zone so we can team up and kill them. I get transferred to my friend's layer and the enemies disappear. 
---
This probably shouldn't happen, since all your friends/guildies would naturally gravitate towards being in the same layer from playing together if I have understood their explanation correctly.
---
My understanding was that Layer jumping will probably be limited to [battle.net](https://battle.net) friends, and layers will be almost like Sub-Servers. If they Layer the chats as well, you probably won't even notice the layering once you have played a bit with your friends. 
---
They haven't gone into great detail about exactly how it works, but they mentioned that you would stick to a layer once you transfer too it. (They really should do a comprehensive blue post about some of the things with Layering that are unclear. Having the community running rampant assuming the worst case scenario based on what we have been told is not good).
---
Yes it might be possible to do some coordination out of game to try Layer jumping using different accounts that are in different layers, but if you just play with your friends Layers shouldn't be all that noticeable.
---
In any case, Layering will be removed by phase 2 when the Honor system is included.
---
Yeah, I can honestly not take anyone who complains seriously. They are (In my eyes) the same as 16 year old spoiled kids who gets a car from their parents for their birthday, and then complain about the fact that its the wrong car.
---
Pathetic
---
I bought flight tickets for China, going from august 20 to august 28... So I will not be there for the launch, bummer !  
---
Maybe it's a good thing, trying to play 2 days after is gonna be easier, maybe...
---
Blizz should probably make layers selectable during login (maybe visible as different servers, but your characters would be visible on the server from any layer in the login). You want to play in Layer 2? There is a 100 player queue. You want to play immediately? Well, here is Layer 3 for you.
---
And then don't let players invite each other from other layers. You want to play together? Log out and log into the same layer. This could prevent instant transition and evading ganking.
---
I'm sure the numbers will be tweaked once they're done with the stress testing.
---
Ahh okay cool :)
---
Authentic? Pfft. People will just change layers when getting corpse camped.
---
Yes. This is the game that started it all ~15 years ago. Old and new players, everyone starts back at 1.
---
I would. It was war. War is not short. Plus, summoning the cool dudes in the BG to give your team an edge was awesome.
---
Classic AV felt like more than a silly PvP game of capture the flag or King of the hill. It was the alliance vs the horde in a battle in a self sustaining zone with quests and goals.
---
&gt; Hmmmm, the reason I dot last is because by the time I finish casting smite the mob is about to be in melee range so if I dot first then they’ll knock back my smite casting.
---
You arent preshielding yourself ? That removes knockback of casting too. I always preshield to prevent/lower any healing needed after the pull (as i want to be do full time of spirit tap before im ready to pull again. If i had taken damage i do a renew + shield and start my dps rotation at next mob pull.
---
Shield is crap heal/mana, but with spirit tap you shouldnt have any problems, if you do the grouping of spells properly and remember to make sure you wand atleast the last 5 seconds.
---
They mentioned free transfers off as a last resort.
---
As a goblin... this isn’t going to work as everyone fears.
---
People are assuming that you’ll change zone, and have all the resources replenished.
---
Your forgetting, you are now in a zone with 3000 other people with other farmers.
---
And guess what? They’re also coming to your zone to take your nodes.
---
All this will do in the end, is provide the same supply unless guilds lock down a area (or multiboxers, as I’m thinking of doing this myself) 
---
You have (let’s say 9k) people. If server cap was 3k, and no layering, you won’t notice a difference. Because the supplies will need to be spread out anyway. And everyone will be farming in “there” shard and trying to in others. Your not multiplying the supply to (30k) people by switching to another’s shard, nor they to yours.
---
This isn’t a issue at all regarding materials or gear from rares. 
---
People should fear multiboxers planning what to do, and guilds locking down farm areas (if any even get this organized, I’m sure a few will try, as I’ve seen post bringing up plans in goblin discord)
---
Stop worrying about the layering though. Act like your server has a 3k limit, and be happier. It’s classic, go have some fun again.
---
But Lineage 2 classic failed due to the grindy gameplay (5+ hours of killing the same mobs). I really hope it won't be the case here.
---
It's just the toughest of them but, even then, it is not that hard. It is just slower and, unless you do the hamstring-kite trick, full of downtime. In PvP you're a sitting duck until 30 (intercept) unless you get the initiative (since charge can only be used out of combat) and even then your 1v1 is still quite poor. 
---
Just stock food and bandages and get a good weapon every now and then. Or, well, you can always get a friend to help you. A warrior+healer duo is great.
---
I'm just gonna call it vanilla and BfA
---
It would be a dream if we find the old classic community of helpful and peaceful (maybe adult) here. Maybe.
---
Don't worry phase 2 will bring DHKs, another thing to ruin the game.
---
Gute Arbeit ! Now back to work
---
In retail vanilla, world buffs could not be used to the extent as it is used on private servers. I expect classic wow to like retail vanilla.
---
K1 buffed naxx with no world buffs was actually so fun
---
it's part of every fresh server experience.
---
i had most fun when i had to compete over every single mob.
---
opinions are different, and that's good. 
---
i personally would love overcrowded areas
---
Dear All
---
I know it's a sensitive subject for some, but I personally hope we will get to claim our vanilla CE pets in classic. It's a great way to connect with others who was there at launch back in the day.
---
As far as I know based on the [wowhead breakdown](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit#collector-s-edition), we'll be able to get our pets.
---
Do we know anything new now that classic release has been announced?
---
Thanks and FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Completely agreed. Layering will be a new, complex system, and will certainly change how to farm for stuff efficiently. Change, as in, significantly different from both vanilla WoW and private servers. I thought we wanted to avoid this at all costs? To replicate the actual gameplay?
---
Remember to empty your poop sock when before it overflows
---
It's still gonna be crowded as fuck on launch day with ~3000 players per layer all starting at the same time. Elwynn and Durotar will each probably have at least 750-1000 people in each layer.
---
Now imagine only 10 wolves spawning every 5 minutes. And you need to kill 20 of them.
---
That's a different argument. Are we talking about *you* getting the chance to pick black lotus x layers after you found one or are we talking about the fact that black lotus x layers ca be farmed?
---
&gt; So if in vanilla you got 2 black lotus per day you can now expect to get 8, because 4 layers give 4x more opportunities to get it.
---
But you also have the increased player count which creates more demand. Isn't this only a problem when you have layers which are mostly empty?
---
"avoid nesingwary on layers 1/3/7 theres lots of horde, layers 2/4/5/6 are safe"
---
fuck right off with this shit
---
For someone who doesnt play wow, can anyone explain what this means?
---
People are making this a way bigger deal than it is. Blizzard is just doing this to give us a smooth launch. 
---
When world bosses are active and Unguru will be farmed the sharding is gone.
---
I'd say just take off the week of launch just to enjoy the time without the kids.
---
Stfu
---
Looks like layering to me.
---
It hasn't even been 24 hours and it's already out of stock... Blizzard would have to be retarded to not sell more lol (because I really fucking want one).
---
That's illegal.
---
~~No~~ Some Changes!
---
TBC is the most hype for me. I seriously loved the expansion, because there was so much deep lore in it. Wrath was where I thought the game officially left “classic” territory for me. TBC though was so deep in both lore, gameplay, and dungeons etc. I felt like the addition of heroics and raids etc would’ve been even better had they kept 40 person raids for TBC 
---
Perhaps, create legendary 10-person dungeons? Just a though. 
---
Chris definitely had an amazing mind for both lore and game progression though.
---
Yeah I noticed that too when i actually looked it up, you have a good point. I changed my mind and agree with your stance.. My bad for not looking it up before writing
---
The inside of bags on vanilla chars is my fetish.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
You know I'm only kidding, right? It's a humor post mate ☺️
---
Holy shit with these stupid ideas, go play bfa if uusi want post naxx content
---
............................................................................................YA! Alright alright.

good execution, very helpful site, upvoted
---
This is excatly how I FEEL! They just should said that Classic Fall, I feel little bit betrayed.
---
Classic Christmas
---
Everyone in APES just ran outside to scrape what's left of their computer off the pavement.
---
Welcome buddy!
---
I think they said guilds will be forced to be on same layer, like parties. Although because of discord you can easily be a guild and not be in a guild in-game. Or just have it split into multiple guilds that are in different shards.
---
It cannot be done with 1 friend but communities and RMTers can do it.

---
Everything that makes the #NOCHANGES REE gang mad is a win in my book.
---
God I hate you guys
---
But it's better than having 12k people in the same layer.
---
The launch will be huge, Blizz is implementing something that will hopefully make it playable, while also not needing to merge just about every server in a few weeks after people have fucked off.
---
Maybe I’m not getting the nostalgia thing because I’ve never left the games I love behind. I still have my first - Mario’s Cement Factory. Also, being old, 2005 doesn’t seem that long ago to me. I’ve been playing vanilla WoW on PS and it’s a great game, phenomenal. One of my top favourites ever and I’ve played a lot of games.
---
I still search for [http://wow-europe.com/](http://wow-europe.com/) whenever I want to find retail blizzard site!
---
If they destroyed the classic servers to make TBC or Wrath servers I would not support it.  Vanilla is a classic and needs to be preserved.
---
I would also be against any TBC server that had removed attunements for raiding.
---
I just refuse to watch him because he's a ret paladin... Aka an idiot
---
This is still possible. Each layer will have a population cap similar to original vanilla servers.
---
Futhermore, layer population cap will increase as players start spreading to different zones (as some level faster than others).
---
Why don't you just install Windows 10 on your Mac? Should give you better performance and you'll experience less bugs when playing WoW.
---
Well, lets say Vanilla Ressources are meant to fit on 2.5-3k players. Now let's say we have like 15k Ppl starting out on Classic but ressources remain on the same lvl for 2.5-3k? how should that work out?  
---
IIRC Nost e.g. had incresed spawnrates to fix it, how's that better?  
---
And if you split the players onto different Servers from the beginning, you will get Ghost-servers and I don't think thats good as well.  
---
So start with layers like 3k each and turn it off after a few weeks seems like a good solution to me tbh.
---
Fellow kartoffel
---
From now on I ll be constantly putting one elemental fire on AH for 90g
---
Well, the people who got to test the closed alpha was saying it took longer on Classic than private servers to level because the mobs were harder, had more abilities and numbers were different
---
Cuz playing on a dying server grinding naxx for years is more fun...
---
No winter holiday?
---
What if... you dont instantly swap over to a new layer upon joining but only once you reached a party members location?
---
Notice what

Ah, the daily, After Naxx post

Devilsaur mafia will be able to get much, much richer now.
---
Tbc was deep in lore how exactly? It finished of a part of wc3 for loot purposes without cohesive story. That's about it. Suddenly, Kael'thas was part of team Kil'Jeaden?
---
You are right about the gameplay and wotlk parts, though.
---
You know on classic you only could turn in stuff once every 8h or so. On pservers you can do it all time
---
Take the legion requirements as a general direction
---
Yup, world buffs are not the same on private servers as they were in vanilla. Wasn't the horde warchief one on  like a 10 or 12 hour cooldown?
---
\&gt; Considering there will only be 2-4 layers per server 
---
Can you link to where this is said?
---
Lot of people screaming about this over at MMO Champ.
---
My response to that is: for some of them, Vanilla came about before they were even alive. 
---
A lot of the folks who will be playing are far beyond school and studies now. So the August release won’t be that bad, really.
---
in all honesty, one of the cleanest designs i have seen recently, no pop ups for random shite or asking my location or asking to give me updates. nice
---
Honest part is they'd just throw more infrastructure into it and smash the overcrowd.
---
Exactly. Check out this screenshot. This is what classic is about  
---

---
Yea that WoW-post is kind of ironic, I think it reflects upon themselves more than anything.  
---
I leveled three characters to level 60 on servers who shall not be named and I did it solo without friends. I'm 29 years old and have a lot of stuff going on in my life. I don't really have time anymore but vanilla wow is that kind of game that makes me want to no-life. I know I like the old gameplay-loop and a thriving, living MMO.
---
My biggest hope for classic is that I can play it with friends again, I enjoy it enough solo, imagine what it would be with friends.
---
On the last note, there are bad apples everywhere so don't get your hopes to high but there's nothing wrong in enjoying something and we all enjoy vanilla/classic wow here :)
---
Get out of here with that shit. People have been playing Vanilla for over a decade and are still perfectly fine with what it has to offer, without any extras.
---
TLDR: This 'classic' version will be a joke
---
What people dont remember is how bad the queue time was for some realms. You could easily be in the queue for 2 hours if your realm was low pop, faction imbalanced or during off-hours. Its not fun to spend more time in the queue than actually playing the game.
---
Dude, you married Rihanna?
---
I think one reason for all the "classic is just nostalgia" doomsaying is that this is like when a country is split in two. They cant accept or understand why people want to split with them and have there own country.
---
Vanilla WoW was literally made for a casual audience.
---
They are giving paying costumers priority for beta testing. Wow, the shock. Evil company Blizzard amirite guys
---
I'm assuming the farmer could get 2 black lotus in a full server. So if you have 4 full layers to collect from, the same farmer could now get 8 black lotus. If some of them are empty, it's even more of course.
---
This does not have to end ...

Does anyone else hear the "here we goooo " thing

Kael’thas wasn’t a good guy. He was simply going after the well of eternity and in the end doomed his people due to his greed. I loved how all the dungeons starting from Hellfire to Magisters Terrace and Black Temple all felt like they came from the same storyline and were somehow working against us. I’m no expert on the lore, but even I didn’t need to be to understand the cohesiveness.
---
&gt;what is dynamic spawning
---
When the merge the layers, player population will be way down, layers are just for the launch hype.
---
I love how people keep saying it’s about the community and about fun then proceed to attempt ways of abusing it.
---
I agree. It feels like cheating and I'm not interested in raiding with a group that does it. Bring on the consumables!
---
This guy is completely confused. You are correct.
---
Vanilla servers were 3k.
---
Each layer will be 3k to represent that. 
---
I have heard multiple times of “only two layers” but so far I’ve not seen a dev or anyone from blizzard actually SAY that. I think people are extremely confused and not understanding half of what they’re hearing / reading. 
---
There will likely be multiple layers per server, with the “new one” being created as soon as it hits 3k players. 
---
We’re in no way shape or form “limited” to vanilla server size.
---
Yeah I re-rendered the clip cause it had a random lag in the middle
---
Be glad with the free time you have now, you will never in your life have as much
---
They confirmed it in several video interviews, if you have the original CE pets, you'll get them in Classic.
---
You are still going to see alot of people even with layering.
---
This post should be pinned !
---
Great explanation and though behind it
---
But every hardcore guild on your server will do this. I really don't see anyone dominating this. But everyone with beta access on this sub schould test those things.
---
Do we have a blue post on it? Anything new since release date was announced?
---
&gt; Tourists won't get past The Barrens
---
Lmao true.
---
Any tourists from BfA will get bored either in the first zone like Durotar/Elwynn/Dun Morogh/etc, or they will stop playing once they get to the next zone.
---
So there's no real point in keeping this sharding on after the first zone. Sure I'm down for sharding Elwynn/Dun Morogh but not Westfall or Loch Modan.
---
The only people playing in Westfall or Loch Modan are people who are serious about playing.
---
From what I remember from my own exp., it have always been battlegrounds, where I acknowledged and got to know opposite faction players. You could gain some publicity and some sort of pvp "respect" as a good pvper in BGs, and gets admired by opposite faction. This kinda ruins it for me
---
If they are harder to get and rarer, it makes it an exclusive world-event. I kind of like that.
---
It also relieves other players for not having them at all times. You can't always count on world-buffs being available so you get accustomed to doing raids without them.
---
Hey guess what, this is still going to happen with layering.
---
Try actually reading what they're doing before assuming it's just sharding renamed thanks to dumbasses on the internet.
---
Bro tourists will leave during Elwynn Forest. There's no point in sharting Westfall.
---
Decided to play Super Mario Sunshine again to burn some time while waiting. Pretty good so far.
---
Problem is same people abusing ALL layers not different group for each server.
---
The ratio blacklotus : players would still be intact compared to 5 times as few of them compared to the modern ratio of players. Isn't that in essence making it more BlizzLike?
---
Dont fucking move.
---
-Blizzard
---
What are the changes to classic for this launch?
---
You know why this is needed, while they still do the "megalaunch" ? Eastern continent holds HUMANS and UNDEAD. Most popular races by a looong way. Meaning in launch there will be 2 layers on eastern side. Western, most likely only the 1.
---
You can do a 9k server population at launch on that. Another way they kinda are milking monayyy and maybe hitting that target 2 weeks in layers... is name reservations, 2 weeks before the launch. Meaning if you sub to get your names reserved, your first sub ends at 2 weeks. There usually is a big drop off at when you have to do another sub again.
---
It still takes the same amount of time for you to travel around farming mats. 
---
Sure there might be more people farming them now but there will also be more people to buy them. 
---
Please explain how it can be abused.
---
Confirmation of an RP-PVP server is the last thing I need to reach maximum hype. Please, Blizzard!
---
Oh yes. On one server there were so many people in line at the quest “Stolen Silver“ in the barrens. 
---
The player who was first in line abused a mechanic to open it non-stop and the line just gotten longer and longer.
---
It took a few hours until he stopped, sure, it was a dickmove, but hell god we had fun there.
---
Man, enjoy those final challenges. I loved that game but couldn't bring myself to tame one of every horse and shit like that.
---
Because all they have to do is recreate the game as it was and they fucking implement sharding.
---
It's technically not the same game. Joke on you
---
Yes, but not realistic for vast majority. Even if you play a ton of hours, know the game etc, id say 1 month is much more likely timeframe.
---
45? isn't like 15 dollars for a subscription?
---
Yeah theoretically you could get an invite without sub. I very much doubt that will happen.
---
That actually look horrible. No #nochanges when it comes to world concurrency caps.
---
I bet most of you have more time spent on reddit than on any game on own. heh
---
People are complaining that layering will destroy the economy, and you want to bring in dynamic spawning? That would have a vastly larger impact on a server's economy than layering.
---
They've already said you will stop asking
---
Is it truly different though? The layering should be compared to the following scenario:
---
You have a server with 2500 players. There are 3 other servers with 2500 players each. After 6 months those 4 servers have a combined activity of 2500 players. Blizzard decides to merge them together for population sake. You're now on a server with 1875 players that you've never seen before.
---
When you can't make your own meme so you ramble on and on over someone else's.
---
like i heard u need a sub for beta? i will 100% not do that. but i will get a sub to get my charakter name 2 weeks before launch.
---
Can someone explain the difference?
---
Nah. They wrote "more importen\* then...", which is even worse.
---
Do you have bluepost on it?
---
doing BWL on private server atm
---
There's a ton of interviews with Blizzard staff that went up yesterday from streamers and media outlets. 
---
About 8:40 here:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo)
---
Lmao, imagine taking Ion's word for it.
---
I don't trust him, plain and simple. I think he's going to stretch a "first few weeks" as far as it can go. Just like how they stretched the definition of "a classic summer" to last day of August.
---
That's the way I understand it. Assuming there is no exploit to allow one player/group/guild to game the system. But I think the spawn locations will be different in each layer because every layer get's farmed differently by that population and so the respawns won't be the same.
---
But the supply will be far more concentrated into a single entity. If you just had 4 real servers each having their own farming entities with no phasing into each other then after merge the overall supply would be same but it would be far more spread among 4 entities.
---
they do no want to shard, but they cant make it work without sharding thus they have to. which is MUCH MORE worrying.
---
You have a server with 2500 players. There are 3 other servers with 2500 players each. After 6 months those 4 servers have a combined activity of 2500 players. Blizzard decides to merge them together for population sake. You're now on a server with 1875 players that you've never seen before. For a period you also had it easy with fewer players on your shitty dying realm.
---
German speaking. I think something like cups is super easy to use. You dont have to weight all the time. Half a cup.  Fine. 3 of them. Easy! 
---
BTW. This bread is very nice! Topping is a bit too sweet but still a nice banana bread ☺️
---
Speak for yourself. Whoever turned in a head or heart any time not before a raid when we were progressing would get booted. 
---
We had ony heads lined up for days to kill C’thun once he became killable. 
---
It will be a thing, and your nerd tears soothes my soul
---
I would honestly rather deal with this for a few weeks than deal with power leveling via dynamic respawning grinding, or waiting 5 minutes to kill 1 mob (that someone else might tag first), or having a completely dead realm after 2 months and having to merge with another completely dead realm and play with people I've never seen before.
---
Layering fixes all of these issues and is by far the best solution I could see. It's not perfect, but I think it's the best solution.
---
I don't get the problem. I played on the latest Ely Server Release and there were like 500+ people in Elwynn but we knew that and I just did a Exploration Run to get me to Level5 and tehn moved on grinding Mobs in lesser populated areas while the Newbies still fought over Wolves in Northshire.
---
It's more than a sensitive issue for some. I posted a thread 2 days back arguing that Blizzard should do it this way- and I was downvoted to oblivion and even downright attacked several times (ppl calling out my 'childish' post history and accusing ppl that agreed with me as being me on an alt account). People really want these pets to be added to a cash shop.
---
Instead of logging out? Same end result, you lose the ability to grief your target.
---
Lol very nice
---
Not about what people think about me.
---
You braindead boy?  Pay 'ttention t'wot'm'sayin.
---
I swear to god most of these people bashing layering don't even understand what it is.
---
Felwood and feralas.
---
Im more of a desert type.
---
and dynamic respawns that inc rates by more than %1000 are authentic?
---
&gt;Based on that it is possible that layering system will run only for as long as needed.
---
I would argue that people should calm down a bit until we get a comprehensive blue post about how Layering works, and what their exact plans are.
---
There are too many assumptions being thrown around.
---
800x600.
---
that's gold.
---
meh, i dont wanna level up a character just to then start all over again anywayz.
---
I was hoping for a release in July. The end of August is just when classes are starting up and I start work again.. I'm screwed.
---
This is kind of a really big deal, a huge amount of server identity comes from BG rivalries.
---
And the excuse that it was part of the 1.12 client is kind of wishy washy to me since it seems like it was something they added in prep for BC. 
---
to me them saying "it was part of 1.12" is the same as saying "We're too lazy to code it out of the modern engine".
---
Its 3000ppl per layer. You have different layers for each continent, meaning if you have 6000 population server and both continents are evenly matched in player base, there is no additional layers used. Everyone is playing on same layers.
---
Id say its more that because humans and undead are by far the most used races, eastern continent will have 2 layers and western will have 1. That would make max cap of server in the 7-9k range. When thing even out and ppl quit, you can end up in the 4-6k range.
---
I know that you will enjoy Classic anyway, trust me. 😊
---
Yeah it's a bit weird tbh. I think most on this sub have something against it.
---
It's a vanity pet that will most likely be in the bank most of the time. The only reason it's fun is because it's a wonderful identifier of the original CE owners. 
---
I honestly thought they wouldnt bring them back, but I am glad they do. And I am glad they went with the retail client with just server change.
---
Love you josh
---
Great link, thanks!
---
People forget dungeon finder came with WOTLK . I for one, do NOT want that shit back. I hope they keep them as separate games/communities if they re-release that.
---
I'm going to smash so many heads in that I feel like a carpenter. Mordhau!
---
ohh fuck so you likely wont be able to log in middle of night to farm rare herbs or mobs without anyone around.
---
Remember ... you Need to go UBRS first.
---
Sounds easy right? Well it is not, because for UBRS you Need to do plenty of runs on LBRS first for someone to get the key.
---
And since everyone Needs the attunement (necklace), everyone has to go UBRS at some Point.
---
This. Would love to drop 10 kegs before launch (and maintain it after launch)
---
They didnt want to mention that at the moment for some reason revolving around server health. So, we dont know yet
---
&gt; simply have them in permanently.
---
Exactly. They're both Vanilla content, and imo taking them out was a mistake. Sure, back then, they probably were just thinking about it in terms of "updating visuals" (kinda like the ogres got a new model shortly after release), but from today's perspective, just keeping them in permanently would do nothing but add to the flair of Vanilla (as opposed to not offering them at all).
---
Hopefully not 12k, but I get your point.
---
because world pvp is not a major element of retail as it is for classic. and yes people will be able to escape griefing easily. getting corpse camped, just have someone from your guild invite you after 1st or 2nd death. poof ur gone.
---
Where I live it was snowing and raining like fuck last week and it's still spring.
---
Gonna be fun when nobody leaves the most popular server and they have to disable layering because of world bosses. :D
---
Indeed it is! For us it's even a deal breaker kind of. We'll have a lot of internal struggle and might even split up (even if we're all friends) on regular PvP or RP servers and not play with each other =(
---
Since some of us just can't stand PvE servers and the others priority is RP. 
---
My hopes is a good unofficial RP-PvP server but it'll still be a lot of people there just rolling on it as a normal PvP server so it's not that great of a solution.
---
The 4.8 FPS says it all. /thread
---
Dont die.
---
Same as blizzcon demo, option to do slightly updated shadows etc or just plain "giev me classic" mode.
---
In the video he says the layers arent between realms. The layers are on a single realm. They are taking one realm and splitting it up. They are doing this with 4 realms. 
---
You can’t hop between realms. But you can hop between the layers on a single realm. After two weeks they will collapse the layers into a single layer that everyone is on. 
---
They can do this because the hardware is so much faster now.
---
that would actually diminish the issue
---
I envy you!
---
My colleague (I hope I didn´t write it like the School thingy) has already taken 3 weeks off from 26th of August onwards....
---
I guess I´ll be behind the pack^^
---
Well it's only 21 Tage of Classic I will be missing until I can get started^^ only pretty much everything :D
---
Kartoffeln ftw especially during Spargelzeit!
---
I'm not going to push for server first or something equally crazy. I just want to really dive deep into the game and play for like 12 hours a day which would usually be impossible due to my work and family situation. I would do it just for fun and maybe try to get ahead of the pack a little bit.
---
It would be like this for the first few days and it SHOULD be like this, its a MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER rpg. Let it be massive and ridiculous, this whole sharding/layering will be not needed after a couple of days. When kids and retail plebs realize that classic isn't going to be for them, then us old school junkies can get on with the game.
---
It's really that simple.
---
What is it exactly? How does it differ from sharding?
---
I have a shit ton of Tokens left and 245€ Balance. I think I can use a Token on the Chance. I played right at Releaseday and they said they want Hardcore Players with lots of Experience. So my chances are higher than in normal Betas.
---
Not the same end result. One lets me deny someone the ability to progress in a zone, the other doesn't.
---
Layering is awful and its existence kills Classic's attempt at bringing back the real vanilla.
---
easily solved. Make changing layers a 10 second cast, which cannot be done while in combat.
---
Should checkout the bfv disingenuity.
---
I might just wait for 1 month after launch to rejoin - I'm not in a hurry.
---
Everyone understands what it is and it isn't classic. Avoiding being ganked, switching layers if a boss hasn't spawned yet, avoiding a wipe by having a character on standby.
---
Fixing overpopulation is so much easier than fixing underpopulation.
---
It won’t effect mats.
---
Let’s say three shards. It’s odd hours, k cool. You go and you farm all three of these shards, no problem.
---
... next odd hours, you attempt this, someone has already done this to you and the rest of the shards.
---
Now all three shards have equal mats, rinse, repeat.  
---
As a goblin and Multiboxer that knows many mechanics / systems I can abuse, this (could) slightly be abused in my case, but in all honesty, in the long run, and on a majority of the servers, most people wouldn’t be able to tell a different, and I actually expect a LACK of resources needed.
---
Why? Because... there’s a shit ton of people.  This isn’t vanilla, where we had a low player base for “slow” respawns.
---
This is now a huge playerbase, with those same respawns, and temporary layering that suedo increases spawns (if you manage to get them somehow from other players doing the same thing)
---
A LOT more material is going to be needed. A whole lot. There won’t be enough even if layering magically was abusable as everyone that doesn’t understand the mechanic fears. 
---
As a goblin, I can’t bloody wait. Prices are going to be so easy to manipulate due to people’s fear, lack of resources, needs... ect.  
---
To put it simply, people shouldn’t worry about this or even be against it. There are a FEW things that can happen (that I wish to leave unsaid, but it’s mainly multibox or guilds that aren’t guilded  yet) related, and even these “advantages” that can happen, won’t effect the overall economy poorly.
---
Play classic, your childhood/teens/young adult, what have you’s Amazingly fun time, and have that damn fun again.
---
(This comment wasn’t directed at you at you, but everyone having a fear of this)
---
You're an idiot
---
Is it known that it'll be doable with the nodes, or just theory?
---
I don't think blizzard has had issues with server recently
---
Kid, I remember the times before Crossrealm BGs. On my Realms a few BGs were just DEAD!
---
On a WSG Weekend all BGs other than WGS were dead. And later on AV was pretty dead, after people got their Rep there and you really had a hard time getting one open.
---
Lol is that the maradon scepter?
---
1. Arms levelling  is good, best if you are on a PVP server
---
2. use rend at low levels when you don't have much damage abilities. Forget it at high level except against rogues in PVP (makes their vanish useless)
---
3. it's very intensive with the risk to agro something else, I don't think many people will really stick to it despite the vocal proponents. It was not a thing in Vanilla (except against elite mobs), it's more a pserver try hard thing parroted by clueless youtubers.
---
He looks awesome, have fun in vanilla
---
Consider that maybe people run dungeons over and over again is because they enjoy dungeon content more than they enjoy quests.
---
So in the short amount of time you see an enemy coming towards you, you're going to find a player in the world, make sure they're on a different layer to you (which would be impossible unless you're both standing in the same place and you can't see each other) whisper them, and hope they send you a group invite in 0.00002 seconds. 
---
Okay.
---
I'm sorry to have missed it. I'll make sure to read all info and watch all interviews regarding Classic launch from now on before posting.
---
Yes, using buffs the game gives you to clear raids is cheating.
---
I could not care less about the server names. I'll be playing with a whole different group of dudes and we all hail from different servers in retail.
---
Welcome to hell
---
You can use the old graphics, i think it will work
---
I agree, think of the alternative. Thousands of players fighting over mobs with 5 minute respawn timers at all times will put the game in a deadlock..
---
I don't know where and when you've played on a large server, but if you expect a single player to score them all you're vastly mistaken. The time spent going through layer 1 is lost while someone else already looted layer 2 in the mean while.
---
Ely had dynamic respawns, and I played on it aswell and it was fucking miserable. There were literal groups of 5 standing a round a single mob spawn just to get one kill. That is not vanilla.
---
on Ragnaros before the crossrealm 90% HORDE, 10% ALLIANCE.. BGs were dead with infinit queue
---
 time
---
Nope
---
Explain me how you can ninja in a raid ?
---
If you don't use master loot in a raid, you deserve it !
---
Or if you have any friends at all you intended to play with that are not part of your guild. This is going to create an issue similar to retails sharding where you don't really get to know the server community, until layering is removed.
---
Mute point.. Naxx gear wasn't available at that time.
---
And we call it "FUCKING SHIT".
---
I'd be less worried if they hadn't said this. Next they'll say, "Layering will just be here until the final phase. Layering will just be here for the next year. Etc"
---
Where are you pulling these numbers from? We dont know how many layers or servers there will be.
---
When I heard about Layering the first time I was really disappointed. From the outside, layering appears to be NOTHING ELSE but a big shard. Technically you can probably even have shards within layers, depending on how their zoning structure is set up. 
---
That being said, the way they explained it - while being a lot of marketing sweet talk - makes me believe that this is the only good way to solve the issue. And here's why:
---
A layer is basically a virtual Server "Kel'Thuzad-1, Kel'Thuzad-2, Kel'Thuzad-N" - however, you will only have access to those servers by joining "Kel'Thuzad" - you will not know which layer you end up with. To ensure that you'll end up on the same layer permanently I strongly suggest that you create groups often with the same people / friends. They probably have some form of weighting-mechanism in place to have players be present on a specific layer for all of the times. They said they want you to see the same players from 1 - 60.
---
And let's be very frank here: this is an unsolvable situation for Blizzard. No matter what they do, they WILL upset people. We can only believe in Blizzard trying their best to do the right thing. And we can! Just listen to them talk. They know about the issues we have. They do know what we want. They ultimately - very likely - want the same frikking thing. But they have to make compromises to achieve something that comes as close to the goal as possible.
---
Exact same mechanic as hopping phases on retail.
---
Vi figured out which server to play on 14 years ago, I think we should manage this time too.
---
There will be less servers at Classic launch than it was between 2004 and 2006 so every server name wouldn't be able to be included anyway.
---
Changing layers is not a spell, it's done by being invited to a party where the party is in different shard, presumably coordinated by discord. You are talking about breaking the party feature in order to prevent the exploit.
---
Are there 40 man raids in retail?
---
the direct quotes used are to "Survive launch", and "the first couple weeks".  That said, they have not set any drop-dead deadline until phase two, so I guess it comes down to how much you trust Blizzard...
---
Well, without Dynamic Respawn it would have been ever worse.
---
I'm still not with you
---
I'd rather not but ty for explaining.
---
Yeah? Guilda where every player has one, because theyve been able to coordinate getting by changing layers
---
For one, we don't know how big the battlegroups are going to be - it could just be battlegroups of 2-3 realms and in that case you'd barely even notice anything. I'm all in for xrealm bgs because I like to play bgs when I want to and not sit in queue for +30min first.
---
Oof.
---
How long you've been subbed can easily just mean 'when you first subbed'. It's vague. For all we know they could be prioritising vanilla players. 
---
I agree that having to resub for a chance to get in is scummy, but if they want to monetise beta accessibility we can't stop them. They want to get sub numbers up at the end of the day. They know a lot of people are willing to resub just for the chance to get in and it won't make it break Classic. Smart move from them.
---
This is not true at all lol. For each realm a new layer is generated only when the last generated one is full. The layers are not created at the start. The full layers will still have 3000 people in the same world at launch.
---
Good job you just found leave normal toxic community and join mythic
---
Thank you for this friend
---
&gt;I think you are seriously overestimating how this will effect people. Most people probably wouldn't even notice if they weren't told about the system. Honestly if you can think of a better system than this to handle launch while trying not to have hellish queue times and horrendous leveling experience for the first 2 weeks after launch, I'm sure Blizz would love to hear it. Honestly it seems to me like you're looking for things to be mad at.
---
We have moved from the Information Age to the Outrage Age.
---
I'm just waiting for the Blue Post to clarify how layering is going to work in all these various cases, because there are a lot of assumptions being tossed around here.
---
The weirdest complaint I have seen is the Server economy one. 
---
How is it a bad thing to dynamically scale supply with demand? 
---
It just prevents an economy where only the top 1% will be able to afford buying anything because the supply would be miserable.
---
Good Vibes**™**
---
FFS, when will those "rose-tinted glasses" disciples stop suggesting that each and every Classic player was the same age as they were? I personally was far from being "young and careless", lol.
---
Even when they made resplendent rates ludicrously high, still no lag.
---
What was wrong? They have now allowed closed testers to talk about their experiences. Yes there is further closed beta testing but there is no longer an bad
---
MEET ME AT THE CROSSROADS.  
---
RIGHT. NOW.
---
This is a "think you do, but you don't " moment XD  I managed to get mine ordered but i hope they aren't doing it like the Sylvanas and Illidan statue which only have 5000 made.
---
At that point the benefits of layering will be used up and that overpopulated server will always have queue times, while offering free transfers. So yea, its just like vanilla where the most pop realms always had queue times
---
If they stretch "the first few weeks" to up to 6 weeks, I think I'm still OK with that.  If we start talking about 2 or 3 months, I start having issues really quickly.
---
I have to do it !
---
 If you take a look at this poll: [https://strawpoll.com/1h1292cy](https://strawpoll.com/1h1292cy) 
---
It has 2809 votes which is basically a full layer. 513 people said Human. So there will be 513 people at Northshire Abbey, probably more than in is in this picture.
---
No but there's an interview with Dev who provides CM with their info. He literally says "were pleased to announce". Stop being difficult on purpose you troll.
---
So they are splitting up your server community in smaller pieces. Why are we happy with this? This is exactly what people reacted poorly to on the blizzcon beta. Is the classic community becoming similar to the retail one in that we defend blizzard regardless of how they lie to us? We were the ones that kept them straight and on the path, no changes etc. What happened to that? Are we just so started we'd take anything?
---
100%, on ely i kept encountering a handful of players who were leveling at the same pace as me.  i'd see the names every other day and i'd get a little warm fuzzy remembering me and that person as lvl 2 taurens or whatever
---
then later at 60 i'd see them maybe once every other month and it would be like "hah, cool, he's still around!"
---
You have 100 days to get her (sorry assuming your and their gender) hooked. Looks to me you'll have a holiday laid out for you, the missus at the pool you idem with laptop 🤣😁😜
---
normally, when you get an invite, you have to accept it. Simply have this have  a 10 second cast when you are being invited into a different layer.
---
+1 turning in ony head every usual raiding day was even planned throughout all guilds on our server. To make sure everyone got it before raiding.
---
How many friends do you have? none. How many people that are going to play have friends? Almost everyone. You think people wont discord call and abuse this? This is going to be the most important factor on leveling fast.
---
1 layer = 3k pop. 1 layer = continent. That was said in the interviews.
---
Ofc they CAN do a 10-12k pop server and have 3 layers on eastern, but dont see that being likely. Such high numbers dying down to 5-6 players before stage 2 (when they say, no more extra layers) doesnt seem plausible.
---
Would they make a server that has 1000+ ques in phase 2 ? No. So you are aiming for something between 6 and 9k / server at launch.
---
Not a bad idea I suppose, but now someone would have to tell them and make them consider it
---
Why 6 weeks? People will have hit 60 by then, easily.
---
Do you really want sharding to continue from 1-60?
---
But we called it end game back in 05. Its not some new retail buzzword, that's just what it's always been called.
---
I wouldn't be shocked if Última and EQ called it end game as well.
---
gimme beta access :P Ill make a ticket \^\^
---
Why are you acting like you're playing the game solo due to layering? You will have those exact same people in your layer aswell. I don't understand why people are acting like layering makes you play the game solo, there are still thousands upon thousands of people in your layer. It is either create a million servers with a population cap of 3000, or have less servers with multiple layers of 3000. Guess which one is more economically defendable.
---
Does anyone know at which time classic beta will launch today on the 15th May?
---
There'll be the same number of black lotus per 3000 players as there was in Vanilla.
---
Me I call it "not WOW", the good days ...
---
A /r/classicwowplus/ subreddit needs to be made because any discussion of even servers that are separate from pristine Classic servers but expand upon Classic WoW with Classic style content makes this subreddit start tearing their own hair out at the roots until they pass out from blood loss apparently.
---
/r/classicwow people are truly remarkable.
---
“Us old school junkies” dont want to wait an hour or 2 to complete a quest
---
&gt;Good job you just left the normal toxic community and joined a toxic community that agrees with you
---
FTFY. Not that that's a bad thing but the posts here are just as hostile as /r/wow
---
Comment much appreciated &lt;3
---
Cool
---
Much more authentic to stay in the same world than in a different layer, yes. If that's your question.
---
\&gt;low pop server at launch

huehuehuehue
---
The original artwork was a bit too low resolution for 4K screens, so I used Topaz Gigapixel AI to upscale it. Enjoy!
---
&gt;We have private servers that average 13k at peak, and that is NOT bad.
---
Speak for yourself. 13k was fucking horrible.
---
how about no
---
Because what he states is a lie and completely different to server merging?
---
You don't know how big the battlegroups will be. Chances are that they will make battlegroups of just 2-3 realms and in that case you'll barely even be able to notice that xrealm is a thing.
---
I'm a simple man, I see Basshunter, I upvote.
---
posts a picture from a private server
---
I'm gonna play on EU and I will too aim for the highest rank I could possibly get.
---
How many layers do you think there is going to be exactly?
---
No downsides ? What about big scale wpvp ? Guild ganking on raid nights ? It does have downsides. But its heavily outweighed by all the upsides it brings, for sure.
---
Talent TREES... *that's gold jerry! gold!*
---
No, of course not.  I think layering has bad effects on the economy once people start hitting 60.  Realistically though, I can live with it to about 6 weeks because the vast majority of us aren't hitting 60 that fast.
---

Sharding
---
Subbing doesnt guarantee access to the beta in any way
---
The ony and rend heads will have a server wide cooldown, that alone makes a huge difference. I remember being level 58 or so on ND, and any time i was hanging out in org, I'd get whispers from level 1s asking if I was about to turn in the rend buff and if I could wait til they logged in to their main. It felt weird, and was definitely not something that would happen back in retail vanilla.
---
What 1.12 features aren't they using?
---
precisely.
---
3 months until BWL is a bit quick I think. Most players still won't be 60 at this point.
---
I’m not sure what the point of your reply was, that’s exactly what I said.

Bear tanks/offtanks are also a thing!

I swear to god these retail children are going to drive me into early grave with their shit ideas.
---
There will still be three thousand people on your layer at launch, you dumbass.
---
Ion talked about it here and it makes me pretty hopefully that it will only be at the first few weeks. He even promised it. https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=236
---
Everyone will be busy leveling anyway. If there is some abuse it will have a very marginal effect on everyone's experience I think.
---
People shouldn't pay for the sub loot box. The beta key will never drop, only game time you can't use (if you are purely interested in Classic and won't touch Retail at all).
---
Its a relaunch of the first game version often called Vanilla and or Classic wow. Its a remastered edition with a few changes but still staying some what true to the original game without all the expansions.
---
"Best of" is subjective. What one person thinks is great is bad to another. It sounds like a good idea to provide 2 different enviornments. One each to serve each player base.  A a lot of players have been wanting a "no changes" enviornment for a long time and until august 27th haven't had one by blizzard to play in. In laymen's terms, if you want the QoL changes, then play [insert modern wow expansion here]. Let vanilla dogs have there bone without sprinkling chocalate or catnip on it.
---
&gt; Private servers increase spawn times to offset increased population.
---
Wouldn't they have to decrease the spawn time?
---
Hi, /u/gy-psy

they remove layering 100% after phase 1. quote: "There should be only one kazzak on the server, "
---
12k pop with 20k+ queue. Handled well.
---
Why do the posts complaining about world buffs/consumables never have any idea how world buffs actually work? Why are "unpopular opininion" posts guaranteed to be bad?
---
You won't be able to spamtrigger world buffs in Classic, it's a private server exclusive "feature" where the relatively long CD isn't in place.
---
“What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?”
---
Most likely it'll be something new. I started mid-tbc (BT patch) and ended up maining druid. Feral (either bear or cat) was a blast yet got pushed into healing by guild even if I did hate it. The sole thought of healing again has drawn me out of druids altogether even if I'm craving some feral action. 
---
The 2 alts I had are out as well, being ele/enh shaman (with resto being the only option, and the one I disliked) and good old shockadin. 
---
Currently undecided, but warrior/hunter feel the way to go, but there is still feral echoing in my mind...
---
Assuming the layers actually have numbers to them that the players can see. Lots of assumptions being made as facts already.
---
I will not sub for the beta. And of course I will not spend for the stress test. Blizzard thinks we are stupid...
---
Sharding means you zone in and out of shards as you play.
---
With layering, once you're in a layer, you're there until you log out or possibly even after that. You won't see people phase in and out around you. Each layer will have ~3000 people rather than each zone having like 2 people.
---
You'll still see 750+people in each starting zone on launch day.
---
First day of class is a shit day anyway. You won't fuck up your grades by missing the day that teachers stupidly try to remember all the names of all the new faces, because they think that's cool.
---
The biggest problem isn't the idea behind it, it's the fact it's a new, untested technology. They've said there's only going to be a small beta, so Layering can't be properly tested there.
---
And we all know that new and untested technology always works perfectly, first time right? Right?
---
It depends on what you value in a game. I suggest trying both and asking yourself which one you enjoy playing more overall.
---
I think you are misunderstanding what layering is and how it works. From what I got so far it's basically like mini servers within a server. Each having a cap at 3.000 (?). And you'll only switch layers for groups and to be in the same layer as the guild. So far I think it's a pretty clever solution to smooth out the early tourism that will probably die out at some point.
---
Rage quit?
---
How is using a world buff any different from using a consumable?

How is one cheating if the other is not?
---
Hi, /u/Munchie_Knows
---
Should put it in a museum
---
thats anecdote to illustrate the point that there will absolutely be layers where spots like nesingwary are alliance camped and layers which are horde camped on the same fucking server
---
Oooh, I 'member
---
I have a few important exams to pass in July, so that's going to keep me busy while I wait for Classic to launch!
---
I'm sure groups of 100 people will be super common and this will be an insanely widespread problem. Oh wait, no it won't. Groups of 100 people joining the same server will be a minority. And have fun doing it for a couple of weeks before layers are gone.
---
Let's assume the average person plays like 2 hours every day.
---
6 weeks * 7 days/week = (weeks cancel, leaving only days) = 42 days.
---
42 days * 2 hours/day = (The days cancel, leaving only hours) = 84 hours.
---
That's 84 hours of playtime, most people hit 60 in like 30-50 hours.
---
I don't think it's your opinion that got you banned, but the way you put the point across.
---
firstly no one really believed no changes will happen so most people already accepted that. However if you arent happy with this then play on private server. This is the solution blizzard has and this is set in stone. So you either accept it or dont play. And i think many people will rather play with it. However to quote Ion: Layering will be removed after phase 1 entirely and will be reduced weeks after launch subsequently.  So the whole swap layer to avoid ganking or whatever might be a thing of the first two weeks
---
I'm so glad CRBGs will be in Classic, true to the 1.12 patch that I loved. I don't have time to queue for 2hrs and not even get into a BG and it's impossible to know if your server is going to be high/low pop or factionally unbalanced. Why should I have to pay to transfer away from my guild and friends who might not care as much about PVP as I do? I couldn't care less if players on the opposite team don't recognise me because I'm not that shallow or vain.
---
This is literally what people were asking for. It's temporary and will last two weeks. It's so you don't have 1000 people in a starting zone just standing around doing nothing.
---
Go to a private server if it bothers you. There are plenty up and running. I'm on one right now. My comment was not in defense of their decision in regard to layering. I was simply answering a question. I stated what was in the video. 
---
Reading through some of your comment history, almost every post is you whining about something. Do you want me to get you an adult diaper? People like you will never be happy with anything. Stay on your fucking private servers.
---
Dumb question but how do people know when they make a post of it's an unpopular opinion or not, especially when it's something so specific as thing?
---
Chances are that everyone wants classic to succeed as it'd set the precedent for each expansion to get its own legacy server or even some kind of expansion-toggle setting within the game (like dungeon difficulty).
---
I personally don't see classic taking off. I hope it does for the sake of TBC/Wrath/etc servers, but it doesn't seem likely.

Yeah, as a r14 who dealt with 45 min Q's, cross-realm BGs really ruined a lot of what made Vanilla special. Has anyone talked about trying a faction soft cap where the servers can't pass something like a 60% imbalance at the outset? I guessing there are some hidden problems this would also create...

What's nice about classic wow?
---
If you never played pre-cata, you get to enjoy exploring the old wow map.
---
For me, I plan to play everyday after work between 6 and 8 hours (from around 6pm to 2am probably.) and won't do anything beside work and wow for a few weeks.
---
Find a thread on the matter with at least 3 people agreeing on their different ideas of bonus content. Multiply this by 100 000.
---
Then remember that the people who made WoW aren't here no more.
---
Agree on changes, and ask the current team, that drove us to want Classic in the first place, to implement these changes without breaking the game.
---
After this take a look at the company name: ACTIVISIOSblizzard.
---
Good luck creating a "Vanilla+" game that wont turn into ToC/IC dungeons again, which will erase 80% of the content.
---
Or maybe you will approach the OSRS vote? Aka the Mob rule. Check this:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bok6ex/developers\_are\_open\_to\_tbc\_and\_wotlk\_expansions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bok6ex/developers_are_open_to_tbc_and_wotlk_expansions/)
---
People there can't agree and propose changes on potential TBC and WotLK realms, and you want those people to vote for content? Good luck, with not turning into BFA after 2 years.
---
"There can be realms for everyone", yes except the question how will you not split the community to a breaking point, remains. Maybe you want eventual CRS again? Heard it's great for the sense of community...(Cross-realm-sharding).
---
Private servers kept people for over 10 years with simple fresh server launches, but for some reason the official one will die. Go figure.
---
I hope this time blizzard will be able to protect people from themselves, but after reading every singe thread on the subject and the constant drama of "this should be changed" which is countered ASAP by "Lol no, better change that instead", turning into drama in no time. Good luck with post content that wont screw up everything. This is blizzard, and they have multiple games, if you think that you will get 100% dedicated team to make SURE that it will always feel "vanilla" well good luck. It will be even harder than working on Retail.
---
The potential for disaster is big, and sometimes it's better to get a fresh server or come back later if you are burnt-out, than risking to one day come back to a game you have no idea WTF it turned in to.
---
it will be full of beta "content". i think i will not visit the sub for some time.
---
Yes, and since Blizzard does not want dynamic respawns since that is not at all Classic, what do they do? Have 13k people fight over mobs with 5 minute respawn timers?
---
I don't think you understand the cancer that is sharding. Imagine you're in the world and in the distance you see a skirmish, you rush in to help your faction. Well, at the moment you arrive they all disappear. That's sharding. That won't happen with layering.
---
&gt;and go back to live
---
Im assuming you mean retail by "live". Many of us are hyped for classic specifically because retail sucks ass and is no where near the game that classic is. Sure, plenty of people, especially those who actually enjoy retail (idiots) will play for a few weeks, see that it's too hard for them, and quit back to retail. But more people will continue to play classic than not. This game will not be dead within a year, and it's not just nostalgia that's bringing everyone to classic.
---
I was too addicted and recognized it in the middle of a BWL raid. I was 14 years old and played until 3am and had to get up for school the next morning. I immediately logged out and stopped playing for... 13 years
---
To find the beta key, you have to search within.
---
No unarmored mounts is a huge disappointment.   
---
"we don't want to force that on anybody. We want to make sure that everybody that comes back plays at their own pace that they feel is most comfortable "  
---
Reading that explanation gave me chills, how can a developer be so naive?! For most of the players that want to embrace WoW Classic as a hardcore game it is important to have the opportunity to get time-limited items such as the unarmored mounts at release. 
---
For hardcore players, the dedication towards those things is the epitome and the reason to play World of Warcraft.
---
Reading that explanation made me question their "vision" on their own game and their fan-base. 
---
Caring about casual players shouldn't be a thing in Classic WoW, keep doing it on BFA if you want but please don't do it with Classic WoW.
---
End of the rant.
---
Peace.
---
This content is what this subreddit needs.  Now time to watch it get buried under Goldshire retriever memes.
---
Obviously the better suggestion is no sharding, no layering, no dynamic respawns. If they're planning for 2 layers per server with 2.5k populations each... just let 5k people play together on the server. Nostalrius has already proven that this is not a problem. Sure, starting areas might be a bit crowded for the first hour or so before people spread out. Would I rather deal with that for an hour than have phasing for the entire first phase of the game? Absolutely.
---
How do you consider 4.8 FPS and +20k players in queue as "handled well" ?? That's literally unplayable and the exact reason why we need layering.
---
I already said the release date is a bummer but it is still technically during the summer whether you like it or not.
---
Well yeah, I suppose, but think about it.   
---
It's the only way of not breaking vanilla (having an actual community) while also letting everyone play.
---
It's not going to affect gameplay at all, save for the potential of exploiting farming spots.
---
Why did community call official WoW servers "retail" anyway? How did it start?
---
Idk what system you think is better than what I proposed. Bottom line: if the server is low pop it's identity doesn't factor in at that point.
---
You too bud, you don't seem to know what you're saying.
---
actually a good one
---
I'm sure my plan will change when it actually launches, but currently I'm planning on an initial 24-30 hour stretch, sleeping for 4-5 hours, another 16-24, then sleeping a full night. Kinda depends. I'm not fully committed to just speed leveling through, but at that rate I'll be matching the level of people probably not wanting to do any dungeons, where as I'd like to at least do some.

People  there can't agree and propose changes on potential TBC and WotLK  realms, and you want those people to vote for content? Good luck, with  not turning into BFA after 2 years.
---
"There  can be realms for everyone", yes except the question how will you not  split the community to a breaking point, remains. Maybe you want  eventual CRS again? Heard it's great for the sense of  community...(Cross-realm-sharding).
---
Private  servers kept people for over 10 years with simple fresh server  launches, but for some reason the official one will die. Go figure.
---
I  hope this time blizzard will be able to protect people from themselves,  but after reading every singe thread on the subject and the constant  drama of "this should be changed" which is countered ASAP by "Lol no,  better change that instead", turning into drama in no time. Good luck  with post content that wont screw up everything. This is blizzard, and  they have multiple games, if you think that you will get 100% dedicated  team to make SURE that it will always feel "vanilla" well good luck. It  will be even harder than working on Retail.
---
The  potential for disaster is big, and sometimes it's better to get a fresh  server or come back later if you are burnt-out, than risking to one day  come back to a game you have no idea WTF it turned in to.
---
My point is layering solves this issue. So having twice the herbs etc on AH because its economy of scale more people more herbs. Layering means you don’t need to alter spawn times etc. This was highlighted in TipsOuts interview. (Google it).
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.

There have been races where druids got to 60 before hunters.
---
Edit: if you wanna be an edgelord, you can be horde
---
Exactly, the game's economy will get fucked by the layers which is why it's bad.
---
Whoooooooosh
---
No. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate would release in 2018, and in 2018's E3 it was revealed that it would be released at December 7th of 2018. The hype train on Reddit for that game was a LOT bigger than for WoW Classic. But I'll tell you what: people were grateful as fuck. People hoped for an E3 release but it ended up as a Christmas release. And many people were like, yeah we understand, there's probably a lot of work to NOT make this a disaster.
---
Unlike the hate circle jerk on this subreddit.
---
This is not the issue at all. It's between releasing the servers with a set population cap (and merging low-pop servers after the initial hype has died down), and doing this weird layering thing which acts as a continuous server merge/split according to current population.
---
The difference really is between having actual server communities, and accepting the possibility for a hard merge at some point, or weakening the character-server tie. Because really, what this is is cross-realm characters.
---
Please *Mr multi million dollar gamedev,* what should they do instead?
---
 Have a hundred servers that'll be dead within a week?
---
Cram everybody into the same server so there's 6 hour queue times, so many crashes that you can't even move, and absolutely no chance of tagging any sort of mob?
---
yeah whats up with the reddit player? mine work fine 50% of the time and a blurred mess the other 50% of the time
---
Time to get up on that horse again ;)
---
&gt; That's 84 hours of playtime, most people hit 60 in like 30-50 hours.
---
lmao
---
I bought 4 copies just to keep them sealed
---
Sad and funny
---
It's another one of those differences in private servers where those players never played vanilla so have no clue how it worked originally.
---
Same thing with the warlock summon 'bug' that was reported.
---
Hahahhahahhahahahhahaha.
---
The world record was around 120 hours in actual vanilla, and from what I've seen from the private beta private servers are easier on leveling so there own time (still above 80 hours) are likely to be too short. What the hell are you smoking?
---
That's just rubbish. I think the average is 6-8 days which is 144 - 192 hours.
---
The world record is something like 90 hours
---
24hours straight first day then 14-16h days after for 2 weeks
---
What? No one is hitting 60 in 30 hours.
---
You're right, but it also has to do with how bad it is to level on retail and how its been that way for a long time. Ive been questing on private servers recently and i find it enjoyable because i have to watch my health and mana, i have to be careful not to overpull and i get levels and abilities much more frequent.
---
I have tried to level 2 characters on retail since the start of the year but i simply cant be bothered since its so mindnumbingly boring and dungeon ques takes just long enough that i dont want to wait on it.
---
Because originally it was "for the first week or so, only in the starting zones." Now it's "the entire world for 2-4 weeks."
---
You people are so gullible it's amazing.
---
Thank you
---
Proper discussions dont work like that. Opinions are, infact, subjective.
---
Kinda disappointed they didn't go with the OG website skin for that extra flavor.
---
I had my account hacked at wotlk, which info do I need to be able to recover it?
---
As far as I'm aware, at least some of these world buffs won't exist (or be usable by a raid) in Classic. Songflowers certainly didn't work this way back in vanilla, you couldn't have 40 people click simultaneously and all get the buff. Rend/Onyxia head quests also had a cooldown for the buff, so you couldn't necessarily just go and turn a head in on demand in order to buff up before a raid. 
---
The rest I have no recollection of in retail vanilla. I imagine Dire Maul buffs probably work, but they're not quite as impactful on their own. As for the ZG and DMF stuff, nobody ever talked about them back in the day and it has become effectively impossible to search for vanilla material since Classic was announced. I'm gonna guess half of them work and half of them don't.
---
I think youre underestimating how long it takes to hit 60 there...
---
What?? Do you realize that the world record to 60 is something like 4 or 5 days played? That's 96-120 hours, for someone who knows exactly the most efficient route, quests and everything else. And the vast majority of players do not even come remotely close to this. For most people it will take MUCH more than that, let alone 30-50 hours, lol
---
You're praising it when it hasn't even been implemented and tested yet. Going so far to say no downsides?
---
Man, people *really* enjoy assuming the absolute worst whenever something is slightly changed from how it was in retail vanilla. Even though avoiding ganks and switching for bosses might happen, we yet have to see the actual in-game examples of this before we start bashing it. Just chill and see what happens.
---
As for TBC/WotLK servers, you need big enough community not to split it, since it will kill all three at once. Or force CRS introduction, which is worse than no expansions at all.
---
Is it possible? Yes, but if implemented at the wrong time, its over. Remember that each of these will also need fresh servers each few years, so people can always start anew.
---
Pservers kept their community for over 10 years that way, so if people are afraid of the game dying, it wont happen.
---
Going to get slated but I didn't enjoy Wrath. 
---
Loved the story and the lore but didn't have the grip that TBC/Vanilla had
---
poopsock all the way to 60
---
It's an easy game. Really. It was designed by Blizzard to be a "casual" MMO. The only "hard" thing about it is that everything takes time. As you progress, more and more time.
---
Obviously if you want to finish Naxxramas (the last and hardest raid) you'd have to know how to play pretty decently. Similarly to be the best pvp-er, you'd have to be *really* good. But by then you'd have played years and eased into it comfortably.
---
People like OP always forget when bringing up private servers - generally, there is only one FRESH ps at a time, so people don't have a choice but to keep playing regardless of the number of people on a server.
---
First I told him my account name which wasn't correct, then I told him the old character name + server, he found the account and I could login within 5 minutes
---
Renew my Cotsco membership
---
If that's such a big deal to those people there are always private servers where there's camping and griefing in almost every zone 24/7. It was a tiny sublayer of the original Vanilla population, not too many sociopaths will be upset.

Remember remember the fifth of November.
---
Yeah, I don't disagree man. Thanks for the reply.
---
It was a fun gimmick for a while but if you actually wanted to get shit done it was a total nightmare.
---
You need to re-evaluate how long leveling takes in vanilla wow.  The WORLD RECORD back in vanilla was 4 days, 20 hours /played.  The world record was 116 hours of gameplay.  You'd have to play almost 3 hours a day, every day at world record pace to be 60 in 6 weeks.  A more realistic number for experienced wow players who are not on a hunter is 10 days /played.  At 2 hours a day, that's 4 months.  Yes, there are going to be a handful of people who are 60 in week one, and a bigger handful who are 60 in the first 6 weeks, but that is not the norm.
---
In true hyper launched fashion we need a Public massage.
---
The login servera WILL CRASH! There WILL BE MASSIC QUEUES! There WILL BE TROLLS THAT DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO DISRUPT!
---
I was playing on a laptop. It was a stress test. Please stop thinking your so smart
---
This is my biggest issue with classic. Every stone has been turned over. What is left to be discovered?  We have 14 years of data/ strats. I still think classic will be a giant twink server.
---
If your friends are playing, why wouldn't you be grouped up already? If you want to avoid pvp, just play on a pve server. It'll be way less of a hassle. Why are people acting like this is the end of the world?
---
All 3 are fine solo, but hunters are absolutely the solo kings, not just in leveling but endgame too. They're also great in raids until AQ (assuming the pserver book isn't totally thrown out in Classic) and awesome in PVP.
---
God I wan't one too..
---
And what happens in two months when half the playerbase quits because many people realize the game is not what they think it is? Either they do server merges or layers, and apparently they have a favorite.
---
I don't want to bring in dynamic spawning, but this picture is from a server where it was solved in that manner. I'm just pointing out that having many people in one area without sharding doesn't mean you have to wait 10 min for a wolf
---
My life went well after that so let's call it funny :-)
---
I would try it out on a pserver so you know if it'll work or not. Chances are a level 3-4-5 mob will be too strong for two level 1s.
---
Also, Dwarf master race.
---
It is. Because there needs to be some way to switch the layer you play on. In order to play with friends on the same server, for example. This introduces layer switching as a new mechanic, which will influence gameplay in some way. Leave it to the players to find a way to utilize and/or abuse that mechanic in creative ways.
---
A server merge happens once. It may suck, naming conflicts and all, but before and after you have a clearly defined community with vanilla-like mechanics.
---
I never experienced old WoW but I played another RPG 7 or 8 years ago that had battlegrounds limited to servers. It was great, the actual gameplay wasnt that good but the community made it fun. You had "enemies" from other servers that your whole server hated, people took on specific roles just to counter them etc.
---
It's easier to mash few layers into one at later time, than managing/closing 15 servers i guess. After the hype goes away, we will eventually end up as we did back in 2005.
---
Well according to blizzard that is, well see how will they follow up on their word, in time.
---
It's always gonna be retail. Unless they start calling it shitfest or garbage, then i'll use that.
---
Hang in there buddy! You'll be fine! Life is a rollercoaster. Sometimes you go down really fast and you think you're gonna crash but then you make it to the top again! I found out some grim things about my health this year as well but just trying to stay positive. You'll make it bro!
---
How were you planning on playing when you went back to school if the release date was earlier?
---
I've only played modern WoW a little in Wrath and Cataclysm. Then I played Wrath on private servers. *Then* I played Vanilla on private servers. My appreciation of the game just grew. I really prefer the Vanilla playstyle. It's a *very* good game.
---
 I am considering basically the same classes as you and have a few thing to say
---
Dont underestimate the tp druids have access to, its rly useful
---
Overall i  druids gameplay is more varied and it has more depth, but i think mage offer more useful gimmicks ( food, tp...) 
---
I personally will level both a druid and a mage making use of rested xp and aoe frost leveling
---
I don't really care for hunter's solo abilities, as both druids and mages are really good solo classes
---
After the initial shock im starting to appreciate the layering solution theyve come up with. It would sort of like a huge pilgrimage. Imagine youre playion on a realm for 1 month and youve gotten to know the other people on your layer. Then all of a sudden you get a huge influx of “new” people from other layers and its like a whole new cummunity. I think itll be kinda fun. Youll meet new people and ask “so what awesome things did you do on YOUR layer”? Also sorry for spelling but im writing from my phone for the first time from work and im constipated its not nice but hey at least classic wow is coming out!
---
haha yeah I work from home and am running my own business. So I'll be able to play as much as I want... but I still don't know if that's a good or a bad thing\^\^
---
OP is a fukken autismo maxima and assume his acquired taste as the norm.
---
Don't sweat it.
---
Except that its not worse and thats why people are okay with it ?
---
Leads to dead servers in the long term.
---
Its gonna be dropping for me on the 26th at 3pm, and I'm off that night. Hopefully, the servers wont constantly crash and I'll be able to get in at least 12 hours of game time. Then I'll just have to wait until Friday to start my 3 day marathon of WoW. Hoping to get level 40 within the first week.
---
But if I invite my friend to a group, will he then move to my layer?
---
"hey guys nesingwary camped by 60 horde, can anyone there from safe layer pls invite so i can finish quest, i give 50s" - absolutely realistic scenario unless General chat is sharded too which would be properly stupid.
---
and i just know (everything points there) that they cant actually make their legion backend work properly will large scale interactions between players so i predict they will shard everything forever unless realms actually become low pop
---
Got mine almost an hour after the announcement which is quite a generous amount of time for a limited item in 2019. Gotta be fast.
---
If they want to test how good the vanilla experience has been recreated, they need to invite vanilla players to the beta.
---
How does that address anything I said?
---
Pretty much. It was cool to see a million people in Ironforge, but actually playing with 13k people was horrible.
---
Layering is literally server merges.
---
Oh I agree it is a smart move, but that doesn't make me want to grr blizz any less
---
You're welcome, glhf !
---
I want to play a priest. But i don't to just run around in heal spec and gear all the time, because I wat to be able to solo things/farm/grind rep. Therefore I acutally think about playing a hunter just to do solo content and hope to get in a raid group.  
---
Is it possble for a heal priest to enjoy the solo content or do I have to respec all the time for PVP and other stuff?
---
Because sharding at least creates more or less equal opportunities for everyone meanwhile layering invites abusing of valuable resources and mafia controlled market.
---
I mostly agree with you, I'm just afraid some hardcore farmers are going to stock up and wait for the player base to plummit and THEN flood the market. 
---
All of that being said, I won't let fearmongering and pitchforkraising from randos rob me of my childish joy to be able to play my favourite game of all time again.
---
Didn't skip a heartbeat when i bought mine. I'm really glad that i didn't delay. I expect they'll add more though.
---
Im not sure how limited it will be 🤔
---
I don't think so, but with bubble you can for sure.
---
Layering is basically the same thing as multiple servers.
---
I didn't say that a single player dominates it all. It would be an entity, mafia, guild, community, whatever.
---
No official communication from Blizzard side so far, which is why I opened my statement with "[...] in theory [...]" and "we don't know how they're going to handle these things"
---
So I was mostly trying to play devil's advocate and think of ways this system could be abused. I refuse to panic before we know any details, and I'm going to play Classic almost regardless of how they handle this, considering it's only going to last for a few weeks.
---
Some of the people in this sub are fucking retarted. This is an absolute great solution.
---
Gonna be interesting to see how they handle layers or shards though. Just due to the fact that resources may or may not spawn in every new shard thus incentivizing shard hopping/layer. No idea if that will be a thing but we def need some clarification
---
That's demonstrably not true compared to the live version of the game.
---
If they merge servers at a later point you will have the exact same problem of people you've never heard of before appearing in your server, that will have the same impact on the "server community" as layering. The difference being server merges would happen far later, but layers only lasts for a few weeks.
---
There are a lot of no-life neckbeards in the vanilla WoW community. I mean there are individuals who camp Redridge on private servers for 8+ hours a day, every day, for months on end. And coordinate with others to keep it camped 24 hours a day. 
---
Obviously that sounds like a mental disability to a lot of us, but at the same time you can make the argument that they deserve their vanilla experience just as much as the rest of us.
---
I find hunter pets to be  a pain in vanilla WoW.  I like them a lot better in WOTLK and later.  Feeding, loyalty and controlling pet is a bit of a pain, IMO.
---
The chart is what each classes pvp trinket breaks, not what each class can do.
---
Also this will be only a thing in Phase 1 so no World bosses
---
For Black Lotus you will have to be veeeeery fast at leveling to exploit this to its full extend
---
Try hybrid, I'll be playing pally ret/holy then going full holy at 60
---
Thanks alot! :)
---
I have the classic soundtrack in my "Work" playlist, which mostly consists of game soundtracks (useful when doing game development code), but I tend to skip to it quite often.
---
Judging by my most played music in 2017 it was very often, actually....

AYAYA Clap
---
I mean it probably will be exploitable. But its a temporary system. A couple weeks max, as noted in the video.
---
Why wouldnt you want to betatest? They’re usually super fun
---
Why should I pay full subscription to have a CHANCE to play a beta of a game? Meanwhile they will invite retailers that are playing totally different game and who have no idea what classic should be like.
---
Not to bash on what you said, but I feel like the net result will be better if they wait and listen to what the community has to say before they make up their minds. They respect our opinions and want to know what we want for the game before they make that decision. I would even say that there's a lot of other games out there that should do the same
---
Pretty much how I feel, under the assumption sharding was just for the starting zones only to find out it's for every zone for months on end. The community can't form if nothing is permanent. I think I'll stick to off brand servers for casual play and main another MMORPG.
---
Most players wont reach STV in a couple of weeks. Do you just choose not to read? It won't be a widespread problem like you're just assuming off the bat. You don't even seem to know the difference between sharding and layering.
---
Ah, the /r/classicwow tinfoil hat is coming on I see. Is everyone turning into Alex Jones?
---
For the moment they are sold out. I am sure they will be back on sale when they see demand. There never was a shortage of CEs ever. Everyone who wanted one, got one for the normal retail price. They will care if they see demand and produce more. Why wouldn't they. Nothing in the box is that exclusive. 
---
So don't worry and just keep an eye out. Set a reminder on Amazon. They'll be back on sale soon enough.
---
How does it hurt world pvp?
---
Its server merging without the overhead of dealing with guild name and character name conflicts. Aka what he stated.
---
 Copy paste thread (3 in 10 minutes), Copy paste answer...
---
I'm no programmer but how do you shard *only* the starting zones when there's no loading screens between them? Is that even possible?
---
Pfff I took 2 weeks from the 26 to the 6 of september
---
Both mage and druid are really nice (portals and druid travel forms, and stealth).  I find pets a pain in vanilla - too much to do, feeding, etc. So I don't really think hunters are that great in Classic - unless you are Ok with the extra work and slower style than later hunters.  I also think Macros are needed to play Hunter well.
---
Yeah, as long as the current bfa team doesn’t do it. I don’t trust them being capable of creating things players actually want.
---
&gt; (please don’t attack me) 
---
Good luck with that.
---
i guess when we create a character we have also select a realm before doing that? (something else does not make sense to me)
---
Whaaat? You would be able to abuse sharding a ton easier for valuable resources out of the fact there'd be a bunch more instances of a zone, including being able to have that many more zones the early people are able to farm for resources (a thing people keep bringing up against layering, not personal opinion). Not to mention the sheer amount of resources would destroy the economy, and the number of rare pets for hunters that would come out of it, and things like the stun trinket from the rare in arathi
---
You can do solo content just fine as a priest, you're not going to be the fastest, but you're incredibly safe. Gold farming lashers with Holy Nova is a thing, so even if you'd want to respec multiple times a week, it wouldn't cost you more than a couple of hours of farming
---
Is that a joke? Im fueled by a competitive drive to succeed. Waiting a whole year after everybody is done leveling and multiple raid tiers have already been cleared and farmed isn’t exactly a fun experience for some people. I really am not interested, even remotely, in playing catch-up in vanilla wow.
---
Yes. Please do. But its fine if you lost on a lower rate to keep the quallity good.
---
I have played at enough pservers to know STV will be a problem even after a year unless sharded.
---
I really have no idea why people assume 80% of players will drop after first week.
---
6-8 days is a really solid time for an experienced player on a fast class.  It's not impossible by any means, but it's not something you could have a generic gamer do starting from low knowledge.
---
I guarantee you in the next few days we'll start seeing "Unpopular opinion...." "Let's remember...." "Can we all just calm down..." type threads when the vocal group calm down a bit about being upset about a release date.
---
This past week this sub was spammed with memes looking for a release date, they got one but didn't like it.
---
If they put as much effort into prepping for classes that they do into prepping for classic release they would end up with more free time to actually play classic.
---
It's not the same though. Regardless of how you put it. People would rather prefer server merging, instead we get several shards of the same realm, named "Layering" instead of "Sharding" which is exactly the same, but will extend past what they promised of being the starter zones only, is now possibly for an entire phase of Classic WoW, if not more.
---
My plan is to make a name of the person i hope to run into. I hope i get his name. In doing so i hope they run into me. Havent talked to this persona and brother in 10 years. It would be unreal.
---
Again, you just choose not to read do you? Most people wont REACH STV in a couple of weeks, which is when layering will be disabled.
---
I don't think all of them are grown men/women (be that age or maturity), which is why they are reacting this way.
---
Then you can start merging them
---
That‘s true 🤔
---
It sounds like harassment to me.
---
Wat lol
---
Then the same problem with server identity is ruined. You didn't think this through did you?
---
Hehe
---
Two things:
---
- Ony/Nef head buffs have a cooldown in classic.
---
- DM:T / songflower / DMF buffs are way more popular now than they were back then, and they do affect raid difficulty to a noticeable extent. That's NOT unpopular opinion, everyone knows that.
---
Pedophiles 👉🚪
---
Better I meet some more community members later than end up on a dead server in a few months...
---
Haha, this may actually be a real problem: popular servers not dwindling enough in population for all layers to become one :O
---
don't see the issue here. back then there haven't been layering, pservers had no layering.
---
sure there was dynamic spawn.
---
tbh back then it was even better. like i said, opinions are different. for me, it would feel more real as it would feel like there is one single world where everyone lives in.
---
How will 3k players on one layer be a smooth launch experience? Nobody has been able to explain that to me.
---
"But it wasn't released at the start of Q3 so it's wrong even though it's technically correct"
---
I think all of this is manageable, but the bane of my hunter friends was keeping up to date with pet abilities. Basically if you tame a lvl 10 cat with claw lvl 2, the only way to lvl up the claw ability was to find a cat with higher lvl ability, tame it, use it for a while until you get a message that you learned the ability, and THEN you can come back to your first pet and teach it the higher lvl claw using training points.
---
Though if OP likes RP, hunters have great class identity due to these things :)
---
How would your friends even know if they're on a different layer than you? Just have one inv you and hope for the best?
---
"Small amount of time".
---
As in:
---
Extended period of time, not scheduled to end.
---
Would of been xxxtradope if it was hard-coded for IE6 and 1024x768
---
Did you watch same videos? They said it will LIKELY last first weeks but it could very well last whole phase 1. And that is based on their current assumptions that player numbers will drop fast.
---
there is no NDA ... they can stream and create content all day from the Beta
---
You only do it with the dead servers with fewer than 500 people
---
Nice, thank you for the fast reply!
---
I keep seeing 'Classic Summer' being used but can't recall a press release using the term.
---
Got a link to a blue post or anything where they use it? Would be interesting reading

Every subreddit is an echo chamber.

That makes hopping even easier as you can just split your guild into subguilds on each shard. So if you want to go on shard 3 just get an invite from someone in &lt;GuildNameShardThree&gt;. Guilds already communicate primarily on discord since it's readable on phone, you have a phone don't you?
---
I'm glad they went with this, I won't feel the need to rush to buy them. 
---
I'm the 1%
---
Yeh people here act like its just a minor thing that you have to wait for 10 hours in queue to play the game.
---
I forgot how well geared I was, haha :)  
---
Full T10 and a staff looted on the Lich King.
---
I kinda get it. When I was younger and a leader in my MUDs, stuff like this felt so important and worth the outrage. Nowadays, my life is so much busier with other stuff that games are a feature in my life, not a core component. It's partially time investment and partially age/life priorities.
---
Most Mac users don't like to constantly reboot.  You lose the instant on benefits of Mac, lose all your Chrome tabs, etc.
---
And you think classic wow did not  and will not have min maxing? 
---
Min maxing is one of the main things i love about the game. I want to be effective, i want to have an edge when i can. I have fun doing that. I think you should try to understand that different people have different concepts of fun.
---
How are you planning on doing those exploits? Just pure luck and hoping that your friends are on other layers when they invite you? There won't be a mechanic to switch layer afaik
---
I think this is blown way out of proportion and it'll only really happen by chance
---
Layering = sharding for a single realm, split across multiple servers. It's the exact same thing, just named differently and explained differently, but still does exactly the same as sharding.
---
in the interview with one of the devs he states layering most likely only last for 2 weeks
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8
---
You didn't fix the problem.
---
And what happens to people who have the same names then?
---
A server merge happens once. While it certainly affects community, it doesn't affect gameplay at all.
---
Layering, as long as it is active, introduces new mechanics to the game. Switching layers to find a crafter, switching layers for farming, switching layers to avoid PvP ... leave it to the players to find creative ways to utilize this.
---
And again, what happens after a few weeks are over, but your layer group is still active, maybe because of a popular guild playing there, because of a big streamer, random chance, who knows? I am convinced they'll just leave the layering system running as long as it is needed, instead of removing layering in favour of a login queue or similar.
---
If you took that as arrogance you missed the point of what I was trying to say. That might be my fault for not being more clear.
---
I say play retail because you've made it clear you want a state of vertical progression. That's exactly what retail is, every raid tier and expansion is a progression in power. There's no way around a power creep in retail but that's fine. It's meant to be that way so every expansion is a fresh start.
---
The majority of people who want classic back want just that. There's a reason blizzard is making it as authentic as possible. Having another tier after naxx wouldn't fit that picture at all. Another raid of the same tier as naxx, I can see that as a possibility. 
---
By no means am I a strict "no changes" person. Quality of life changes that don't affect game play or social interaction are welcome on my book. But  causing power creep of a tier after naxx would be too much. In all honesty, I dont think even blizzard expected naxx gear to be so damn powerful compared to prior raids.
---
&gt; Is it possble for a heal priest to enjoy the solo content or do I have to respec all the time for PVP and other stuff?
---
You don't *need* to respec. You can do the content just fine, you'll just be slower at it.
---
Just focusing on farming, certain classes have certain 'spots' and for priests it's DM:E. 
---
There is always going to be a concession at the end of the day. As a priest, I'll be surprised if you ever have trouble finding a group to do anything, but your soloing speed is going to be meh at max level.
---
Hunters are amazing soloers/levelers, but (especially on alliance side) there are more of them so group/raid slots are more competitive and they scale less in group content as the phases release.
---
&gt; I want to play a priest.
---
I think that says it enough right there. Play a priest. I think you'll find that grinding isn't all that bad, you just need to play to the strengths of the priest.
---
Even tourists will play for more than 2 hours. So Westfall and loch will certainly have them.
---
Incorrect.
---
With layering, you're still able to go from Layer 1 to Layer 2 by being invited to a party/raid.
---
It's exactly the same as Sharding, it just involves only 1 realm name, still being several different servers.
---
I got 5 weeks off after launch. So 12+hours for that periode and after that it'll be a few hours a day.
---
I feel like a casual :(
---
Can relate
---
Can I ask how you did this? Trying to find my account from 14 years ago is providing a challenge
---
Is this reply not in defense of layering either? Your thoughts on my character is not relevant to this discussion, I didn't make that reply wanting you to like me. What I want is for classic to be true to the original vanilla but we are moving away from that more and more. I don't think most people wanted layering, that is a bold assumption.
---
Hope everything works out for ya brother.
---
See ya in Azeroth.
---
Stuck between a rock and a hard place. I kind of want to play female Troll because they have beautiful animations and they look amazing in Hunter tier sets, but I'm an avid PvPer so Orc is the natural choice. Female orcs have ugly-ass crossbow animations which is the weapon type I'll be using for the majority of the content. Male orcs have amazing weapon animations all around, but look incredibly ridiculous in tier sets. 
---
What do.
---
My only concern is what happens if more people than they expect stick around? The novelty of a server having 10k+ people wears off kind of quickly if you actually want to do anything
---
&gt; ugly ass-crossbow animations
---
^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)
---
You didn't even mention all the fan art, cosplay posts and silencing of any kind of general criticism.
---
Well supposedly they are prioritizing old accounts.
---
So I’m hoping that my old acct which is active on the classic forums gets a pretty decent chance especially since I have had it subbed for a while this year.
---
Got your priorities straight ma’ man
---
"controlling pet is a pain"? It's a whole layer of gameplay that was stripped away to make the game easier. The best hunters in Classic will be those that can control their pets well.
---
2018 bubblelayer
---
You're right. No matter what, a large part of the community will be upset.
---
Servers crashing? #nochanges purists are happy and everyone else isn't.
---
Sharding? Solo players are happy, everyone else isn't.
---
Layering? Seems like most are happy, and small subsets aren't.
---
There's no winning.
---
World PvP is your most authentic kind of PvP. That’s where the identity of the servers should be kept in tact. Not in battlegrounds. Battlegrounds are almost like an arcade in that of itself. A game within a game. World PvP will always be the most authentic. Cross realm makes sense for BGs.
---
I just don't get how people see this a better solution than sharding just starter zones.
---
The concession on sharding JUST starter zones was that there's massive bottle necks at server launch and that mob and quest item competition sucks for playability. I understand that, I disagree that it's necessary, but it's a valid complaint that has a minor impact on the first 10% or less of the leveling experience.
---
Layering now instead will be a continent wide  shard that you phase in and out of daily/per group/per log session for the majority or entirety of many players' leveling experience. I hate the thought that the classic leveling experience is going to be a massive multi-layered 10k population server where you have little chance of running into the same leveling players day to day. That is exactly what the live leveling experience is, a massive blob of nameless players who fade in and out as you make progress towards your solo goal.
---
I was unhappy but able to accept that we might have to put up with immersion breaking sharding for the first 10 levels. I'm downright disappointed that there are going to be multiple instances of STV on the same server while I'm progressing through that zone and that which layer you are on could be a legitimate advantage on winning something like a gurubashi trinket etc.
---
It is basically sharding renamed.
---
I quit playing shortly after Cata and I've never seen that set before so you must have been doing great.  Haha
---
You know that blizzard couldn't give less of a fuck about the first few weeks? They are planning on supporting this game for decades, and that the top 1% of the most hardcore players will be a little disgruntled for a few weeks at launch is nothing they really would care about, and it makes perfect sense.
---
Make you a priority to be assigned to your previous layer when logged of for only short amount of time with diminishing returns.
---
Relog just to switch layers? Impossible.
---
Log out, wait 5 minutes, log back in, possible, unlikely.
---
Log out, wait an hour, log back in, be assigned to either layer based on the pop caps without prioritizing.
---
I don't recall Blizzard ever putting them back on sale, unless they did with later expansions where nobody wants the CE.
---
Looks good! :D
---
I'm still working, but the kids have (more or less) left the nest, so I'm ready to nerd out in the evenings.
---
The race is where I draw the line for min-maxing. You're going to be staring at this character for thousands of hours.
---
Go with what you want to play. It's not *that* big of a deal at the end of the day.
---
Not only for starter zones. He specifically gave examples of how it would work when travelling between Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, so that proves it.
---
It's a beta. you don't have to pay anything. You can just wait for the full release. 
---
They want beta testers who support World of Warcraft. they take into account how long you've been playing as well and the pool of people invited will be small. It's not a normal beta either.
---
But you're right. No one that plays retail knows how vanilla was like since they all started playing the game yesterday! :)
---
Instead you zone into a premade from a different server
---
So servers with 501 people are screwed?
---
Wanna finish Dark Souls 3 and get Super Mario Maker 2 when released. That's pretty much it.

&gt;Calling Countdown #3 – Retail Reception of WoW Classic w/ Axtel, Taladril &amp; Trabadab – 2:06:05
---
Classic leveling is awful from the POV of most retail players and the people who haven't played an MMO in years are going to be much more harsh. Players used to high M+ and mythic raiding aren't going to find the gameplay engaging and the amount of time to get to max level is going to put off the people who would be engaged in raiding. They've already got social groups  because you can't do hard PVE content without them.
---
So many Classic hyped players seem to be pretty casual as in they only seem to care about leveling. They like slow gameplay but from what I see the retail audience used to high end PVE just aren't going to be interested in that.
---
The second issue is that the slow gameplay and huge amount of downtime in Vanilla exposes that the gameplay is unengaging and the story content is awful. People have played The Witcher 3 now and they know what good story driven games are like. WOW has pretty bad story content today relative to TW3 but they focused on making questing smooth and unchallenging because they can't make the gameplay interesting. So they sped up the questing rhythm and refined the quest patterns but the audiences expectation of production value continuously rises year on year.
---
Overall, the amount of time it takes to get to max level is going to be the biggest inhibitor for many. I'm sure there are many who would enjoy Vanilla raids and the near max level dungeons but the time taken to get to that point is just too much.
---
I know there are plenty here who like leveling in Vanilla and I'm not arguing that they aren't having fun but for a modern audience and certainly for a modern audience that hasn't played an MMO in years the leveling section of Vanilla is total shit and they're never going to get to the parts that they might enjoy. WOW as a gameplay system in PVE only starts to get interesting when you've got groups of players and mobs that have a lot of scripting.
---
 Just look at how much scripting a boss has today with the many abilities and the amount of damage that needs to be avoided as well as the group coordination required. In leveling content however the mob either runs up you to and melees you or stands at a distance and casts a spell. That's just not enough gameplay variety for the hundreds of hours it takes to get to max level and it's still a problem that exists today but they refined the quest structure and speed to reduce the issue.
---
As for RNG in gear. It's an issue but it's less of an issue than people make it out to be because the RNG is titanforging items to be higher item level than the base that content gives normally. The biggest issue actually is that modern players at the high end of PVE have payed a heavy mythic tax in grind. Mythic raiding is expensive. Having to do boring shit like world quests, island expeditions and warfronts a minimum amount per week on 2-3 characters has burned out a lot of high end PVE players who just want to mythic raid and do some mythic+ each week. Ironically, people say that WOW isn't grindy anymore but at the high end it is and people hate it.
---
Possibly around 10am PST. Gives them time to get into the office and push the big red button.
---
Stop spreading false information. Pets were in vanilla. There were not the combat and leveling systems.
---
Me too. The last thing I want to do with the 1- 2 hours a day I have is sit in a queue
---
Yes they said so :)
---
This exactly. People forget the 50 minute queues. The fact that you queue up and get the same premade and everyone basically afks.
---
XRealm bgs were a god send even in vanilla. Running bgs before they were introduced towards the mid/end of vanilla was absolutely horrific.
---
I was dead set on playing a rogue come launch, but the release date made me doubt the choice. This is because I will only have about 10 days after launch to play about 100/120 hours total. After that I start my thesis and will have much less time. Maybe 3 hours in the evenings and more over the weekends. 
---
I won’t be going for maximum speed because I lack knowledge and experience and want to enjoy the process, but I would like to get to lvl 40 in those initial 10 days. Im trying out rogue on a pserver and its pretty slow, still fun though.
---
Would I maybe be better off playing hunter or lock? I really like those classes as well, still prefer rogue but am just worried it will take me ages to get to 60 if i can’t get 2/3rds of the levels out of the way in my 10 days after launch. Any thoughts on this? :)
---
You could very easily make a list that maps all the original vanilla realms to the new realms. The only issue is getting it widespread enough for people to care. 
---
Anyway, as the realms will not be 1:1 anyway, using the original names would only help for the lucky few who actually played on one of the servers they chose to reuse.
---
I assume you haven't  been on 15k players launch experience of some private servers?
---
Update by Blizzard:
---
"We like how the layering feature has worked our and we decided to keep it past phase I".
---
Everything is relative I suppose. Though if you genuinely think potentially ruining the phase 1 endgame economy just so you dont witness a few phasing people during the first hour of game time as it will ruin your immersion (will happen anyway), then you're either woefully ignorant or quite simply selfish.
---
&gt;I need a Countdown app for **android**
---
So just start playing when they turn it off
---
I had decided on playing a Warlock, but all this talk of framing soul-shard for raids is kind of scaring me off. Is it really that annoying? Will I have to farm shards for 20-30mins twice a week? I just don't want to get to 60 and end up hating the soul shard farming.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
You've proven already that you don't know what Layering actually is.
---
I'm not sure if I should play a hunter. It was my first level 60 ever as horde, now I would have to switch to alliance because of my friends. 
---
The main reason why I want to play one is because it's on it's best state right after release because of the shitty gear scaling the further the phases go. I already think about what I can play after the hunter "isn't good" anymore. 
---
Would you play hunter or rather a different class?
---
Already booked a week off from work fuckin get in boyssss!!!!!!!!
---
I hesitated and wanted to take 2, one for wifey, one for me. 400$ for the 2 was way too expensive for me
---
I was in college when wow came out originally. You will make time, believe me
---
Not only that but it sucks for casters, especially since we'll have lower regen rates. I played a mage on a p server a bit and it sucks ass when there's a few people in the area and you got mobs spawning on top of you while you're drinking.
---
Gotta save the money to pay out the ceo
---
Good call, best time to stop.
---
I don't remember people like Redridgelol being that common on Vanilla, I used to play on a PVP server and there was absolutely nothing like what you now get on private servers. All I remember were weekly XR/TM raids and the occasional lvl60 main avenging his alt. People who went hardcore into camping were so rare they became efamous (hello [/u/Angwe](https://www.reddit.com/u/Angwe)).
---
You can go play Retail then, Where everything is predictable and perfect.
---
what the fuck are u talking about? lol
---
We do not know how many people are going to be allowed on a server. For all we know it might be +7-8k which would also not be a real vanilla experience as they could only handle 3-4k back at the time.
---
I am all for No change but this is getting ridiculous. It's only for a few weeks and people are acting as if it's the end of the world.
---
Good news, bad streamer.
---
They mean 29 because the servers will burn
---
Congrats, you fell for the sub lootbox. 
---
You may have wasted your money or not, only time will tell.
---
It's more powerful to use the statement:
---
"And to make it worse, those wolves and boars will respawn once every five minutes".
---
Dynamic respawns are one thing, but it's an abstract term. Respawns every 5 minutes? That's heavy hitting, we all know what that is going to look like.
---
Just contact the customer support through the battlenet page. 
---
I started a chat and all they needed was my old character name and the server (tried it with the account name first but I couldn't remember the right spelling).
---
No, it isn't. And even if you want to reduce it down to that to simplify it, the layers are the size of vanilla servers, not current WoW shards. You aren't going to notice. The image you posted is still what Northshire is going to look like on launch with layering. That's why they're doing it.
---
My vacation ends 18th of august. 2nd september ill be going away for 3 weeks on civil duty....
---
I really wish I didn’t sell my old account before cata came out.
---
how in the world is killing people in wow harassment...
---
Isolated ganks are only affected by targets changing layers to escape if you intend to get a revenge or you expect a gank from someone you've seen. But actual PvP fights (SSvsTM is the stereotypical one) will get harder to get due to layering splitting potential contenders. 
---
Unless you get some kind of appointment outside the actual game (so you can settle a group-raid for it) it'll be hard for them to happen. And even if they do they'll be way less spontaneous than they used to be and there'll be fewer people in them.
---
no
---
Only one upvote to give but this, a thousand times!
---
"It's just the alpha!"
---
"It's just the beta!"
---
"They'll fix it in the next patch!"
---
"They'll fix it in patch 8.1!"
---
"They'll fix it in 8.2!"
---
They'll not only move the goalposts but most of this sub will clap with glee when they do.
---
What? He’s saying if you have the OG vanilla WoW collectors edition you get those items in classic, just like in 2004
---
Same answer I got aswell when I voiced my concern about Activision accquire Blizzard. Its always the same kind of people who defend these changes.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
20 thousand people in a queue isn't a good thing. If you are at the back of that queue you have to wait potentially hours to get in only to be unable to progress at all. Layering is temporary, it is going to allow a shit load of people per layer anyway so the exact thing in your screenshot is possible. You have no fucking clue what you are even talking about tbh.
---
Play for 24 hours go bed next day at 12am, sleep schedule saved .
---
It's not as bad as people make it out to be. You get soul shards doing things you'd be doing anyway, for the most part.
---
Plus, depending on raid makeup, it becomes less annoying...every lock divides the labor even more.
---
Because I’ve moved around in life a lot, so never really got to finish my education and degree on time thus working low wage jobs. I don’t get financial support from anyone but my self.
---
lol, oof.
---
You're right, but then I think about getting zerged by two rogues and it makes me reevaluate my life choices.
---
Bitches about not having info. Doesn’t watch people who had the info.
---
You must really hate the news too? God damn those journalists for getting info first can’t believe the president didn’t tell me directly.
---
Ok guys, all who think you are depressed because you have no family/wife/good job. Listen here - I have a great job with great sallary, I drive a land cruiser, have a wife, two kids, flat, we are healthy but I am depressed same as I was 7 years ago without this.
---
Depression is a tricky thing. Reaching your life goals not gonna help for long. You have to conquer it no matter what illusions you are dreaming to get. 
---
Once you understand it, it will be better. Just freeze a time and live today. Feel the air, warm, food. It helps.
---
Then shard the bottlenecked starting zones like they said, not the entire fuckin continent. By the in people are level 30 there will be enough leaving zone choices and player spread that it will be a non-issue. Plus 3k player layers on even alleviate the gridlock issue. That's still upwards of 700 players per crowded starting zone.
---
as far as I can tell, the argument against layering is "I'd rather have zones be unplayable-y crowded or potentially end up on a dead server than not be able to grief people as effectively for ~3 weeks"
---
Well we agree its not the same, so I'm not sure about the confusion here. Its server merging with better consideration for the future. Aka not pure server merging. I totally agree these are different concepts, and I don't think anybody here was claiming they were.
---
the thing with layering for me is that i just worry about the economy - do you get twice as many spawns if you have 3001 players online, and the last player to log in gets everything to themself?
---
it seems like a sensible solution but they're going to have to fiddle with spawn rates and things now
---
Dont confuse you having a problem with it, with other people having a problem with it.
---
Ill play retail just to even get more exited for classic as the game is not even close to that feel in the current state
---
but your guild is on the same layer.
---
Layering and sharding is the same thing, only numbers change (x players and x zones)
---
If you read the other response, you'd notice that we already clarified that I had assumed that poster was talking about some additional pets. My original comment was only talking about the pets. I don't even know what combat and levelling rewards existed in later expansions?
---
"be grateful" lmao. Can I please give you 10 downvotes?
---
Depends on class but almost always some of your PVP BiS will come from raids.
---
Limit Realms to like 3K and later on merge them together.
---
well at least you didn't play at pleb 1280x1024 5:4
---
^this ^post ^was ^sponsored ^by ^4:3 ^gang
---
&gt; Please stop thinking your so smart
---
I don't? You think that no layering is better than layering and I simple just point out why I disagree with that. It's doesn't matter if you were on your laptop and doing "stress test" or whatever. The game isn't designed for a 12k pop, +20k queue is obviously just really bad and stupid, and these things together will lead to lag and low fps no matter what. I'm not saying that layering is the best solution but if I have to choose between that and endless queues + lag and possible crashes, then it aint really a hard choice.
---
The only one that didn’t have much of a place in a raid back then was moonkin. Depending on how hardcore you want to be, it should be fine up to Naxx.
---
On private servers those bosses have resistance and armour values that are just estimates, alongside boss mechanics that simply don't work as they actually did back in vanilla (As the Nostalrius devs found out after asking Blizzard if their Deep Breath mechanic worked the way it should).
---
There's also plenty of people who haven't touched any of these raid bosses since vanilla. I would say they outweigh people who have experience on private servers, and that the bosses will likely have differences from private servers that make them harder (or easier) in Classic.
---
I disagree, they are both just as bad as the other, dynamically increasing spawn rates means you are unable to turn off the bullshit, layering means you won't notice it unless you intentionally abuse it. Am I incorrect in this assumption?
---
Summer ends 23rd of sept. The school summer holidays are not all of summer.
---
So how do you switch a layer?
---
I played a rogue in vanilla and the number one thing I remember is constantly looking for a tank/healer for dungeons. 
---
As a result I’m considering Druid since they should be able to tank or heal dungeons while levelling but I’m afraid that I’m going to be left out of raids once hitting 60. 
---
I never did much raiding back in the day but it seems Druid isn’t ideal in any role so I’d imagine that raid spots might be competitive for them. I don’t have unlimited time to sink to be an ultimate Druid master  and constantly respec but I can commit to a set schedule and be competent. 
---
I really do want to see the raid content this time around so would it be better to level a class that is less competitive to get a raiding spot for?
---
Am I over thinking this whole thing?
---
Definitely wasn't common, but it legitimately only takes 1 person per server.
---
Well, in that case the game time is not a total waste for you at least.
---
There was no lag but horrible login queue, and in my opinion it was an absolute shit show with so many people and spawn rate was fucking anoying in later parts where not that many people where moby would respawn so fast behind you xD but thats vanilla comunity the complain but dont have soutions
---
I should make one of those for myself xD
---
Its like politics. They try something that sucks, so they rename it and try it again.
---
There will never be a proper vanilla experience in raids, everyone knows what to do and people aren't quite as godawful as they were back then. Fights aren't going to change either, else it won't be Vanilla.
---
Private server raid encounters are off. We don't know by how much, but we know that ability numbers are wrong, armor values are wrong, resistances are wrong-- And skewed easier. 
---
While you're right, if we as experienced players went back to almost any raid from Vanilla to WOTLK we could clear it so much easier with our superior knowledge and skill, you're not factoring in the swaths of players who haven't played vanilla ever. There will be entire guilds who will struggle (Even with videos) to clear MC. This is because they just don't have the experience.
---
Maybe what you should be petitioning is a separate "hardmode" for the people who need it. (Sounds like TBC doesn't it?).
---
But changing the game as a whole because a percentage of enthusiasts have already cleared the content, you could say that about the entire vanilla experience. 
---
We're literally just slapping an 'official' sticker on something that has been out for a decade, you know exactly what you're getting into, and if you want something new and fresh, you're in the wrong place.
---
I just liked the mount more then the armoured one
---
The way I like to look at it is a racial bonus has never made a good player great or a bad player good. If the racial is what keeps you alive at the end of the day, there is something that could have been done differently.
---
That said, I fully agree with you. Every time I get stunned I usually think "THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF I WAS AN ORC." Just a mental thing, and rogues are *literally* the worst people who have ever lived, so they make it worse.
---
3 months is to Long......
---
Vanilla raiding isn't harder in that matter, it's harder in the matter that there is only x amount of things viable for each specific boss.
---
So you wouldn't really bring the wrong setups
---
Yeah, I am not even sure if he actually played on that server if he says that.
---
Because I was unable to get out of the starter zone after 3 hours (On Nost when it was back on with it's huge server).
---
Once I reached STV I pretty much gave up as it was camped 24/7 and you were unable to do anything as there was a red around every corner.
---
It's fine on a Private server as you are not paying anything, but if you are actually paying a subscription then you expect at least some progress instead of staying at level 1 forever.
---
All chat and the AH will be server wide.
---
What about playing a Paly? You can heal in raids, PvP and farm.
---
Nah there was a shortage of the earliest CEs
---
Play your main first so you can get asap the feeling, maybe do some test or route per levelling etc
---
Test some macros 
---
Then try other classes, I would suggest your alt candidate and try it out.
---
Minor QOL changes, Content rollout is better structured &amp; and if you choose the option a graphic overhaul.
---
They don't.
---
It's a god awful "pls validate me" thread format that needs to die.
---
Their plan can change at any time
---
Why bother with retail when you can play a similar experience on a large variety of private servers?
---
While they aren't the same as Vanilla, they're closer than ANYTHING out there (including retail).
---
Yeah seriously increasing spawns to match population size would be better imo. Using The same shard with increased spawns for everyone certainly has it’s downfalls but imo it is infinitely more preferable than literally not even seeing the people on your server.
---
Look, it's yet another single player gamer who would "not be affected" if everyone  else used glider and cheats to one shot KT.
---
3k is not nearly as bad. Roll a nelf or a tauren for relatively easy starting zone experience, then outlevel 90% of people just by knowing the game and not fucking about. Pretty smooth. With 12k+ people on Nostalrius it was unplayable, having to fight for every single spawn even when dynamic.
---
So what? This is a great way to build stable server communities without all the cross-realm stuff. 
---
* Only a cursory interest in playing? Will quit immediately upon seeing 'unplayable' zones. Tourist problem mitigated significantly.
---
* Feels like wasting your time camping mob spawns for hours? Try again tomorrow, or late at night, or in two weeks. Naturally spreads people out.
---
I have no idea why everyone should be able to level (relatively) competition-free right off the bat on launch day. Either fight your way through it, or wait until the early traffic jam has dissipated a bit.
---
Blizzard is taking the cautious approach as opposed to yours that's based on something you pulled out of your ass.
---
If "bro tourists" leave after Elwynn, then layering will merge what's left into as few compact servers as possible. There's literally no issue to this except ones you make up from lack of understanding of this technology.
---
I would argue that first 10% is the most important for truly new players, there will be people playing this for the first time and if they have a terrible first impression they are unlikely to stick around.
---
I know this has probably been addressed a thousand times. But can someone explain to me why I need to pay top dollar via full game subscription in order to play a 15 year old game? Don't tell me that I can play the retail version to. For the love of god do not say that.
---
Except it doesn't because sharding dynamically shifts players between various instances constantly even during play, layering puts you on one shard and leaves you there until you log out or accept an invite from someone on a different shard than you. It's much less intrusive. The alternative is having *massive* queues or having to merge servers later and have tons of guild name, character name etc conflicts and also people getting salty because their server got merged.
---
Yeah I know, Mate I was super excited for classic wow and this means I wont be able to play at all, That plus it was like 3am.
---
Im in a panic beacsue this means I wont be able to play classic as I wont enjoy it. Its just annoying after being told warts and all they take off all the warts. I loved the warts.
---
This has been said before but I really hope this doesn't affect Oceanic servers too much. We're very likely to have a small amount of realms. I can grudgingly accept lower queue times for a loss of server identity, although playing cross-realm US servers with 300ish ping again, that's not an experience I'd like to go back to.
---
Well, im sure they can limit the spawns to have exact same number of spawns up with or without extra layers.
---
Like black rotus, spawn ever 20 mins, 5000 ppl on. It will first roll weighted roll on how many people per layer on WHAT layer it will spawn and then where it will spawn.
---
Did they need any other info? I can remember 3 of my old characters (on an acount I sold) but I have no idea about the email or stuff like that.
---
Building a huge computer desk, like with my hands.  I'm in over my head but I got 100 days to figure it out.
---
you could clear everything raid apart from naxx with every dps being a meme spec.
---
you could also watch stuff or play another game on your 2nd monitor.
---
Maybe someone reads this but I just want cluster side minimized. Cross server BGs were one of the worst changes in the game to me, but at the time I played on the underpopulated faction. I don't give two shits about the people who want to play by themselves and avoid "premades" but hour long queues are an issue. Finding two servers that are unbalanced in similar ways and having a two server group though could fix that problem and keep the community small enough to matter. Not seeing opponents in the world is a bit of a problem but not seeing anyone frequently enough to get a rivalry is a huge issue. And even in 2005 we used forums to build the best rivalries.
---
It’s going to be layers of the same realm...if you pick realm A when the game launches, there will be multiple layers of realm A up to like 3000 people. As the population dwindles, those layers of realm A will be merged together to keep you on the same realm with the remaining same people you were playing with all along. Realm A and B or C all the way to fucking Z won’t be merged.
---
The realms won’t be merged together, the layers of them will.
---
Sure except they fill up an entire layer before moving to the next.
---
It's not bad if you enjoy doing the campaign quests.  I didn't mind doing Zandalari because most of it was done as I levelled from legion. Doing the unlock on both factions (Kul'Tiras &amp; Zandalari) was a bit much though, I haven't played the game since I unlocked Kul'Tirans because I burnt myself out.
---
judging by the last beta videos id say private servers are more closer to vanilla than classic tbh, all that bfa mob IA with weird shit doesnt seem like vanilla at all
---
Hi, /u/Finally_Vanilla
---
Show me where the big bad gambler touched you.
---
What I want and what I think are realistic/good for the game are two different things.
---
1. I would like content made in the vanilla way. Doesnt have to be past nax, could also be horizontal woth it or a new instance to lvl 30s for example. Now do I trust that we would get that in the real world? Sadly no...
---
2. Tbc or wotlk servers? Again I like the idea but am afraid of the community splitting.
---
3. Fresh vanilla servers? Well sure and these are very likely to be happening. Problem is if its just the same old again and again, why would you pay for it? There are pservers and their quality can skyrocket now that blizz brings the real experience for all to see.
---
4. Fresh servers with more functions? Example fresh vanilla server with original talent trees and patch cycles? Could work as a new thing and also classic?
---
5. Osrs path? Again cant trust it outside the ideal world but having classic and these servers could work? Problem community split.
---
Oh my bad (and As I read my message again, it’s quite aggressive, sorry about that).
---
Yep in an extension around ...mop maybe? You could train your bet to fight other pets, Pokemon style.
---
Choosing for the pet is one of the hardest decision to take
---
I´m gonna level a rogue when classic comes, but I´m still deciding on what race... Humans for their racials or dwarfs for the luls, and a tiny bit for their racials ofc. The min-maxing can´t be *that* important, right? 
---
Either way; My main will be a rogue.
---
if your willing to heal dont sweat it, youll get a spot
---
its true druids have less spots in a raid htan other heals tho
---
It shows you're able to level fast to 60 and grind out 1k gold. That's is effort if I ever seen one. AQ mount is also time gated so drop that one also ?
---
For me it's more for the looks and I prefer raptor over other horde mounts. They feel smoother.
---
You can play the retail version too
---

---
Got mine. Although mine is NA
---
jesus
---
yes you'll have to, but if you can't afford 20-30 mins farming twice a week you're gonna struggle getting consumables anyway
---
ahh it burns! :D Seriously though, they so greedy over at blizzard. But we do what we must.
---
Even so, still not even a whole month. In what world does that constitute a classic summer?
---
any guys from Fire of DUNE?  
---
Sorry guys, waiting for vanilla to hate you again.
---
why try to rush it anyway? classic isn't going anywhere this time, you have all the time in the world.
---
Well if they are true to their word then it should be turned off by the time raids on org start appearing.
---
I mean, it's also temporary and will be a non-issue later. So while not ideal, it's certainly better than the alternative of the game being basically unplayable for the first month. That being said though, it's not like a server's identity is going to settle quickly anyways, and even though the servers are sharded, they aren't split between different servers. My point being that everyone that picks server A will remain on server A with everyone else from server A. So when layering is removed later on all of those people are still together.
---
Your guild can be multiple guilds on different layers in game or in no guild at all. They are on same discord. If there is benefit to doing that, and it looks like it, people will do it.
---
In another thread people were praising post-Naxx content if it was handled correctly, now we're shitting on it?
---
This sub is so fucking stupid.
---
Can’t wait to play with my friends - past and future! 
---
Shout out to everyone who voiced their opinions on wanting Classic all these years. You made it happen :)
---
You'll only know if you're on a different layer than someone if you try to meet up. And even then there will only be like 3, maybe 4 layers and only on the most populated servers.
---
&gt;Its just as usual, people complain for the sake of complaining
---
I was downvoted for suggesting that if you just play the game without thinking about the layers, you probably won't even notice it. 
---
I don't know what people want any more. 
---
They seem to be so focused on the absolutely worst possible scenario that they don't consider that it could work just fine if you just play the game as you did 15 years ago without thinking about how it works on the backend.
---
I hope to get maybe a 3-4 day weekend around classic release and then play 2-4 hours a day after that with days off from time to time.
---
Should reach 60 in a month or so.
---
There will be a correspondingly larger amount of players to consume those resources as well. It won't be perfect, but I also don't think it will be as game breaking as some people claim.
---
No it isn’t. It’s lazy. All the private servers that had awful population overages didn’t randomly or magically die because they were too populated. Nobody is quitting a game because it is TOO popular. Why everyone acts like these servers will be a ghost town if we don’t shard is fucking nonsense. The only thing that will cause a situation like that is them opening fresh servers or them opening wayyy too many servers at the start.
---
Haha don't tell them you sold your account or they'll ban it for sure. 
---
Nope, character name and the server was all they needed. Just give it a shot, you've got nothing to lose :-)
---
They’re hard countered by rogues, Warriors and Hunters until you get some gear and become tanky.
---
24 hours first day + 14-16 hours a day the days after.
---
Got 3 weeks off work after launch, so I’ll finish the leveling process and some gearing before I have to go casual again. Goal is to get at learn some part of preraid BiS, find a raiding guild and then go back to max. 2-3 hours of play every day after work.
---
Judging by the rage comic in the bottom I'm guessing this pic is about 8 years old, how did you know about the release date of classic in 2011?
---
I would never put in anything time limited, including the AQ mount if I were to design the game. But I didn't. :) I still strongly dislike anything time gated in any way. (Limited time, dailies or timed.)
---
Easiest way to say it, play what you enjoy. Leveling will take a long time with every class you pick. 
---
Be sure to have a goal so you have something to look forward to else the leveling will be even more of a struggle and you might make a new char.
---
I’m deleting PS from my laptop for a start. Always got 100’s of other games to play.
---
So you are telling me, that classic wow will be shit because you get your pony with a little bit of armor?
---
Wait are people really subbing to play the beta for classic?
---
You can safely refer to BFA system requirements for that.
---
I remember back in vanilla we set up buffs just the horde competitor guild hasn‘t got the buffs up for their raid 😄 they returned the favor
---
Harder hopefully
---
I know, you’re right, but I would still like to get as far as I can in my initial push. With rogue being pretty slow early on especially, I’m just considering other classes that may give me a smoother ride through azeroth.
---
nice
---
Okay, this is bad news. Blizzard just came up with a new name of the old solution instead of new solution. All the talk about preserving authenticity and than this.
---
What did they do good is how they presented this shit of a solution. Giving portions of information in an interview to streamers casually and not focusing on this gentle topic, given Blizzard monitors and understand how big is the influence of those streams. So they are so grateful being invited to Blizzard that they surely won't criticize it. Just look how positively Tips nods as Hight says there will be layering.
---
I leveled each class on PS recently to 20 and Rogue was by far the slowest and most painful.
---
I'm torn between a few classes. I eventually might level them all, but have a hard time deciding the first.
---
I don't have the time I had back in the days. I'm looking forward to pvp the most, but I know I have to raid in order to get some if not most gear to pvp. My main goal over all is to pvp with my friend which is a rogue. We will do everything from wpvp to BG's
---
In no particular order:
---
Mage: the utility in raids and in generel I love that. Used to played mage in tbc up to mop. I know the class just not in vanilla. Also everybody plays mage. Lots of gear to fight for.
---
Druid: while I know they might not be the best, they would be a good addition to wpvp with a rogue. And especially in wsg. I dislike to tank or heal in dungeons aaand im pretty much forced to do one of those if I want to to dungeons. They also look fun in pvp, even though they don't have the highest kill potential.
---
Rogue: my very first character was a human rogue which I got to lvl 58 right when tbc released. Im just afraid they're too hard to play.  
---
Warlock: nothing to add besides I've always wanted to level one, lul. Easy to level. I
---
12h a day would put you way ahead of the masses, especially if you start right when servers open
---
&gt;"avoid nesingwary on layers 1/3/7 theres lots of horde, layers 2/4/5/6 are safe"
---
Wow you have a lot of faith in Blizzard if you can envision them running a server with 21k players (3k players / layer, and 7 layers).
---
I tried to recover my account that i got from a friend that quit after a few days playing it. I needed ID papers so i couldn't recover it :(
---
As much as my work schedule allows me. Probably 2-3 hours during workdays, 10-11 hours during weekends.
---
The reason rag took that long to die was because it considered people having to level up to 60 in the first place just to get to him
---
one would hope ;) but this is blizz-activision we're talking about
---
Warlock: nothing to add besides I've always wanted to level one, lul. Easy to level.
---
Indeed. Which is why they should have pop caps and queues if the pop caps are exceeded.
---
You forgot Firing resistant gear
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-update/113138  
---
It's the last sentence in the post.
---
Have they said what will happen if you get just over 1 layers worth of players on a server? I saw some guy use the analogy of glasses of water as a comparison - so when one glass fills they start filling the next. 
---
So if you have a server with 3025 players online, would this mean one layer of 3000 players and another of 25? Surely it makes more sense to have 2 or 3 "glasses" being filled simultaneously and ensure they're equally full...
---
Making baseless assumptions (which are laughably incorrect btw) isn't a great way to support your argument.
---
just play a hunter bro
---
hunters are required in every raid regradless of how much dps they do
---
they are also very useful in pvp in a number of different ways
---
It’s got a rag statue....classic is releasing soon. It’s definitely geared towards classic wow.
---
wdym its 3k people per layer tho
---
I'm a simple man: I see "Unpopular opinion" - I downvote.
---
Private server are not accurate.
---
because the layers will be removed until there is only 1 layer, bg's don't come out till phase 3 and layers are being removed in phase 1 they don't overlap at all.
---
It is completely different from sharding, read about it before posting.
---
Gather all the data you want, we don’t make the same mistake twice.  Blessing of Kings is nice, but we can easily beat the game without adverse disadvantages such as server imbalance... min-max right ?
---
Also what the fuck is a lane for people to kill world bosses lol PVP&gt;PVE shame on you.
---
I would also appreciate some official requirements from blizzard. Haven’t bought a pc in 10 years, I’m assuming I wouldn’t have to spend much to play classic and decent graphical settings?
---
youre thinking 10 days vs years of content my dude, it's overthinking
---
No one knows.
---
Same, but where i live uni classes are worthless, u learn much better by urself and you can skip as many as you like, so lucky me haha
---
That looks terrible to play on
---
As a holy paladin I had 2 sets 1 plate for pvp and then my pve set and it all mostly came from raids. But as the pvp blues are 1.12 stats they are really strong and will be good for both
---
Battlegroups are fine, people were still notorious, it's when it became anyone vs anyone that it got diluted.
---
See ya! :)
---
I had to look this up and yes there was, in fact, what they called LFG/LFM interface (certainly not "Dungeon Finder" nor LFD).
---
I had over 100 days /played on TBC across a couple characters and for the most part I was the one forming groups for 5-man dungeon content and I can tell you I've never used that, nor did anyone I knew. From what I remember, it was an abandoned feature no one even acknowledged.
---
Groups were formed, for the majority of it, through:
---
1) /3 Looking for Group chat;
---
2) Guildies;
---
3) My personal favorite: typing "warrior 18-24" in /who interface and spam whisper everyone with "hey wanna come tank DM? last spot"
---
If you wanna be technically correct about it, be my fucking guest, but  "Dungeon finder was added in WotLK" is not a lie.
---
The difference is:
---
•Updated Talents for every class
---
•Nerfed Raids
---
•Updated Gear.
---
•Updated Class Abilities.
---
This is 1.12, MC, Ony, BWL, ZG, AQ20 and AQ40 are not meant to be a challenge on this patch. This is the patch balanced around Naxx.
---
But, but, but... layers!
---
Why not a mobile version for the phones too, they can handle it.
---
They didn't say that. You seem to be intentionally oblivious to the things they are actually saying.
---
What monitor is that?
---
Just recreating it straight up is dumb, and you #NOCHANGES REEE players are an extreme minority.
---
They dont cater to dumb minorities
---
Work all day, have like an hour after cutting the grass and hanging out with the kids to get in some BG's, sit in org for 30 mins, leave before either team can win because you have to go to bed. 
---
I don't think 30 min que times are acceptable.
---
Yes but then make them actually gone, as in, dispells on entering a raid.
---
If you make it a cooldown, you just make it more annoying to get.
---
FYI, people already spend more than 48 hours to prepare for those kind of raids, rolling DMF to perfection, etc. 8 hour cooldowns is nothing, won't stop anyone that's dedicated.
---
I'm 100% cool without world buffs, but don't go this in-between route.
---
Too far left to right you're at a disadvantage
---
lol I hope to get some addons to move frames at some point
---
With layers organized players can control which layer they play on and when they change layers.
---
With sharding the same thing happens but randomly and not in a player controlled way.
---
guessing he's a student, where i live we get 2 months and half summer vacation in university.
---
Yeah I would like to see them "layer" BGs tries to pull from your server first, if it can't it opens up to the next server then another but always in the same order, means more often than not you would be playing against the same 1-3 servers, with occasionally getting a new face.
---
Samsung CHG90
---
Why
---
There are three scheduled stress test weekends. Its not just a "small beta"
---
brb, turning around to check buffs
---
Bartender4 lets you move any and all frames and remove blizzard UI
---
Unless you're going to play retail wow, its probably a waste.
---
Honestly I'd spend $15 bucks to try out BfA despite all the negative things I've heard, but the $50 for the expansion is big enough to keep me from it.
---
keyword here is "accidentally" :P
---
&gt; We're not assuming that. If there is 4 layers you can get 4 opportunities to get black lotus from the zone whereas normally you would get only 1. So if in vanilla you got 2 black lotus per day you can now expect to get 8, because 4 layers give 4x more opportunities to get it.
---
Actually think about this statement for a minute. You are somehow acting under the assumption that you are alone in this world.
---
Say that there are currently 3 layers active, that also means there are 3x players. You will not be the only one looking for black lotuses, there will be on average 3x as many people. so you will NOT end up with 3x as many lotuses, in fact you might end up with less because someone on another layer is thinking the same thing and actually gets to your layer first.
---
You can’t play any game that you didn’t play at time of release it’s the law.
---
Just make sure to tick the Classic box on beta preferences.
---
I can't wait for POMO WoW.
---
Casual players are the ones that like playing specs that are bad at raiding. Playing with an added handicap when you are already putting in minimum effort will just result in wipes or loot drama. So if that ENHANcement shaman is really your freind he will realize his dps is bad and he is holding you guys back. 
---
Simply playing your class/spec perfectly is not enough in Classic, you will want to optimize your talents, gear, prepare your potions and tactics if you want to clear current raid tier. Even MC+Ony is hard when you havnt done it for a decade.
---
The point is that something like that is so dumb to be made trivial.
---
There's plenty out there, you just might not like it
---
They did this to help control the population come launch. TBH and I'm sure this will get down-votes, I'm glad I won't have to deal with kids at launch except in the evening.
---
Yes, dont know if u stay on the same layer when u leave group but if u wanna Quest together ofc u can do it
---
Weeks of exploiting or a shitty launch day? Also it's also stated to last for whole of phase1, which is definitely not couple weeks or someone is lying.
---
Depends what "not much" means. Check whatever is recommended for BFA, but I assume a mid-range PC build is around $700. Should be enough for 1080p60 gaming.
---
It's been a real struggle to choose which class to play... Playing since the start of Wotlk and my main was always a warrior. 
---
Will probably pick warrior again for Classic (dps) but my main concerns are I'm not that an altaholic and don't know how viable warrior is for farming gold and materials for raiding and PvP. Second thing is that seems like there isn't a viable dps spec to use for both PvE and PvP and respecing every couple of days could be out of my reach.
---
My other option is Warlock. As much as I'm informed, Warlock performs well both at PvE and PvP and you can do both with one specialization. Leveling would be a breeze, compared to Warrior and seems like the only struggle would be farming shards, but really don't mind it that much.
---
I'm really stuck between those two classes... Warrior is my main since I play this game, but Warlock seems better to enjoy the game.
---
Will be really thankful, if you guys can give me some advice, what to expect from those two.
---
Thank you and have a nice day!
---
You think you do but you don't.
---
What did you expect? Recreating Classic is clearly a huge undertaking, should they just do it free of charge? It's already kind of generous that we don't need to buy anything to play. The only questionable thing is the need to have a subscription in order to get into the beta, but in the grand scheme of things, that really doesn't matter.
---
The alternative to a subscription is microtransactions. Nobody wants that in Classic. It's not "a 15 year old game," it's something that no longer exists but is being brought back due to popular demand. 
---
Why do you have to pay money for a used car? Because it's something that's being sold to you by someone who makes a living doing that. You're welcome to try to look for a free car (i.e. private server), but you're unlikely to get something as good.
---
Are you talking about the bug that you can summon people into an instance when they're in the world? If so that is a bug, you can check tbc patch notes
---
The equivalent of one baked potato
---
Sorry, my mistake.
---
Have you ever played a wow release before??? You have to be a fucking moron to not understand and be complaining about this
---
Vanilla raiding isn't very difficult in terms of the actual fights or mechanics imo. The progression takes forever because you don't get much loot and you need to gear up 40 people. 
---
So yeah you can bring ret pallys or enhancement shammys, but I guess most peoples thought process would be "but there is a Combat Rogue right there ready to go, so why would I pick the scuffed raider?".
---
Thanks for the good laugh :)
---
good goyim
---
I agree that they are most probably wrong but i remember veterans aggreing that most raids were skewed to be harder on most servers... We'll see
---
If you wasted your money, I wasted mine too.  I unsubbed in October because BfA was just utter disappointment.  I would like to think that the algorithm for distributing keys is a little more nuanced than "Does this person have a sub or not".  I feel like if they have a bnet account that's over 15 years old, with every WoW xpac, multiple server transfers, race changes, and token purchases, it would take precedent over "Lol did this idiot really just sub to get into the beta?"
---
The raid encounters are off because the bosses are way overtuned. They have stupid amounts of armor to curb the melee dps and they use their abilities far too often. It’s safe to say that Classic raiding will be significantly easier and this is a worry.
---
Bubble hearth FTW good job a my good sir
---
haha yeah, if it gets to be too much I have a ROG Swift PG258Q, then i can center and just mount this one higher.
---
Layers are just shards.
---
np m8
---
It’s gorgeous mate. I have the 32” curved one and I can’t wait to explore Azeroth through it.
---
Man I love that dude, He has so much dedication and passion for this project it just erediates from him.
---
Why not? They already allow people to shard together from whatever server, and that means everything is on one (or technically, few) big servers already and only shards (lul layers) are actual servers handling interactions.
---
Naxx is also cleared within 3 hours of release even though the game is balanced around it.
---
This is a great idea.
---
It was a comparison. An apt comparison.
---
I don't want BC or Wrath servers, I want Vanilla.
---
Classic+ would be great if handled correctly. There's a bunch of unreleased content that Blizzard begun cooking up before they decided to create BC instead. I think polishing that off, making sure it fits Vanilla's design philosophies and releasing it post-Naxx would really serve to keep the community alive.
---
I don't see the Classic community staying even remotely alive longterm with the release of a BC or Wrath server, the community would fragment into pieces - Vanilla's already such a niche game already, BC and Wrath would be a niche within a niche.
---
With layering, you'll still be on the same server you chose when they eventually merge.         
---
If they went with just more servers, then you'd randomly get assigned to whatever servers needed merging.
---
To everyone frothing at the mouth, do us all a favor and stick to your private server. Your asinine behaviour is unwanted.
---
it won't be limited at all, artificial scarcity is just to pump up demand
---
Classic population as a whole will drop quickly yes. That doesn't mean every server will drop population uniformly. They are completly different things. Some servers can have 100% tourists and some servers can have 80% of long term players. When population drops the former will be empty and the latter overpopulated, nothing in this system prevents that?
---
Also why act like that first 10% of leveling has to be Hitler aids on launch for everyone lol
---
They’d all work well. you guys could do good with low gear apart from lock which needs more gear to do well than the others but if you have a rogue stunlocking and peeling you it should be gucci 
---
Forget what the levelling is like on each class once you’re 60 that’s it
---
For pvp think mechanically what class you could bg all day and not get bored 🤠
---
So if im in layer one and my friend is in layer two we can see eachother? No we cant, I think you need to look up how layering works.
---
So phasing?
---
Heirlooms, mounts and gold available through the shop will make leveling much easier this time round though.
---
r/wow is an echo chamber just like r/classicwow is, the difference is that you agree with the opinions here. 
---
prove me wrong
---
Guarantee they'll bring it back for the AQ gates opening...
---
Awesome. Thanks for the reply i appreciate the help : D
---
I still say that I rather not see them go up to TBC-WOTLK altho both expansions are fine. I rather see them upgrade the old world, kind of like OSRS is doing there thing.
---
dude, just roll your hunter. i'm doing the same. hunters are so much god damn fun, and hunters will always be viable for raids. You might not top the meters, but with a good understanding of your rotation and how to efficiently dps, you will do just fine. 
---
Hunters are even required for most raids with their tranq and ability to kite certain mobs. 
---
Don't sweat it, roll a hunter
---
Vanilla servers were 2500, chicko.
---
Great fun, Might not be able to quest in the first few days but who cares? Im not in it for the rush to be server first 60, Im in it for the people and the world a world and people that have split up.
---
Hunters are pretty good at grinding and have virtually no down time. 
---
Mages have https://youtu.be/fGyF-wV-IFo  outstanding aoe farming potential with their blizzard frost spec.  On the downside their single target dps rotation consists of frost bolt, and a few ways to get mana back when needed so it may be boring to you. As mages get more and more geared they get closer to the top of the dps charts.
---
Fire can also do great damage outside of the first major raid molten core. A lot of the bosses in MC have fire resistance. If I'm not mistaken the final bosss is immune to fire damage. 
---
Druids are are okay at healing but have things preventing them from being best like having their only rez (can be used in combat) being on a 30 min cd. Their healing spells can be great but only if other healers don't heal it first.
---
Dps wise balance druids don't do good damage in pve. 
---
Feral druids do okay damage if they use wolfshead helm (gnomeregan) and know how to "powershift"
---
Feral druids also make good tanks (still 2nd to warriors).
---
STFU 
---
STFU
---
You want to pvp and join a hardcore guild as a balance druid? I think you should read up more on vanilla.
---
It was pretty much known it would be holday 2018 for smash. 
---
WoW Classic is a fall release. The problem with a mmo is most want to put in a bunch of time at launch. Alot of people cant do that in the fall. 
---
In the summer, you can sink a ton of hours upfront, play in free time the rest of the year. As soon as you go to sleep youve already lost. (Not truely, but it feels that way) 
---
Ultimately, this doesnt effect me as im no longer in school or a teacher. But my buddy is, so not sure we will even play till hes done with his doctorate come winter. Atlease with classic wow your not realy too far behind ever.
---
I just understand why people kinda bumned out. When you anounce a summer date, then people expect to play it in the summer.
---
But the only worse thing you can do now is change the date, youd fuck ppl who took work off. Nothin pisses me off more then when a company changes a release date.
---
I've been stuck on the same two for a while now. Love tanking, tanked pally up to cata, druid to mop, monk after that. No one in my group wants to tank either. I would hate to roll a dps just to sit around at 60 waiting for tanks.
---
But warlocks are so damn cool, and a joy to play
---
Private server world buff meta won't exist in classic
---
They said it will launch during summer, It is launching during summer.
---
Sure the nostalgia will fade. But what we will be left with is a playable version of WoW (the best MMO ever created). 
---
All my other favourite games I can easily replay, but WoW has changed so much that it is no longer recognisable. I'll just be happy to have a way to go back.
---
actually was looking at that one before I got this. my curiosity got the best of me
---
There definitely were people that did things like this on my server. Maybe not as extreme, but I remember a few of their names and where they'd be camping until this day.
---
He said proper
---
Because it absolutely will be, launches are usually an absolute shitshow. If you have been on any Pserver launch in the last few years you will know exactly what I am talking about.
---
You are right, didnt think about it, but do you think more people will clear it quickly or a bit more than 2006?
---
In my opinion, orc female hunters look gnarly. And for some reason, people who pick orc female always seem to be good at the game
---
That just means all players will end up in the same layer per server, but that doesn't change that the population caps are larger?  So why start off assuming there'll be low-pop servers come phase three?
---
pservers have been opening and merging servers constantly with 0 problems or outrage.
---
but blizzard needs sharding right here and now to solve this incredibly complex problem of imaginary dead realms 1 year later.
---
player experience IS NOT the reason why they shard. their modern backend (which can not handle large scale player interactions) is the problem and the reason why they introduce sharding.
---
Its like people like you are deliberately misunderstanding what is said. He said it will only be used in phase 1, and ONLY if there are too many people for a single "layer" to handle. He even specified that a layer is going to be a size of an optimal server size(probably 3-4k)
---
If for example you are playing on a server that loses most of the players on the first day, and you are left with only around 3k people playing. That means you would be playing from that point on as if layering didnt exist. It will be just a normal server, with a normal population of people.
---
I don't know if not having a mafia would be "ruined" per se...
---
That still requires me to hit the mob first when hunters and other ranged abilities will get there first.
---
It’s not a massive deal to be fair it’s just something very frustrating when you are waiting for mobs to respawn and keep missing them. I will be grouping up as much as possible for classic :)
---
Unless you know like, people join groups... That didn't happen in Vanilla right?
---
In your place, I'd definitely roll tank, since you have a group and tanks, especially warrior ones would always be welcomed!
---
Idk they're worthless who needs em anyways
---
Already joined a top tier guild you better get in fast :)
---
Hey guys, i want to Play Warrior.   
---
Tank Dungeons etc. , but mainly DPS in the Raids.  
---
Can you tank Dungeons with the Fury specc?   
---
For PvP it would be Arms, right?   
---
My question: How bad will it be in terms of respec Costs? Or should I just Focus on one spec?  
---
How hard is it to make those extra \~100 Gold only to respec?
---
How dare you presume my ideas.
---
booked the week off, 18 hours a day for 6 days tues-sun, should get to 50 i hope.
---
Dont worry xD After first week of Classic when people hit their 30+ numbers will go lower and we will hear how hard is to level up and how not fair is that xD
---
Yea player dissapearing.
---
layering = player dissapearing
---
sharding = player dissapearing
---
phasing = player dissapearing
---
I think logistically speaking it’s difficult to merge servers. This is why they opted for the layering system as the next best thing.
---
Yes, layering is basically a premediated server merge, to avoid naming conflicts etc from the get-go.
---
With the huge difference that you'll be able to switch (presumably) freely between the layers. This is in essence cross-realm characters. 
---
I have no idea why they didn't just set up the servers in groups or pools instead, with shared name lists, so they could be merged easily when the need arises.
---
You kill boars in the forest.
---
Playing the game in first person mode is more impressive than the monitor
---
I cant wait for beta. If they are introducing sharding I am extremely sceptical or what other changes await us. Remember that they are recreating game using modern tech.
---
Warrior is probably the best class for farming lol. You can pretty readily tank 5 mans as fury so that isn’t an issue. Also you’ll be one of the fastest mob farmers in game. Survivability is lower but just stock up on bandages and food and you’re good. Their pre-bis is a little more expensive but the challenge is what makes the game worth playing! You should go warrior.
---
Your counter to their concerns is 2-3 not 5? Really?
---
Hunter is the best class for a noob period.
---
Those are gonna be in classic. Idk about mounts but the cost of a mount wasn't the issue, training was expensive. Cash tokens aren't in classic and heirlooms definitely won't.
---
I resubbed only for a chance of beta... 
---
I feel foolish
---
&gt; Post is getting downvoted for some reason. This sub's community really is something.     
---
Because the topic is posted several times a day in different flavors.
---
The day they start adding or removing content to classic is the day i quit the game.       
---
That  said, if they release a separate game completely, i wouldn't play it but i'd be perfectly okay with it.
---
I'm the same with different expansions as well, i'd like to play them, but only as they were, not with or without stuff.       
---
I'm here for something i know and love, not something ambiguous that may or may not be good.
---
You're going to end up hating the entire soundtrack. I ruined a couple of songs like that.
---
they did not develop anything. its literally the same sharding just maybe with adjusted parameters on when to do it.
---
Outstanding move
---
Could you come with an example? So far this is nothing but an insult for no reason. Where do you think these people are wrong?
---
We have the most free time of probably anyone except for unemplyed people, except during exam weeks. Atleast where i'm from we dont need to attend classes so you can just skip them all.
---
Wrong. If you can get 2 black lotuses while competing with 3k people you will get 8 black lotuses while competing with 12k people.
---
i cant decide between a massive widescreen like that or 2x 27inch monitors
---
First off I am biased because I'm playing Warrior and Warlock just so happens to be my least favorite class, but I'll try to give you some insight into why Warrior isn't as much as a struggle as you think. Farming gold is going to be a non-issue, you can always make decent gold with a gathering profession (I'd recommend Herbalism / Engy as your two professions); then, once phase 2 is released you'll be able to do Dire Maul East jump runs which you'll be able to do with a healer for a steady income of gold. As for specs/respecing, when pvp ranking is in the game a lot of guilds will raid monday and tuesday and then take a 13 day break from raiding for pvp, beyond that if you're truly struggling for gold you can do just fine as fury if you have the support of a group which will be necessary in phase 2 world pvp. Hope that helps!
---
yeah because making new servers as needed is really fucking complex
---
10-12 hours per day till 60 at least. After dat I’ll slow down and work on my pre-bis &amp; attunements. And once you get in the raid scene you’ll start raid logging sooner than you think.
---
heads are on a flat cd. so unless you are on a sh\_tty server as the only guild of your faction that can down nefarian there is no guarantee for it
---
felwood flowers become un-interactable after 5 uses.
---
DM buffs are minor compared to dragon slayer and the serenade. 3% spell crit 200 melee atp and 15% stam
---
pservers allow players to stack armor penetration debuffs fully ignoring 1.3's and 1.8's balancing changes regarding those.
---
Armor and resistances are made up by guesswork due to a lack of data.
---
Their threat calculation is completely off (giving birth to the p-server fury deathwish dual wield tanking) while classic had tanks - without thunderfury - holding against 1,3 and 1,4k dps on patchwork and the respective equivalent on thaddius
---
the list goes on
---
Yeah who cares right lol. Bunch of nerds getting mad over nothing
---
They have 6.3k people actually on their subreddit. We have 4.3k. A lot of their subs are people who no longer visit, but it doesn't really matter, I don't really care about whether retail is popular or not, I just want Classic and to have fun.
---
In America, summer is when you can grow food in the midwest. August is not that.
---
What do you think about doing both PvE and PvP with a single spec? Do you think there is any viable one out there? :D
---
That might be nice honestly. If I was taking two weeks, I wouldn't mind a break for a day of work. Then get excited for my next week off.
---
More servers you add, more of them are going to eventually die and have to be merged. Its PAIN in the ass for everyone, for blizzard, for the playerbase on both servers you merge. It can result in horrible faction balances, you loose your char names etc.
---
Thats why you start bit larger, when ppl quit you will result in what you want.
---
I don’t agree with this as some mobs didn’t even have spells , all the quests gave almost double the xp and the list goes on.
---
APES
---
Blizz could publish these officially so I wouldnt have to watch 20 minutes of "SUBRAIB TO MUH CHANNEL BOIS" bullshit to get the pieces out...
---
Yes. You guys are just pathetic. Please dont play classic, stay away from me.
---
It still gives the debuff. Best pet there is.
---
how often we say these things i feel whoever engage in wow classic will know what to expect :D
---
Im glad im not the only one. Hope i get beta access or i feel like they dont care about how many years and how much money i have actually spent on this game since release.
---
Same as it is right now - not a lot, sadly. When it was first announced I had dreams of finally being good, doing Naxx, having tier 3, shadow bolt crit peoples dicks off, but I’m going to a filthy casual again and it’s going to make me sad. Seriously considering staying away from it entirely and not becoming a masochist.
---
They're smart, a disturbing amount of people on this subreddit are defending layers. 10/10 genius.
---
For the majority of the player base it will still be challenging (it still is for the majority of the guilds on private servers, I do not expect classic wow to be less challenging). But raid difficulty is not the reason why most of us plays vanilla.
---
They changed the term and people are accepting it, I’m legit mad right now
---
If people still have a original 15 year old collecters edition the price will skyrocket. The pets from these are available in classic.
---
Do you plan on raiding stormwind during the first month? And you can still do that, just gather a raid if you want your lvl 40 friends to get annihilated vs guard.
---
Pathetic complainers.
---
In all honesty, after using it for a few days its fun but not too practical for playing games. I'll be playing on a 24.5" monitor which seems about right for what I like. This will eventually be mounted higher for watching vids while grinding.
---
#slipperly slope
---
There will be plenty of people selling key service by the time most people are 60. So it’s pretty easy. You don’t have to do LBRS.
---
We don't know the specifics but I would wager that once a layer is deactivated or merged it won't be available to come back online, thus lower the maximum potential player count and those players would need to sit in que.
---
I am not positive what you are arguing here, if its that xrealm isn't needed because servers will have more players to pick from, I would say that in every launch there are faction imbalances and people rerolling to other servers there will be servers with medium populations a few months after launch and others that have huge faction imbalances which will still lead to insane que times.
---
We don't need to wait on a release date though.. We have one.
---
Do they have a fixed number per layer, since I hear 3000 being thrown around alot, that's likely just peoples estimate of server population. It could quite easily be less than 200 hundred like shards.
---
There's no RPPvP server.
---
Everything you say can and will be held against you
---
Scheduled a week off, totals 8 days off because I only work 4 days every other week(9/80 schedule). I just want to hit 40 and get my mount and I'll be happy.
---
The point is that it is highly abusable by any large group. Ever hear of a guild before?? That’s usually a group of around 50-100 ppl who all organize gameplay on the same server. This is far from a minority occurrence. The Guild chat is all you will need to get a phase invite.
---
This is a copy/paste of a previous explanation I made - hope it helps!
---
A lot of folks don’t understand it. It was explained to me recently and I have to say, it began to make sense, and seemed the most logical way to work this issue.
---
The basic concept, if my understanding is even remotely close, layering is building additional servers, but they share the population. Think of the base/primary server as “servername”, then add your layered servers sharing the same name, but add a number to it: “servername1”, “servername2”, etc.
---
What this means to the end users, is that you will be part of a server population as large as say 10k players using 4 servers. Because each server handles up to 2-3k players at a time.
---
Here’s the winning ticket: This means that as player log on, and the primary server begins to fill up, then servername1 splits responsibilities with the primary server. (Sort of like sharing, but you’re still part of the base server community). As this continues, each server takes and handles part of the player population until 4/5 servers are filled. As the players log off, players are seamlessly transitioned back to the primary server - completely behind the scenes and unrecognized by the end user.
---
So you’ll still have the same friends, and play with the same community. But, instead of waiting in a que to log in, you’ll simply connect to another server to play with other players on the same base server, but on a layered server. If someone playing on servername1 invites you to group, you should be able to switch over without any issue. (Providing there are reserved slots available for this purpose). Most importantly, you’ll most often be associated with the players you log in at the same time with - because you’ll likely be on the same layer each time you log in, if your playing time remains constant.
---
Eventually, if players stop playing, the layered servers simply lie dormant and can be removed without affecting the active player base. This way, servers won’t need to be merged, alleviating all of the problems THAT chaos brings.
---
Trust me. Layering is brilliant.
---
Years overdue
---
No, it has only upsides. The downsides are as miniscule as say, you having to tie your shoes in the morning. Sure, I'd prefer to not have to spend 30 seconds each day tying my shoes, but thats how it is. It doesnt matter.
---
 Stop whining
---
It says I will get the beta, must be because I’ve had my account since 2006 and it’s still active ^who am I kidding kill me now
---
Because most of us don't trust that it'll be a few weeks until we actually see it.
---
If you have the original cd-keys from back in the day they can retrieve the account as well for you.
---
also this. cept only booked 8 days (for 12 days total of pure classic nostalgia flooding my brain). office are neckbeard gamer types. nobody expects anything more of me.
---
Dynamically increased spawn rates would only be noticeable in zones with higher population than normally, so for the first few starting zones in a week or two. Much better than layering for weeks/months.
---
What made you quit only 2 levels in?
---
Veterans level 20-30% faster. If you play 50% more you outlevel them.
---
I pulled these numbers out of nowhere.
---
At least the 3-4 hours I have available every evening which are currently occupied by "watching stuff" and "not doing much".
---
I'm currently debating with myself if I take time off for launch and play from the get go.
---
I don't plan on raiding heavily, not unless I meet 'nice' people. So there really is no rush.
---
Get out.
---
How is this supposed to be an upside? So in addition to all the things listed in OP, actually acquiring the buffs will be a significantly bigger pain in the ass too? 
---
Argument still stands for DM:T buff and ZG heart, too.
---
First of all i just wanna say that I appreciate that you took your time to respond, thank you. Oh okay so that's how you get the beta key? Where exactly is the  Blizzard Headquarter? Isn't it somewhere in Nebraska? I would  love to meet  Ion Hazzakooses, I am literally one of his biggest fans, he seems to be such a nice guy that I would love to spend some time with and talk about the good old days of World of Warcraft.
---
Exactly!
---
It changed from on launch, to first few days, to first few weeks to phase 1. Soon it will include phase 2, 3, 4 and 5 too.
---
and charges death head first.
---
So many tipsout fanboys in here who have no clue how world bufffs work and actually believe that there is a cooldown on them.
---
It’s a load of poop lol I was a non sub invited to WOD , Legion , BFA Beta
---
Im willing to bet money that druids will top healer in most guilds, the problem is that you have quite big diminishing returns using more of them. And on horde you NEED loads of shamans, so fitting druids in there is going to be limited anyways.
---
Ahhh the old "I was 14 and in high school when WoW released so everyone else must have been 14 too" chestnut
---
I hate threads like this.  I'm a testament to the "Not everyone has 8 hours of free time everyday with no responsibilities" trope.
---
Bitch I work a full-time job, no SO, no kids, a shitload of free time.  Why do people insist on trying to convince me what I may or may not want?
---
There wasn't really any way to accomplish that, other than getting rid of vertical progression altogether.
---
If you had to work your way up to naxx before going to tbc it would have taken forever even for most vanilla players, let alone new players.
---
&gt; Reddit is a platform for people who live in an echo chamber and can't handle the thought of even a slightly new idea.

I should have those too actually

Where were you listening too?

"We will probably do sharding to help for a smooth release, it could help in some zones like starter areas that aren't suited are for hundreds players at once. We have a lot more tool now for managing the populations compared to before and we WILL use them where appropriate"
---
Then Anti-Sharding said FUCK YOU BLIZZARD, NO SHARDING PERIDO, it splits up the community and people need to suffer on release day with hundreds people in every starter zone even though they can barely support 20-30 without become a massive hassle to quest.
---
So Blizzard was like ok, bluff called, you're getting Server levels of population for the stuff you complained about, AND it's sharded in such a way we won't have to make a bunch of extra servers to die off in a few months. 
---
thanks for feedback and enjoy the last compromise you're getting.
---
1) you can definitely tank in Fury spec
---
2) Arms is the PVP spec
---
3) you'll want to do something to mitigate your respec costs, unless you are playing a ton it'll add up and become quite costly.
---
It wasn't really a status symbom because alot of players who earned them turned them in for armored mounts. Its more lucky if you didn't.
---
But I wanted then to be a status symbol. Ivory raptor on an Undead mage... would have been sexy.
---
You give them a hand, they bite the whole arm. It will stay, either because it is too popular, so their shit hardware can handle it, or not popular enough where they will start merging servers.
---
&gt;  Roll a nelf or a tauren 
---
Thanks for useless input. 3k without dynamic respawn is going to be worse than 10k with dynamic respawn. It's fucking 5 min respawn timer on most mobs.
---
I'm doing civil engineering atm in what's considered the hardest college of my country but we have the most amount of free time anyone probably has except for unemployed people, our classes are not mandatory so you can skip them all (they are also worthless, you learn much better by urself). You can skip projects if you want, just makes it super harder to pass in the exam. The only time you have to study is like 2weeks before the exams where you have to no-life it.
---
I stood outside gamestop for the midnight release of wow when I was 14. Now I'm 30 and still playing retail.
---
3k players with 5 min respawn timer on mobs. Rofl, sounds like paradise.
---
Hahahaha you got me laughing mate
---
I honestly can't remember having any issues on vanilla launch day though. I logged in after school, there was a queue for the server i was on which was one of the most populated EU ones, but i can't recall having any real issues getting out of my starting zone at all or waiting for mobs to spawn.
---
Fair! I'll leave my ifs and buts at the door and choose rogue, since I like that class best which should equal the most fun, regardless of the speed. Thanks man.
---
I opened a ticket asking if they could try and retrieve my old acount with the cd-key. They said they could and asked me for an e-mail address which didnt have a battlenet account linked yet. Even gave me 3 days of playtime to check out the account!
---
What do you want me to say, you wanted vanilla, that's what you are getting. If you don't want that experience, wait 2 weeks after launch.
---
&gt; Reddit is a platform for people who live in an echo chamber and can't  handle the thought of even a slightly new idea. It has to fit their  narrative. 
---
Really eager to read that idea.
---
Oh man pvp on the zeppelins was insane, people jumping to their deaths rather than being killed on board.
---
In another classic wow transport story I once chased an undead warrior down the deep run tram tunnel, almost had him dead and he jumped on board a full speed tram and got away. Was way too cool.
---
Will never happen, but full Illidari faction. Please please please guys, please.
---
Just roll a pvp server and rp lol you snow flakes don’t need a separate server to hide in
---
Sharding/phasing as it works in retail means there's basically a bunch of alternate realities of any given area and players frequently move between them without really noticing, people just fade in and out of existence at certain times. Makes gameplay feel very random and impersonal. Imagine 5x Goldshire stacked on top of eachother and filled the area with invisible portals between each "shard."
---
Layering is a series of persistent instances of the world. Instead of 5x Goldshire with a bunch of invisible portals, you have 5x WoW stacked on top of eachother and you log into one of them at random. As long as you stay on that layer, you're part of the same persistent world as everyone else on that layer. You can move to someone else's layer by joining their group, and guilds will apparently always be put on the same layer.
---
The main difference is that you won't notice layering at all. It's literally invisible and undetectable. It has no direct impact on gameplay, players and mobs won't just pop in and out of existence like with phasing. It's kinda like when you go to the movies: you go to a certain theater at that cinema, and it's random who you end up with, but it's the same people throughout the entire movie. If you made friends there, you can swap phone numbers and stay in touch; but next time you go see a movie, it's gonna be mostly new people.
---
All that's needed is a few safeguards against abusing layering. That seems like it would be easy to do--just add a cooldown to layer shifting, and a hearthstone-like cast time to the act of shifting over so you can't use it to escape from fights. It's pretty simple and other games use similar systems, but people will of course go into panic mode and invent all kinds of horror scenarios where Blizzard don't do anything to prevent layering abuse.
---
I used waifu2x to stitch together this wallpaper in slightly higher quality: https://i.imgur.com/y5hdM85.jpg
---
&gt;  I find pets a pain in vanilla - too much to do, feeding, etc.
---
Non-issue after you get your pet loyalty to rank 6. Easy to get going and maybe the biggest skill cap of any classes in vanilla.
---
You're saying it has only upsides and are contradicting yourself literally by the start of your next sentence. 
---
I get that you like the concept, good for you. I'm not super opposed to it myself, assuming they handle a few key factors well. That doesn't mean there are no downsides, though. 
---
I've seen you pop up in all of these threads with the same non-argument, and honestly, it's getting super old. You're a pretty negative person, and I have no interest in interacting with you any longer if you're not willing to actually provide arguments for your standpoints.
---
Some people are arguing there should be sharded starter zones instead. Its a valid opinion. Both would work. Layering is more likely to have a negative effect if left for too long, whilst sharding will probably lead to you seeing more people phasing out.
---
Dont worry too much its a gorgeus screen, addons will help replacing everything then u can enjoy
---
Yeah seriously I know someone who is convinced people will quit before level 25 because the game is too hard. Like wtf who are these ppl?
---
It's literally the same outcome.
---
Dragon heads do have 2h CD, altho you'd be adorably naive if you believe this changes meta. It only changes the specific way of obtaining the buff, not the fact that the buff won't be obtained.
---
weekends? ;)
---
Hey guys. Since the Classic announcement i ve changed what to play many times, but the release now is so soon i want to finally conclude.-I want to play alot ( not 12+ hours no life it but surely 5 hours a day ).
---
\-I want to clear all raids but i also want to play PvP and i want to be compettiive in pvp.  
---
\-I believe i ll have skills in what i play so not afraid of complex classes. I actually want to play a complex class that has big outplay potential and creativity.
---
\-I also dont want to play something that everyone plays and makes it harder for me to gear up.
---
\-Finally, i want if possible to have the same build for pve n pvp or at least have an easy time on transitioning from one build to another ( via easy farming etc.)
---
I know i ask alot but thats why i m here.Would appreciate a class/race combo choice on both alliance and horde.Also, i actualy like almost every race and class concerning lore so i wont have trouble to adapt on that.Thanks in advance!
---
If there's a queue, that indicates that server is full, and we're not dealing with low-pop realms, which is what people seem most indicative is the problem.  That low-pop realms will have egregious queue times.
---
Yes, those things are possible, but why are we assuming them as the default?  Why isn't cross-realm implemented if necessary?  Why not make it a threshold?  If queue times start getting egregious, activate cross-realm queues for those realms where it's necessary?
---
I don't think that's an unreasonable thought, they took the time to build out 'layering' as an enhancement to sharding.  Why not an enhancement to crossrealm that doesn't activate it unless it's necessary?
---
he looks like a bond villain haha
---
Might be skipping the Valley of Trials...
---
I think using enchants is cheating. I'm not interested in joining raids where people enchant their gear. Who has gold for that shit anyway.
---
I remember doing the pirates in Tanaris and if you had anymore than about 4 people in the area you were waiting on respawns. Retail wow uses dynamic spawning as well, people forget how much down time was waiting for mobs to spawn.
---
Because you will be the only one getting them? You dont think if there are 4 times as many people on the entire server, that there will be 4 times as many people also farming black lotus?
---
Or are you saying despite having 4 times as many people farming black lotus, you will be the only one finding them?
---
Stuff like Black Lotus is actually really rare though, the spawns were at least sometimes camped on timers even back in vanilla.
---
If chat isn't layer then the odds of being invited to another one drastically shrink.
---
I'm well aware that balance doesn't really do well at either PvE or PvP, but that doesn't mean I couldn't enjoy it. And I would respec for raiding. Please feel free to actually tell me what's wrong with my ideas. That's why I'm asking questions on Reddit.
---
when your fantasy meets reality.
---
Yes and Cthun will be killed within 2 hours of AQ opening.
---
Undead is better in pvp and troll is better in pve.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I was considering the LG 49” ultra wide and playing in windowed mode. I was gonna put a browser either side of the game window. One for YouTube and one for guides and levelling resources. It would be great for multi boxing too.
---
I guess it depends on how old your account is. If you just subbed on brand new account, then yeah you probably wasted money.
---
You are assuming that each layer will be full. There will always be the newest one, which will be almost empty.
---
Lets say there are 3020 players. There is one layer with 3000 and one layer with 20. One of those 20 people is from Guild X, who then invites their whole guild into that layer.
---
Now that layer has 100 people, 80 of which are from one guild who have free reign on all the resources that continent has to offer.
---
Swiftys stream just said in 20 minutes. I'm not sure how much I believe that. It's only 3:50am for Blizzard right now, I highly doubt they will be doing anything at around 4:10am.
---
Instead of just implementing these things they need to let people TEST this stuff ahead of time. We need more testing phases so that way we can test the different technology and see the positives and negatives of them.
---
You got one of them flexible ostrich necks, don't you? Never go full ostrich tho.
---
Classic is basically Modern WOW Code modified to use Vanilla Data. Therefore, the PC Requirements for Classic are basically the same for Modern WOW. 
---
Here are the specs that I found:
---
**World of Warcraft Recommended Requirements**
---
* CPU: Intel® Core™ i5-3330, AMD™ FX-6300, or better
---
* CPU SPEED: Info
---
* RAM: 4 GB
---
* OS: Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10
---
* VIDEO CARD: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 750 Ti or AMD™ Radeon™ R7 260X or better
---
* PIXEL SHADER: 5.0
---
* VERTEX SHADER: 5.0
---
* FREE DISK SPACE: 45 GB
---
* DEDICATED VIDEO RAM: 2048 MB
---
That fuck does that mean?
---
Beating Final Fantasy 12 on switch.6 hours in so far, probably a long way to go.
---
Well if its between Troll and Undead, just decide which of these is more important to what you plan to do.
---
Troll - Berserking: Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 25%. At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 25% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec. 3 min cooldown.
---
Undead - Will of the Forsaken: Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec. 2 min cooldown.
---
You have always needed a active wow sub to get into any of the wow beta. Why should classic be different?
---
Armor reducing debuffs all stacked and were used in vanilla https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/the-official-bet-how-many-weeks-upon-launch-until-molten-core-is-cleared/161314/150
---
&gt; Please try to avoid using Reddit
---
assuming they are wasting their time on here instead of being busy at their paid jobs
---
The "proper vanilla experience" can never be recreated without a time machine.
---
So, that's was not ever the goal. The goal of Classic is to recreate Vanilla WoW, the *game*. Any experience creation is then up to the players.
---
Most of which, by the way, won't be speedclearing the raids. Most of them will be hard pressed to down Ragnaros. You can't just create the game only for the super-grizzled veterans, a very small minority.
---
If you want a different, more "difficult" game, well, ask Blizzard for it. It's not Classic/Vanilla, that's for sure.
---
tbf it's kind of a shithole
---
Sharding the low level areas work best with the assumption that most of the playerbase will never go beyond level 20 and population of servers plummet after 2-3 weeks. 
---
While I think it's what's gonna happen, it's not like I'm sure of it and if the game gains momentum and the number of people playing the game raise after a month, then you have servers with probably more than twice the 'vanilla' setting and a big problem on your hands.
---
In the end, I guess that nobody knows what will happen and this solution, while imperfect is probably the one that gives devs the most option to have healthy server in phase 1 which will benefit everyone.
---
Thats what they wanted to do.
---
But Anti-Sharding has been bitching NON_STOP since it was announced to have no sharding and giving all their reasons for why sharding shouldn't be a thing.
---
Funny that blizzard took basically all of those reasons, turned them into layers and then has been rubbing their noses in the shit they've helped create with their whining. And reminding that come release day, THEY'RE the ones getting Lynched by the people freaking over the game being essentially unplayable for the first 4-5 days.
---
Fair enough. But i don't think Activision wants to miss out on any sales. I mean, this CE is completely useless if you think about it, and is a huge money grab (personal opinion). It was sold out on the blizz store after 2 hours, and on amazon (germany) after 12 hours. It would be strange if they would just let it be..
---
He used the macro.
---
&gt;  those players never played vanilla so have no clue how it worked originally.
---
Why bash on the players? They just play whatever hand is being dealt to them.
---
Honestly, I'd just turned 18 (straight after TBC release) and the rest is history. Booze, girls, life. Never really commit to another MMORPG after that due to work constraints, probably like many on here.
---
Nice
---
Where did you get this notion?
---
Imagine being 100% serious claiming that you'd be allowed to take a shit on Blizzard CEOs desk for $10
---
I really like the OSRS style! 
---
and then by making a new part more relevant then the old game just add it into the old world als a  "new zone" so that ironforge as an example stays relevant.
---
If they would go this way I would be really happy!
---
Nah. When Classic launches it's time to play Classic.
---
exactly this!
---
Not sure if they changed anything but for me I logged into my battlenet account (another account then the one I was trying to retrieve) and went to support &gt; Contact Support &gt; Not Listed Here &gt; Web Ticket. Here I explained the situation and also added a picture of my ID in case they needed this for the retrieval.
---
I don't have sms protect either etc.
---
Vanilla pservers aren't expecting a big influx of retail players all at once though. If the predictions that a lot of retail players will check out classic, but not stay, are true, then these scenarios aren't really comparable i think.
---
You can refer to BfA's system requirements. Classic will require even less.
---
Honestly, the approach they're taking isn't much different to opening many servers at launch then merging them after a few weeks.
---
Sure, comparing mc to Mythic KJ it’s no question. In vanilla, the entire game isn’t just rush to max level and raid, like the game is now days. Realistically, finding 40 people who are competent and won’t fuck around could be hard in itself, who knows? Unless you already play on private servers and have a group of people ready to go, you will encounter many players who have never stepped foot in a vanilla raid and don’t know what’s going on. I think it will be fine, Im personally not worried about the difficulty, because it doesn’t matter that much to me, the game itself is amazing.
---
You want to play on a 4k pop server with normal vanilla respawns (just imagine launch specifically)? Are you insane lol.
---
I'm sure reading reddit is probably part of at least one person's job at Blizzard.
---
Fury is awesome for both, but at least until BWL I think frost mage is awesome for pve and pvp
---
If it is “the first few weeks” like Ion promised, then what are you talking about? Do you know how few people will be 60 before even the first month ends?
---
Hi, /u/nutty100333
---
lol yeah, you cant tell but I pushed it back as far as I could to avoid that
---
Moot* point.
---
Boy you need to practice your idioms!
---
So we should rather have crashing servers and 30 minute wait times for named quest mobs?
---
Haveing something that is bad simply because its the way it was, does not make it good.
---
I would pay 500 euro for it
---
I feel like people do not understand the differnece between "Sharding" and "Layering".
---
Layering you will only see people on your realm.
---
Sharding you see people from other realms, which is far worse obviously.
---
All these complaints about release day seriously have me playing the world's smaaaaaallest violin.
---
"But school starts next week!!"
---
Like... do you hear yourselves?
---
I really wish they would give a glimpse of the subscription spike that's going to be happening over the first few days.  I know they'll keep it under lock and key, but nobody can tell me there isn't a HUGE influx of subs happening right now.
---
Layer to have the same number as people on as the classic cap per each layer is a bad thing?
---
But still... he just changed his mind.
---
People in here going off on this dude for changing his mind about playing a computer game, it's insane
---
Feel you. I hoped for a early summer release. Guess I'll be playing after school again like back in the day.
---
Just sounds like they’re making it a better launch than last time....
---
That's only 1 to 10 though, on the first run through which I'm sure would have more optimizations when you make shifts from private servers to actual vanilla
---
I had an idea about a new pvp focused zone where there are world demi bosses that spawn around the map every so often that drop mats for a new tier of tradeskill professions and then add some new mining herb nodes and recipe drops from the non elite mobs therefore encouraging world pvp and tradeskill usage which i think are 2 of the most iconic things about vanilla
---
That's fine if you don't. But there's reason you don't see resto shamans in premade groups with good players. They're terrible PvPers. They offer so much less than a 30/0/21 ele shaman offers.  I am also a gladiator resto shaman on live and have been playing resto shaman since 2005.   And no, a shaman/warrior will not beat priest/warrior, at least not in the open world. In a situation like gurubashi arena maybe, but that's about it. Shaman healing is very mana inefficient and just terrible
---
you also get one attempt and then you're done for the night.
---
Are you fucking kidding me with those "convenience" features? You are nitpicky as all hell.
---
Starts thinking? I joined my guild 6 months ago.
---
You play how you want and what makes you happy. Just be aware that no hardcore guild will take you as balance so you won’t get the best peace’s of lewt for balance spec.
---
Guild recruitment has been going on for many months already.
---
See this for example: https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
there is no NDA, people can stream and create videos all day from the Beta
---
Well, if you played on an RP-PvP server before you'd know why it's that important we have our own server.
---
The community is so much better, and you actually prove that point. People aren't like you. They all share the same common goal, to have a great community, fun times playing and some RPing mixed into it. 
---
Defias Brotherhood EU was the most amazing server I have ever played on and hopefully they'll bring RP-PvP to classic (since it was in vanilla, I have a hard time understanding why not!)
---
If they decided to keep the same server structure as retail, with only PvE servers but "you can flag your self for PvP anytime!". Wouldn't you think the pro PvP-server players would be enraged like hell?
---
Has nothing to do with being snow flakes, we'll handle it somehow. It's about Blizzard doing something bad and frankly quite stupid since it'll ruin server population for both RP and the RP-PvP servers.
---
Where is this from?
---
Damn I miss old steam UI
---
There is no NDA, many streamers will stream it like Esfand, StaySafe and others
---
There is always the option of just waiting a week or two after release before starting to play. You'll hardly be 'behind' in any way that matters, and by then the population has both dropped and spread out a lot. No reason to change what 'server' meant just because people are impatient.
---
You mean 22 months. Last time i checked 27-5=22 not 3.
---
LFG tank, BRD!
---
(Joins your group)
---
(Quick looks for black lotus)
---

---
How reliant are hunters on macros and such things? Im a bit worried about needing to write and use tons for pets, attacking etc.
---
Because dynamic respawns suck. The world is designed for a specific number of players and it served that specific number very well.
---
So I would rather play on a 2000-6000 pop server (I don‘t know the exact number). And enjoy the game, how it is meant to be played.
---
But then I have to be honest to myself. It is unreasonable to believe that every single server can sustain those numbers. We don’t want ghost towns.
---
They can now estimate how many players end up on the servers 1-3 months down the line and adjust the numbers accordingly.
---
It’s basically a server merge plan for when things stabilize. It will be telling to find out who extends their sub.
---
I have been on enough private servers to know that they suck when they are empty and they suck when they are nostlike from a population point of view.
---
I am cautiously optimistic. My main fears about the way they do it do not hold. I will be able to gank guilds for instance. It just seems a bit like a slippery slope is all, but that is a logical fallacy if I am honest to myself.
---
What worries me more are xrealm bgs. I personally like the idea as I have been around back then and it was difficult. But I respect how many others feel about this (even if they were not around back then).
---
That... that is almost literally what layering is. You just merge the layers instead of the servers.
---
they've already said they will have three stress tests to specifically test these kind of things. The first one will be as soon as May 22 to Thursday, May 23. :)
---
And the release date is when theres busy season at work
---
its more a classic experience than a private server launch. Just saying
---
You're underestimating a lot of people there. The majority won't be 60 but there will be more than you think for sure.
---
Gnome/UD Mage
---
Here's my first impression of tipsout's first impressions of the wow beta: 
---
WHY do people like him beta test anything? For a so-called vanilla enthusiast you'd be hard pressed to believe him when he seriously thinks the minimap projects arrow to the quest location if you track it, or that warlocks can summon people from outside the game world directly inside the instance. 
---
It's all just one fucking soup of "private servers have no clue", then he goes on to bash them without specifics, vaguely claiming that leveling will take approx. 30% longer on official classic because "armor values are correct". 
---
He also mentioned that the mob "Fire Roc" doesn't have the ability "Spit Fire" on private servers, except that they do.
---
You could have that argument with all of classic with aspects you think were bad. 
---
The point is, this is not a remaster. The goal is not to change the game to make it better. The goal is just to make the same game again. 
---
Ironically, if you listen to the blizzcon where they announced classic the devs were really emphasizing that they would not use modern solutions to solve flaws in classic because it would alter the game irreparably. 
---
Wonder if they still think that today...
---
Guild recruitment has been going on for months already.
---
Ah the slippery slope argument. While I do not wish to dismiss your worries, that line of thinking is a logical fallacy.
---
BFA is really not worth it.
---
yeah, even with healthy average enforced population starting zones would be cramped. sure.
---
but its like a problem during first few weeks only, not big deal, just wait a little.
---
making giga servers with layers will be a problem for years.
---
the onyxia had like 8h cooldown on the official wow servers 
---
The flowers also got patched I think
---
Just making sure. Could be troll-factor.
---
You really want TOEP for pvp as a caster, and while molten core wont be hard you are gonna be super low priority as a respeccing healer on the list of it dropping. 
---
I was a shadow priest in vanilla, and yes in theory you could be insane like I was and spend 50 gold multiple times a day on respeccing, but let me tell you that aint exactly fun. To give you an idea. I progression raided did and still Molten core basically ever week for the life cycle of vanilla wow. Got rank 12. Got lokamir so didn't go after hwl and fuck my friends over for gear. Never got TOEP. Not once. Still envious.
---
I am a masochist and may do this again, but don't be like me.
---
You do not need TOEP to do well in pvp, even though a decade later I'm still salty shows you do want it, but honestly balance is really trash in vanilla. Like really trash. Druid's are amazing in pvp, but you will be resto and you will be running flags or guarding bases and that is gonna be more fun anyway. (You also might do as much damage as balance and maybe not die inside kidney)
---
Word. I was only 11 or 12 so I had all the time in the world 😀
---
Hunters can be played without complicated macros. Most macros are just QoL things anyway.
---
Can't you just ask your friend if he can send you a screenshot of his ID?
---
Off the top of my head... hunter/destro warlock
---
"running out of content" in wow 2019 lmao xD
---
Well, let's say that scuffed shaman raider healed on bosses when it was needed with a full healing gear. And knew how to perfect totem swapping for 100% uprate of +agi and WF buffs (4.4%~ crit and a lot of AP for rogues + Windfury). Which means you'll have a somewhat "ok" dps, healer if needed and a great boost for your melee group?
---
It would be literally the same IF the layer you were in was always the same one.
---
Guten Tag mein Deutscher Freund :D
---
This subreddit, and its hardcore minority will be a tony drop in the bucket of the population. If 5,000 try hards out of a million people are 60 in 3 weeks, and layering somehow negatively affects them, so be it.
---
Anyone know at what time the beta is starting, and have someone already gotten their beta key? :)
---
Thank you for the information bud! As it comes to professions, why do you recommend Herb and Eng? Professions will be my second concern, after I chose the class ( which will probably be Warrior :D ). Was thinking about mining and eng. so I can supply mats to level up eng. What do you think?
---
I was thinking about ganking horde guilds in BRM or dire maul entrance. But if it's only for a few weeks, it's true that ut won't be that bug an issue. Please don't insult me when I'm just qharing my opinion.
---
I'd still would rather starting zone sharding then FFA after a week or 2 than layering for an entire phase but hey, apparently more people would rather a much less true vanilla experience and more of a 12k cap private server experience instead.... that's what happens when you listen to a private server community/content creators who never actually played at release and seen that it was nothing like they think.... if you want the true vanilla experience, you didn't have to fight over starting zone mobs for 5 minute respawns, you need blizzard to continuously crash the servers for months on end...
---
I really wonder what game you mixed World of Warcraft up with when you made this monumentally stupid comment.
---
I thought about buying, but there is  really nothing interesting in it. A Figure and a Mousepad for 100€ ...no thanks!
---
They should’ve made meeting stones like flightpaths. So you would’ve had to actually travel there at least once in order to queue for it.
---
Streamers gonna stream, players gonna play, and nobody's gonna report bugs
---
&gt; Not many guilds ran with world buffs or put any emphasis on them whatsoever back in 2005, but it’s become quite the standard over the years in the private server scene. Acquiring the buffs can be tedious and usually means you have to prepare for up to hours before each raid to get them all (DM:N, Songflower, Ony/Nef, ZG) and stay logged out to preserve them. I’d argue this is bad gameplay.
---
IIRC (been a while since 2006, which was the last time I raided in vanilla, no Pserver experience) we would absolutely go for a Dragonslayer buff even during T2 progression (which would mean one of us would need to turn Ony head in) and we would also get the Fire Res buffs from mind controlling a mob whose name I cannot remember, for specific encounters. And later on, ZG buffs were also mandatory for AQ.
---
If you were in the top 3 guilds of your faction you definitely pushed for buffs, especially during progression. So don't assume this is just a 'Private Server thing' only.
---
&gt; World buffs kills competition and make it hard or near-impossible to accurately compare personal or guild performance with others.
---
It was not uncommon that our RL would coordinate raids so that we could potentially benefit from zone buffs put up by the No.1 Horde guild in the server (our rival).
---
&gt; Dying means losing your buffs, thus rendering you relatively useless and pissed off. Also while playing with world buffs is cool and you super powerful and all, it's also quite stressful because you could lose them any second and get your day ruined.
---
Not an issue for me per se, because I was in a PvE realm, but in PvP servers raids would run to the entrance as a group specifically for that reason. And generally people would not engage groups of people decked in T2+, with stacked buffs. So basically not an issue if you played smart.
---
If you haven't played any vanilla since retail, you might not remember just how horrible shamans are in terms of mana efficiency, or seen how wildly the vanilla "meta" has changed
---
I think you made a good call for yourself, one that I should have years ago.
---
Each fucking layer will have A REGULAR REALMS POPULATION.
---
This is 100% correct
---
And every privat server player who doesn’t believe, will wonder how much harder progress will be compared to the privat servers
---
Some bosses even hat like 90% resistance 
---
And there were caster bosses with lass armor than others
---
I sort of understand the reasoning behind only inviting people with a sub however I feel like all of this controversy could have been avoided if they just didn't announce it. Still just invite subs only but don't announce you're doing it that way, no?
---
Regardless I am somewhat worried that the beta test will be more of a publicity stunt/stress test given the (basically) guaranteed invite for content creators and the actual bug reporting will be put on the back burner. 
---
Personally what I think would be an interesting idea would be for them to try and invite as many players as they can that played during vanilla (sub or no sub). I myself did not play back then but I want the experts to give feedback to make the experience as genuine as possible for the rest of us.
---
I don't know why everyone is assuming you'll be able to pick or even see your layer. 
---
I'd bet you're not going to make a character and choose betwern Kazaak 1-9, you're going to make a character, pick Kazaak, and be assigned a layer. The only way to even know if somebody is on a different layer than you would be meet up in the same spot, check if you could see each other.
---
Private servers use dynamic respawn to cope and that is worse for the classic experience than layering.
---
So be it.
---
First thing that comes to mind considering your criteria are warlock, hunter or shaman.   
---
Orc or gnome - Warlock  
---
Orc or Night elf - Hunter  
---
Orc - Shaman
---
that's a good screenshot
---
It’s similar if not the same. They’ve just packaged it differently. The server cluster is done away with, and instead those servers exist all within 1 server as layers.
---
It’s, at best, a good rebranding. The same issues you had with phasing will apply to layering .
---
This is a nightmare
---
It's a concern for sure, but it still might be harder compared to private servers, as Beta testers have noted so far, even the leveling content is harder than private servers, with it being estimated to take 20-30% longer to get level 60.
---
Sorry, but why should the needs of "truly new players" outweigh the needs of those that have been campaigning hard for this for years and who played originally in vanilla?
---
Exactly what i'm worried about. Publicity is great but we need a real beta test as well.
---
Pretty sure people will have cleared MC before Ony gets killed. The Ony PreQ is just horrible. That long ass quest with the BRD Escord and then UBRS...
---
the problem is that I really don't trust them THAT much.
---
refurbishing existing content is one thing. Making something new that hadn't really existed before I'm not 100% sure the current blizzard can do it.
---
And I'm waiting till the end of Phase 1 to see how well the current classic project works.
---
Of course if they did release servers for every era of wow, and then start looking into alternative paths for the vanilla content that's just more wow for everyone.
---
And everyone can get their "home" whichever era they liked the most, and then dabble on other servers whenever they felt like they needed a break and wanted to experience content with era appropriate mechanics.
---
And it's not that big of a Deal, Vanilla has the LARGEST minimum population needs of any kind of server.
---
You need about 800 on average to have a healthy server population.
---
TBC can get away with about 350, and Wrath and above can get away with as low as about 150 IF you don't mind 25 mans being a bit harder to get formed. (later expansions with Flex-style raiding can manage with even less since you can recycle members instead of needing full extra guilds to help with clears for your B-teams).
---
Depends on what you like really. Mythic BoD and CoS is really nice if you like raiding. If you're a pure casual, BFA is likely good for you as well.
---
But it's definitely not the same game as Classic
---
It's you who doesn't understand the difference between sharding, phasing and cross-realm. 
---
Sharding splits population, just like layering.
---
Cross-realm is matching people from different realms to your zone or dungeon.
---
My bad, you're correct I can't seem to find a hard number. If it's like shards I'll jump on the rage bandwagon. But I'm trying to be optimistic with a 2500or 2000 minimum layer cap before opening another
---
The feeling of helping the game you love. I wont have the time for it but knowing that fellow players are helping Blizzard making the game the best is hype.
---
I disagree. I think it actually brought another/different element to your server having an identity. You'd always keep track of which server the best teams/players came from. Running into pre-mades wasn't the end of the day but those from some servers were to be rightly feared and respected. It also made a fight against a pre-made from your own server extra special and I always remember people treating it like a personal grudge match. You just gave it more effort against your own opposing faction. Between Xrealm BGs and the new layering tech for the open world, I see this as pretty much win win for PvP.
---
Sounds like you should play druid my guy! Super fun and pretty complex in pvp and pretty fun in pve aswell
---
People like different things. There's your reason. Some just want to speed level and some want to take their sweet time.
---
Why? People like different things. So let them like different things. 
---
It's going to be OK.
---
Wrong! Layering is like instancing the whole server. He describes it in the video.
---
Damn, Lionheard Helmet with T0 Shoulders is quite the unique sight :p
---
When does it start today?
---
human fury warrior ftw
---
Macros in classic will be much easier in the current wow system
---
You could talk with other people using in game chats or out of game chats and then get invited to different layers, same as it works with current retail sharding.
---
45 dollar? what are u on about....its 13 euro, thats like a fucking lunch worth of money lmao
---
Spoil the fun? How so?
---
I enjoy leveling. Yes, my progress will be destroyed when beta is done, but I still had fun.
---
I want to experience the different classes to figure out what class I want to main.
---
In comparason to private servers, I want to see how different it feels. Is it harder, easier? Does some spells do more or less damage?
---
Also, I want to help a fantastic Classic team to make the best possible product when it's released by reporting bugs and problems.
---
I have no idea what BoD and CoS even is. But BFA is terrible, I played it for a few Weeks and its the worst Expansion I ever played. They removed everything I liked about Legion!
---
Pservers don't have a company image to defend. Pservers , big as they may be, can't be compared to the numbers expected for official vanilla by Blizzard. Pservers don't suffer a huge form of tourism like it's expected for Cassic WoW.
---
Sharding and Layering are different solutions, for what I've heard on the interviews each Layer of a single server will be able to handle the same population of a vanilla server (about 3000 players online), so layering it's not the solution to a baseless "modern backend" inadequacy, because, as already said, each layers will handle "large scale player interactions".
---
I find this solution a decent compromise.
---
We'll be sure to remind them of that quote if they do.
---
This will be quite easy to manage with an addon or just voice chat
---
As much as possible but in reality with work and family life I will be lucky to get 2-3 hours in per day. 20 hours a week so should get to 60 by Christmas!!
---
If you average out to 2 lotuses when competing with 3k people, then you repeat this competition on every shard with 3k people, you will average out to 2 lotuses from each shard.
---
&gt; Sharding you see people from other realms
---
Wrong.
---
Sharding is NOT crossrealm, you don't see people from different realms with sharding alone, that's connected realms + cross realm zones.
---
The difference is that sharding is limited to small zones while layering encompasses the whole world to have a more consistent community than what you'd have with constantly changing shards every time you change zones.
---
Where is the source that layers are going ot have the same cap? Looked around but can't find it.
---
I think currently they have done excellent job by creating authentic Vanilla experience but still utilizing modern technologies (layers, battle.net etc).
---
Jots name down, never to play with that person again when Layering ends and the layers merged.
---
You make your own bed on your server. As it should be.
---
That means more servers to mantain and players spread across more games though
---
f-fire and recklessness could be on the same target for their primary function. the first being stealth and invis suppression the second being fear and flee suppression
---
the discussion was brought out in length when recklessness was removed in wotlk and both warlocks and physical dps complained because of the removal of armor reduction utility. The statement was simple: it was a secondary effect and only the strongest was active as far as armor reduction was concerned. 
---
the entire topic is the reason why bonereaver's was changed in the first place as they've reworked secondary armor reduction effects with 1.8 and they forgot about bonereaver's when they did it and they had to edit it with 1.10 because its debuff placement was useless from that point onwards
---
as for the oh so beloved crystal yield. that didn't stack with sunder armor from patch 1.3 onwards. yet all the private server crap videos still have it on their bosses anyway
---
Assuming you can see and choose your layer. 
---
Make character on Kazaak, be assigned layer, never know what layer you're on, problem solved.
---
_Light wills it_
---
SM/Ruin alliance lock. Very complex pvp class, nobody rolls it, and you can be the same spec in pvp and PvE.
---
this is exactly what wow needs!
---
Well, blizzard announced this about 2 years or something. Right now they just confirmed the date.
---
That just means you get the full vanilla experience.
---
None of the buffs persist through death. That's what makes them so awesome - people will actually fucking focus while having them.
---
I'm in the same shoes. Feeling really bad about it.
---
They won't. The whole point is to not overcrowd zones. If what you said was the case we'd see 3k people across starting zones on each layer - the exact opposite of what layering intends to solve.
---
Imagine still replying to this thread
---
Unless your wife plays, too! Mwuahaha, I beat you, life!
---
What no gym class heroes - Cupids chokehold?
---
Super thanks for the simple explanation. Finally somewhat understand the difference. Or at least how we experience the difference. As long as I can randomly team up with someone on a quest, then exchange "numbers" and perhaps meet up some time later, then i'm happy. In retail that's just impossible.
---
Should they listen to youtubers in stead? Or maybe just go for some discord channel?
---
You'll find circle jerkin in every forum..
---
Is layering going to even be a bad thing? I was and still am too sleepy to listen to Ion talk about it to understand what he is saying.
---
Is it essentially like this? Assume the server name is "Dragonmaw". That would technically be Dragonmaw1. Everyone who joins the realm will be there together and there would be none of the current sharding experience at all. Once that server fills up, there will be a Dragonmaw2 that gets automatically created and combined with Dragonmaw1. Both servers are still on the same realm and again, there are no sharding symptoms.
---
I've played on private servers on and off for the past 8 years and I'm so fucking stoked for the beta and the release, can't fucking wait. Didn't ruin my hype at all! Best game of all time.
---
&gt; But each layer is the size of a vanilla server
---
This is what concerns me though. If they are planning to merge the layers by the end of phase 1 and each server can potentially have 3 full layers, how are they going to merge them without ending up with an insanely overpopulated server?
---
The real problem with layering is that if classic is a huge success, they will have to keep using it well beyond phase 1.
---
Layering: Kazzak-1, Kazzak-2, Kazzak-3, Kazzak-4
---
Sharding: Kazzak, Magtheridon, Frostpeak, Stronghold
---
There is no difference. Layering just renames 3 out of 4 realms, it's completely the same, just worded differently.
---
I don't care if you merge 4 servers with different names or the same name, but layering isn't doing that. It's large scale sharding, without a fixed end point.
---
Not bashing but when someone goes out of their way to make a new thread saying "X will ruin Classic" they should be sure what they're saying is true and maybe put in a little bit of effort to check
---
I've been away mostly cause of the new content. It turned me away.
---
Is this going to be like Vanilla? max lvl 60, AQ highest raid, no flying in Azeroth?
---
Accessing the garrison was nearly impossible in the early days.
---
That's always the problem with betas nowadays.
---
Streamers are there to generate hype. That's all they're good for, and nobody should for a second think otherwise. Then there's the other ppl that get in on the beta and just play the heck of it and only report major bugs, bugs that more than likely have already been reported.
---
There's probably gonna be only 5 to 10% of the ppl who get in that will take the time to document every single bug they come across, no matter how small. But then again, these people from past betas are for sure getting in, as there's databases of good testers out there.
---
At least I know of 2 major devs with such databases, so it would seem logical to me that Blizzard has one as well
---
uhhhhhhhhhhh... got some bad news for you buddy
---
There is no way you believe they wont keep it forever.
---
&gt; Their threat calculation is completely off (giving birth to the p-server fury deathwish dual wield tanking) 
---
You do understand that they take Defiance, right? And sit in Defensive Stance? The only ability they don't use is Shield Slam.
---
&gt; LG 49” ultra wide
---
I was looking at that one as well. Some thoughts: 
---
The problem I saw with the LG was that its locked at 60hz. It may seem like a small thing, but once I jumped from an old 60hz monitor to my first over 144hz, life changed. The one thing the reviews noted is pixel density is a lot higher for the LG, but once you tweak settings in nvidia panel on the Samsang for higher anti-aliasing you can keep pretty good quality no matter what.
---
Lol he also got a giggle out of me
---
That is wild speculation because currently modern WoW simply cannot handle that and demo was aggressively sharded, so I think my assumption is fair based on current information.
---
Tourism, sure, but what about people who will join classic week after launch, 2 weeks after launch, months from launch? If you make giga server with 10-15K pop and then remove sharding you are back at initial problem of too many people in same zones.
---
A warlock pet disappears when the cast started for a new pet summon. 
---
Happened like that in vanilla and the classic demo but not private servers
---
They've made multiple promises to not keep it forever, so yes, I actually do believe they won't keep it forever.
---
So it's the worst for you. Sure I can get that. Not the worst in general though. There's been worse ones, like Cataclysm. And yeah, after a few weeks you wouldn't have experienced mythic raiding I guess
---
Haha I believe there's no pandas.   
---
But unless you use the 1080p version, it will get cropped.
---
When I get my new pc I’m probably gonna resub just to check out my old characters and play around. Check if I got any of those weird old items that sell for a lot etc. 
---
I’m guessing subbing for beta alone is a bad bet unless they guarantee an invite
---
I can't see how the beta can spoil something that is pretty much known for most players already.
---
Undead has more survivability because they do not need to breath. Think about it
---
Update: Got the account back but the main character for the sale had been transferred of. Thanks for the tip!
---
You can, but its not great. You can do all of that totem twisting as a resto spec in the melee group and provide more value with Chain Heal than you do with Shaman DPS. The DPS an enhancment shaman provides is basically a non-factor. 
---
Some raids will bring one to proc Nightfall though. I personally don't think it looks very fun as you can't even use Stormstrike.
---
But thats just min/maxing, you can for sure get a ragtag group of non-optimal specs and clear most content. Maybe even all of it, idk. For sure 5/7 I would think at least.
---
There's no good time to stop playing wow.. if you get to 60 as a Hunter or mage, you're not going to want to do your thesis. If you get to 55 on your rogue, you're not going to want to do your thesis. If people pool you money and you get to 60 and get your epic mount and you clear MC once, you're still not going to want to do your thesis. Just play what you want, we're here for the long haul. There are tons of people that have the same problem, meaning when you return, lots of others will return at the same time.
---
Sodapoppin a popular twitch streamer and youtuber that started out playing wow (now he plays a bunch of games).
---
This video reminded me of how stupid some people in this subreddit are because the person in this video likely played a huge part in classic coming back in the first place
---
I'm getting married Sept 1. I'm also canceling. If you want, we can marry. We dont need those pesky people telling us we can play because of a "wEdDiNg."
---
- By referring to phasing the way you do you demonstrate that while you know your catch-phrases, you have no clue what they mean.
---
- By your statements in your last paragraph, you demonstrate that you have no idea what Blizzard intends to do with layering.
---
- You obviously have no clue what the expected size of the playerbase for classic is going to be and how it is expected to evolve over time. Namely BfA-players creating classic characters and having a go at it in the first few weeks, basically sightseeing. Expect an average active population drop around 90% and you might be on to something. Interested "hardcore" players will play less per day once the initial thrill (and their vacation time sheduled for launch) has ended and sightseers will abandon classic altogether. Combined, the number of concurrent players will drop like lead. Trying to handle this with traditional servers, you have two options: 
---
1. Create a huge number of servers to handle the initial spike. This will result in dead and vacated servers shortly after. You will need to have servers merging wave after wave, forcing active guilds and players to give up character- and guildnames and destroy server identity.
---
2. Create servers to handle the expected long-time population. Since servers can handle *a lot* more concurrent players than they could back in the day, you will have tons and tons of players competing over the same NPC-kills, resources etc. They have said that modern servers could handle a thousand players in a single zone (e.g. Elwynn Forest) at a time. But that would render that zone unplayable since Classic will be missing modern features like dynamic spawn rates that we don't want in classic for a reason (it would change the nature of the game drastically). And even with increased concurrent population limits, we would *still* be looking at massive login-queue-times.
---
So, what would you propose to handle this initial spike that will be steeper than anything WoW ever experienced? Nothing, exactly. You offer nothing and yet you discard what Blizzard plans because you don't even understand it and don't bother to find out more about, neither about its technology nor its justification.
---
So I'm planing on rolling a warlock for solo lvling, taking my sweet time and enjoying the ride. But I will also have a second char which I only play with friends on, we will probably be 3 with the setup of tank, healer and dps. Cloth, leather and mail/plate so we don't take gear from eachother. I don't care what role they put me on since I'm the least experienced of us but, I do want to know since we will be tryharding and semi-rushing, what is the optimal setup for 3-man lvling? My guess would be prot warr, holy priest and combat rogue? Maybe a fire mage instead of the rogue since both mage and priest want cloth but different cloth.
---
Of course you can, and some of it is more blurry than others.
---
But certain things simply were just bad.
---
Hi, /u/haken--
---
Ahh, forgot about that one completely. Not surprised people keep mixing up vanilla and private servers, esp when private servers had more convenient type features

To get a taste of WoW Classic. Some people were hoping it would be out in June or July, but its not coming for 3 months.
---
Also, a lot of people want to test out various classes and specs, races, factions, etc. These people don't feel comfortable using pservers, so this is there chance to test out some things before the game launches.
---
The proof is not in the fact that debuffs were active at the same time, the proof is in the fact that armor was reduced by the amount that you would expect (3500 or so).
---
Server transfers and character renames is what really did this.
---
What’s up with the panic about the layers? How is it abusable by any significant portion of the population when most of them are going to be about level 40 at best by when the layers are supposedly turned off? It seems to have a tiny potential for abuse, how is it viewed as such a catastrophe?
---
Yeah right people with more time to play the game are also going to abuse the fact they have more time to play the game, should we do something about that? Is out leveling everyone cause you can play 15 hours a day abuse of the game? Or using auctions to gain gold and in turn gain more gold and control the market?
---
How many rogues does it take to kill a paladin?
---
Two. One to get the paladin to bubblehearth, the other to finish the job at the Iron forge inn.

He still plays but not nearly as much as he  used to.
---
It's for 2 weeks. Reported.
---
yup. here. 2 weeks
---
*Ahh shit, here we go again*
---
I'd argue layering will make Classic launch closer to Vanilla launch, so why not do it if it helps 'make the same game again'?
---
Played vanilla at 500-600ms in vanilla basically ruled out playing any melee characters

---
Yeah... not being able to play the game the first 2 weeks due to no layering/sharding is a WAY better option.  
---
If you prefer to just look at the login screen be my guest but i rather enjoy a smooth launch experience where i can play the actual game and then 2 weeks later layering is gone forever as said in many interviews already.  
---
90% of the population won't even get to level 60 before layering is removed so no worries.
---
I don't understand the question.
---
For years I wanted the game to be more like vanilla but I would have no idea how to manage that on modern wow.
---
The closer classic came the less I cared about modern wow.
---
This is specifically so they dont have dead servers. Jesus you guys cant fucking read OR listen
---
That's still better than waiting for 50 minutes because there's 150 man competing over tagging Sarkoth in Valley of Trials.
---
Your argument was beaten, they have said guilds will be on the same layer. Now you propose that people will want to actively make multiple guilds to abuse layer switching... ughh. Grow up.
---
i'm so ready for the bc heroic and attunement grind. that's the best endgame of any expansion IMO. in general, all expansions kinda get better when you can just go play vanilla when after reaching raidlogging
---
Sure, Reddit accounts are free, dude.
---
Our lord hath spoken
---
I personally want to use it to figure out what class I want to main. A chance to level out a few to 30 before launch is reason enough to dive into the beta for me
---
Old accounts and time subscribed.
---
441ms ? Damn you had 56k modem back then naah ? :)
---
The sheer joy of getting a new item excites me. Even though the item may just be a green or a blue.
---
Official?
---
I never understand idiots who argue with Mythic Raiding. Why the fuck would anyone waste time on that garbage?
---
There fixed end point is actually the end of Phase 1. They say they hope the population stabilizes and they can merge the layers a few weeks in, but the actual deadline they've set for the removal of layering is the end of Phase 1
---
I like everything about layering except the phasing to other layers. So if im farming Black Lotuses, the Tidal charm trinket, getting ganked etc i can just ask a friend or discord for an invite and come on over to another layer. Someone just killed the 5 min respawn quest mob? No problem, lets try another shard. 
---
I understand the motivation behind it and how it will help keep casuals around for longer etc but it really kills the immersion for me. This mean that i can't copse camp that mage who killed me when I was fighting a mob with no mana without him getting an invite and jumping to another layer. 
---
Tbh they could probably fix this by having that you just can only swap layers if the guy you group up with is within X range of you.
---
Having oceanic servers so we can play at reasonable ping like the millions of other players that are able too is not against the spirit of classic
---
MW2 was the start of everything wrong with COD today, so this isn't exactly the best comparison to make.
---
It seriously amazes me that Blizz is actually going through with this crazy project and doing nearly everything possible to remain true to Vanilla and here we are watching people moan about something so ultimately inconsequential.
---
You forgot the /s
---
Honestly, man, I’d say fuck optimal and play whatever the hell ya’ll want. Any hybrid class can do all of its roles competantly until endgame raiding, so you’ll have options for classes to play. But the cloth, leather, mail split is not a bad idea at all.
---
Pally healers can wear any gear, so those are super flexible. Druid tanks are badass if you want an alternate leather class (lack of a nonCD rez sucks for healing). But other than that, my first point still stands. Just have fun :)
---
What? I can't hear what you're saying over this loud ass crying.
---
^^^feed ^^^me ^^^downvotes
---
Well, good thing it’s a good trinket but not the only one you can use in pvp. Shocking right?
---
I agree with you. The same company that produced 7500 original collectors editions (citation needed) won’t be deliberately short selling this CE. In any case the statue is awesome but I won’t have regrets if I don’t get my hands on it.
---
It does not. I had the option to subscribe when my last expansion was Draenor.
---
I haven't seen anything official, but I'd guess at 8am Pacific, server reset time.
---
So you're saying there's a chance?
---
Right? Either we sit and wait behind 30,000 people in a queue, or the communities aren't fully established for a few weeks.
---
I know what I'm picking.
---
Find a way to use Classic WoW as a teaching instrument for a week
---
If that would have been the server's natural state then yes, it's ruined.
---
Gonna roll a shaman, but not sure what professions to pick. I'm thinking skinning and mining, save up the ores and use them for engineering at 60. 
---
Is mining a good money maker at lv 60?
---
Is mining easy to keep up whilst leveling or will I constantly have to hunt around for ores?
---
You'll want to have 2-3 for your pet, one for Feign Trap, ideally one for your melee spells. Except for Feign Trap I think none of these are absolute must haves, just nice QoL improvements that you copy paste once and then use because they're neat.
---
Change the dates, you have time!
---
You’re not wrong in that assumption. In fact, most of the comments I am seeing against layering are based on rather incorrect assumptions of how it works.
---
Even “takes” based on information released from Blizzard regarding layering has been skewed drastically.
---
First off, they have already stated multiple times they cannot release world bosses until layering is completely turned off.
---
Also, layering will be used to handle player loads based on their location. So, you will most likely be able to see all of the players currently active in your zone. The “most likely” comment was used because it is unreasonable (as stated) for players to be able to enjoy playing in Elwynn forest with 500 other players in the same zone. So, there may be additional layering used to help handle the initial load for the first few weeks.
---
After that, players will go back to work, back to school, back to... life in general. And the likelihood that there will be 500 players in the same zone at the same time will be pretty remote. However, they also want to enable 1000 players to go nuts in PvP in the same zone, or fight over world bosses for five hours, so removing the layering simply is a must-have after those first few weeks.
---
1 of the thousand reasons vanilla was better! The guus back then knew exactly how to make a beautiful living and immersive world. It will be a shame to not have intense weather effects in classic wow!

Questing and meeting up with new people to overcome difficult quests/objectives. Something that just doesn't exist/is necessary in current WoW.
---
Yeah I think he's also the one who started Project 60 and the following Projects on retail as well.
---
&gt; Now you propose that people will want to actively make multiple guilds to abuse layer switching... ughh. Grow up.
---
LOL
---
So their initial promise that sharding was only for the starter zones was a lie.
---
So their initial promise that sharding was only for the first few weeks, was also a lie.
---
I'm not going to be surprised, I totally expected this from the moment they mentioned sharding. They got a completely different server architecture for retail, so stabilizing one realm with 3000 players are never going to happen with this iteration of Blizztard.
---
I think you're right. I always make the mistake of thinking that the Reddit hive mind is unanimous.
---
Our kid is 11 months old and we play quite a lot, she sleeps like 4 hours (2x2 hours)  during the day and go to sleep at 6pm, and sleeps for 12 hours. You can survive on 6 hours of sleep, so you'll have 10 hours of baby sleep time you can play on per day!
---
Troll has hp regeneration in combat making your kiting time healing time. (Sort of)
---
You can finally tell your gf your gay.
---
That's awesome, thank you!
---
Neither have increased survivability over the other. If you're playing a PvP server that isn't true at all, and Undead will have Will of The Forsaken which is probably one of the most powerful PvP abilities in the game.
---
But in terms of just leveling neither really have a distinct advantage. Just play which ever one looks cooler.
---
In a personal level, the only 2 things I'm interested in if I were to get in on the beta, is 1) try out everything we learnt from private servers as far as min maxing go and see if it really is the same on Classic. Coz we know there's gonna be small differences here and there, but we won't know just exactly how much it's gonna affect gameplay until someone documents it. And 2) freakin report bugs no matter how small and no matter whether or not you manage to replicate it (which is why streaming beta is a great thing, because more often than not when you encounter a bug you can't replicate it yourself, so it at least gives devs an idea of what you were doing at the time), as that'd what a beta is for in the first place.
---
Because if the server crashes you arent able to play the game.
---
Temporary layering. Relax.
---
My account is from around 2004 ithink
---
Layers disappearing happens once. And after 2 weeks. Server merges would happen far later.
---
Again, layers are lasting for a couple of weeks. You are exaggerating the reach layering will have on a community and exploits. This is not something that is lasting for a long time.
---
If you're going to just assume the exact opposite of what Blizzard are officially saying, what's the point in even debating?
---
Great post. They also said during the interview with Esfand and StaySafe that their goal is to not have any type of sharding or layering when Phase 2 comes out.
---
Which is totally fine if you ask me. The hype will be serious for the first weeks, after that it will drop off. By the time most people reach 60 I bet it won't be an issue at all.
---
Content of the game has absolutely nothing to do with the boycott. It was about dedicated servers and in the end no-one gave a shit, they all played it anyway. This screenshot was launch day.
---
They already stated they guilds will have a tendency to default towards the same layer. 🤷‍♂️
---
The general feeling in the community, though, is that wod was worse than cata. And bfa is right up there with wod for the worst received expansion. 
---
Of course that doesn't mean everyone hates it, everyone has their personal taste. I thought mop was worse than wod, but to many others, mop was their favorite.
---
First of all, the queue would become massive once phase 2 hits and they drop the Layers (unless you expect 85% of players to have dropped off by the time phase 2 hits).
---
They did specifically state that once phase 2 hits and there are no more layers, you would be put in a queue if there are too many online characters on your realm, and worst case offer free realm transfers.
---
The layers are there to prevent the need for doing realm transfers once the tourists have left. 
---
If they allow more than 2-3 layers for each realm, we should be concerned since that implies they expect a mass exodus after a month or two.
---
The way they explained it, some realms won't even have layers, as long as the total pop is not too big. It's a dynamic system.
---
Preferably most realms would have 2 layers that are scaled down to 1 after a month or so.
---
Just do a free trial of modern wow on it and see for yourself how it works.
---
Or all the people that will cry on the forums about any small change.
---
Layering should be in 1-10 maybe 1-20 starting zones only. After that it is way to much. We were told starting zones only and now were getting screwed.
---
Yes, imagine doing that. Oh wait, you're the one that keeps doing it. But I'll leave you with the last word. Let me know how your plans of defeating in blizzard offices go.
---
My main was a Hunter in TBC when I first played WoW 12 years ago.
---
However I grew out of the "bow and arrow" fantasy and much rather enjoy the "sword and board" leading the charge kinda role I played in WotLK, MoP and WoD and other games as well.
---
Now, for Classic, the only viable tank is Warrior. 
---
But my favorite class to play and tank with is the Paladin due to it's theme (holy knight kinda crusader theme) and gameplay. I've been looking at all kinds of guides, professions, macros, etc in order to optimize the Prot Paladin performance, /sit is not a thing to proc reckoning and redoubt anymore so we'll see about that. 
---
And I know I'll be victim of quite a bit of Classism but hey fuck it I'll play what I enjoy the most. Might even level in Prot.
---
This is something I don't see as much as I expected but surely some other people feel the same? Balance druids, disc priests, arcane mages, survival hunters (lol), and so on.
---
&gt; He also mentioned that the mob "Fire Roc" doesn't have the ability "Spit Fire" on private servers, except that they do.
---
When he says pservers he clearly means some shit subset of pservers. So much of the blatant bullshit he spews about "pservers" can be explained by the fact that he only knows about some pservers and thinks they are all the same.
---
Take my downvote and lave or i will call the manager

B-b-b-but I'll never see that Tauren who picked up that Peacebloom 3 miles off in the distance in Mulgore ever agin!
---
Does the computer turn on?
---
Then it can run Classic WoW. I think there are some modern graphical options that you can turn on, but by default everything is essentially a game from 2006.
---
That garbage is just as hard as Naxx was back in vanilla. I'd know I've done both. So yeah, it might not be your thing, it might not suit your tastes, you might not be good enough for it, but it's not garbage. It's there for a reason. If you can't even understand why, don't speak about it because then you're the one who looks like an idiot
---
+ Blizzard adds spells for some mobs making it impossible anymore to farm on some spots that people would AOE Farm before.
---
Idk if these spells existed back in the days or not though.
---
That's what my solo warlock is for lol, to have fun. In the 3-man group I will want to play optimal class and spec for raiding later on. That's why I asked for best healer, best tank and best dps options in a 3-man setting. I know healing and dps got a few more options but in vanilla the only real raid viable tank is prot warr, a shame but it is the reality.
---
Boobies
---
It comes naturally by playing the game. you don’t have to try and find the bugs to find them, they are found when enough people play the game :)
---
This is the great news I wanted to hear.
---
I get that they're nervous about not having enough people to make up a community on each server but I wish they would let it run naturally for a few weeks and then adjust and turn it on if needed.
---
I also havent received my beta invite. I'm gonna have my mom call the CEO in the morning.
---
Exact same, I made a lost a month ago or so saying literally don't care for anything but the game to be classic again as that is when the role play was golden.
---
Probably same people that were defending shards. I personally think there are better alternatives involving server merges (and optimizing for those merges from the start), but this layering thing sounds like it could be ok. I'm at least reserving judgement until we see how the beta goes. And even if it's not ideal, it's still not a deal breaker for me.
---
Well i guess mg girlfriend and I wont go to Rome
---
Because you're no more important than anyone else, you self-righteous prick.
---
Hope you should reschedule your wedding, but if that's not possible, then no worries even if you started 3 months late and finally hit 60 at the 6 month mark... People will still be doing MC and just starting BWL for the hardcore players (if there will be any). If you pvp the. It doesn't matter at all.
---
Played vanilla-present, vanilla took up far more of my time then any other game... Ever.
---
So... people can't be pissed about layering and still plan to play the game?
---
You know, in an ideal scenario where someone might actually give a shit that you didn't pay $60 out of a million people who did, you mocking this kind of thing would maybe make sense, but in our society you're actually more likely to get attention by actively being a customer and trying to garner some social momentum for the change you want by rallying other customers and making your voice heard.
---
But yeah, super ironic zing! Dude, awesome, right on, bro. Remember those video game players who wanted something better for their community but got assfucked because the publishing company wanted to save money? LMAO losers. By the way, aren't we here because we aren't happy where WoW went? Nevermind, I mean LOL holy shit those MW2 DIPSHITS ahaha they BOUGHT THE GAME ANYWAY?? WOW
---
I used to do that on my tauren druid, for sure. (It's a lot dicier to do it on a druid than a rogue, but what are you gonna do.) Those were the days!
---
(I'm embarrassed to see that I seem to be ret in the picture... I think I had just gotten the Runeblade out of stratholme and was experimenting with it for a while.)
---
Yep. You can apply it to literally anything and make any idea seem awful.
---
Give them a fucking chance.
---
See that I've tried. Its shoddy, I'm not gonna lie...but I think if Classic is less demanding it should work.
---
Yeah I noticed this on a few named mobs, if they’re surrounded by others there’s a good chance you’ll need a hand to get out alive, as I believe it should, I tried a hit and run but the daze got me!
---

---
best to just remember the good times mate, this is one of the rare occasions where you think you do, but you don't is unironically true
---
You can’t really say it’s the same. Layering is not zone-based, so a single layer will have a population of around 2,5k players and will be for the whole world. Also, people will not change layers unless they join the group of someone in a different layer, and people will be prioritized for the same layers. It’s not perfect, but it creates a smooth launch as well as preventing servers from dying when the «tourists» leave
---
Also the "you are in place 3500 in queue" problems
---
Ænima?
---
I was already an adult with a full time job and my own house when vanilla came out (yeah I'm *that* old), I didn't have the chance to play it back then (I started at the end of TBC), I do now and I'm happy about it.
---
NO WAY I'd want to be 15 yo again anyway, sure I'd have more free time but no job and *no extra money* to spend on whatever entertainment I see fit, *mom bitching* about playing too much or games are a waste of time or add-whatever-here.
---
People are just being delusional believing noone knows what they're getting into, sure there will be people that have no idea and will cry the game is too hard or lack QoL or whatever, but there are others who will appreciate it for sure and stay long term.
---
Time will tell.
---
Athene is not a nice bean
---
It won’t be temporary. I promise you, it will persist.
---
It’s like when they said sharding will only exist in starter zones. 
---
The goal post is being constantly moved
---
Realm identity was very much a thing until 3.3, cross realm bgs will not ruin realm identity in classic.
---
It shows a level of progress, wheels in motion. Something we can see, more than "soon(TM)".
---
You're gonna die a lot if you don't move your character portrait near the middle. Won't even see your health. I do that and i only have a 24".
---
You're welcome! Have fun! :-)
---
G'day!
---
I *lived* WoW from late 2004 all the way through to 2007~, where I just stopped playing and never went back.  
---
Classic WoW has me excited to re-live those days though, but this time I want to do it differently;
---
I never played Horde back in the OG WoW days. Always alliance. Every toon.  
---
So here's my question;  
---
For those who have a lot of experience on both sides of the fence, **what would you say are the pros and cons of the levelling experience as a Horde member?**  
---
:)
---
There wasn't until yesterday =)
---
Thanks, Blizz dev very cool. Appreciate the insider info.
---
It's because these fucking idiots don't actually watch the reference/source video to see what Ion is actually saying. They just see the concept explained by other retards and decide that they hate it as well.
---
Here are the specific listed system requirements for Classic Wow as of April.
---
&gt;Processor
---
Minimum: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlon XP 1500+
---
Recommended: Dual-core processor, such as the Intel Pentium D or AMD Athlon 64 X2
---
&gt;Memory
---
Minimum: 512 MB RAM (1GB for Vista users)
---
Recommended: 1 GB RAM (2 GB for Vista users)
---
&gt;Video
---
Minimum: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM Such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce 2 class card or better
---
Recommended: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM Such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or better
---
People fail to realize this is what theyre bitching about.
---
It's 2019, anyone playing classic already has their close knit group theyll be playing with. 9/10 youre gonna get fucking pissed at that shaman for tagging that mob instead of being like, "oh look I can make a friend!" 
---
Fuck outta here.
---
You do know that layering only lasts for max 2 weeks right? (source: many interviews with the classic devs)  
---
90%++ of the population won't even be near level 60 yet.  
---
Soooo doubt people will get a chance to abuse it as you mention. Also that guy that joins the dungeon group is actually from your realm if he does that for half a day then the whole server will know about him and he's screwed to ever join a grp again.
---
Because if you don't jump when going in an instance portal, you'll never convince me you're not a bot.
---
Can someone crop this for 1920x1080? Thanks!
---
This and itemization issues is potentially enough to make it so I will not play. WoW is something that sucks me into it for 12-16 hours a day. If I'm going to be playing in a fucked hacked up version of the game, it's not really worth the investment.
---
You didn't replace your gear in hellfire peninsula. I still had some bwl and aq40 gear when I hit 70. However itemization got a lot more versatile in tbc so you did get greens that weren't necessary stronger but had better stat distribution for your specific spec
---
Yes, Ion said first few weeks.
---
5:20 or so he literally says "first few weeks".
---
Classic progress will be a lot easier compared to overtuned private server raids.
---
The crying face at the bottom is awsome :D
---
No recount. I like it
---
^ exactl, how are so many people who comment so stupid?
---
It makes no sense to go back to classic if we just repeat history of wow going casual, spoon fed with flying mounts all over the place.
---
Like...if anyone is reading this that wants the expansions, please explain how you can't see this is not a good thing.
---
They aren't doing this out of the goodness of their hearts.
---
I really don't think many of us are going to mind come launch day, when there are healthy populations in the starting zones and no queues. I know I won't- as long as he is right. If I will see the same people throughout the zone and it won't fade in and out like sharding, I will be a happy Dwarf.
---
Which is essentially what they are doing with layering. Your suggestion is simply less cost-efficient but has the exact same outcome.
---
Like it makes no sense. Do they actually think that layering means the starter zones are going to be empty? Jesus Christ I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.
---
I had great respect for those that had the original unarmored mount in vanilla. It was a very rare mount and should stay that way. 
---
I don’t want to see every single troll on a white raptor; it would feel like we cheated those that originally had one (I did not).
---
But how can they possibly do that in a seamless way? If a shard only holds 3000 ppl and then it puts guilds on the same shard what happens when someone new logs in? Will someone be booted from the existing shard? Will someone random be deprioritized on their current shard because a guildie logged in somewhere?
---
The shards wont be combined. You will sit in dragonmaw2 until people start logging into it. So you could have 3K people in dragonmaw1 and you could be fully on your own in dragonmaw 2.
---
Your son will understand why you weren't there for his birth. Your wife, not so much. But you can always get a new one, whereas you'll never get to experience classic WoW at launch ever again.
---
It being a system determined by "convoluted variables" is 100% speculation on your part. Blizzard has said that they're like glasses of water, once one is full, they start filling up the next. Nothing convoluted about that at all.
---
25% chance of seeing that player again the next day if you're standing ontop of each other is fucking _awful_ and it honestly speaks volumes that you think it's "not that low". This sub had a minor riot last time it was announced that sharding would be in the starter areas for the first few weeks, and now we're accepting continent-wide sharding for potentially months instead. The fact that this is blindly accepted without any promises of a max duration (phase 2 is released when Blizzard wants to release it, after all...) is ridiculous and I can only assume most people who are fine with it have forgotten or simply never experienced how important the community is even while leveling.
---
Even private servers with 10k people _in the same world_ started feeling like a sea of faceless strangers. Now we could very well be looking at twice that, with sharding.
---
There is such a thing as too much negativity in your life.
---
[YES HERE WE GO BOYS I GOT GREEN!](https://imgur.com/UIBoOYY)
---
Yeah, didn't the data say the average wow player was 28 during vanilla. Retail players are just dirty that no one likes their shitty game.
---
that's the same kind of logic that makes everyone hate baby boomers, just because someone wasn't born in the right time period to experience something originally it doesn't mean that they should be left out.
---
Also being called post ironic but being ironic doesnt make sense.
---
Layers affect the game as long as they are there. Server merges don't affect gameplay at all.
---
We currently have no idea how long the layering system will be in place. All we have is a statement that they 'plan' to turn it off at some point during content phase 1. No word on what they'll do if layering is still required, population-wise, after 'a few weeks'.
---
&gt; actually believing that they will remove sharting after phase 1
---
Yikes.
---
Thats crazy though, Being denied even a chance at black lotus becasue you didn't log into the lucky shard?
---
Starting zones were simultaneously hilarious and miserable.
---
STV was.. old STV times x100. It was a fucking actual nightmare. I don't know how anyone can say 13k pop was a good idea.
---
first version of wow, so a chance for players who want to check it out, see how everything began, but feel overwhelmed by the current version after countless world/story altering expansions.
---
Layering, or even sharding, was never intended to solve overcrowded zones. The goal of both is one thing: to prevent dead servers. Dead servers means the core part of Classic (the community) dies as well. It defeats the entire purpose of the project.
---
Fair point! but you understand the game will be completely unplayable without layering/sharding on launch. 
---
If they didn’t bring in layering we would all be complaining on launch week about the failure that is blizzard and how they still haven’t learnt to launch a WoW game.
---
I believe this is the perfect compromise and if they stay true to their word I can definitely handle this. 
---
Fingers crossed!
---
This needs to be higher up!
---
I don't get these comments.
---
First: we want classic because the expansions suck
---
Ok you get classic but we will have expansions and repeat the cycle 
---
And now: yay I can't wait for the expansions again!
---
Like what the actual fuck is wrong with people?
---
We all want classic as it is a totally different game, soon as you hit tbc and past that then it is not classic.
---
Move to the EU, many EU countries will start first week of September. For those of us that have regular jobs, it was always the case we would have to play after work or phone in sick....
---
Its literally the second post on this fucking subredit, after the stickies. Its like 30sec of a video you had to watch to understand this shit. He says "...each of which has a capacity similar to what the original servers did on launch" he also says right after "as the people spread out in the world we can increase the capacity of the layers, and decrees the number of layers to host those players"
---
But you should know this cause you are also have comments under that thread, so you are either obtuse on purpose, didnt even watch the video or just really dumb.
---
The coolest part about battlegrounds were that we could have rivalries back in the day, talking crap on the forums to other guilds and premises . I really hated this change but I can see people not wanting high que times
---
Side note: they said they won’t (can’t) release world bosses until layering is gone. As for general mobs, on a layered server, you won’t be fighting for mobs with another invisible player from another layer - what you see is what you get. Same with running into other players. 
---
The only way they will leave your layer is by joining a group in another layer or by leaving the zone, into another zone that is managed by a different layer, which will be adjusted dynamically based on players on the realm itself. (So it won’t be a constant thing players will be able to continuously utilize as a means of griefing or other such nonsense).
---
Also, I think this will actually replicate the way zone breaks used to work, where the old servers wouldn’t show players in another zone, so you could stack up a group on one side of a zone, and when everyone ran in, it looked like an army was spawning directly on you. So I think this is actually going to be VERY much like vanilla WoW in that regard.
---
“Have a classic summer!”
---
There should be a faction balance display tool to show the population % of the factions for a given server. I think most people will help to try and balance a server's population because most don't want long as BG queue times being the high population faction.
---
I am strictly against cross realm BGs. Make the server populations larger if you have to.
---
They are doing it to keep stable happy community's long term as much as possible, and this feels like an excellent compromise
---
You'll also eliminate a bunch of other players since 13k pop was not at all how Classic WoW was. I hope you're not one of the people advocating for #NoChanges as increasing the population of a server by more than 4x is a huge change.
---
Cross realm bgs were very good . Server identity isn't important in pvp. In pvp people want to be the best, not just the best on a team on their 1 server.
---
Yeah, and they were pissed because every other COD before that had dedicated servers and the game would literally pause and take 20 seconds of staring at a loading bar to force hosting on another player with varying quality if the current host left or quit the game which happens pretty fucking often in random deathmatch FPS games. 
---
This was in a transitory period between the point where everyone had dedicated servers for gaming and before official matchmaking was an industry standard.
---
By the way, every single game with said industry standard matchmaking now has dedicated servers! Wow!
---
Twat.
---
... Launches in vanilla
---
A good reason why you should never eat too much broccoli
---
I stand corrected.
---
If you can run Guild Wars 2, then you can run WoW easily.
---
Sharding was taken off of the table because people begged and pleaded for another solution. Just make more servers and merge them, people cried. Blizzard delivers that with the added benefit of never having to have a forced name change and it's *those begging people* that moved the goalpost. Suddenly it's not a good enough solution.
---
Since classic will run on the bfa client I won't hope for "it's classic wow it'll run on everything"
---
WoD was badly received because it forced people to spend a lot of time in their garrison instead of playing the game as they wanted. BFA is back to the old horde vs alliance as an attempt to get back to the roots, but sadly in practice it was badly implemented.
---
I agree that it's a matter of preference, but as all such matters, if you don't like it, you don't like it. It doesn't make it bad. You just don't like it is all. Too many people think they're the center of gravity of the whole universe and Classic should be like they want. But from Blizzard's PoV, it MUST be a success and for that it has to be "good enough" for as many people as possible. Which means compromises must be had.
---
But sadly, too many people in this sub don't get it
---
Needs a field for average viewercount aswell.
---
Money
---
They could, that would be great. But nothing they've said so far indicates that they will.
---
Kingdoms Will Burn from the Legion soundtrack/login music.
---
You don't get the point.
---
Well it’s a test and not a jerk of for either retail or returning classic players. They want people who actively play video games to get in, so they know people will actually play it.
---
Im fine with layering, if /World covers all layers
---
If you watch any of the videos the “first few weeks” is still their expectation.
---
If they said it'll happen, it'll happen. People are assuming the exact opposite of what Blizzard are officially saying. There is no point arguing anything if that is the stance of everyone.
---
I was supposed to get married next year...
---
I’m assuming they meant waiting for it to actually release, even though the wording is off.
---
Great explanation! Layering does seem like a happy, temporary in-between.
---
You have just given me the best idea. Thank you.
---
Honest question, indeed. However, don't expected an honest answer, especially not from Blizzard. It's just a blatant cash grab. Speak with your wallets, don't subscribe for a CHANCE of getting into the Beta, yada yada yada
---
Again, assuming the layers will actually have numbers that people can see. Why are we just assuming they will?
---
they did that in cataclysm
---
World PvE is your most authentic kind of PvE. That's where the identity of servers should be kept in tact. Not in dungeons. Dungeons are almost like an arcade in that of itself. A game within a game. World PvE will always be the most authentic.
---
Cross realm dungeon finder makes sense for dungeons.
---
Annnd now there another thread going on about getting expansions and so many people seem to welcome it, legit have no idea what is going on in this community.
---
Athene was such a good troll back in the days. I watched ever single video of him. Followed his journey to raise 10 million dollars but after he started making the bitcoin stuff and making video games I don't follow him anymore.
---
Thanks for your reply! I know who sodapoppin is, just lookin for the original video :) i dont understand why the wow Guy is in the video though
---
Well let me tell you - BFA was fun for me for a couple of weeks. Of course there is Problems but the biggest one for me was that it became repetetive and boring. 
---
That only sets in after a couple of weeks though so go ahead and have yourself a good time!
---
Will this game be subscription based or pay one time? Considering there wont be any new content etc. Also are they gonna make divine shield purgable this time? So it doesnt become something scrubs can use to save themselves from being bad.
---
That's the mindset of someone who never wanted to be on top. You can't be truly on top without being able to fight vs everyone that plays the game, trying to be the best in a smaller group of the whole player base and disregarding the rest cause you'll never play with them is cowardly .
---
Oh it’s a dwarf... sorry from far away I thought that was a panda head lol
---
I think people are overreacting over the fact that layering will be implemented. Servers with long-term healthy populations are needed, and on launch the swarm of people demands a certain type of isolation. This solves both imo. 
---
The communication from Blizzard was not clear and precise enough, I agree but this system sounds much better than sharding. 
---
* You will never be able to meet a player from another server (realm) and never see them again.
---
* Guildmates are preferred to be put on the same layer. Friends that you play with are likely to be in the same guild as you.
---
* If you group up with someone outside your layer, you will be transferred to that layer permanently until you group up with another player who is outside your layer.
---
My problem isn't my job or boss, it's my fiance not wanting me to "waste" PTO days on a video game. Feelsbadman.
---
You’re right. Total cash grab. Best if we go play something else. Come on it’s the only way to show them our true outrage.
---
You sure? What if someone is talking in ‘world’ about an event happening and you get to the place and it’s happening on a different layer (opposing faction attacking a town for example)
---
Eso is decent for a few months.
---
I'm not disagreeing that I would rather play against people on my own server, but I also realize peoples time is limited and that waiting 3 hours for an av q isn't fun for anybody.
---
I would rather then triage it so that it tries to match your server, then after 2 mins, it goes to the same sister server every time, then if that one fails after 2 mins a third server but always in the same order to keep the feeling of seeing the same folks over and over
---
Those are all empty arguments, cross realm bgs are good cause it shortens queues and allows you to really be competitive
---
I never said I was more important than anyone else. I asked why their needs should **outweigh** the needs of those who want a true vanilla experience, you illiterate fucktard.
---
According to some of the people who went to the meeting at Irvine, the armor and resistance values are unique to every single boss, and some even have random resistances just for the hell of it. So one example of these thematic armor/resistance values is Garr who supposedly had really high armor just because he was a giant rock elemental, and a second is Kel’Thuzad who had lower armor and high frost/shadow resistance because he’s an undead caster type of creature. 
---
Now I don’t remember the values used on private servers, and IIRC Kel’Thuzad actually has some higher frost/shadow resistance on some private servers, but I’m fairly sure Garr is one of those bosses that just has copy pasted armor values like a ton of other bosses do on private servers. So far I haven’t really heard any concrete numbers so I can’t really attest to how much it can change gameplay and difficulty, but I don’t think it should be discarded at all. If the guesswork does end up being accurate then hey, good job private servers, but if it’s wildly wrong and lower, then I’d say there’s only more hype for the raids! 
---
For us, I think it’s best if we hope they’re wildly wrong, so we actually get the game with some surprises :)
---
Expectation =/= Reality.
---
They have three stress test weekends already scheduled.  I'm thinking that's when us non-streamers will get a chance to log in to classic azeroth
---
yea i currently run 2x 24" but there like 8 years old. 1920x1280 and 60hz refresh, maybe i should stick with same size but just get bigger resolution and 144hz
---
Ok i'll entertain you
---
if we go with his assumed max armor of 3731 the reduction down to 976 (sunder + faery) would bring bloodthirst down to 615 and give that bloodthirst a paper dmg without armor mitigation of 702,5 ignoring the 0,5 as half numbers are not a part of the bloodthirst calculation.
---
if we reduce the armor to 841 (sunder + reckless) the expected bloodthirst damage is 702+99 mitigated down to 712 damage.
---
since his armor max value is still guesswork the 3 missing points are still within reason
---
it proofs the point that the difference of 135 armor make and break his argument
---
Damn, someone is both uneducated and ill-tempered. I thougth the teenagers were playing retail?
---
I asked a question and you couldn't find a source, so I'll take it that you're talking bullshit.
---
You assuming it’s not going to happen =/= they lied.
---
Beta releases later today, then we will have specs 🙂
---
I hope enough people rage quit over this to solve the problem organically.
---
Beta will start when Blizzard wants it to start. Mails will go out at an already predeterminated time, everything's already scheduled. 
---
Besides, soon™
---
1. If you die you lose world buffs, so you must be extremely careful with them. World buffs create awesome world PVP situations where guilds are desperate not to die. Even with worldbuffs, raids are still not always facerolls, since small mistakes still whipes the entire raid.
---
2. Classic classes aren't balanced. and you have no idea what damage the DPS will do in raids, because resistances and armors are very different in private servers. And even if warriors rock, they are most certainly not best DPS in every single boss fight nor in trash.
---
3. It is your opinion that its bad gameplay, i like the fact that you could see extra dedication,  exactly the same thing could be said from all the consumables. World buffs also makes you communicate with other guilds, you can also sell them as bad player.
---
4. World buffs doesnt kill competition, it creates competition. You cannot win without consumables either.
---
5. Making a mistake is more heavily punished if you got world buffs. Noneed to be upset. If you chose to do hour and hours of work to get extra stats and be able to showup ur dps, get ready to be mad when you die.
---
If the guild knows boss tactics  very well and they play well, they will oneshot bosses from mc, bwl and aq40 without worldbuffs. Guilds wich have full world buffs, will whipe if they make mistake.
---
Some races can't even get to exalted before they gets removed so the whole point stinks to begin with. You guys just want something to cry about.
---
I’m totally skipping lol
---
You're confusing popularity with quality. Just because people took a chance and played it, that doesn't mean players didn't prefer dedicated servers. Also, design decisions brought that series down just as much as content, so I'm not sure what your point is in trying to differentiate between the two.
---
Best pvp items come from pve content, undeniably. Some classes more than others, but all classes have a majority of pve items in their absolute pvp BiS set. 
---
Rule of thumb is that AQ40 item level and beyond beats out most R12/13 gear and most weapons are interchangeable. 
---
All in all the difference isn’t that big, but getting pve gear is by far less time consuming if you plan on getting r12 and up.
---
There is no /world in vanilla.
---
Right, just letting a few realms do bgs together is a bandaid fix and crossrealm is more like getting stitches
---
YES exactly! That's where you make your enemies and build up hatred for the opposite faction. Crossrealm BGs can go fuck off.
---
Make the servers LARGER and give us a population balance display for each server!!
---
I agree! People who say this is a deal-breaker for them should be put in a starting zone with 600 other people with standard spawn rates. I'm curious how long they will enjoy it.
---
Am I the only person who clicked this thread expecting a discussion on Class specs?
---
Great.  What about everything else?
---
This subreddit summed up:
---
*  Extremely US centric

* All streamers are bad, especially tipsout. Some youtubers like Madseason and frostadamus are good though.
---
* Every aspect of retail is bad
---
* Vanilla was the most hardcore expansion
---
* Anyone that cares about performance in game is a filthy minmaxer
---
* Vanilla was not meant to be rushed
---
* Warriors are terrible without full epics and also the worst levelers
---
* Druids and locks are good
---
* Private servers are bad
---
* If you didn't play vanilla you don't have a say in anything
---
* Everyone that isn't at least 30 years old is a ''kiddie'' and should go back to fortnite
---
* August 27 is a ''classic summer''
---
If you don't agree with these points you are wrong
---
And then he said he knows they need to get rid of it before phase 2. Few does not mean one or two weeks. It means some (small) amount of weeks. Maybe few weeks means majority of phase 1.
---
People overreact on the internet, no?
---
its not per zone, its per entire world. Its not 3k per starting zone.
---
How does a 14 yr old recognize that? 
---
I was addicted to ffxi at 14 and crawled my way through high school and made money in every way possible BUT getting a job after.
---
Lmao got this myself too, just finished it, was amazing. I now ordered "Rise of the Horde" by Christie Golden. Cant wait for it to arrive.
---
As far as I know you will always be put on the same layer.
---
Eh, it's a 2% drop from a 4-6% drop you can farm about 30 of those every respawning cycle. With a shaman bud of mine we farmed those and greater nature resist recipes.
---
Definitely not easy to find but I wouldn't call it super rare, you're way more likely to get one than an epic for instance
---
Exactly how it was for the original wow launch. Rppvp was added later.
---
71 downvotes? dude you got fucking Rrrrrrrrrekt brah! LOL
---
I wish I knew how low the bar was to get flown out to play Alpha and get a Beta invite, seems like every youtuber with even 10k subs got one.
---
If you don't want to have dead servers, do what they originally wanted - implement sharding on sub level 20 zones. Done, no harm done to the population, economy and PvP, yet servers are stable, tourists are gone and new players get their stable servers.
---
Instead they are doing some kind of Frankenstein monster of a solution that is worse in every conceivable way than the original intent.
---
Aside from teachers, most jobs are year round.
---
He’s talking about the collectors edition pets. You will probably never see one of them they will be so rare, imagine getting upset about that.
---
What's that?
---
Even if there is no number it can still be found out, you severely underestimate players
---
Nailed it
---
From my understanding of layering, won't the starting zone still have 600 people?
---
Layering is better but it is still horrible. In all examples it revolves around idea that population will drop to less than 1k players. But what if it doesnt happen? What if vanilla wow is not garbage game like retail and population will increase instead?
---
Good. Dynamic respawns are stupid and reward tactics like sitting and area grinding for XP. Leveling up should be an adventure.
---
If there’s twice as many people selling that means there will be twice as many people buying...
---
I think Realm chat should not be implemented, especially until the Realm is not consolidated to a single layer. It makes sense that what you read in Zone chat is related only to your Layer, so you don't miss any event happening.
---
&gt; that's the same kind of logic that makes everyone hate baby boomers
---
Wow, are you a professional moron or is it just a full-time hobby of yours? I have nothing against "truly new players" whatsoever and I never said anyone should be "left out". I asked why their needs should **outweigh** the needs of others, to which you still haven't provided any kind of response.

---
3:53 Onwards
---
\- High server capacity with as few servers as possible
---
\- No dynamic spawning
---
\- First few weeks only
---
\- Unlike sharding in retail which is per zone, layering is copies of the entire world
---
\- Each layer has a capacity similar to vanilla server
---
\- As people spread out they can increase the # of people in one layer and decrease the # of layers until there's only 1
---
When you open the Blizz app, at the bottom to the right you will see a drop down showing which version you have (for me it’s bfa). Click that. I believe you can also check your account and it will be listed there.
---
I knew more people that did this than I would care to admit
---
Haha, Volume 2 will be arriving on the 18th and Volume 3 will be arriving on the 21st. Yes, all planned as such.
---
Stuff like this makes me like Ion and think because of him (and the community outcry) Classic is coming. He seems to really love the original game and it’s a shame and confusing that BFA doesn’t reflect this or show any passion.
---
Why would it? It's explicitly there to manage server load while having few enough servers that they all have good population by the time phases 2-5 roll around. Once the population inevitably shrinks as the tourists leave, what reason is there to continue layering?
---
Highschool gang :(
---
Yeah this is official
---
Yup, I was in my 30s for vanilla. The friend who hooked me and with whom I played was in his 40s at the time.
---
&gt;  that line of thinking is a logical fallacy.
---
It's only a fallacy if the underlying reasoning cannot applied to further instances. If they can, however, it's not a fallacy. In this case, the underlying reasoning for introducing sharding/layering ("too many people in one place") can be applied throughout WoW, and thus, fearing that layering does not get shelved is reasonable. It doesn't mean that this is a necessary outcome, but it's not a logical fallacy to be wary of layering getting continued use.
---
He never said anything that suggests players won’t disappear when they’re invited to another group.
---
You can play it with an active subscription to retail. I don‘t know if there is any other cost.
---
I guess divine shield will not be purgable, because it was some expansions later where skills that could would be introduced.
---
You ask in the chat to get invited by people who are in the layer where the event is happening?
---
cashgrab
---
Mods really need to start removing these uninformed nonsense reactionary posts.
---
The day before my birthday, let's go.
---
My GF: "You're not gonna play THAT much, right?" 
---
Me: Yes.
---
Cmon man you can’t honestly mean that. This is not modern wow.
---
Layering doesnt do anything to overpopulation of starting zones. They are going to be FILLED to the max. That true wow launch feeling when you cant kill shit.
---
Its SHARDING that "fixes" overpopulation per zone.
---
If you're gonna play swords then yes, there is a difference. If you're using daggers it doesn't matter (PVE)  
---
In PvP I would say dwarf racial is the most useful and human is decent too.
---
What kind of calendar always starts with the first day in the top left? How do you know what day of the week it will be? So confusing
---
he kinda went [off the rails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FETDudTcFXg) a few years ago. not sure what he's been up to since
---
I was wondering if the news would be too new for the next episode but guess you hussled it out. will enjoy my drive to work :)
---
There is no winning with part of a classic community. Whatever Blizzard does, people will complain. Thanks for posting this, nice explanation!
---
I'm not going to respond further since you don't seem to have the capability to carry on a civil conversion, I hope your day gets better.
---
I think that is good tbh, it lets not just the big guys have a chance at growth but smaller channels as well.
---
Why don't you include Cross-realm function to Layering? If you get invited by Billy, you'll be transported to Layer 2 from Layer 1. Exactly how sharding works.
---
If Layer 1 reaches X amount of players, future log-ins goes to Layer 2, exactly like sharding does it.
---
Sharding, or Layering, as the brilliant minds at Blizzard have fooled thousands with now, is one and the same thing. It's just re-named and introduced as something different, except that it's exactly the same thing.
---
You could use your sharding example and skip the layering example and it would still end up being the same after 3-12 weeks.
---
It doesn't matter if you split 1 realm into 4 (sharding) or create 4 realms using the same realm name, with all the same features as sharding. It'll still be the same. A green Apple and a Red Apple are both Apples. They may appear different, but they are the same ultimately the same fruit.
---
Hi, /u/Sparky780
---
This was exactly my concern and why Ive been constantly telling her she wont recognize the person shes been dating for at least a week.
---
I made it a point to unsub from r/wow and r/Overwatch. I think you're right and a lot of folks just haven't unsubbed.
---
Well that would certainly be a change.
---
I know i'm wasting my time but as i said in my comment.
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=236
---
Layering is the best solution to the problem but too many whiners can't get that in their heads. It's fine just ignore them. The only potential issue is in regards of the chat channels, especially /trade.All the flippers are gonna be pissed/hurt if their target audience is reduced by Blizzard. So in that regard I think /trade should be layer-independant. On the other hand, other channels should be layer-specific so people don't start looking for that one orc in goldshire that's actually on a different layer...
---
I would assume that each layer has a soft cap, so for example random person logging in will get put in layer 4 with 1400 players instead of layer 1 with 2133 players, but the hard cap will be higher so that players who are "supposed" to be on a certain layer can still be on it if they log in.
---
That’s not a game within a game though. It’s content actually within the world that you have to go to, get a group for, and enter it. You can’t just walk into warsong gultch and start fighting shit or Arathi Basin. It’s a competitive PvP arcade that was added to the game. You have to que for it and to make it faster they made it cross realm. You will be competing against people on your realms and all other realms. You’ll start to recognize certain people, and form rivalry’s. It still happens in retail today. What’s gone from retail is the immersion within the world. You never see anyone anymore out and about and world PvP is non existent.
---
Yes but there is general, trade amongst others where the same principle applies.
---
It's really crazy that they change their plans. I didn't like when they changed their plans from 4 phases to 6 phases. Or when they scaled back loot trading to raids only.  /s
---
Every case they are very clearly listening to us. We complained the hell about sharding because it presented legitimate gameplay problems, despite helping the server launch experience. This is their response to that, they designed a system to try and solve the same problems sharding did without being anywhere as disruptive for the gameplay. I personally like it, but can definitely see some issues, and it's good that those are being expressed. But we can express them constructively rather than just "blizzard is awful and wants to ruin classic"
---
Having _at least_ 2-3x as many materials floating around as there should be is a big deal, especially during the early formative months.  It doesn't matter if there are 900 players or 9,000-- one realm should have one game world's worth of resources to go around.  Not several instances feeding into one coherent AH.
---
My thoughts on this: You're doing exactly what Activision Blizzard wants and expects you to do.
---
So when they remove layering we'll have mega servers? Or do they hope enough people leave before phase 2 to where the pop is so small it fits on a regular server? Either way, there are several layers to each server, that is splitting it up.
---
Yes but there is no /world which the post I replied to addressed.
---
Sticky this please.
---
The way his right eye slighty drifts off to the side clearly means classic will have mount shops and max level boosts.
---
I would imagine that the game engine does a name query across all current layers of the realm. Jesus.
---
I think you are going to have a problem tanking raids because paladins don't have taunt. :(
---
Every game has a surge at the start and some amount of decrease in population after some time. It can grow sure, but cannot be guaranteed. It is hard to predict what percentage of people will remain after 1-2 months. If you don't implement sharding or layering you end up with potentionally too small servers that feel empy and dead. You can choose to merge those servers but then server pride is destroyed and character name duplicates come up.
---
It’s not really a flaw in Vanilla they’re trying to solve. In 2004 they didn’t have an existing subscriber base of a few million that will be given access to the game on the same day. It’s a modern problem that they didn’t face in the original launch which is what they explained at Blizzcon.
---
I've never heard of this. Glad we didn't have that
---
Each layer is going to have 3000 players.....
---
No expansion needed
---
I'm here from all. Pretty shitty that they threatened to sue other people for making classic WoW servers, and now they are doing it themselves. I mean, be excited, but WoW is Blizzard a piece of shit company.
---
Let's keep our chin up
---
I wish there was a dyanimic system that could let you que for your server then after a set time it would put you in the larger cross realm pool  to keep the times down
---
Yeah I just set it up a few hours ago, will eventually get a few addons to hopefully help that
---
In case anyone read this comment and thought it was legit:
---
Water elementals in STV: Half of your AoE spells are not frost
---
ZG crocs: no shit
---
DME and DMN were always there, at the bottom of the level 50-60 section because they're great for leveling (as well as making gold), but won't be in until Phase II.
---
I have no idea how you came to the idea no changes would mean a 13k population cap? 
---
I am 'advocating' to let the servers grow naturally. That means incentivizing players to start leveling spread out over one or two weeks, not all on the same day. This allows people to consciously pick more or less populated realms and live with the consequences. If this means some players drop out immediately rather than two weeks in, so be it. They are the ones causing all this mess anyway.
---
Artificially overloading the servers using layers will just cause problems if the population does not develop according to expectations.
---
Layering sounds like the kind of solution the players wouldn't even really notice much if we hadn't been told about it.
---
I hope this is sarcasm. Wake up, blizzard gives News and announcements (release date) to the streamers. They will give them all informations. They will lead the whole release at the end without surprising blue posts or trailers.
---
No need to purchase anything, simply resub.
---
One of the dev videos even stated layer is assigned at character creation.  Changing layers isnt a vommon occurrence.  If your start on layer 1 you will almost always be on layer one.
---
This is what layering is. More initial temporary servers under a common server name..that way when the initial tourists leave you have only a single layer with a good stable population.
---
Where is this crowd? I've seen a lot of people argue against sharding but I haven't seen people say they won't play because of it...
---
&gt;some kind of frankenstein solution
---
You didnt even watch, did you? If you did, you surely didn’t listen
---
Right but that is also somewhat true of layering, it will only be a thing for a couple of weeks. I suppose I am just viewing this as a long term deal, so it really just doesn't seem like much of an issue. The layers each support just as many players as an actual server in original classic, so it's not like it will feel empty. The complaint, I assume, is that you won't see the same people as often / some people will be in a different instance than you. My question though is.. Is that really worse than just not being able to log in at all? It seems to me that this implementation at least allows everyone to play without altering the actual mechanics of the game (spawns etc) very much.
---
Like I definitely understand why people don't want it, I just don't really see any suggestions for a better way to do it aside from just doing nothing or solutions which lead to even worse problems in the long term. I think ideally layering shouldn't apply beyond the first few zones (I suspect around level 20-30 is where most people will taper off and quit), but aside from that the system doesn't seem *that* bad.
---
You're ignoring the "boycott" part of the group. My comparison is between those saying they will not play Classic with layering, because I guarantee that most absolutely will, even if they'd prefer not to.
---
The 3731 armor is the known value when boss has no debuffs, not an assumption. See http://www.kurai.com/wow/naxx/maexxna.jpg which was posted on http://www.victorious-secret.org/printthread.php?tid=7475&amp;page=2 in 2006. 
---
Since you are unfamiliar with this elementary fact I am going to assume you have not really done any research on the subject at all, it's just uninformed opinions.
---
Thanks, got a source confirming by any chance?
---
Yeh like being on a server at 60 and your friend wants to play with you but can’t... stupid idea for a problem that doesn’t exist.
---
Clicker n00b
---
I just mean if that was the bar, we all should have just tossed out content and got our own invites =p
---
He's one of the lead devs for classic, hence the title
---
Thanks. Wouldn't this have been much easier to post to begin with, instead of ranting? I now see a video where they **promise** it's for the first few weeks only, instead of hear-say and estimates of layer size that others posted around here.
---
I couldn't find this video, since it was buried, as far as I can see, in a post with 1000+ comments.
---
Imo stacking of other consumables are also a problem
---
No wonder some raids are easy if they are tuned for close to no consumables, and a whole raid uses as much as possible 
---
Maybe it will be less in classic, but on private the amounts looks crazy
---
So don’t play and get off the subreddit.
---
Thanks, do we have a source on this?
---
It's impossible for me to look back on it without nostalgia goggles, but I really think it has a lot to offer if you have the patience for it.
---
I know that I'm excited, and it'll be great to be in there with new players, too :)
---
I agree Ion seems really passionate about it. I hear rumors that they would maybe bring back pre nerf C'thun for a week or so. I wonder if it was Ion's idea, since he was the one who did the math  15 years ago and posted on the forums about how C'thun was unkillable even in a perfect scenario.
---
Isn't the main difference is that layering is session-long, whereas sharing can change on the fly? That's a pretty massive difference.
---
Hahh sorry about that mate, it's all just ironic 😃 Hopefully you'll enjoy the next one(s)?
---
If they're really smart, they'll add arenas and new content in the style of Vanilla WoW, similar to Old School RuneScape
---
Thats beautiful man.
---
Yes, as opposed to the rest of the world that can largely choose to take a vacation when they want if they give enough notice.
---
Not as easy as "1/2/3/4 is safe" etc, which was the argument.
---
It's better on one server because you'll learn the names of individual players and you'll know which ones are to be feared and who needs to be killed first, etc... It was just so much fun to me. This makes the BG matches so much more involved for me. It felt personal and you had some skin in the game. Crossrealm just loses the feeling.
---
I also played on the Horde side of an Alliance dominated server, so that made my queue times short and we basically couldn't World PvP because the Alliance controlled everything.
---
Currently I'm leaning towards warrior because despite the fact that all the videos I find are of warriors in better gear than what I will have, I can still at least find footage of them soloing groups of enemies. I can't find any of an enhance shaman doing this at all. But a part of me really wants to play enhance because stormstrike windfury is so fun.
---
the only enh shaman videos you'll find are windfury crit clips because that was the highlight of the class. i'm not sayinng enh shamans could only kill people by proccing wf but that was the highlight because you could 1-2 shot people. you'll do far better as a warrior as they are the ultimate pvp class and obviously don't rely on mana like shamans do but i would say choose whichever you want to play more
---
Billy cannot invite you here theoretically, he is playing on a different server. With sharding you meet strangers  that most likely you will never see again, with layering it is not true.
---
They are aiming for classic to be as close to vanilla as possible. AQ wasn't the final raid. Naxxramas was. No flying. All old content.
---
&gt; So... people can't be pissed about layering and still plan to play the game? 
---
Where does my post say this? Do people not finish reading posts on Reddit before commenting? I'm talking about the people who say they *will not play* Classic because of layering. I'm calling bullshit on them, that's all. Take your Ritalin.
---
Mine has known about it for years. 
---
but mine is awesome, she learned how to take over my main streams so when it drops, I can stream on my second channel while she takes care of the business. 
---
Best.Wife.Ever.
---
From my understanding, yes, they'll still be pretty busy. But it's more the diffrence between a couple hundred people fighting over spawns, and a couple thousand.
---
Let me try and be the Blizzard whisperer for a second. 
---
Their internal logic probably is something like this: 
---
Although beta is a testing period, a lot of people look at it as a chance to play the game early. If you give out beta invites to those people, they're essentially playing wow for free. To my mind that's why this particular decision was made. 
---
Now do I agree that this is how it should work? 
---
No. I distinctly remember getting an invite to the Cataclysm beta despite not being subbed to the game at the time.
---
Absolutely, Ion specifically stated that the major events like world bosses simply won't have layering/sharding. In my personal opinion, layering affects a relatively insignificant portion of the gameplay (the first few weeks of the launch) in order to make it actually playable. As long as the world is populated and PvP is able to flourish correctly, I think it will be fine. 
---
My main take away from all of the info is that they are *very* clear on it being a temporary measure, so in my eyes it's a non-issue after like a month in a game that I will be playing for *years*.
---
I agree. If its only a couple weeks then perfect.
---
Poor Billy, couldn't continue playing with johnny and karen because he  doesn't play classic.
---
Try getting 10k subs yourself before claiming how easy it is.
---
na, it means you are sad because if you were confident about your choices, you wouldn't feel urge to brag about how "successful" your life has become on classic wow subreddit  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
So to show Blizz you won’t. Support them, don’t play :)
---
The question of AH and trade channels are very interesting, curious how they want to tackle them also.
---
U mean th lv 40 mounts will not be in classic?
---
That is not at all what this post is about holy shit I have honestly never seen a more retarded reply to a obvious joke/comparison.
---
His statement is: People say laying is bad and wont play it because of it will still play it because people say that shit ALL THE TIME and it reminds him of the MW2 boycot  group that played it on launch.
---
It has nothing to do with ingame mechanics or industry standards. Its so simple to understand yet you are too stupid to get it.
---
I have no idea what layering is and this Venn diagram thing doesn't help at all!
---
They still turn it off. You have que times now. Happy?
---
The one thing I’d change is that your final realm has “n=3k”. When layering goes down there’s not much population regulation: it’s more like “n=?”
---
Hi, /u/buenodelicious12
---
Probably.
---
Enhance Shaman. 
---
no one knows how to play against you, they under estimate you and the random one hit kills on mages makes you laugh a lot more than you'd think.
---
streamers haven't been informed about the beta access, sorry to burst your bubble. swifty wasn't even sure if he was getting in on first wave.
---
Layers do not actively re-distribute players to account for fluctuations in population like shards do.  Blizzard made this change specifically for classic to try and synthesize a sense of cohesiveness.
---
Because you're trading active load balancing for cohesiveness, though, I imagine that it won't be that uncommon to join a layer that might only have a few hundred people spread throughout an entire continent.  Sure, it might fill up over time.  It might hit the minimum threshold and de-spawn, moving you over to a more populous layer.  Or it might just hover above it-- and you're stuck in a ghost town.
---
Just for more info
---
Nelf. Rogue. T1 geared. Looks like he's using daggers, but is standing in the front with the tanks. 
---
Definitely authentic, but people have higher standards these days.
---
Maybe they have left?
---
I leveled a hunter in Vanilla, a mage early in tbc, and tried to level a druid in tbc as well. The hunter is the most noob friendly, but they are all easy. I personally found the druid extremely boring and just stopped playing it at around level 50.
---
I'm not ignoring it, I'm just making a different point.
---
It wasn't buried, its the post titled "Ion explain layering and duration, best explanation i have seen so far." with this link as the only text in it.
---
http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub
---
The problem you'll face is that item optimisations just doesn't exist to support Prot Paladins post UBRS, they need everything a warrior needs, plus int and +spell damage. As everyone's gear improves, yours will improve slower, so you end up being the anchor that pulls the guild/raid down.
---
Now, if you're just concerned with running 5-mans, UBRS and ZG/AQ20, then the difference is small enough not to matter and the spec specific buffs are usually worth it at those levels, so you'll have few problems. 
---
BWL+ (and especially AQ40 and Naxx) and you find you're a Warrior with worse threat, less health and worse survivability, who can be mana-drained to the point of uselessness (and swigging a mana potion for some threat replenish screws you).
---
Balance druids can use +spell damage cloth, Feral Druids can use rogue leather, Ret palas can use dps plate (and even then have to work a specific judgement in to replenish mana), Ele shaman can use cloth and Enh Shaman can use dps leather/mail. Prot Palas were just screwed by limited gearing options once you got well into endgame.
---
Pretty sure they did talk about starting areas, that they will be packed in the dev talk vids. The way it was explained, 1 shard will contain the whole continent, not very "effective" if you are going to run 100 layers just to get less people in the start zones.
---
Would suggest that they will have 1 layer untill that continent is filled, put out 2nd... aka most likely you will end up 2 layers in eastern and 1 in western at launch.
---
Tbf, the classic community is a little different. There is an active community that wants this game to be exactly as they remembered it from their times playing years ago. I agree with your overall point, that in general, modern betas are mostly just marketing campaigns. But I do believe there will be way more people submitting bug reports during this beta than other games who have had public testing phases.
---
its the best solution, i think blizz have made the right decision.  i just hope that they adjust resource spawns accordingly so that it doesn't affect economy
---
Some servers will become a ghost town because just about every person that plays retail will give classic a try for a couple of days, get spanked hard, and go back to retail.
---
Streamers have one job and one job only, generate hype for the game. So yeah, obviously Blizzard is going to give them info beforehand. That doesn't mean they'll get to start before others.
---
My girlfriend doesn’t and wont know.
---
They also said this on their announcement:
---
&gt;We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game
---
That means retail players will have a higher chance to get a invite over you.
---
So yea, even if you get a sub now you'll be competing with blizzdrones who've been playing their shit expansions from the past few years and never cared about Classic.
---
With such a small beta I'm sure blizzard will have employees going through server logs of some of them. The stress tests will be larger in scale.
---
Eh? I'm saying a 13k pop cap is the opposite of no changes.
---
So basically fuck the people that want to play at launch but don't want to deal with 2k players in each starting zone. How very elitist of you.
---
Yeah
---
They are also looking at other factors and mentioned a really close and small beta, in the interview
---
I am full aware of its cons compared to warrior for example, that's why I think TBC was the best state of Class balance and talent tree balance. But hey, if you don't play what you enjoy the most, what exactly is the purpose of playing.
---
It is literally one google search away
---
wouldn’t that be amazing? Lol
---
But isn't it the same ultimately? Kazzak 1,2,3,4 or Kazzak, Magtheridon, Frostwolf, Stronghold - if they are "layered" or sharded", it's pretty much the same thing. Kazzak, Magtheridon, Frostwolf and Stronghold are 4 different realms. Kazzak 1,2,3,4 are 4 different realms, they just share the same name.
---
This is what I am advocating. Larger servers and faction balance displays that show the %.
---
Once it reaches 55% you will receive a prompt to roll for the under-populated faction, but there will be no enforcement. Not sure how to implement it, but I think something like that is best.
---
does 400k count?
---
Blizzard said : 
---
 Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account 
---
For what I understand, this can concern any game, from overwatch to DIII.
---
And what’s the point exactly?
---
As far as i know, technically autumn starts the 1st. of september. So technically only 5 days.
---
A friend of mine played a prot paladin on a private server. He had mostly dungeon gear. His threat was pretty decent and as long as you let him get a few seconds before starting to dps it went smoothly. Since paladins don't have a taunt ability, waiting for him to build some threat before starting to dps is crucial. He also needed a quick manabreak after each pull, but other than that he was a decent dungeon-tank. Very good aoe threat. Having no taunt can quickly become a bigger problem in raids though.
---
Pretty sure this was removed in the 1.12 patch though.
---
&gt;It will be fine. 
---
No it won't. Sharding goes directly against vanilla. The ability to no longer face enemies that might be ganking you or holding a quest hub "hostage" changes everything about how vanilla worked. 
---
Classic is dead before it even had a chance.
---
in greens?
---
It’s insane how this sub hates the content creators that are putting the most work in for this game.
---
So literally zero impact on any one person. Why are people so butthurt?
---
Autumn starts on the 23rd of September. You can look it up if you don't believe me
---
It's not the same though.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm still not convinced that this is a net good thing and it will definitely be exploited, but in all fairness it IS different than sharding. 
---
With shards beeing local and more numerous there is far more incentive to shard hopping as you're able to just go through dozens of versions of the same zone. Layers however are supposed to be as large as an entire vanilla server, so there won't be more than ~5 layers max per realm and even that will likely go down pretty soon as launch hype dies down. That plus no LFG tool to make hopping essentially automated is a big difference from regual sharding IMO.
---
My problem isn't with your regular game/quest breaking bugs. It's with the very little things that most ppl won't care enough about to report. And I stand by my point that most players won't report these
---
Say goodbye to low level zone raids
---
Let's see. They create what they call layers, to which you are assigned upon login, we don't know if you swap layers upon relog. You can't change your layer unless you group with someone from another layer. Each layer holds up to 2.5k players, after that new layer is created. So what did I miss?
---
I'm down for it. As long as battle groups can rotate occasionally lol. Sucks getting stuck against a stacked group. I know it's part of the experience but it would still help out Haha.
---
You've inspired me
---
Probably not gonna need time off to play when servers and crowded.
---
Gonna take time off a few weeks after so I can grind out some dungeons or something
---
I think this latest announcement really brought out the incels from hiding. So many no lifers complaining about the absolute smallest issues like it’s the end of the world.
---
Funny thing is there is so much misinformation about people sprouting ‘facts’ from pservers that just don’t apply to vanilla. Respawn rates is my favourite, the game will be unplayable without some form of layering/sharding, this is a perfect solution.
---
Just have to live for 3 and a half months
---
She doesn't know
---
Thanks heaps :) Yeah you are not wrong at all it was the highlight. yeah its a tough decision. Warriors really were absolutely amazing in the right hands and their infinite resource (rage) did make them capable of good consistent damage right up until they died.
---
So the server community argument is finally out the window at least, that's good. Yes, layering might have a minor effect on gameplay, but the effects is greatly exaggerated as it will only last for a few weeks, as officially stated by Ion. We have more than a statement, we have Ion literally saying layering will only be active for the first few weeks. Is the outrage blinding people?
---
No, more like same as retail today
---
It’s cool and all, but no one has actually experienced this new « layering » system. How about we wait before reaching any conclusion?
---
A lot of people like myself were counting on being able to level while only dealing with 40 hour work weeks during the summer months, and then be able to raid/pvp more sparingly after summer. Now I’ll have to balance work, school, family and extracurriculars so I’ll be severely behind the curve. 
---
And thinking that was going to happen after being told to “have a classic summer” is not that crazy imo.
---
Id rather have new classic content  osrs style than the other expansions. Come one, we've all doen that content before. Sure TBC was pretty good but cba to do all that shit again.
---
the level 40 badlands run sucks......
---
I mean, come on guys we all know 100% of this "close beta" will be for Streamers and "influencers"
---
Yeah server logs. There's tools for that. And many bugs that are client side won't show up on these.
---
Nobody reports bugs in beta.
---
it LOOKS cool but it's not really practical especially in pvp. the same reason professional players use smaller monitors is because you're able to see more without having to move your eyes as much. for wow i can see this as being a thing to do especially for casual enjoyment
---
Not even session long. Think of it as sub-server. You login and logout from the same community essential every time until you want to group with another member from another layer. Since your guildies are in the same layer as you, you will not change layers often.
---
i want to say it's that simple but i dont have the economic know-how to explain it haha, but maybe you're right though
---
Yeah, the point of this post has really flown over my head. Really wish I was as smart as you.
---
Its almost like there are lots of people with lots of opinons.
---
This dude is just a piece of shit now constantly trying to scam people
---
Players on layer 2 and 3 would be in the queue.
---
Yes there will be more resources (I'm not disputing that at all). There will also be more players able to actually log into the game and consume said resources. 
---
&gt; Why not just up the respawn rates on everything
---
That sounds like a significant departure from Vanilla and would result in a very different and bizarre experience in game. By comparison I think layering would feel much more authentic. 
---
Blizzard has to deal with a huge burst of players on day 1 many of which won't still be active 2 weeks later.
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=230
---
I predict you won't even notice you're on a layer because there is nothing _to_ notice. The starting zones will still be crowded. When two layers get merged you will notice "sharding" abnormalities just like in retail but that will be short lived. I infer that merging layers is permanent because they said they want to keep you be with the same players throughout the journey. They can't un-merge layers and keep you with those same players.
---
No, it won't stop people that are record breaking or parsing (if that will even be a thing) or whatever. But is that where the problem is, people trying to break records, while requiring insane dedication? The only problem is if it affects the experience for most people, which I feel won't happen with the cooldowns.
---
2 hours ? I wish.
---
I played on a 80% Ally 20% Horde PvE Realm.
---
Often times queued for Alterac at noon and got in at 8 pm.
---
Seeing as all you did was ramble about servers and industry standards, yeah, I think you did. Most of the people who "will never played layered Classic" are full of shit. That's the point. They'll be there day one like the rest of us, subscription in hand.
---
I met my girlfriend on WoW so she'll be right next to me playing as well.
---
Sort of, but with sharding on launch you could be playing with Kazzak as a Magtheridon player then once the shards get removed you can't play together again. This way anyone you do meet will eventually be on the same realm once the layers are gone
---
Anyone that complains about the game being unplayable launch day needs to fuck right off.
---
Honestly augest 26th works perfect for me too its my first day off so i work a 4 on 4 off schedual so i can use 4 PTO days and get 12 days of pure vlassic wow right at launch. Also it comes out at 6pm on the 26th and i will jave already worked 4 night shifting before that 6p to 6a so it litteraly perfect. And my girlfriend doesnt care if i no life for the first 2-4weeks
---
Uh, do you have any numbers? Say number of people versus number of bug reports in any of the previous betas?
---
Fair enough. I'm sure some people would prefer no layering, I just don't believe most of those people aren't going to be there day 1.
---
ya honestly the fact that school will start up within a week is HUGE for me as an adult. I'm sure blizz wanted to release it sooner so that they could capitolize on all the people with free time in summer but I'm SO happy it's not coming out in June. Otherwise there'd be so many more players and I would find it hard to get myself outside.   
---
Now I can enjoy my summer and then start off in WoW when the weather starts to get worse and the servers aren't full of young retail people who will quit in 2-8 weeks when they realize getting to 60 takes time
---
New client but still don't need a top of the line gaming PC for it.
---
Me: "Magic Conch, will I ever get invited to the Closed Beta?"
---
Magic Conch: "Maybe someday"
---
Ask any of his friends or in guild to invite him to a party.
---
FOMO basically, many people will feel pressured to get them if they're only temporary. Making them permanent would ruin the prestige behind the mounts that exists today.
---
And if they're added then removed you know a ton of people will whine and cry, because they missed out on it and they don't want to miss out on things in classic like they did in vanilla.
---
The same people that are crying about the CE pets not being available again, only available to the classic original CE owners.
---
Pretty
---
I feel you - I would not rush, let alone be able to accumulate 1000gold by the time they would be removed. 
---
But it was always nice to see People riding around with 100% on a 60%(looking) Mount! It was something to be proud of - especially if you didn´t trade it in for a armored one :)
---
Hahahaha that's a great way of looking at it. I'll just have to think really hard about it for the next 3 months. I love the idea of both classes.
---
Hakuna your tatas
---
It's pointing at something?
---
It was a joke that went WAY above your head. Relax.
---
You are by default in the same layer as your friends and guild.
---
Sounds like you’re a shitty student with an easy major.
---
Uh, yeah... and my point is still that being a customer and threatening to not play is miles more effective than saying you don't give a shit and walking away.
---
But, thanks for explaining such a complex angle on humour for my tiny, retarded, underdeveloped brain. Maybe you and jokemaster2009 here can start a MENSA-sponsored comedy duo?
---
"eliminates the problem of overpopulation of zones" - we'll see about that, personally I'm thinking that the starting zones will be a shitshow if the number of players per layer is 3000
---
Just like they said they would only shard the starting zone right? 
---
Just like they said they want the servers to have community right? 
---
Just like they said warts and all right?
---
Everything they have said so far they have gone back on so I dont see why they wouldn't be leaving layering in as a full time thing.
---
a Lad
---
If it feels relatively coherent and not too noticeable or disruptive I won’t care as much. I’d imagine they’d only do it as long as is necessary to provide a consistent experience to all players. 
---
They’re not doing it to piss us off or mess with us... they’re doing it for us to have a more seamless and smooth experience. 
---
A necessary evil... I think we should keep an open mind. Our stress about our awareness of this destroyer might actually be must worse than the real experience of it at launch - as with most fears/concerns. 
---
But yea, I don’t like knowing that vanilla has sharding for so long... my paranoid brain automatically goes “oh no it’s a slippery slope towards retail!” Which is completely irrational.
---
What a fucking great point. 
---
Your ability to go to the beach is completely irrelevant to what season it is. For literally thousands of years the changing of seasons has been on the same dates. Deal with it.
---
not saying you're wrong but why does everyone treat classic wow as though the only people who play it are super tryhard speedrunning guilds?  that's a minority of players
---
our guild on ely was the best guild i've ever been in, world buffs were encouraged but not necessary so those who wanted to would go and get them, and we'd have a good laugh if they pulled aggro on trash and died and lost them.
---
we would clear naxx then go onyxia and have a stupid wipe and we'd all be laughing our asses off on discord.  it's so much more fun when you're not that concerned about the outcome
---
it's a social RPG for most of us rather than a a leaderboard
---
I’d advise you do a bit of research on the system being used before you attempt to thwart it.
---
How can you be so sure of that? From what I know they have always said that sharding/layering will only include launch and a few weeks after that. If the population doesn't smooth out as they hope it will, then the beginning of phase 2 is the absolute deadline for when layering gets removed.
---
Thank you.
---
That doesn't work, so no. Layers = channels from other MMOs.
---
Would also appreciate someone letting me know when they get sent out; I thought it was today but it seems like it hasn’t happened quite yet.
---
North maybe?
---
Why are you marrying someone who runs your life?
---
I agree. Always wanted one of those mounts in Vanilla. I remember when I learned the Winterspring saber was the only unarmored mount I  could get outside of ZG as I was late to 60. I don't see any actual reasoning as to why they  are impossible to add and remove during a phase.
---
What about the promise of keeping server community? What about the promise of only sharding starting zones? What about the promise of warts and all? When do you stop believing them? When they dont take sharding out?
---
Totally, agree. I can't beg people enough to try a monitor higher than 60hz. You wont go back lol.
---
Yeah that happens, don’t sweat it
---
Nobody’s needs are outweighing anyone else’s. You having a laggy launch experience isn’t a need. It’s a want.
---
MW2 is without a doubt the best COD.
---
I wish you the best of luck on your choice! 
---
TBH, if you're pondering both, you won't be upset with whatever you choice. So don't second guess yourself too much. Just have fun!
---
This is my memory of classic PvP. I was in the premade, but I remember the spam of “Lifestealer has left the battleground.” when they’d see our names. It’s not good for “server identity” if every time you queue up you get the same premade matching up against you.
---
Btw this is cataclysm ragnaros.
---
Classic ragnaros looks différent, he doesn't have thoose armor pieces
---
You mean in actuallity it starts on 23rd of September. But when most poeple say summer fx, they mean 1st jun -&gt; 31rd of Aug. Atleast thats the interpretation 90% of people on this hemisphere of the the planet uses. The one you're talking about, is the one based upon the solar equinoxes is outdated and hasn't been used in a veeeeery long time.
---
What?
---
You sir are a wanting to waste your money.  I have been a beta tester on the original game, many others before and since and never once have I had to pay for entry.  What you are asking to do is pay for early entry, well why?  You want to see level 1-30 and have some bragging rights is my guess.
---
The fact is Blizzard will already have THOUSANDS of existing players that have been useful and participated in previous tests.  They also have their own internal focused testing groups.  There will also be the stress test phases.  
---
This stage of testing is not some hype generating cash grab, its actually a test, and they are kind enough to let in a some streamers and dedicated players to share that experience with no NDA.
---
I enjoy testing, its a hobby of mine, but would I subscribe 3 months early for the privilege?  I think not.
---
I'd advise you to not believe anything Ion says. Layers = channels
---
It will be very easy to change them, like in any MMO. Worst case you ask a random person for aid.
---
&gt; The main difference is that you won't notice layering at all. It's literally invisible and undetectable. It has no direct impact on gameplay
---
Just one example.. you're questing with someone but not in group or just near someone.. they join a group with someone else in another shard.  They disappear into another layer.  When people can move between them easily on their own, you're going to see it.
---
803g!? i dont think i ever got over 100 in like 2 years of vanilla haha.  I was constantly begging money off my friends to respec cos i wanted to do good dps as a combat rogue, but then wanted to go AV and blow up clothies with a dagger build
---
i also never maxed out a profession and didn't really farm gold much.  i just wanted to duel and pvp and get gear from raids lol
---
No it’s that the way they are going REEEEEE to any slight inconvenience is very reminiscent of the shit you see over there...
---
I was the one of the biggest anti-sharding advocate if not THE biggest on the Classic WoW forums, but even I'm happy with this compromise. People are unreasonable.
---
 11/23/2004 Free Month
---
Perhaps
---
You can’t ask a random person, you have to be in their layer to interact with them.
---
I really like that we have a launch at midnight, if you tryhard, you will have only a1 or at most two hours packed with people, and then people will start playing all throught the day depending on their sleep/work schedule. That way in europe we have far less isues since we don't have everyone coming at once.
---
Obviously and no one disagrees with you there. But NO ONE  was either 1. arguing that layering is good 2. that you should play even if layering gets introduced 3. that you should walk away if you dont like it.
---
No one was arguing anything the OP just stated a point and made a comparison that was supposed to be funny (thats obviously subjective)
---
Right on, bro! When I'm pissed at a company and I want them to change something, I tell them, "You know, I'm still going to buy this even if you don't change anything, but it would be pretty cool if you did!"
---
You really gave that "Layering is Just Sharding I Will Never Played This Abomination" Crowd a german suplex through the table of reality checks. What a bunch of hypocritical idiots, right man? Haha
---
what are you talking aboiut man
---
the raid group side panel thing???
---
I think you might have not looked this up in a while :) you are correct that Naxx did exist in wrath of the lich king as a rerelease, but original Naxxramas was the final ultimate raid in Vanilla WOW. That is where people got their Tier 3 raud sets. The Scourge invasion event happened before. AQ20 and AQ40 were the raids for 2.5 tier sets. They were not the end of Vanilla.
---
Their biggest mistake was having these influencers first introduce this system and having them try and explain it instead of themselves making a video with Ion properly detailing what to expect. Instead now we had poor information regarding exactly what this was and digging through these interviews to get the real message.
---
How would you go about circumventing layering then? All that you've mentioned ties back to sharding or layering, whatever you wanna call it.
---
Actually I think you would be surprised how much people like it. Do you have any idea how many people would flock to fresh private server releases, just to join the rush of leveling with thousands of people at once? Of course the populations spread out and fall off after a month or so, but the answer is thousands. This is only for ONE server too. Blizzard with have multiple. I think a lot of people that agree with layering and sharding, have either never been apart of this, but claim they have, or they just want a no fair advantage that gets them further ahead because they are going to take a week off work to no life the game anyway.
---
Yup, I use a ROG Swift PG258Q. This will be mounted higher and back for watching videos lol. I just set this behemoth up a few hours ago and had to share it haha.
---
Why would I not believe what ion says? he’s the game director , if anyone is worth listening to on the subject it’s him.
---
Because sparkling water drinking BFA players like him realize that the amount of real life money on tokens and other assets in the current retail game are now absolutely fucking useless because nobody cares about the retail game anymore
---
Ion specifically stated in sn interview that layering will be switched off before enabling world bosses. 1 Kazzak will be per realm.
---
SHARDING . IS NOT . CROSSREALM.
---
Stop confusing sharding with connected realms/crossrealm zones (CRZ).
---
I came looking for this. Thank you.
---
There are two autumns. You are referring to the astronomical one. The meteorological one starts on the 1st of September. For a lot of people that's "autumn".
---
Right? Everyone seems to think they will be level 60 in the first week.
---
What is Discord/TS/Vent/anything else?
---
PC gaming community can be much more toxic than incels.
---
Day 1 isn't as important as day 60 or 90 or 365. Especially since the price of entry for classic is just an active sub.
---
But what if population of Kazzak only grow, because Kazzak is fucking meme hyped server with top-streamers, booty bay casino and goblish whores?
---
I saw a clip of lirik saying beta starts at 6.  But it’s probably just a troll
---
Wow Classic is using BFA client, so yeah, it's technically a new game .
---
I just would love to know how you make any friends while sitting in queue.
---
Also having played Vanilla i can tell you that most of the people i grouped with while leveling quit looooooonnngggg before hitting 60 and all my "friends" were made in the guild I joined to raid in.
---
Aye, World of Warcraft has always been a haven for sociopaths.  It's inevitable.  Can't punch and kick toddlers irl, so you're left with the WoW equivalent.  I'm still impressed when there are more gankers than levelers in a zone, though.  It's like wasting 100% of your time to waste 75% of someone else's time.  How do you do it?
---
Just lie and say you need to visit the dentist for 1 week
---
I see you don't play retail. Otherwise you'd know why nothing Ion says is of any value.
---
First, jesus christ, you can like both games. I raided through AQ in Vanilla, and I raid Mythic BoD now. They’re completely different games, it’s like shitting on people who play Diablo, it has nothing to do with Vanilla. 
---
Second, there’s a billion bnet accounts, there’s no good way to know who will actually log in. It sucks, but there’s not, so they picked something simple that shows they’re active in the Warcraft Beta.
---
Finally a concise and understandable explanation of layering. Thanks for posting.
---
What are the alternatives?
---
Yes it's easy to point out some flaws with this approach, but if there was another easy solution they'd use it. 
---
People seem not to understand that classic was designed with only around 3000-4000 players in one world, if you go past it everything goes to shit so you have this set limit which you have to work with. 
---
I prefer layering over sharding any time, at least you have a somewhat consistent world compared to random sharding in every single zone.
---
If you didn't play that janky pirate version of MW2, you missed out!
---
It had dedicated servers, custom gamemodes, the whole shebang.
---
Yes, I truly believe you shouldn't expect to play a MMO on launch day and not deal with overcrowded zones, and I don't think compromising core game mechanics to placate impatient players is a good thing to do.
---
I do not think that makes me 'elitist', though.
---
Good argument. Thanks for conceding.
---
You have a point, I just wanted to show that it will be much smaller pop than at launch.
---
AH has to be independent of layers. Don't want the availability of items changing as people change layers
---
Isn't the difference that you're only meeting people on your server instead of other servers? Once populations shrink you'll start bumping into people more frequently as there'll be less layering going on and eventually there'll just be one layer.
---
Under sharding they would need to run many more servers and once the populations drop you'll end up with some very low pop servers. With layering they can monitor server pops and even add new ones if we demonstrate there is a big enough demand for them. Better to start small and grow than overestimate the demand and create twenty servers that then need merging.
---
Everything he says is of value when relating to classic wow as he is the game director and ultimately decides what is and isn’t in the game.
---
Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you. Troll vs Orc hunter. The only difference is that I'll play a male.
---
I like Trolls but that stun resist is so sweet.... And I'll be mainly a PvP player.
---
Is it worth for someone who didn't play back then?
---
Hey idiot just for your information all these boring streamers and youtubers are the reason you are getting classic in the first place. If no one would have promoted those ideas you would still be sitting in a dead private server instead of waiting for a massive launch with millions of players.
---
So just shut your mouth and be thankful
---
For all the people our here trying to portrait him as a scam, fraud, wako jako or whatever. I inform you that he has done more for the world and the children who aren't able to game let alone eat on a daily basis then any of you. Yes he may come of as a douche or a jerk but if you know it is only a personal for a greater good then you wouldn't judge him the way you do.
---
mining is pretty easy to keep up, and good for the purpose of using the mats for engi later. although at 60 it is probably not as profitable as herbalism, mainly because of the amount of consumables that come out of it.
---
I'm not sure about some things, if anyone knows I'll be glad for help!
---
* How did Head/Legs enchants work? Were these Libram items freely tradeable after finishing the quest? Would they be available right from the launch?
---
* What exactly is needed to get Insignia and Sentinel's Medaillon (rank, gold, honor, reputation...)?
---
* 2hand vs dual wield - I'm strongly for 2hand cause of that one, big swing. What are the pros of dual wield?
---
* Are cats the best dps/pushback pets in this bracket? What pet would you choose for level 24 pvp and why?
---
* Is there a shared cooldown for consumables? If yes, how long is it?
---
* Which consumables except grenades have I forgotten about?
---
Guild/general chat should be immune to layering.
---
Your post is why Blizzard rarely talks to the community. It’s not in their best interest
---
Losing world buffs due to a minor mistake must induce massive rage
---
People who never ran classic raids before need to know that they can easily clear MC, onyxia, aq20, and zg through simple teamwork
---
&gt; more than happy to pay $200 usd to play classic beta
---
That's *more than one year of sub*, so if you sub now you'll still have 8 months paid to play Classic.
---
There won't be a retail sub anymore, just a WoW sub that will let you play both versions.
---
Mining is not a very good moneymaker at 60. Stacks of ore (or bars) usually go for "just" a couple gold a stack. Herbs however, are always in high demand. Some high-level herbs sell for 10g per stack.
---
Both mining and herbalism kan be kept up while leveling, of course, but you will have to actively seek out veins and plants to do so. Be prepared to spend a few hours extra in each zone just to level up those professions.
---
In the end, do what you believe is most fun for you. Skinning + mining or herbalism is great to pick when leveling. Sell the skins, keep the ore or herbs.
---
If you just do random playing, you're going to stumble upon, here or there, major game/quest breaking bugs.
---
These will more than likely be reported by many people and easy to replicate and thus fix.
---
Now by having some people focus on given areas of the game, these people will have more chances to stumble upon minor bugs that most people will never encounter, but that might impact the game nevertheless.
---
I'll give you an example. Back during Guild Wars 2 closed beta, as part of what ArenaNet called the CoreKrewe, testing was done in phases during each of which different aspects of the game were tested. During one such phase dedicated to crafting, I found a recipe that let you craft item which sold to the npc for roughly 8 times more than other items of the same level. And though it was a rare recipe that few people would have used due to the required mats, it still had the potential to upset the economy of the whole game by letting people in the know get rich af real quick.
---
That's something that probably wouldn't have been discovered if nobody focused on crafting related bugs, as it was 1 recipe in a pool of thousands.
---
That's the thing I'm most worried about for this beta. That these small bugs are not reported. 1) because the people who discover them want to exploit them after release or 2) because they're just not discovered at all
---
Guild chat will be because you are by default on the same layer as your guild.
---
General chat will ideally be later based to avoid people trying to abuse layer hopping.
---
Probably raid frames (they were added in WoD and confirmed that they will still be in classic.) They are actually kind of nice for ppl that dont have addons
---
Did you already get a beta invite!? How did you know you got one, email?
---
You didn’t have to do it to him!
---
I'm very stupid, could someone help me understand this a bit better? If I'm in Layer1 in the Barrens and killing zebras, I will never see anyone from another Layer. So that would mean that Layer2+ will have their own mobs to kill, since they can't see me killing my mobs or anything. But if there's only one world boss up per server, and there are still multiple layers at that time, how does that work? Like, GuildA is on Layer1 and GuildB is on Layer2, but there can only be one world boss up at a time, who gets to see it?
---
&gt; I would think having a limit for how many layer-hops one could make in a certain time (like instances) would be adequate enough. 
---
That would suck as a crafter. "Sorry, I can't hop layers to give you +4 stats, I'm on CD".
---
The content creators are literally the reason classic is happening in the first place. Do these retards really think they could have done this shit alone ? I signed the petition before I started playing wow because of these content creators and so did thousands of other people.
---
Bunch of entitled retards in this sub
---
The entire year is sit inside playing wow (sweden)
---
How's that gonna work out?
---
I think it’ll be easy to overthink this. It’s all meant to be one community. Having multiple AH’s means they would likely need to be merged when layering is removed, and that means more work. My guess is the AH will run on a separate server which provides AH services to all realms, much like an NPC server. That way all layers within a realm will have access to and use the same AH.
---
World chat being broken up by layers makes more sense, because combing chat from multiple layers takes more work, but is probably fairly simple, so I could see that going either way.
---
She does play a lot of games.. just not world of warcraft.. so i mean.. Classic &gt; GF any day of the week.
---
I'm gonna go look for one of those that play WoW - Any takers out there?!
---
i got to field marshall in vanilla wow and played a lot of bgs. i don't recall ever being threatened by a shaman but there were a couple skillful warriors on horde that could literally solo carry an entire BG. one guy was an orc warrior named mayday who never had a healbot and would still carry BGs because he would just murder everyone in his path.
---
I like this, however layering still have some problems that should be adressed.
---
1. You can farm rare spawns with unique drops way easier, by having people that get you into a diffrent layer (Like Tidal charm has 1 spawn per day, with a 45% drop chance, now lots of people can get this because of layering.
---
2. Economy will be way worse because of layers. Imagine farming something like black lotus. It has 1 hour respawns, now it is in 4 diffrent zones, however the zones are so far away from eachother that u won't be able to travel from zone to zone to pick up extra within an hour. But with layers what u can do is having some friends that u know is in a diffrent layer and just get invites. So rather then getting 18/h in blackrock mountains, you can get 54/h.
---
(This ofc is only for people that rush 60, since layer will be removed later on)
---
So what is the soluotion for this? 
---
I can think of 3 things that would make it atleast way less abusable.
---
1. You can only change layer inside an inn or capital (Maybe at lvl 20 or so) since new players before that might not understand why they can't play with there friends otherwise.
---
2. Lvl 45 zones or higher doesn't have layering (This would fix the gold farming methods at max lvl)
---
3. You will be told it's not allowed to do "some things" on other layers. Like the black lotus, u can't pick up the same node on 2 diffrent layers within 1 hour.
---
thanks!
---
First : why oh why ?
---
Second : I don't think you ever played a hunter then don't advise people on the class. Making a hunter build without Aimed Shot is ridiculous especially to put point in a useless talent that give you 2% more damage (you would shoot for 1020 dmg instead of 1000 woooohooo !) against humanoid.
---
It’s mostly just a hate train circle jerk.
---
that would certainly minimize those situations then. your only escape from griefers would become people on ur friend list.
---
it will all depend on how big will those "layers" be. if w're talking about 1-2k people then it won't be a big issue. but if those layers are 100 people each, then it will be a big issue. i certainly hope it works out. i, like everyone else here, want to enjoy my favorite mmorpg of all time, probably my favorite game of all time.
---
I think it also endorses speedleveling or hardcore gameplay. Dont think blizzard wants that. Back in the day it was more a coincidence that these mounts where an “achievement rather than actual gamedesign.
---
But, but, but layers...
---
To get to 40 in just 10 days is doable but not very enjoyable imho.
---
Gotta follow your heart! Classic &gt; meaningful relationship
---
Short answer is no. i am sure other people will explain why
---
Same, I want to be a Mage for the Levling experience but Warlock in the late-game.
---
All of the original races have had their starting quests totally revamped. Practicing in retail would be a waste of your time.
---
Because if someone fucks up and lie/wiggle out of answering issues for BFA why would you trust him for classic?
---
Yeh tell me about it. So much negativity in every thread here today from a non-issue.
---
Don't take the shown numbers as facts.
---
&gt;Would speed running a level 1 to 20 on a retail server be similar to classic
---
I understand why you might think that. But that is not how it works. You are not fully considering the fact that there are other people in this equation. You are not the only one entering the new layer, and there are people coming into your layer as well. So it's not like you are the only thing that is added to the layer. If you get what I mean.
---
For arguments sake, say there are 4 layers, and you are farming in winterspring. On average each layer has 10 black lotus, and each layer has 2 people farming. That is 40 black lotus and 8 people farming.
---
You are saying, since there are 2 persons on my shard I get on average 5 black lotus, then I get to do that on all the 4 shards, so I end up with 20 black lotus.
---
If that is the same for all 8 people, then you end up with 8 people all getting 20 black lotuses, which is 160 black lotuses. There are only 40 black lotuses though. 
---
That doesn't add up.
---
Honestly I didnt say shit yet. Not sure what to do
---
rip billy.
---
You're in for a rude awakening.
---
Classic is for parents.   That's why release is right when the kids goto school, so the parents can take time off and have the day free to play.
---
RP-PvP servers have always been graveyards and always will be. You can't change people. Roleplayers want to Roleplay. PvPers want to PvP. There is no cross-over. Anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or is lying to you.
---
PvPers will know they can find easy targets in contested zones. Roleplayers not wearing their proper gear, etc.
---
Roleplayers will get fed up and move to capital cities for safe Roleplaying.
---
Roleplayers will grow tired of how stale Roleplaying in cities gets overtime.
---
Roleplayers will abandone RP-PvP realms for genuine RP realms.
---
RP-PvP servers will become graveyards, with no reason to exist, as RPers have all moved away, so you might as well have just played on a PvP server.
---
RP servers won't decrease in population if RP-PvP servers launch, because Roleplayers won't go to RP-PvP servers.
---
RP-PvP players are not Roleplayers. They are PvPers who don't know what they are talking about.
---
RP-PvPers are a very, very, very loud minority of this subreddit / the Classic community. They won't even be able to fill up a single layer of a Phase 1 server.
---
Get mad.
---
I’m not sure “after 3-12 weeks” is accurate. Do we know how long Phase 1 will be?
---
For me whether layering is good or not seriously depends on how long it will be around. I understand why it’s needed, but it’s not going to be classic if several months later it’s still a dice roll whether or not you run into someone on your server who’s doing the exact same thing as you at the same time in a high level zone.
---
So a bunch of players and guilds will randomly pop up after a couple of weeks in?  How is that different than a server merge from the player's perspective sigh...
---
&gt; Please try to avoid using Reddit as a way of gauging how the classic wow community views things.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Reddit in general is full of circle jerkin , you can see that clearly by looking at other platforms and how people discuss classic wow like a cult here. Reddit is a platform for people who live in an echo chamber and can't handle the thought of even a slightly new idea. It has to fit their narrative.
---
I've been on reddit for 8 years. Every single day I read comments about people trashing on "reddit". Not individuals, not specific subreddits, not specific times of day (which varies what sort of people across the globe are on the website).
---
Constantly people say "it's an echochamber", "it's just a circlejerk", "it's just hive mentality"..
---
But you know what? It's not _just_ that.
---
There are **widely** different users at any time of day on any subreddit.
---
Do you think the users of /r/EatCheapAndHealthy are anything like the users of /r/classicwow ? Maybe there's some overlap, but I don't think the 2 subreddits have much in common about opinion at all. Meaning that it's not just "reddit", there are differences of people.
---
You can believe it's a hivemind, but it's not really. People make threads, and they're upvoted if people agree, or down voted if not. Same in the comments.
---
When mistakes are found, or new evidence, public opinion can change or be contentious. I've seen many a thread with widely different viewpoints being up voted. Take /r/gameofthrones and the latest season. Go to any thread and you have many many comments up voted that are positive to the season, and many many comments that are negative to the show.
---
If you make a comment that is shit, and down voted, it's not the hivemind, it's your comment is shit. I have rarely if ever seen comments or threads that have really good substance be down voted into oblivion, or if they are, it's because no one saw it, so it has mabye 10 down votes from 1 side of the coin.
---
Blizzard should 100% listen to a lot of what this subreddit wants. This subreddit is the largest classic wow community on the internet. This is the case for many many games, reddit is a website that attracts casual and hardcore fans alike. It generally congregates a lot of players that just know more about the game. I'd rather they listen here than the official forums which are trash.
---
The only parallel game we have to look at is 2007scape, and the subreddit is literally the defacto place for anything related to the game. It's the public forum, the gathering place where ideas, drama, news, memes, everything is displayed for literally anyone on the internet to come and see.
---
Posts like yours are poorly thought out and show YOUR draw to the "hivemind" anti-reddit circlejerk that "LE REDDIT IS BAD" crowd that like to take very niche examples on a website used by 150+million people.
---
The whole point of reddit is for the majority opinions to rise to the top. A lot of time, users are swayed by well written comments and factual arguments (and sometimes nought, but eventually corrections are made, which is called reality... where people can change their opinions when conflicting info / argument is proposed).
---
If you don't agree with a post or comment, make a comment saying why, and argue for your side. Down vote or up vote posts you like or don't like and move on. Just because you're wrong, doesn't mean the system is wrong.
---
Yeah, and I don’t mean to sound hostile, but it doesn’t make sense. This is literally dungeon finder for pvp. You may as well have lfg  lol. I don’t see how you could support one and not the other. 
---
Part of my favorite memories came from consistently lining up against rivals who I knew by name outside of the BGs.
---
I would be happy, but it appears this place had been taken over by a blizz fanboy meme brigade who circlejerk in praise of everything announced that we fought to prevent.
---
I did not hear that personally, but you may be right.
---
We had vacation scheduled from Aug 24th - Sept 7th. I explained to her we had the change it due to the game, which she understood. 
---
Since the announcement of Classic, I would randomly either quote the game: "TOO SOON!! You have awoken me too soon!", describe raids: "Well clearly we will need to travel through Searing Gorge to get to the Dwarven Gates of Black Rock Spire. We are then going to run along a chain, or if you are feeling saucy, we can take a leap of faith into molten lava. .... ", and reminder her how I will no life when the game comes out  
---
I told her I need to be home Aug 13th and I'm okay missing a day or two of launch. We have rescheduled to Aug 14th - Aug 28th.
---
Sadly, I don't think she will play with me, but at least I'll get 6+ hours a day.
---
Thanks mate! Cant wait for release. I got rank 10 and exalted with AV on an account I shared with 6 people (my family) playing an hour or 2 a day after school. Now I'll have no School, No shared account, Plenty of time every day to grind and have fun. Its gunnu be the ultimate game for me now. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
---
If you resub look at it as a resub to modern wow with a possible perk. Its funny that crybabies like alexensual for example start to complain about their $50 beta while it actually was a blizzcon ticket.
---
I just want to know what happened to Billy? Did he quit in the first week or what?
---
We gave them a chance with retail quite a few times. Look at where it's at nowadays. I'm happy but i'll be careful.
---
I probably won't. Layering and DHKs still being in (dumbest thing they ever introduced the way it works) are awful.
---
The release date is shiet tho
---
You cant pick which layer you want. To switch you would have to be friends with somebody on that layer. Seeing as your friends also cant pick what layer they're on, I dont think this is going to be abused like you think it is.
---
No it doesn’t lmao.
---
Like as if gankers didn’t run you down with a 100% mount. You can easily be dismounted on a ground mount, not as easy on a flying mount.
---
&gt;Whatever Blizzard does, people will complain.
---
What an over-dramatization of the facts. When Blizzard announced Classic, the classic community didn't complain. When Blizzard announced the phase system, the classic community didn't complain. When Blizzard announced spell batching, the classic community didn't complain.
---
I wonder if it's just that the community complains when Blizzard makes bad decisions, and is happy when Blizzard makes good decisions?
---
Nah that can't be it, it makes too much sense and doesn't fuel my unwarranted rage.
---
Guten Morgen.
---
here's a better one:  
---
layering = sharding but instead of smaller areas, it's continent based
---
Damn, you're so right about this, remind me to just stop coming here after launch, lol
---
With a Core Hound Tooth, as it's made of solidified lava.
---
Way to be on the ball Josh!! Thanks for quick release on this episode! Keep up your amazing work! This podcast is bar none the BEST podcast available to the Classic Community!
---
I cry , thanks to maney it happen
---
Also spells, class mechanics, etc. Not to mention all you do from 15 onward is dungeon finder lul
---
Hey I played on burning legion horde side. Was in &lt;JAGD&gt; don’t know how many people remember our ragtag group of weirdos.
---
Well, that's all I'm saying -- priority to your own server, cross server after that, but only if necessary.  I'm not sure if two minutes is the optimal timeframe -- that's not for me to figure out, I'm sure the devs have a better idea of what that is for the playerbase.  But I'd rather have a slightly different working to cross-realm than simply default to it right off the bat -- and that's my contention.
---
Sure, plan for failure, but don't assume it automatically.  To me, that's what it sounds like -- they're assuming non-cross realm BGs will automatically fail.
---
For me it’s that I know and love warlock. Mained one since I started playing in 2008. It’s fun, it performs well, and solo leveling is easy. 
---
But on the other hand the utility of mage portals is a little better than summoning slave. And it seems like a very fun overall class to play.
---
That's a good question that we haven't gotten a good answer to. 
---
We don't need Blizzard policing our leveling speed and telling us how we ought to have fun. It's not going to have any effect on people speeding through leveling anyway since mounts are rarely the reason people do that. 
---
I was really looking forward to grinding rep for another faction's mount. It's also a really inefficient way of leveling that takes you longer than rushing through content would otherwise
---
You’re calling out that guy but totally ignoring the Ret Pally?
---
This guy has become a scammer. He will try to gain popularity again with some shitty wow streams but after a week he will try to sell his shitty self made cryptocurrency and mobile game to his new viewers. He is the worst. You have been warned.
---
Decent for a few months is not what I call a proper MMO
---
When will the beta be live? Do you know?
---
Yeah I hate playing with other people too.
---
You are not locked into a layer. You can switch by re-logging or by changing groups. They clearly confirmed layer hopping via groups, and it was a bit less clear, but it seems every log in can give you a different layer
---
R/iamberysmart
---
&gt; And I can make up stories too
---
Yeah, we've seen it throughout this thread.
---
When I played WoW no one in my guild would ever say anything. Just appear for raids.
---
We have video and screenshot evidence that chromaggus, firemaw, patchwerk, maexxna, veknilash all have 3700 armor and KT has 3000 armor. I could look up more but it's enough, that's samoples from 3 differnt raids. Then we know that TBC non caster bosses had 7700 armor and caster bosses 6xxx (dont remember the exact number but it was the same). Based on this it is pretty certain that the pattern was 3700/3000 for vanilla. 
---
It doesn't even matter because before this evidence pservers used initially much higher armor values, to make sure it is 100% sure that it is at least as hard as vanilla was.
---
Kargoz made a few guides about duo/trio leveling on YouTube. [This is the DUO leveling one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4). I'm sure there is another for 3 people though. 
---
To give my opinion on your question: Prot Warr, Priest (doesn't really matter which spec priest takes while leveling, I guess) and Combat Rogue sounds pretty great. I'd rather take Rogue than Mage, because while they fill different roles, a lot of the cloth "increase damage and healing" gear will be wanted by both Mage and Priest. A Prot Warr will prefer mail and plate over leather, so the Rogue's solid. Instead of a Priest, a Shaman could be pretty cool as well. Heals, totem buffs and all that good stuff.
---
That’s a good point, and hopefully the system is smart enough to prioritize putting battle.net friends on the same layer preemptively so it’s kept to a minimum in that respect as well.
---
High capacity servers... That alone is worth my sub. Imagine playing an actual world filled with other players.
---
We don't know what a 'High' population level means. This picture is meaningless.
---
* Leg enchants had to be completed by another person, and then that person had to enchant the item for your through the trading window(get a friend to help you with this one)
---
* Rank 2 i belive and gold.
---
* Dual wield for double +15 agi.
---
* Cat's are imo by far the best ones, because of pushback(attack speed).
---
* Potions share cooldown.
---
* Consumables seem fine, except maybe absorb potions(Fire/Frost/Nature/Shadow protection).
---
nice try to distract from the argument at hand
---
but by all means call me an uninformed idiot - to paraphrase your statement.
---
Then come back when you've punched the numbers into the armor mitigation formula and tell me if you ended up with a different result
---
since you are building a new pc, u wont find half the requirements listed even on modern wow. for gpu if you are playing on 1080p resolution then go for a 1660TI or 1060. if 1440p go for 1070, 2060. as for cpu any 8th or 9th gen i5 or i7 will work well enough too. for ram 4gb would work but i would advise going for at least 8 gb ram. i don't have much insignt into amd gpu to give specific recommendation but i would immagine an rx 570 or 580 would run the game stable at 1080p and vega 56 is enough for 1440o
---
Lol good luck switching layer when you have to find 1 in 3000 that isn't in your layer
---
The “bfadrones” probably didn’t opt into the beta in the last 24 hours.
---
You do realize that there are many fun, engaging, scripted dungeons you can do while leveling up right?
---
I prefer layering as well but I dont agree its needed.
---
You can solve everything with server cap and amount of server. In first two weeks you will have problems anyway with sharding/layering/nothing it doesnt matter.
---
Layering only works if you created 3 layers and 50-70% people will quit. If more than 70% quit than you will need merges anyway. If less then 50% quit you will have overpopulated server.
---
And on top of that sharding/layering adds major problems to community, gameplay, pvp, economy.
---
Thanks so much for sharing this! I’m pretty excited. What will you be creating?
---
Probably because most people work for living and cant be playing games 24/7.
---
My guess is she does not exist? :D
---
RIP Aniki.
---
Too soon my friend, too soon.
---
These layers will most likely aim at numbers reflecting the initial world design, around 3000 concurrent players. 
---
Imo there is no point in allowing cross layer communication it if they value the classic feel as the world would be complete and "Classic" with one full layer.
---
The fact that they say it won't be a common occurrence let's be believe they won't allow ingame /world communication, same as facilitating jumping around.
---
Right now they're saying that layering will be removed by the time world bosses are added in.   
---
I'm guessing for other similar things, such as rare spawns, quest mobs, herbs, nodes, chests, etc are all going to be cloned on each layer.
---
Waste.   Going lvl 1-10 on retail is probably faster than going 1-3 on classic.
---
I’m stuck between Druid and shaman right now.
---
I don’t know what spec I want to play yet, but I never see anyone talking about the dps of either class. Are any of the dps specs for shaman or Druid viable?
---
I'm ok with it as long as people aren't able to exploit it to farm named mobs, quest faster, farm nodes/chests, etc. Blizzard needs to point out if layering will be susceptible to that type of thing or not.
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Or like PvE content you gear up and group up because obviously BGs were made for teamwork. I soloed the grind mostly and I always took Vvrath and his minions as a challenge. People on my server had a different view I guess. It wasn’t always rosy but the alternative was x realm and that killed BGs for me. I go to CoD for nameless faceless people for me to battle with. 
---
Maybe we should scale down AV and create it for lower lvls so they can see the content ASAP and all the time :).
---
I have a 32 curve, the ghosting is pretty bad, response time as well.
---
It's nice to have all that extra space though, bit of an advantage when it comes to FoV.
---
But when it came to mythic raiding, it felt a bit too much, not to mention you have to resize everything and you end up just placing it all in the middle like you were using a normal 23 inch monitor anyways.
---
&gt;assuming the layers are gone
---
I mean they could not split the community up that would be a start. 
---
Honestly they need to launch at least 1 proper classic server with none of this silly tech. Otherwise people like myself cant even consider playing the game. Maybe in the final phase actually becasue I assume they will get bored of attempting to kill community.
---
Ooof, better man than me. I would've cancelled to be there at launch.
---
They need to do this because after a few weeks when the hype is dead so will many realms be.
---
lol, I just like they tried to troll me, realized I do have that many and then voted me down. 
---
 Damn, people cannot handle sass or a joke after they fall flat on their own.
---
You know you have the option of getting a group together yourself too right?
---
But its not, sharding is not layering...
---
But since you seem to know better, please give us a solution to the problem they are addressing...
---
you remind me of the people during the BFA beta who kept parroting "stop complaining, it's just a beta"
---
Ironforge can be full again! Lol
---
I’m hyped because addon developers will have day one builds.
---
Dude, he used his charity cult mentality to sell his worthless cryptocurrency and gullible people sucked it up. He got banned for it on twitch. Wake up, this guy is a fraud and became totally mental.
---
"Okay we got a release date, now what expansion do YOU want to play next?"
---
Wtf, fucking fortnite kids.
---
YOU ARE NOT PRE...nvm. Good job.
---
Did you even listen to what they said? This isn’t sharding. They are having up to 3 copies of the same realm existing at once. If you meet me in the world, until we log off we will always see each other. When we log off next time we log wecould be in the same world again. And after launch they will combine the layers into 1 realm, so anyone you see can be invited to a guild from day 1.
---
Explain to me how this is bad in any form please
---
It's just evasive language really, hasn't clarified all that much
---
We will all be glad for layering and sharding at launch. Even with split up servers, there will still be a ton of people on your shard/layer
---
Fair enough!
---
The real PvP happens in the actually world. BGs are just a game within the game. Capture and Flag and Conquest in its purest form. World PvP is literally kill or be killed. You form rivalries and guilds go at it. HORDE VS ALLIANCE. Dungeon finder wasn’t necessary. You could find groups for dungeons all the time leveling. The dungeons within the zones were right there. Barrens, Westfall, Stormwind, Orgrimmar, etc.
---
Retail works on my 8 year old PC.
---
i7 875.   2.9 ghz, 8 gig ddr3 and GTX 550xt 2 gig card.   I might upgrade the video card, but it seems fine to me.   Although I haven't tried a raid.
---
Even 1 extra talent point would be really bad. You'd be able to get a 31-pointer in a tree while also having a 21-point talent in another. Removes a lot of choice and thinking when you cna just get everything.
---
# NO SHARDS
---
# NO LAYERS
---
# NO MASTERS
---
Seriously, was out of stock in less than 80 minutes... what a shitty stock estimation
---
I really expected this to be another HURR DURR LAYERING JUST SHARDING WITH DIFFERENT NAME post
---
Its just a funny meme.
---
This cut is from his video where he leveled from level 1 - 100 in 5 hours.
---
And he bashed the retail wow that it is easy as hell.
---
Hoped it was a meme
---
Why are you happy with this "compromise"? This solves very few of the major issues sharding has.   
---
You're not thinking about sharding and layering deeply enough if you think layering is significantly better than sharding
---
Hi, /u/-Boz-
---
Seeing a hunter without a mana bar disturbs me
---
Strongest economy on the planet is a shithole, TIL.
---
Yup, launch will be a shitshow. But I expect it to get much better after a few days when people start to spread.
---
"There's a game coming out in 3 months that will probably consume most of my time for at least a few weeks. I want you to know now that it's important to me and has nothing against you."
---
If you meet again on the same layer, yes.  
---
You won't see people from other servers.
---
one thing blizzard is overthinking here is. People do want the shitty experience, the queues and stupid loot quests. It's all part of what gave flavor to these old school games...
---
Hi, /u/wadlet-
---
 /g anyone on layer 2 inv me? horde raid on sw
---
I made it to Warlord, but this is back when I lived in an apartment with 3 other people who had no lives, haha. 
---
 But now I think that will just be a dream of mine =(
---
Tips said it in either his stream or in one of his videos yesterday, it will be in.
---
I said I got in!!!! YESS!
---
shaman for sure, i played with exactly that setup rank10 +unstoppable force (on ps), [my char](https://i.imgur.com/mGzkEeD.jpg), you can kill anyone really. even r14 ppl. or have some 1v3 action. And its enough for oneshot fun action. you feel content with this gear setup and very functionable, and dont feel gimped at all. 
---
when warrior with the same gear still feels very gimped. you really need one of the big raid weapons to feel good about your gear and capability. and its stiil not enough and you need a healer behind.  and before you get all gear (which can take mothes farming) it feels absolutely terrible to play a warrior without a gear.
---
Enh dont need top gear to be functionable, since they got tons of utility tools and a ton of spell damage. i rekt ppl even with dungeon gear, and stratholme staff. all you magic spells hit the same. obviously gear helps but its nearly as scaling as for warriors. Though you need to be very thoughtful gearing enhs, as you need so many stats in a good balance. chasing just melees stats is wrong, as many ppl do.
---
Most enhs dont know how to play enh shaman properly though. like 95% that ive seen. aswell as how to gear it up and what stats in what amount and proportion you need. most of them are total pepegas fishing for wf procs. and thats all.
---
just a hint against most of the physical dps classes you need to swap to 1h+shield. in general if you play in bgs you swap weapons all the time depending on the situation. 
---
preseting should be a fire nova totem is a stable in your burst rotation. 
---
in general there is a ton of nuances to a shaman. 
---
~
---
The only downside is that its hard to get to 10man premades, as enh. as ppl get a stigma against them, well fairly so, most enhs are total braindead pepegas. its very rare to see one played properly. 
---
I've never seen a proper enh movie, played well.
---
Bitches about people bitching
---
They will still be in a starting zone with 600 people. That doesn't change at all. There is just a chance that each time they login, its a different 600 people.
---
some unhealthy shit going down in this thread, i guarantee it.
---
Yeah you have no idea what you are talking about. Vanilla for the first 3 months was a shit show of crashes overcrowding and server queues. If this avoids that and I can just play.. I'm all for it. How about you simulate a queue for yourself by not playing while the rest of us enjoy the game as it was originally intended.
---
Free xfers to lower pop realms
---
They disagree with this, since people don't like mergeing servers. They don't want u to sudenly see "new names", this way u can still see "all names" in /who list and ask them to join your groups etc. With servers being pulled together not only do you make this problem but many more. Like servers won't have queue times now because instead of having "a long queue time" like u normally would it would just create a new layer.
---
So yes while i kinda agree with you to an extent. Layers fixes a lot of problems for them.
---
One problem i see with layering is on something like "streamer servers" where the pop will be so big (unless they make a max number of layers) that the server queue will be insanely high after they remove layering.
---
good meme format
---
Yes it is
---
Come on man the second layer only comes up when there's over 3k players... Chances are after a couple of weeks they might not even happen
---
Effectively we're gonna be on 3k population servers.  The only problem i see is if the second layer doesn't have a large enough population.  At launch it will be full but after a while i can see it maybe happening
---
It's better to play in a quieter layer than be in a queue.  It's better to have layers than have server merges after a few months
---
so they want to save manpower on loot requests but are willing to use manpower to punish people for shitting on their system?  I hope that's not the case in either side.
---
what?
---
not really, not competetive with other dps speccs
---
Yup. It'll be genuinely awful having so many players fighting for spawns. People don't seem to be able to comprehend it. I've had people insulting me in comments over it it's that bad. I get it I genuinely do, I don't like sharding at all on retail, but playing with early layering beats the hell out of not being able to play at all.
---
The only other way I can see them fixing it otherwise is having lots of realms that are destined to be merged later on (e.g. Ragnaros 1, Ragnaros 2, Ragnaros 3) that are functionally their own server but share a name/guild name reservation across them all which will be merged later on when server pops die down a bit, with little to no impact on who's who. People with names are still known, nobody shares the name. If I have the name xIllidanxgod on Ragnaros 1, it's also taken on 2 and 3. The only issue are economy ones after that I think?
---
It would probably be more of a determinant. The games are so different now.
---
How does layering solve the server lag when 100-200 people are at the same place? Retail wow servers seems to lag then even with sharding.
---
as great as wotf is, i would choose orc simply because their base stats are more suited for being warriors (higher str/stam than undead) plus orc racial is pretty good too
---
&gt;(layering) eliminates the problem of overpopulation of zones
---
Can someone PLEASE explain this to me? I dont think it does. 
---
On launch day assuming a 50/50 split between alli and horde, there will be 1500 people per layer spread among 3 starting zones. Without dynamic respawns, wont this be a disaster?
---
Let's look at the human starting zone quest where you have to kill some wolves. Let's say for nice round numbers there are 100 wolves in the zone. There are 500 new players trying to kill these wolves. They spawn once every 5 minutes. That means on average a player will kill a wolf once every 20 minutes?? That sounds absolutely awful to me.
---
Eh? 
---
Cata Rag had massive shoulder armour. This one definitely looks correct, and they're in Molten Core not Firelands in the pic... 
---
Now that said it bas been a long time since I looked at Raggy
---
People will still play. What they wont have is a mass group of time-off driven first-to-60 crowd that burns out after 4 weeks.  Instead you’ll have people rushing home from work/school and putting in 2-10 hours a day, just like classic was.  I’ll still manage to get time in between working full time, side business, and going to classes while not getting wife aggro.
---
How does the final layer phase compare to how retail servers worked back then? I’m confused. If there’s only one layer how does that mitigate server merging? Further, how does it do so without threatening server/realm identity?
---
You're better off just reading up on where the quests are, so you spend less time finding them and figuring out where to go once it's live.
---
Imagine launch (second pic) : Karen and Johnny quest together and discover they have a lot of affinities.
---
2 years later they are married and a baby is on the way.
---
Then now imagine that on launch Karen and Johnny are not in the same layer : their story will never happen.
---
Best alternative is layering that you can't hop between layers at will (AKA more servers with planned merges)  
---
It's such a simple solution. Layering as it is now is nearly as bad as sharding
---
Like what?
---
This is what makes classic for me. These realm interactions actually dictate what are you currently going to do.
---
Maybe you want to fight and try to scrape a 40 man raid to defend
---
Maybe you are saying fuck this shit dude i will try to avoid that and be forced to run to another zone to hide
---
And then you start seeing the yellow text saying *Elwyn Forest is under attack!* and you know its coming
---
remind me of this famous dota meme : [https://i.imgur.com/AnkPGiu.gif](https://i.imgur.com/AnkPGiu.gif)
---
You are.
---
Im infinitely grateful that were even getting classic, but August is probably the worst time for a game to come out. Blizzard always launches expansions at the strangest times.
---
Except now world pvp will be a different animal you may not like
---
If you think that, you clearly have no idea what layering is. Even though there's literally a picture, right there, explaining it all.
---
Yes, thats how it works in retail? Triggers based on events or coordinates that changes your shard.
---
Compared to 2004 dollars, maybe something like 10% of original cost. Let’s round UP big time and say $1k/month
---
If they had a team of staff developing layering it may have costed them around $100k company resources and time to create, test, modify, etc. 
---
They opted to go with the more expensive approach, that ruins player experience, because..... I don’t know. Maybe they didn’t want to deal with the logistics of physical server. Maybe the Classic team promised to keep this operation light and deal with less physical servers. Maybe layering allows them a bit more flexibility with merging.
---
No matter the scenario I can’t come up with a solution that makes layering overwhelmingly preferred to traditional servers, at the cost of player immersion and general reputation hit because of this
---
This, to me, is Diablo Immortal all over. They took a simple decision and fucked it up. The previous blue posts made me think blizz actually cared for player experience. This layering tho. It’s exploits are gonna suck
---
The alternatives to this is to either have several hour long queues or completely unplayable starting zones (the number will easily blow private server launches out of the water, and those are bad enough as is). Layering isn't ideal, and I'm a bit concerned with how it could be abused, but I still feel like it's the best option.
---
This seems to be a popular point of view. I’d argue the rarity of the matches is what lead to people trying to win a match after 2 days of battle. 
---
After reading these comments I guess I’m a minority. The limited time of the BGs meant you could level alts, help friends, get raid ready w instances and pot grinds and depending on your server, know about the time you could join and play an AV match. I don’t ever remember waiting in queues for WSG or AB much and on my medium pop server AVs popped quick on the weekends if they didn’t last a day and a half (exhausting but epic).
---
This also means you couldn’t max rep in a weekend if BGs are limited, but then we may actually have to stand and fight and play matches and retreat and turtle and defend and make and force a pvp match not just a pve grind run through for rep as we wave at the horde or alliance running by 😁😁😁
---
He plays BFA alone on a whole realm.
---
It’s insane, but if that’s they way they want to live heir life....
---
sounds like a pre-crime problem to me.   laying is the same thing as server merges for all intents and purposes :(
---
Are you a big streamer? No? No invite for you.
---
Its not
---
I think they have already determined how they want to partition these layers, since these are also dynamic I can't see the problem with your example regarding layer population.
---
They'll have to adapt the growth and set limits of the layers dynamically, there should never be a case with overpoulation to begin with. They could set smaller player limits in the beginning which would allow them to merge these easier if player counts drop.
---
Unfortunately Blizzard didn't give enough information regarding some aspects of layering like economy, auction house, communication, we'll have to wait and see what they have planned. 
---
Let's hope for the best experience possible.
---
I haven’t kept up with them in a while. What are the pure pwnage people up to?
---
You are meeting a servers worth of community inside your layer though.... Then after a few weeks if all goes to plan, you will be introduced alot more people as the layers collapse the the tourists leave.
---
Same scenario without layers.
---
If you didn't have layering you would meet a servers worth of community on your server, then after a few weeks the servers population would be significantly lower and you will be stuck there for some time untill a server merge/xfer happens then you could lose your name/guild name.
---
How bad/annoying is ammo for hunters? Is it a chore to keep buying, do you end up spending huge amounts gold on it?
---
I remember this!
---
It's true tho.
---
And you’re in for a fun time with classic wow 😁
---
I expect the disk space at least to be way lower though :D
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
I sympathize with your overall opinion but it does seem you come across as frustrated and unreasonable.
---
I'm 27. For the past few years I've played in private servers, played others games from my childhood as well and watched Detective Pikachu last weekend just because Pokémon was part of my childhood and part of me, even today.
---
I think "ItS jUsT NoStAlGiA" fanatics such as the ones you're describing eventually die out (not literally, just become quieter) and the best for you to do is ignore them and stay true to yourself.
---
Have a good one.
---
You can implement this behavior in a bot though :o
---
NO! I must be irrationally angry!!!!
---
We have a Fan boy here. Where is your source? In my eyes the big sucess of classic private Servers showed Blizz how important it is to hear what we say :)
---
What sort of weird calendar format is this where Tuesday the 27th is in the second to last column???
---
&gt; For the sake of the game I hope it’s just split into new realms.
---
So you're expecting Blizzard to forcefully remove players from servers?
---
Idk, when someone does that for classic I’ll let you know
---
At work - can you explain what "Dynamic Spawning" that refers to?
---
Hasn't a lot of the lore been retconned between Vanilla and the chronicle books?
---
They plan to switch off layers before world bosses are enabled.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
yeah I feel you, here's the original monitor for scale. I'll end up mounting the large one above on the wall and keeping the one you see in the link below.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/j1JEsJ4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/j1JEsJ4.jpg)
---
Remember that old saying? It goes something like.
---
'Then Classic isn't for you, which is fine.'
---
You are now on the receiving end of it. Have fun..
---
..and Get mad.
---
How do they control that? We haven't heard anything saying you will see what layer you're on (it sounds like this will all be under the hood and invisible to the player). You can join a friend on another layer, but seeing as you cant see your own layer or control what layer you join when you log in it's going to be difficult to control.
---
Or maybe don’t join a low pop server? Will there be any low pop servers with layering?
---
Exactly. Hate it or love it, the starting zones are largely unaffected by layering
---
yea i agree, but what he meant that the game is not THE endgame only. half the game is literally leveling. it can be the whole game for some people, they can get thousands of hours worth of fun just leveling classes. but i also agree that you should have explained that AND said that after the hundreds of hours of fun from leveling and exploring the world, there are end game activities like battlegrounds and raids. the difference is that content is not gated to max level after doing a boring 10-20 hours of pointless leveling. the game does not start at 60. it starts at level 1 and only open up a few more activities at max level in addition to 20+ dungeons and 40+ zones you have to explore while on your leveling journey
---
Again, tell me how you would know what layer you will be in when it is not advertised? You're telling me that everyday when you log in you and a group of random people will all meet somewhere to see if you can see each other, then write that information down in a discord announcement and have no one swap layers unless they are in trouble then update that list to reflect? And you will do this daily?
---
&gt;but they have "exploits" and a small possibility of break the game ( economy, items, materials, etc ).
---
The number of turbonerds and spergs that are actually going to do this will make the will be so small that their effect on, for instance,, the economy will be indiscernible.
---
I miss the jump in Wailing Caverns..
---
It will inherently be susceptible to that. The question is how much effort Blizzard will put into mitigating that. They could take a very lazy approach. Or they could make things bullet proof.
---
In scenario 2, Karen becomes a cat lady and Johnny becomes addicted to hookers and coke.
---
Just for a few weeks. To give everyone a chance to level. Don't be so dramatic.
---
You can't compare a one time server wide event for the most dedicated, to content that is in the game and then removed after sometime.
---
TBH, I want the mounts to be added and then removed, I don't care if people cry and complain. If they missed out tough luck.
---
But it's just going to be more of a headache for Blizzard in the long run.
---
You don't know how much teachers actually work.
---
No need to be so overly dramatic, they're doing this because there's a bottom line - this isn't some fun project for them.  The expectation has always been that they remain as close to classic as possible so don't put that on a pedestal.
---
Even the dungeons are boring and as easy as the quest mobs. Especially since most people queue them with full heirloom gear.
---
Flying in the main world was the 3rd biggest mistake followed by LFD and LFR so thank goodness
---
Nice graphics!
---
Imagine waiting 3 hours to loot the quest item because of how many people there are
---
Can I get an invite without being subbed, but I am opted in for wow classic beta. Will I get the option to sub if I get an invite? 
---
Would be cool not to waste 1month sub for sothing.
---
Oh, I didn't notice haha. nice
---
Thought I was in /r/Accounting for a second. Which firm?
---
Leveling warrior is one of the slower classes, but once you start getting gear at 60 you’re a monster in pvp and pve. Level your fishing and cooking and first aid as you go and you’ll be just fine.
---
Can someone explain how layering won't just result in people abusing the mechanic and hoarding engame resources?
---
Yes, it is annoying. Craft your own ammo.
---
Join other ppls on other servers who were doing the same quest/stuff as you did
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
I really do pity people that have to negotiate these types of things with their supposed loved ones, my condolences.
---
The only thing holding me back from Automatic pick of Horde is from MoP onwards Horde is a shit show of changing leaders and internal fighting which annoys me. But that is such a long way in the future wonder if i would even play WoW Classic at this point....
---
No naming conflicts or server prefix. Also knowing beforehand which "servers" will get merged and being able to switch between those.
---

---
nice cattering to the casuals, this is what ruined wow
---
What about getting ganked on your alt, logging over to your main only to find you can’t do shit because your main and alt are on different layers..
---
Sounds like a stupid way of creating sub-servers
---
He elicited a chuckle from myself
---
my best-friend is envious he doesn't love anything in his life, like i love wow.
---
The only reason someone might want to play retail now in preparation for classic is if you're going completely blind into WoW and want to dip your toe in the most basic of things (running, attacking, casting spells, putting gear on, looting, accepting and completing quests). If you want it for a feel of a class then no, the classes are different from retail and you'll que up as warlock or hunter and question where your pet is or why you can't fire your bow after level 10.
---
This is awesome. Thanks so much for doing this!
---
I believe it's the way sharding currently works in that it brings in and kicks out people based on how many are in a specific shard.  That won't happen in classic WoW.  You'll only ever move from one layer to another if you have friends/guild on another layer and what will happen then is that you'll stay on that layer until they remove layers and everyone is on the one server.
---
That's NOT what they're doing. PLUS, they could solve that just by making the separate servers "Kazzak-A Kazzak-B Kazzak-C", etc...   
---
What they're doing is continent and server based sharding, meaning that the shard boundaries are done by continent instead of dynamically calculated by the server, and there is no cross-realm going on.   
---
You can still hop between them at will by either re-logging or getting an invite to a different shard.   
---
This is the reason people are still angry about layering. It's only a minor step above sharding. It's still terrible
---
And btw blizz doesnt give a singular fuck about what any of us have to say. The petition showed them that there was massive interest (the petition that got the fuck promoted out of by these content creators) which meant they saw a opportunity to make money.
---
The fact that you think blizz cares about this for any other reason and money shows that you are retarded
---
im literally screaming
---
Nah. Hunters can farm gold like mad, so the small cost of ammo is nothing compared to what you’ll be making.
---
I would really be down for a re-balance that makes a lot more specs properly viable, and then also a re-tune of end game content so it isn't too easy. Sounds like you might like the same.
---
Good one, never thought, yeh, this is terrible :s
---
I remember when I was playing vanilla (or was it BC?) and the final fantasy mmo came out. People on WoW said it didn’t have a great end game so once you capped there wasn’t much to do. Was definitely in the vernacular.
---
He made my ass make laugh sounds.
---
Ah, thanks. I can't remember when I saw first saw that implemented since I skipped from BC to MoP and it took me by surprise. I understand the intent behind it but you could quickly be overwhelmed if in a bad spot.
---
Ahh, the TBC pre-"mangle nerf" Bear Druid tank... out DPS-ing literally everyone else in the raid, twice the health of the plate tanks and more mitigation, those were the days.
---
So it's server-only sharding, but instead of it being a zone-wide thing, it will just be a world-wide thing? What if I want to trade with someone on Layer2 or 3, will they see my trade chat message? Same AH I'm guessing?
---
Well not played in some time since Legion but Alliance was bigger on a number of servers (PvE)
---
So they ran out of ideas?
---
I’m probably going to just sit and listen to Legends of Azeroth for a while before I even login in on the 27th. Every time I listen to it, I get an overpowering sense of nostalgia and happiness
---
I'm glad you like it.
---
It isn't common, no. I've personally seen maybe 4 DPS warriors during my raiding career through vanilla. Most notably was a dual-wield fury spec warrior, but he also happened to be the guild master.
---
Aight sick, cheers.
---
Image is most likely wrong. Your guild can not possible be locked on a specific layer.   
---
Layering is just sharding within your realm and another name to avoid rage.
---
Imagine the second scenario you have here. You and your friend are creating characters on same realm but ending up on different layers, hence you cannot play together. There is just no possibility it will work this way.
---
It will literally be just sharding but within your own realm. Otherwise it will be a terrible experience for friends who end up on different layers.
---
That being said. I dont really mind this solution.
---
Honestly I would resub if you really want to get in on the beta.
---
Then it was worthwhile :)
---
Remember to mark off the day when you can create your characters on the account!
---
Imagine an MMO with a *massive* amount of players *online*. I'm so damn excited.
---
I respect your opinion on what real pvp is, but real pvp to me is battling my opposing faction on my server in the main world and also over supplies ranks and bragging rights in the BGs. I don’t want to play CoD where I just go up against a faceless number of people probably rocking the name “legolazzzzzzz” :)
---
Can we not just call people you don't like Incels?  It's supposed to be a term for guys who have built up a toxic attitude towards women and relationships, not nerds who are mad at a video game.
---
it hurts so much that you're getting so many downvotes
---
That is assuming every layer is a servers worth of community. If we assume that, then when they remove layering and add even more people, the server would have more people than it could hold. That is unless blizzard is hoping that a majority of the server will quit before phase 2. That would mean that this layering thing is not pro customer, it's Activision blizzard trying to minmax costs at the expense of the server community being split into different instances.
---
huh That I didn't know. I joined Vanilla right before BC dropped, didn't even get to try AQ and Naxx out, everyone was in BC already at the point i got to lvl 60. Was it like the full Naxx with the 4 quarters, or a simplified version?
---
That sounds like true love to me.
---
I apologize, I use curse words often even when cool, calm and collected.
---
Just thought was worth mentioning cause honest to god I had forgotten about that feature.
---
Yeah, a server might be able to stuff that many in but the game is not designed for it at all. Gameplay suffers once you overpopulate the game even slightly (4k at once is miserable)
---
My first thought as well. "What happened to Billy?"
---
So you won’t be here in August and will be avoiding Private Servers?
---
Awesome playlist, it really took me down the memory lane. Vanilla and Linkin Park go together for me.
---
 Someone outtagging you adds to the experience, its the little things that makes the experience. You have really weird perspective of classic WoW, sounds like Bfa is more of a game for you.
---
Belinder that is all part of the fun, teaming up in a party to do quest actually having to communicate with people
---
I got 2005 account, im subbed, this morning i prayed to the old and new Gods and i still believe my chances of getting a beta key is 0.1%
---
BUT they should give vanilla players beta keys since they knew how the game was back then and not focus on "influencers"
---
Yes we do know that, they sat you DO change layers if you relog. Imagine pouring water over those towers of glasses, the water doesnt spill over to the next tier until the current one is maxed
---
Everyone’s tearing you apart.  I think it looks cool.  Super immersive for low level questing...which was one of my favorite parts just kind of getting lost in the world.
---
Well, that is exactly what i mean with this right here. Maybe i didn't explain it well enough. Lots of speed level'ers (like me) wants to rush the Tidal charm. But if i can solo the rare at lvl 43, then i can just "abuse" the layer system and have some other people on diffrent layers invite me. That's the problem. Of course it won't always be up, but this is kinda like cross-realm sharding in retail. U can get invited to another realm, but maybe the rare isn't up. This was abused by streamers (like asmon) to get rare spawn mounts where he just keeps getting invited to diffrent realms until it spawns. Same can be used in classic with layers currently.
---
Different opinions so to accommodate both they’ll have cross realm BGs like 1.12 had. I could have both but the cross realm is better in my opinion.
---
I too would love high capacity servers, but this is not it. This is 3 low capacity servers sewn together, with metal plates in between the 3. When you log in, your character will spawn at random on one of these 3 low capacity servers, giving you little control over it.
---
Someone will kill you 4 times in a row while leveling in Stranghlethorn Vale. When you try to finally gank them back and get revenge because you're about to throw your keyboard out the window in tilt, a friend of theirs on another "layer" can invite them and they'll disappear from your world, from right in front of you. They'll then whisper you "haha suck it my friend ported me out peace loser." This type of scenario breaks immersion completely. It breaks the one big immersive World of Warcraft up into 3 smaller bullshit wannabe fake "worlds," which will be very unlike a true World. It removes the sense of danger out in the world, and it does very many other things as well.
---
Mined all the mining nodes in Badlands on your low capacity server? Have a friend invite you to his #2 low capacity server, where mining nodes aren't despawned.
---
Raiding Molten Core, but a group of the opposite faction is at the entrance? Just have a friend invite you to his low capacity shard where the opposite faction won't be there.
---
Horde guild raids Stormwind, 120 people are coming to take over your home? You don't have to defend it. Just go to another "layer" (shard) where the horde isn't raiding Stormwind.
---
The examples go on and on. Layering is sharding and sharding is bad. It breaks immersion. It breaks the sense of danger that made WoW great. It breaks the world up into 3. It breaks the WoW community up too.
---
There is also no true guarantee that they'll stop using it after 3-12 weeks. It might take 6 months. This is also the most crucial time for Classic's longevity (the first few weeks/months), so even if it takes 3 weeks (which it won't) this will still suck.
---
They're repeating their same mistakes that they made with original WoW back then. This is honestly dumb.
---
I think you're misunderstanding why people care. The concept that there will be "x" layers that people can move through via invites is what has people concerned. While world PvP won't be nowhere near as bad as sharding on retail this system will still allow for people to appear and disappear before your eyes, albeit far far far less than retail.
---
Whether you want to call it layering because you like nachos, the world is still being fragmented and you're not interacting with everyone. And yes, before you inevitability respond with the que times, I'm aware of them, I've played every private, it's a necessary evil to maintain classic communities. Nachoing is just another "lesser evil" that got us to retail.
---
They have already confirmed that layering will be gone before phase 1 ends tho?
---
Yes, all launches face some problems. This one will still be different. There’s an entire preexisting subscriber base that didn’t exist for the Vanilla launch.
---
Blizzard released stats a few years back, the vast majority of players never make it to level 10, regardless of expansion.
---
regardless of what the cap is, it still sucks dude, think about it. it still has all the major problems sharding has
---
Ele sham can burst like a mofo in pvp, 2h enh is a really feast or famine fun pvp spec based on Windfury procs.
---
Ferals are some of the best dungeon (5 man) tanks, and they can be a solid offtank for raids. Cat dps can perform, but requires farming a specific weapon that has procs and many other consumables to pull numbers that other melee classes can pull without all the farm. Moonkin is kind of meh, but people have only been able to sim on private servers, which have their flaws.
---
Tl;dr- Shaman dps is fun in pvp but not the best in pve, Druid dps you should count on it but in pvp they’re the best flag runners and they can also tank five mans.
---
At this point, no one knows.
---
If anyone here is skilled at animation / vfx,  i'd love to see a slightly animated version of this on Wallpaper Engine!
---
How would they even know I've blocked it on my router and not just experiencing technical difficulties?
---
I see below people talking about meteorological seasons being at different times, which I guess is what you were talking about? I've never heard of this type of season, and it doesn't seem to be common at all. So I'd say most people understand summer to end Sept 23.
---
Well, told my gf the date and she booked plane tickets to visit her parents for 2 weeks. All good 👍
---
Is the fact he was at the media summit and spoke directly with the developers not good enough for you?
---
Being DPS in raids is difficult though. The way it used to be, there weren't ever enough geared warriors on a given server to allow for much beyond tanking, as the rest of the classes are subpar for that task.
---
It's possible, just difficult.
---
No I said if the average what you gain from competing agains 3k in one realm is 2. This already has taken everything into consideration. Then you simply multiply that by 4, since 4 layers enable to perform the same thing 4 times.
---
You saw the video? Layers hold roughly same amount of people as vanilla servers, and he said we know our servers can hold alot more people, it's just the 'game world' cannot. Game world is too small to put 10k people in the same level bracket.
---
this, so much this. I dont get how people cannot see this.
---
it's a good thing
---
here's why
---
i’m hoping i can do an alt if i’m being honest, i just haven’t played wow as much as i used to and part of that is being older but a large part is its hard to enjoy the game like i used to bc it’s just so easy. i unsubscribe for a few months, resub, and catch up in a week and then i’m bored again. hopefully classic is more engaging
---
would rather just assume what they said is true until they say otherwise instead of getting all angry for no reason, you do you tho
---
I blew air out of my nose on this one
---
Ahh the memories thou why is there a Panda here, and not back in a zoo?
---
I love how there are apparently layers but everyone's defense for it is you'll always be in the same layer as everyone so you can't game the system? I mean come on...
---
Cross realm rbgs were literally in the game in classic. They were just called battle groups and even some battle groups had dead battlegrounds. 40min queue times in the off peak.
---
I feel like you should play beta and roll a completely different character and class you are planning to main from launch, im rolling Human Warrior at launch but during beta im gonna try my hand at healing and roll a priest and see what healing in dungeons is like.
---
NO unarmored mount come on.....
---
It's hard to say. It depends on the exact implementation of layering, and it also depends on what kind of player you are. Overall though, the black lotus supply should be fairly similar to vanilla.  
---
Hardcore players will have an easier time getting black lotus, and casuals or people with jobs will actually have access to fewer, because the hardcore players can steal them all so easily.   
---
Overall though, don't expect availability of black lotus to be anything like it was on private servers. Private servers changed spawns, spawn rates, and also have hackers cheating items in.
---
Yes the damn raid frames show/hide arrow on the left of the screen, that shit reminds me of retail and I want it gone!
---
When he entered the Blizzard stage I legitimately thought it's Robert Downy Jr.
---
Wait, what? I think you misunderstood my point. My point is that tagging is part of the experience and instead of being like, "Oh look, there's another player! Maybe we can be friends!" most people are gonna be like, "Fuck.."
---
It obviously was not exactly the same, but there were 5 sections/wings with Kel'thuzad as the final boss.
---
They're all tank and spank designs that offer no challenge to good players. I'm used to running M+15 dungeons in retail.
---
Need to be subd to have a chance of invite.
---
And then a random person shows up and steals it because they get the tag and fuck your group waiting.
---
I did initially power up wow in window mode and works fine. Here's an example.
---

&gt; madseason
---
wait, wtf? He didn't get one?
---
I'm just glad we got a release date.. but i agree, would have wanted it like mid July~
---
Unless you have a friend on another layer invite you, you'll only see people from your layer.  You'll keep seeing them, and eventually once the populations stabilise and the layers are removed you'll still see them, plus a bunch of new people who you will continue to see until they or you quit.
---
&gt;Having at least 2-3x as many materials floating around as there should be is a big deal
---
Well there will be a corresponding 2-3x as many players consuming these materials to balance it out since this system is supposed to be dynamic. 
---
It just means that you won't be screwed if you rolled on the wrong server where the economy is bonkers because there are 9k players sharing the resources designed for 3k players. In that case, any even slightly casual player would not be able to afford anything in the server economy.
---
We don't know how hard / easy it will be to exploit the system. The only thing they have confirmed is that if you have a friend, you can be invited to play on the same layer, and you will stick there after leaving the group. 
---
For all we know, it's a bannable offense to deliberately Layer Hop and exploiting the system. Most people who want a classic experience won't do this, they should just naturally gravitate towards ending up in the same layer  as their friends by playing together. It would probably be easy to detect if someone did try to exploit this.
---
That’s just because that gear is so competitive. Warriors pull insane numbers and can beat out rogues. It’s just like have a million rogues but only a few good geared ones.
---
So again, it's them trying to minmax costs. I think it is foolish to assume that so many people will quit, and no other people will join at any point, to where the active playerbase on this server would go from 10k to 3k in phase 1. What if they are still close to the same, or at least 6k people there when phase 2 starts? Do you think they will make people sit in queue, or will they extend layering and apologize? Looking at Ions track record, the latter seems more likely.
---
So it's even worse. Imagine farming Black Lotus or Devilsaurs with this system. Or trying to do a PvP raid. Not only you can bail out with the party, you can just do a log out and chances are, you will be in different layer when you log it.
---
How can anyone defend this is beyond me.
---
It's been stated that the number of players per layer is small and will grow up as players spread out.
---
If you are standing walking down a hill, and the pavement is slippery, the chain of events to follow are unknown, you can only theorize, that perhaps you may fall and break your hip, maybe you will struggle slightly, but remain on your own to feet, until you are stable again. Regardless of the undeniable chain of events that happen... it is still a slippery bastard. You willingly chose to walk down it, fully understanding that it COULD lead to furter NEGATIVE circumstances.
---
Now, there is no doubt that whatever direction blizzard takes with this layering bullshit, there WILL be an "undeniable chain of events" that will happen after it is implemented. Whether they are positive or negative, time will tell. Lets just hope putting modern ideas into a 15 year old game is the slope that we want to be on, not the slippery one. Thanks.
---
The vocal minority is just that, the vocal minority.
---
Thanks for all the effort; this looks awesome. Is there a way to hide columns or freeze panes at all? I would love to be able to put a-like classes next to eachother and also see the far left bar which shows the tier of content
---
yes 8 total for all the people that are on there, not 8 just for you. 
---
If what you are saying is if there are 4 servers that means 4 times more total black lotus, I agree that is the case.
---
If you are saying that it means 4 times more black lotus for you personally, that is not the case, because there will also be 4 times more people farming for them.
---
Theoretically, the shards could start out on the smaller side and then they can up the limit as people are playing past launch. Nothing to say the cap has to be static the whole time layering is used.
---
You'll be level 20 in 10 minutes on retail, donc be silly
---
Content creators haven't received invites either yet.  They are waiting just like everyone else.  At this point, no one knows when.
---
Thank you for asking the question. That gives me hope that there will at least be one on one of the more populated regions
---
:o
---
Da durn robits r comin fur err JERBS!
---
- Known armor on boss = 3731
---
- Known armor on boss after stacking penetration debuffs = 336 armor (=5.4% reduction)
---
- Bloodthirst dmg was reduced only by 5.6% (85 vs 90), therefore 5.4% reduction is correct after you account for rounding error. Because it is correct, it must mean boss has 336 armor - which is only possible if all the debuffs stack
---
Yes I know, they were added in 1.12. They weren't in the game up until that point, so having them in when bgs are introduced is sorta a change. But none of that matters lol, we're getting crbgs in at phase 3, when BGs are introduced.
---
Generally, yes, until your layer gets merged with another layer when the population starts to decline
---
My point was that there is no end of thing in Classic that people are going to miss out on and cry about.
---
What the fuck are you talking about ?
---
Nah, wasn't trying for that. Just giggled when he told me to try and get 10k before claiming it's easy, that's all. 
---
 But that's why I said we should have all just made wow related channels and went for it. Hindsight 20/20 or something like that.
---
Done it before on pservers. Bet your sweet candy ass I’ll fuckin do it again. F R E S H.
---
It's all he has man. He can't find anything to bitch about anymore, so here we are. He literally wants a laggy 5 hour queue with server crashes.
---
You're being an alarmist.
---
MC, you're not going to raid that alone. Your guild will stay in it's later. That person who ganked you? Once they leave their friends group they're back in your layer.
---
Blizzard has already indicated this, low capacity layers. Let's say half as much? They'll reduce the number of layers.
---
Also your immersion arguement. Is attempting to do anything in a zone of 2000 people really that immersive? Yeah it's fun when you're there for the spectacle but not if you're attempting to do anything. What immersion is there in this scenario?
---
Layering for 3 weeks will suck? Will that really be worse than competing with anywhere from 3-8 times the number of players? How is a server of 15k at launch a good experience?
---
Probably around 8-11 or so PST. It's up in the air.
---
Do you have a source for that?
---
Russians are MVP.
---
With sharding every player could be phased out while layering puts you on a specific layer at login.  
---
Of course you get transported to another layer while grouping up but it occurs less often unlike balancing the population. Sharding in starter zones is much worse immersion wise.
---
We will miss those 2
---
But there is no sharding... Nice try though.
---
&gt; What an over-dramatization of the facts. When Blizzard announced Classic, the classic community didn't complain. When Blizzard announced the phase system, the classic community didn't complain. When Blizzard announced spell batching, the classic community didn't complain.
---
Except that they did.  When the Phases system were announced, people complained that they weren't in the "correct" order or that things were happening later than they thought they should be.  People complained that Blizz wasn't going to do progressive itemization, or that 1.12 items would be in the game from the start.  People complained when they thought spell batching wasn't going to be a thing until Blizzard said yes we'll do spell batching.
---
&gt; I wonder if it's just that the community complains when Blizzard makes bad decisions, and is happy when Blizzard makes good decisions?
---
&gt; Nah that can't be it, it makes too much sense and doesn't fuel my unwarranted rage.
---
As I watch this latest drama over layering unfold, it's becoming clear that this community doesn't want Classic--they want a pserver experience run by Blizzard.
---
Layer size is not static.  My understanding is that Blizzard will use a smaller layer size at launch to address the player density issue you describe and slowly increase layer size (and decrease number of layers) as players spread out across the continent.
---
Then as I have said in other comments... what the hell is the point??? 1500+ people in a starting zone will STILL cause massive mob competition issues. So the plan of only adding another layer at 3000+ doesn't do anything.
---
So that can't be the case. I don't fully understand yet how this will work, but clearly it will create a massive opportunity for people to exploit.
---
Its map of new world order and timetable of its execution
---
while i was looking up reviews, this video came up. absolute legend but ffs
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boUQsQsoAdM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boUQsQsoAdM)
---
Having layers to ensure 3k player population just like it was in vanilla is no changes, how is that bad? Why are you advocating for changes all of a sudden? 13k pop was not vanilla.
---
This is a fantastic point. Whether the system is actually better overall can be debated but if they were just looking for the easy way out they wouldn’t have spent time and money developing something new. They would have used the same implementation that they’ve been using on Retail for years. 
---
They’re obviously attempting to address the complaints they heard about sharding. Which is consistent with what they’ve been doing for months on other issues.
---
You mean like not having to worry about login queues?
---
See you in august
---
Oh really? that's good to know - thanks for the reply.
---
I’m from Pittsburgh. If you ever get a discord going shoot me a dm.
---
Great job Blizzard!
---
If that's the case then what the point? How does making a layer 3000 people solve ANY mob competition problems?
---
I support this opinion very much. For me flying was made to give the player an option to avoid interactions and to provide the player with a shortcut to pass all obstacles and just go to the reward location
---
Dam my time zone, thanks dude.
---
It's a temporary solution, as in the first few weeks, which means you're only talking about the hardcore players who've played non-stop for weeks anyway, not the overwhelming majority of players. By the time anyone is that high a level, they will have already expanded the player cap on each layer, and there will only be a couple of layers per realm. Those hardcore players will still be fighting with other hardcore players for endgame resources while the vast majority of people are still far behind. It's going to make practically no difference.
---
Wife laughed at me because I only have three weeks to level between launch and our 9 day vacation.
---
 If they keep this for longer than few weeks its really bad, like really terrible. Imagine doubling resources, rare spawns, people will find ways to abuse this shit, multiple Tidal charms and stuff like that, vanilla has tons of little things scattered around in world that actually matters for the whole eco-system. I think everyone want this game to succeed, i just booked 2 weeks off from work to play a game, but its hard to be non sceptic when it comes to BLizzard saying "it will be just few weeks", ive seen this before so many times before.
---
I feel a strange connection with other people who leveled a holy priest :D
---
I agree that accounts that were active during Vanilla should have priority.
---
none of what you just said is proven or true.
---
I don't think they'll create new servers, but the reason for the layering is to ensure zones aren't choked with players trying to level.
---
It's the difference between 500 players or 1500 players funnelling into the barrens from the Tauren and Orc/Troll starting areas.  Levelling will be tough but if everyone was going at the same time it would be completely impossible.
---
The only issue would be if the population remains high when layers are removed.  Could Orgrimmar/Stormwind handle potentially 1k+ players in it at the same time?  It would be cool, if a little chaotic.  It might also encourage people to filter out to other cities.  I've always preferred the asthetic of Thunder Bluff myself.
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
Lol how do you think you sound after you call people fucking retarted then state "Gunna be interesting to see how they handle layers or shards though."
---
Correct! Well put!
---
Hmm.. lets say 1 shard is 3k, since that number seems to be poppuing up a lot
---
1,5k horde, 1,5k alliance
---
40% human,35% gnome/dwarf, 25% nelf
---
that would still make it 600+ players in human start zone, so we are expecting MASSIVE queues then? Otherwise it will be the lagfest/crashfest they are trying to avoid? 
---
I dont like sharding or layering, but I still dont see how this solves the launch problems without massive queues
---
Can I have your gold?
---
True he got unbanned, but only under the circumstances that he will never promote his cryptocurrency again on stream. He himself said that it was the reason and that he cant openly promote it anymore.
---

---
The people who opted in for the classic beta should get an invite, without allready having an active sub. I'd be glad to sub when I know I can play the demo.
---
&gt;Personally I’m torn and I’m not sure what the ideal solution is. Open to anything really since I myself am not sure.
---
You offer free realm transfers. You don't force people on another so they can no longer play with their friends. Give them the choice instead.
---
"Have a classic summer!"
---
There is absolutely zero reason they'll have that many layers. The layers will be consistent with the attrition they're forcasting - even assuming *75 percent* attrition you would only need 4 layers. You're making a mountain out of a molehill from a problem that simply wont exist.
---
Layering is server meshing tech Star Citizen is trying to implementing in the coming year. This is essentially cutting edge tech being developed FOR Classic's benefit. 
---
It has a potential to be implemented with Retail to merge low-pop servers together, thus restoring Server communities &amp; Realm reputation.
---
People have no idea what they are talking about. They criticize aspects in layering that have been explained already and to their benefit.
---
I am sure legitimate critics of layering exist out there, but I have not seen one so far. So hit me up.
---
Yes, layering is: same realm only, continent based sharding.   
---
I don't think it's been confirmed yet, but my guess is that chat will indeed be cross layer. If it's not, someone from your server will probably make a discord for cross layer chat.   
---
Auction house will almost for sure be linked cross layer. It would be a mess if it wasn't.
---
tbh I can't tell you how I did that. I'm just glad it happened. 
---
Hopefully the addiction doesn't come up again when classic finally releases :-)
---
Honest and vital work. I salute you.
---
Ill keep both of mine up
---
It seems like layering is just separate realms with the same name that are going to be merged after a few weeks/when populations become manageable. 
---
I think using the word "layering" has had a negative effect with people stung by other jargon terms like "sharding", if Blizzard had just said they're going to be merging realms after the launch rush I don't think people would have had a problem
---
They could just limit the layer jumping, set it on 30 days cooldowns or something similar. 
---
I mean, there are ways they could tackle it if they see that it's not working as intended.
---
A company run by billionaires trying to minmax costs? No way.
---
I personally think there is going to be alot of tourists. Maybe not as extreme as you said, but noticeable. This avoids low pop servers completely dieing and having too many servers active for no reason. Then if the population is still overcrowded while 'stable', then offer xfers to low/new servers to balance it all out. If people on servers A and B have a queue every night, I imagine a free server xfers to server Z will fix that a little.
---
Heres to hoping... since im still subbed and my account is from dec 2004. Who knew that Christmas gift would last me 15 years.
---
Spell batching (decreasing the update tick rate of game events) should reduce the server load and help with this, actually.
---
Hopefully they will be going with fewer, more powerful cores as well, rather than the current parallel-small-cores setup optimized for the extremely fragmented sharding system.
---
Thats basically what it is except the process is practically invisible to players. Only the people actively trying to become angry(streamers looking to cash in on drama) will even notice it. You are penalized for grouping outside of dungeons so all these people acting like they're going to miss out on making 1000 friends while they Joanna themselves to 60 to be bored and wait whilr everyone else takes their time are just stupid.
---
Nah like it literally is tho
---
To Sacrifice: (v) give up (something important or valued) for the sake of other considerations.
---
Yes. Sacrifice.
---
How is that a smooth launch when it will basically last the entire phase 1?  wow community has been bamboozled again.
---
It's the original game that started it all from ~15 years ago prior to all expansions. A few minor QOL changes, content release will be better structured and an (optional) graphical upgrade. Everyone starts back at 1. Old players can re-experience their memories and new players are able to experience what they missed out on.
---
Yes, most people in the US see September as the Fall if you were to ask them.
---
If only it was a temporary fix to deal with the ultra high pop from tourism, instead of a permanent thing... Like if they removed it when WPvP rankings were added, along with the second tier of raids so that it wouldn't impact 90% of the playerbase that will stick around.
---
Or just go with the alternative, and create a ton of 3k pop servers. That way, when all the tourists leave, we can just be flooded with dead servers. Maybe to fix the population issues then, they'll just start sharding them like they did in retail; since they can't bring the population back up and merging them is a logistical nightmare.
---
I totally agree, they're definitely repeating the same mistakes, not taking preventative measures to anticipate the tourist dropoff so that long-term classic is health and stable. I mean what kind of IDIOT would think that?
---
Can you kill Onyxia in human form??
---
If Warlocks are summoning slaves, Mages are basically water-boys. :D
---
Why are people mad lol this is literally the “merging servers” thing people thought of months ago.
---
But what happened to Billy? :(
---
Agreed. Everyone I've seen so far complaining about layering doesn't seem to understand it.
---
Get the pitchforks and torches!
---
Goals
---
has everyone already got their invites?
---
You need an active Sub
---
Let's talk about that in a year, when Classic fails because of those smallest issues. The less immersive the game is, the sooner players will complain how shitty the game is.
---
That fact that epic gear isn't handed out like candy is a pretty big incentive to get one.
---
r/de ist am lecken, Brudis!
---
Why would you try to understand something based off a picture?  
---
You do realize that layering IS sharding but it's server based, and continent based instead of smaller sections of the map.  
---
What did you not like about sharding that layering solves? People are still going to be hopping layers all the time
---
&gt; t's supposed to be a term for guys who have built up a toxic attitude towards women and relationships, not nerds who are mad at a video game.
---
Yeah, those two things are correlated.
---
Papa Reassurance
---
Haha, nice catch!
---
Pretty sure hes been quoted saying it will absolutely not extend past phase 1 "hold me to that". Thats not evasive speaking.. Thats actually the exact oposite or evasive.
---
You're welcome.  I was just watching swiftie stream and he confirmed he hasn't received any invite yet.  That's where I got my info.
---
What's your alternative option create far too many servers and have the communites die because too many people leave, or go the Private server approach of allowing 10k players to exist at once with queue times? Neither seem like great options.
---
Also, all general chats will be across layers. You can still have your community even moreso that this isn't a permanent feature.
---
Nobody knows except blizzard. Closed beta just got live and there are no instant 60 yet for testing purposes. I think one class will do better on a particular boss fight than the other within a single raid instance.
---
Finally a real update, i have been refreshing this sub for 1 hour straight
---
&gt; you have to know someone who is in the exact zone you are in. You cant just message your friend real quick to save you from a gank squad if you are getting killed in Desolace and your friend is in Org.
---
Layers are continent-wide, not zone-specific.
---
Shadow priest or rogue?
---
I'm looking to enjoy a mix of PvE and PvP.
---
Kinda concerned about the viability of spriest when it comes to PvE content-- I've heard some mixed messages. I know I won't do the damage of a mage or warrior, but I'm hoping to at least deserve a raid spot.
---
Also, for professions: I've settled on engineering as it has a lot of benefits in classic. What else should I take for primary (after dropping mining), and what are the main benefits?
---
See you in August
---
I don't think they considered it either.
---
Thats literally what layering is..
---
&gt; if someone has your name and manually invites you to a group, yes.
---
That *is* hopping layers. "Bro invite me fast, I've got a warlock on my ass". Oh but it won't work in combat or for 20sec after combat? (as an example). You can still hop prior to entering combat.
---
&gt;It will not merge/multiply while you're activally playing, which is the biggest issue with sharding. You wont see Layers.
---
It will if chat-channels allow it, or friend lists allow it. You could've been invited to a Deadmines run from /2 in Stormwind (trade is not layer specific) and added all four to your friends list, only to find out they're from layers 1 and 2, while you're on layer 3. Everytime you do a dungeon with any of them, at least one of you will get dragged to another layer.
---
That's my biggest issue. I tend to add good players to my friends list when leveling, especially tanks/healers from dungeons. It's easiest to find dungeons in /2 or sometimes /1 (like Deadmines or ZF, but not SM or Maraudon), so many people from /2 groups won't be on the same layer.
---
You are stuck in loop imagining completely different what I said. What I said that if you play on a realm of 3k pop and get 2 black lotus on average per day. Then you will get 8 black lotus on average per day if you play on 4 3k pop realms. It means 4x more black lotus for me because every realm has 1/4 of the total population.
---
Yeah wtf?
---
Billy wants to help turtles getting to the water!
---
I agree. I like the idea of rewarding those who stuck with the game since release.
---
Extending the period in which you can obtain these mounts is a sound solution.
---
waste if time. google download private server offline. and download a repack where you just run it locally and practice. i won't name kz i don't think it allowed
---
Real talk, isnt layering objectively better than Sharding?
---
Why dont they use this tech for retail too?
---
9fps at 480p on Win 95 or GTFO Blizz smh
---
It’s largely used in 10k pop private servers and absolutely ravages the economy
---
This is how MMORPG works. Be that person, what's the problem?
---
A warlock with mana issues is a poorlock.
---
Life tap + bandages
---
Resto shaman or holy priest? 5 man and raid healing complexity, ease of gearing, ways of making money. I can't decide between the two.
---
He was just a WoW Classic tourist. He went back to BFA because it was too hard
---
Did they say anywhere that they will open new servers if demand is there? Because they did say that they want one big server.
---
It would be great if someone can confirm what they are doing with Ony/Rend buffs in classic.
---
There's a large amount of people that want their favorite private server experience again moreso than a blizzard hosted server.
---
100% better solution, I do just wonder how many people will actually take the offer, or if we’ll end up having some servers looking like Nostalrius at its peak population.
---
Discord/ts to dodge gank is highly questionable, but for grinding black lotuses/devilsaurs/thorium veins yep.
---
Play through new eso expansion. Glad I'll have some time with it and blizzard didnt do their usual thing of shitting on new mmo releases
---
There will almost certainly still be queues to spread out the level 1 creation times at launch itself.
---
I hope you understand that I hope that you already know that I understand that given that this is a 90k subscriber count subreddit.
---
Talking about world bosses here retard.  "LFG Kazak"...oh the stream guy put a viewer grp together and now hes down oh well.  Gonna be real funny to read the complaints here in a few months.
---
One thing I do notice as I’ve level so many characters is I do often run into the same people every now and then. This effectively does end this. 
---
They aren’t friends just players with common playing habits and similar leveling speed /course. This ends that (until it’s removed obviously)
---
Why wouldn't I?
---
My guild is already discussing of having split groups to farm Devilsaur on different layers. It's easy gold at the start of the server.
---
This kind of post can be summarized by :
---
"If I can't be happy, nobody does ! And I have proof!"
---
Drive me nuts, as it seems that the fact you just want to play because you enjoy it over anything modern wow as to offer seems to be impossible for them.
---
Hell, it's not even messing with their beloved modern wow so why the fuck do they care about my (our) enjoyement of a game?
---
20 Servers ?!
---
Thanks for posting this. You are completely right. What I keep saying is that people who have been playing on private servers for the last decade really love fresh server releases, and the rush of competing to pull ahead of the pack. 
---
I think a lot of people that agree with sharding, and phasing are more from the retail side of things, and rather have it as convinient as possible for themselves. Sure they may claim they have played every fresh server release and hated it, but there is an overwhelming amount of players that loved it. 
---
I also agree that implementing something within the first starting zone, has the least impact on the players immersion, as well as has the most benefit from getting players out of the starting zone and into the world a bit more. 
---
If they are to do something this would be the best solution in my opinion. Instead we are implementing a system that makes everything more user friendly, and therefor ppl that get to lvl 60 in 3-5 days will just get there faster now, and to be sure there will also be a lot more of them. If this lasts for the whole phase there will be hundreds of lvl 60s at that point.
---
Yeah well the launch is in August when a large chunk of their player base has started back to school. They’re not gonna have time to wait for a quest mob to show up that’s farmed hardcore.
---
You really want half of the potential player base to quit within the first week? I don’t think so.
---
It reminds me of GW2’s map system. But instead of each individual zone being a different layer, it seems like each section of the whole world, Eastern Kingdoms, and Kalimdor, have “layers” instead of each zone like in GW2. 
---
This system works super well in GW2, the only drawback being that you will get the dreaded “map is full” error message when you try and join a friend in a full map/layer. I’m assuming they will have to implement some type of new error message to accommodate players trying to join friends on full layers (i hope!).  Hopefully this is something that we can set out to test in Beta.  
---
I want to address two things, that have come up in this thread however, AH and Chat:
---
1. I believe the AH will definitely be whole server, all layers. There’s nothing to make me believe that they could implement any technology to make that layer specific. Further it does seem like a silly idea and would be require a ton of extra work to make happen for no payoff or benefit. 
---
2.  I wonder if chat would be layer specific. That would make a lot of sense for channels like General and Local Defense etc. 
---
For Trade chat, I’m not so sure. I would like to think that the layers would be condensed in the big cities (like gw2 does).  I do wonder if that question is answered anywhere. If not, someone should seek that answer, because i would really like to know!
---
What happens if the population stays too large to get rid of the layers? This whole system is banking on a large portion of player quitting within the first 12 weeks. What I am most concerned about is, what if a much smaller number quits? What if the remaining player base on a given server exceeds 10k players? Will the server be split or just become a huge pop mega server?
---
So if anyone can confirm you’ll need an active sub to be eligible that would be golden information.
---
There was some guy who made an exact replica of the old site and received a warning from blizzard and had to take it down
---
I think the biggest legitimate criticism is that chat channels spanning multiple layers would be very problematic. And we don't know yet if they will or won't. But being able to talk with someone in a chat channel and then not see them when you go to trade, or duel or whatever would be an issue.
---
Layer hopping would also be problematic, but it will be hard as hell to abuse I think. Doesn't mean abuse won't happen, but that it'll be tryhards and rare cases. I think the people fearing abuse by layer-hopping are blowing out of proportion the # of cases where it actually happens.
---
And there are sometimes people or things you will miss because they are in a different layer. But I think people are exaggerating how often that will happen, and how serious an issue it is. For all the things you miss, other people will miss things on your layer that you might miss too because you weren't in the right zone. IMO, it's not a big deal, and  will be over in a few weeks.
---
After the webseries they made some tv series. In the Pwnage saga they ended it a year or two ago with a movie. Which was pretty cool!
---
They have modern tech on retail with node tapping. They could probably use this in some effect to prevent exploitation.
---
Seems like a really good solution to me, honestly. I'm sure there will be a lot of discussion about "Layer vs Realm" chat if nothing is confirmed yet, which is good. Thanks for breaking it down, this is definitely better than I initially thought!
---
&gt;PLUS, they could solve that just by making the separate servers
---
Thats’s LITERALLY what they’re doing, except you can’t pick or see with ABC you’re on!
---
I'd say it's chance to see for yourself. You can experience the original game from ~15 years ago prior to all expansions.
---
 Either you like it or you don't.
---
the best solution that preserves the "authentic vanilla experience" that they pretend they're aiming for is to have more servers with planned merges. they could make illidan-A illidan-B illidan-C so that people know they will be merged down the line.
---
Nice blizzcon servers lmao. Why are people upvoting this? Its a demo screenshot.
---
These "when I was 12 i swear it was different" and using private servers as reference need to be ignored.
---
&gt;WORLD OF WARCRAFT IS A FEELING
---
WHO NEEDS A SOCIAL LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFE  
---
I can't wait to log in, 
---
Hop on a griffin
---
Sharding exists in part because of how much people hated server merges.
---
I think one of the worst design choices they ever made was no forename surname character names and not enforcing unique guild names across every server.
---
100% yes. If you have buddies, and you are hardcore/knowledgeable about rares/items/spawns/etc, you will be able to make INSANE amounts of gold with the way layering will work. Gonna be great to have timers on 3 layers.
---
&gt;(By the way Wikipedia is not a source. It is an aggregation of sources).
---
Secondary sources are still sources.
---
It was cool when you’d come out of a WSG and it was utter lag and chaos in the SW throne room. 
---
Or the horde betrayers letting everyone know in general chat of the impending raid.
---
I always make a pet attack macro that uses all dash/charge abilities/swipe/claw/hunters mark and auto attack. Makes leveling quick and easy, less buttons. Just push one to get in battle quick and do good burst.
---
Hunter or warlock?
---
Ive been a healer since wotlk looking to switch it up. Wondering which is better in pve and pvp and more fun to play.
---
Says so in the news
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
In vanilla, although I never tried, I understand that the songflower was click-able by entire raids (similar to pserver) - it would be nice to have confirmation of what their intentions are. (Somehow, I don't think this was ever intended to be a group-wide buff.)
---
Very generous of you. Be careful because there will definitely be people who will try to take advantage of this.
---
Esfand would come to my mind.
---
But i guess everyone who got a beta invite is somewhat hyped?
---
For me i watch Sodapoppin just because i like him.
---
Yeah but at least here people don't go over the top and preach people that they sould'nt like modern wow. Just look at comments when a newcomer ask the difference. Top comments are always people explaining the difference between the 2 without saying one is better than the other.
---
You sound delusional. If you set up your argument to be unfalsifiable, it’s not worth considering what you’re saying
---
Its highly unlikely that the number of players from the launch will stick around after launch thus no longer needing to have layers present to manage the playerbase.
---
Classic will be pretty fun, but it won't be for everyone especially those that never played Vanilla and accustomed to retail for various years.
---
May you constantly roll 100's you beautiful soul.
---
It's just coming from the principle that people want Classic to be very popular and succeed, and validate that Vanilla-esque gameplay design is still legitimate/valuable.
---
And then that leads to wanting Classic to not stay static forever, as this is mean inevitable decline to only a small hardcore fanbase.
---
So, with that in mind, I'm sure the people talking about expansions would also be ok with original content produced for Classic. They'll just want *something* to continue the momentum and not have the game die (from a "mainstream" popularity point of view anyway).
---
Also, as a side note, there is a significant amount of the community who thinks BC was the best version of the game, rather than Vanilla.
---
Overall it's probably 60/40, or at least 55/45, in Vanilla's favor, but the BC-lover part of the community is by no means small.
---
She smirked at my nerdy ness. I felt no shame. (Seriously, she likes to watch teen mom or other trash reality tv shows. Not a fucking thing to smirk at me about.)
---
Thank god im on another layer
---
Not always.  I mean yeah a lot of incels are mad nerds but there's others who see themselves as sporty "alphas".  It's all about the mentality in the end.
---
Also have to be careful to not equate criticism or concern with being an incel.
---
Ah ok, explain now how will Johnny and Karen can join Guild 1, which lets say has 2-3 of their best friends irl? Explain how a crowd funded, reverse engineered, based on an unstable core private server managed to squeeze 1k humans in the starting zone (yes for some of you which I call "normies" this will be a problem, but that's part of the MMO genre "Massive multiplayer online game") and blizzard wont do it. And please don't comment with retarded statements like "wow man that's so dumb you cant understand that its impossible to level with 1k humans in Elwyn forest", no its totally possible because its bad just the first 2 days, from there on you travel into small places like badlands and its full of players enjoying the content, if it wasn't possible no1 would have been lvl 10+ on nost (12k+ populated private serv RIP)
---
When you log in or create a character at launch do you do so on a specific layer? Do you and your friends need to coordinate hey everyone be sure to create on Archimonde-Layer03? Or does it all happen behind the scenes and I can chat/group with my friends even if they happen to be on other layers?
---
I was in a mediocre Horde guild on a shitty low/med pop RP PVE server back in vanilla. (Earthen Ring represent) And we managed to clear Ony, and MC, and ZG, and BWL without stacking world buffs, or pounding all the consumables imaginable. 
---
We weren't first to clear anything, but with solid tactics and knowing the fights we managed to do it without coordinating hours and hours and hours of work on getting world buffs and consumables.
---
Tanks got stoneshield pots, healers got mana pots, everyone got food buffs, anything else you pretty much brought yourself, or we didn't use. Sometimes tanks and healers would get a couple of flasks from the guild (if we had them) and we were taking down Neff, or Ragnaros for the first time.
---
I don't think that everyone who plays Classic is going to be a super hardcore min/max'er and most of the content will be accessible (over time) to even the slightly more than casual players. We have tons of content, and strategies now, that we didn't then, and we'll be more prepared for the individual fights. (what with all the streamers, and youtube videos, etc.)
---
this
---
Oh its legion? Nevermind. Thanks a lot!
---
No one in this sub will be able to give you an accurate response. It’s all guessing at the moment
---
That’s not a great metric though, I opted into the SC2 beta queue the day it went up on the site but I haven’t even finished Wings of Liberty. While I would enjoy playing an SC Beta, my feedback would be largely useless outside gross bugs.
---
I’m sure people could offer theories how it might or might not result in people abusing the mechanic. Unless you put in some kind of safeguard, we won’t know for sure. I think that exploitative behavior is going to go on to whatever extent is possible. I mean people will tell you that the player pop will die down enough by then to where there will only be one layer, but A) no one knows the math for layer generation (how many people per, what’s the threshold for them going away) and B) no one knows how fast the population will die down. Also, there are guilds planning on trying to get down MC with the first week. I doubt this is feasible but this implies that they think they can get an 40 man raid+ to 60 in a week. Surely the realm population will still be swollen then?
---
So you are saying that you and a group of random people will all meet somewhere to see if you can see each other, then catalogue that information and tell people not to swap layers unless they are in trouble then have someone update that list to reflect? And you will do this daily? If people are this afraid of getting fucked in a pvp server then they will just roll pve
---
Nobody’s going to answer, they’re playing
---
Defo stay at the same size. I am also looking to upgrade my monitor. I currently have a 144Hz GSYNC monitor that is 1920x1080 at 24 inches. Unfortunatly, that resolution has a low PPI (pixels per inch) so visually it doesnt look that good.
---
I need one that is basically the same but at 2560x1440 resolution for that sweet PPI for crisp text. Hard to find that resolution at 24 inches though. Most at that resolution are 27 inches but I am afraid the PPI might be too low.
---
Really need to see one in a store to judge for myself instead of buying one and be disappointing.
---
I like Teen Mom :/ my girlfriend hates that shit.
---
Is this satire?
---
24 inches is 60.96 cm
---
Yeah, so many questions left unanswered, really the only time we’ll start to see some resolution is when the beta starts opening up and we get to stress test and see how far we can push those servers. 
---
I agree, it would be glorious to see Orgrimmar filled to the brim, and maybe see people spill out and fill the other cities, would make the game feel more alive than ever before, so much chaos but so much fun.
---
If that's the case, why is it different to private servers then, they are referencing the correct build
---
I didn't even say they couldn't implement it, I asked how. I appreciate the personal attack though it really strengthened your argument. I will now just stop being upset because you insulted me. Thanks bro!
---
&gt; a friend of theirs on another "layer" can invite them and they'll disappear 
---
You'd have to try all of your friends randomly until you get one on another layer, surefire way to piss people off. How many people are really going to bother doing this? A new layer won't make them safe from other enemies.
---
&gt; Mined all the mining nodes in Badlands on your low capacity server?  
---
You're still going to compete with everybody on that layer (again, the size of a vanilla server) for those nodes. It's not a free pass.
---
&gt; Raiding Molten Core
---
In the first few weeks of launch? What percentage of the Classic playerbase is this realistically going to affect compared to everyone else?
---
&gt; Horde guild raids Stormwind 
---
See first comment about pissing people off by layerbegging. 
---
I'm not saying there aren't going to be tiny problems stemming from layering, but again, *all of this is only in the first few weeks*. There's zero reason to believe it will take longer. Once the tourists leave and people spread out (which is going to take a week or two, hence the time frame they give) they can start increasing the size of layers and decreasing the number of them. Suddenly each of the problems you listed is literally half as bad every time they do so until it's just a server.
---
Seriously? People voicing criticism and your immediate thought is "oh golly must be an incel". Grow the fuck up. This sub has prided it's self for having objective criticism. It's what got us to where we are today. Even if I disagree with some of it I welcome all of it.
---
So will this be like retail where even though you can see eachother you have to be on the same server group to actually trade stuff between eachother?
---
Thank you, nice explanation.
---
Ian gave a good, thought out and caring explanation as of why and how they are doing layering. Blizzard keeps future problems in mind more than the community does apperently. The low population servers are a big problem for players who are dedicated but a lot of complainers don't seem to see that problem coming.
---
I'm glad you're spreading awareness about their SOLUTION (for people who are saying they are replacing problems with other problems).
---
Personally I think these are illegitimate concerns; Or rather they are inconsequential.
---
The biggest damage sharding did to WoW was the destruction of server communities &amp; realm reputation.
---
Layering solves those two.
---
In my opinion, anything else is inconsequential. Considering we already know layering won't last into end-game. 
---
If it does, Ion will be crucified.
---
So we are cherry picking out single guys who we dont like when tons of people got invited ? I dislike Towellie as well but he has been creating content for wow for a long time I think (I have never watched his stream).
---
The man the myth the legend. Unbreakable.
---
&gt;. But making people pay $15 to get first access to names is shady as fuck
---
You're essentially paying 7.5 USD to get the name you want. That irks me as well.
---
I respect this response
---
Yeah we will see how well that works out if the rates are now correct
---
Ths is completely different. In MW2 the servers were hosted by players instead of dedicated servers.
---
The issue about this was  that the host had a big advantage and the others players could be laggy, and when the host leaves it had to pause to look for a new one. There is nothing in commun with sharding or layering in this
---
Cool story
---
Finally! So excited!
---
Shit man I didn't know you lost your sense of humor. I'll take a look around and see if I can find it.
---
That's not true. You can get a new layer by re-logging, or taking an invite. That won't be a rare case. People will hop layers frequently, and when someone logs, there's a good chance it'll be a long time before you see them again.   
---
It won't be like vanilla where you log on a couple days later and see some familiar names in your same levelling zone, because this day when you logged in, they put you on separate layers, so you're seeing completely new nameless people  
---
I WISH you were stuck in your layer. That's the best solution. It's also identical to multiple servers with planned merges. But that's not what layering is. Layering is nearly as bad as sharding. It's not vanilla at all
---
Indeed. Part of the fun of classic is that levelling is tough and rewarding. Mobs will kill you, there aren't 8 billion mobs, drops aren't 100%, people will screw you, zones are pvp fests. It's going to be great - and sometimes frustrating. I for one can't wait.
---
Ehhh too lazy to bother.
---
Good explanation. My only concern atm is low level raiding - how will that work? The most fun I've had in classic is the 100 man redridge raids on fresh launches.
---
Old instances havn't changed that much, however it's fairly face roll in my opinion in the instances, could be due to majority of players having the heirloom gear. 
---
TLDR; Wait for classic.
---
I like Alodar
---
if people can escape me camping them by getting an invite to a different "layer" it will be broken, and many will return to priv servs
---
Esfand has a 1-10 video on youtube of paladin leveling. It's not obnoxious.
---
no one needs them bc they will die out anyway and cant even fill a layer
---
People managed back then yes, but the server size was smaller back then as well. Each layer will have roughly the same population as a server in Vanilla so thats a not a good point to try and make
---
Why do folks ball hang streamers so much? These guys didnt "get classic created" the masses of players  who dealt with shitty private servers all these years did. 
---
As for Blizzard giving them access to shit I get it from a business/advertising standpoint but fuck Blizzard for that seeming to be our news sourcr. Not all of us sit around watching some other jackass just sit around..
---
I don't think I clarified enough.
---
Server1a servers 2a are auto generated just like a layer would be.
---
Literally the only difference between my solution and Blizzards is with my solution you pick your layer, and you're stuck in that layer.
---
Layering is brilliant, it's the fact I can move between them I hate with a passion.
---
Phase 1 is my favorite phase and sadly this effects it.
---
What are you talking about? Defias Brotherhood and other RP-PvP servers had without one of the best communities and wasn't dead in any way, whilst Steamwheedle Cartel (normal RP server) was dead because of the release of RP-PvP.
---
An RP-PvP server IS if anything a geniune RP server, because no one would RP a paladin that are friendly with undeads in vanilla.
---
I have a feeling layering is being tested on classic to possibly be put on the live servers later on.
---
And all of them are dumb.
---
If you only speak up about the major issues, Blizzard will see this as "there's not a lot of issues so people are mostly happy". If you speak up about *every* issue, Blizzard will see this as "there's actually a lot of issues, we should at least fix these major ones".
---
Layering is definitely going to be exploited so hard, it will literally be months of standard rates x the total number of players per server. I imagine since layers are cross zone an addon will be created to help "hop layers" like server swap addons used to work.
---
People can:
---
-Get multiple nodes of rare materials
---
-Get multiple kills of the same rare in minutes
---
-Farm Devilsaurs on all layers
---
It may cause problems if the only suppliers are smart people that exploit because then they can set prices, so either everyone does it and healthier prices are set or a select few exploit and determine AH prices for the first phase (potential rollover on 2nd phase)
---
I hate that I might share a server with you on release.
---
True, now I feel so bad for the teachers. They only have 3 months off.
---
If you understand sharding, it's basically continent-sized shards.
---
If you don't know what sharding is, it's basically "parallel dimensions" where you and everything you see is split into multiple worlds within a single server so that there are fewer players per "world" despite being allowing every interaction if you join their chat/group/guild (with the last two putting you on their layer, sharing their world).
---
Bye
---
Yeah, let's not believe the developers or their actual 1.12 client but third party addons and guesswork!
---
??????
---
Being punished for exploiting ANY system or feature in WoW have been a bannable offence since the alpha. What have you been smoking?
---
Imagine being this mad lmaoo
---
My husband and I have been having fun chatting about what we're going to play :)
---
Inb4 people dont get this post.
---
I don't, sorry.  Everything useful seems to be in a video, which makes searching difficult.
---
I've been saying this since the Blizzcon panel/presentation - Ion gets classic/vanilla WoW. He actually sounds excited when he talks about it too.
---
no show me the part where billy, jhony, math, dudebro and twitterella are all farming black lotus and arcane crystals on different layers
---
As if you know anything about my current personal/financial situation. If you aren't a total stroke you can game, party, fuck around as much as you want and still do very well for yourself. That is what the majority of college kids do. That is what college is about really.
---
The man has a point
---
I generally agree with you except for the potential chat channel. Chat channels where Layer 1 can talk to Layer 2 leads to a lot of talking to people who 'don't exist' for you. The rest of the concerns, while legitimate, are certainly extremely minor in the grand scheme of this game
---
If someone gets a invite without a active sub would be
---
It's a parody...
---
Of those two, you want rogue. They are one of the best dps, outperformed really only by warrior, and they are monsters in pvp. Shadow priest great for leveling and decent in pvp (especially if undead), but useless in raids due to mana issues.
---
Really can't go wrong with wrong if you like that playstyle. I don't personally. 
---
As for profession.. it depends a lot on what you want to do with it. Make money? Craft your own gear? Have an advantage in combat?
---
OK I exaggerated a bit. It's NEARLY as bad as sharding. Obviously continent and server based sharding is better than the random ass sharding that retail has, but it still has nearly all the major issues that sharding has.   
---
It's not like vanilla at all, and it solves very few issues for the vast amount of problems it creates
---
A lot of things that you will be able to abuse will be available at lower levels. Arena Master Trinket, Tidal Charm, etc etc
---
☠️FOR THE HORDE ☠️
---
&gt; *Layering exists because 6 months ago, they heard our feedback. And set  out to create a system that fixes the same problem sharding does*  
---
It doesn't fix the same thing sharding does though, that's the problem.  Sharding and layering aren't the same thing, they aren't even close and they don't accomplish the same thing.
---
Let's use the starting zones for an example.  Say on launch day Blizz wants to keep servers capped at 3k.  So on Thunderlord it hits 3k and everybody is in the starting zones.  There's 3 zones for horde, I'm assuming 3 for alliance, so 6 zones and 3k people.  And let's say it's balanced perfectly between horde and alliance and the races.  So 6 starting zones 500 characters each zone.   Blizz doesn't want login queues and they don't want 500 people in the starting zones so they shard them which moves people from Thunderlord's server to other servers so new people can keep logging in there and it cuts the population of the starting zones down to whatever level they set.  However the rest of Thunderlord is static once you get out of the starting zone.  At least that's what they were talking about doing before.
---
Now let's use the same scenario and look at layering.  Thunderlord fills up to 3k and Thunderlord 2.0 is spun up, it fills up and we get 3.0.  Copies of the same server with the capability to move between via grouping.  This is what we've gleaned from dev interviews and 2nd hand info from quasi celebrities.  
---
Someone explain to me how this solves the problem Blizz says has to be solved of over populated starting zones.  It doesn't!  It's 3k people on a server, spin up a copy.  
---
Unless they are looking at the above and saying hmmm, 6 starting zones, we only want 50 people max in each starting zone so after the server gets 300 people on it spin up a new layer.  Then our Thunderlord server ends up with 10 layers per 3k people.  Then you'd be on a server with 300 people across the whole dang world!
---
My big concern is that we end up with layering AND sharding both.  They are going to push layering as the fix for long term server pops and push sharding to make launch easier.  If they do that they still haven't learned what made classic wow so great and I'll be back to private servers.
---
Just head to the WoW section when BETA launches and look for a streamer you like. I think most people will watch Sodapoppin though.
---
Jokes on you. Their layer did not support 5 40 man raids so they are attacking on multiple layers.
---
oh noes..
---
I want to know what happened with Karen. Did she request to talk with a GM?
---
Do you think he turned green
---
Oh yeah being put in a new layer with 3k people everytime you relog is totally blizzlike. You morons are unbelievable lmao.
---
I hope server first faction leader kills are a major thing
---
&gt;Point me to the official Blizzard statement that says it will be removed please.
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=311
---
&gt; If management turns around and wants it left in...guess what... the devs cannot do anything about it.
---
It's to manage the players, having server queues or 1000 players in the starting zones would be a terrible experience. Once the population settles, it will no longer be needed.
---
It all depends if you view 'not being able to play the game' to be part of the classic experience :)
---
If so they should also implement some tech to make the layers crash randomly for the first few weeks. /s
---
14% upvoted. They didn't lmao
---
Retail doesn't have layers it has shards. A layer is a whole continent whereas a shard can be specific to a zone maybe even subzones.
---
In retail outside of cities they are crossrealm zones meaning that people from multiple realms can be in the same shard. Those realms don't have to be a part of your connected realm.
---
Then there is connected realms which can be 4 realms permanently connected together for guilds, trading, auction house which they all share. Just consider it 4 realms taped together permanently to make a single realm functionally acting as a server merge. If they are not part of your connected realm you cannot trade with them or join their guild etc.
---
&gt; Except that they did.
---
I knew someone would nitpick.
---
Yes, a small minority of people complained about some of this stuff but it's quite different. Phasing was an attempt to make classic *more* authentic, if people want to push Blizzard towards an even more accurate representation of vanilla, then why not? Isn't that what we all want?
---
People who attack others for their attempts to petition Blizzard into improving their classic experience make absolutely no sense to me. You're literally stabbing yourself in the foot.
---
In fact, you even mentioned a positive outcome of people "complaining:"
---
&gt;People complained when they thought spell batching wasn't going to be a thing until Blizzard said yes we'll do spell batching.
---
&gt;As I watch this latest drama over layering unfold, it's becoming clear that this community doesn't want Classic--they want a pserver experience run by Blizzard.
---
I'm not really sure what you mean by this. A "pserver experience run by Blizzard" would be a highly authentic representation of classic WoW, with accurate data regarding things like mob stats, proc rates etc curated by Blizzard. That is not what you want? What do you want then?
---
well if you do old instances the other people are typically equipped with scaling bind on account heirloom gear and they rush the instance so fast that people without gear like that wont even have time to loot thinks let alone realise what is actually happening around time, one just tries to follow them and run - thats how it was back when i was subbed to retail, but maybe things changed?
---
Multiple Men Online Role Playing Girls!
---
But is there a better solution?
---
Esfand would probably be the most chill. Soda would be laid back as well, seeing as Classic isn't entirely new to him as well (due to having played on private servers)
---
# OPEN UP THE DAMN BETA BEFORE I PISS MYSELF
---
Good shitpost, I enjoyed it, but this subreddit is full of too many toxic bonobos so you're probably just gonna get downvoted.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Thank you heaps I really didn't think about it from this perspective. I knew that eventually I'd be fighting raid geared people but the time frame you bring up is really important. I think as a good player I could possibly compete with raid geared players, but once naxx hits.... ooft I think when that happens people are going to finally remember what burst damage really is.  
---
I played mage all through BC. I think they are great unfortunately I just don't like the play style without the frost elemental. If this were a BC server it literally wouldn't even be a question. :)
---
I hope you're right man. And I hope they manage to use this for only the first few weeks. I want them to get this right.
---
Thanks for taking the time to answer in detail.
---
&gt; about right for what I like. This will eventually be mounted higher for watching vids while grinding. I suggest getting something around the 24-27"
---
I highly recommend ASUS ROG lineup. Just make sure you play with the monitor settings to get the best contrast/color out if it. 
---
 e.g. [https://www.amazon.com/27-inch-Monitor-PG278Q-Response-Display/dp/B00MSOND8C/ref=sr\_1\_10?keywords=ASUS+ROG+Swift+1440P&amp;qid=1557925338&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-10](https://www.amazon.com/27-inch-Monitor-PG278Q-Response-Display/dp/B00MSOND8C/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=ASUS+ROG+Swift+1440P&amp;qid=1557925338&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-10)
---
It was risky, and I don't think it's panning out... oh no.
---
I'm kinda guessing you imagine it to be like this  
---
General chat: LFM this dungeon, need your role  
---
You: Whisper: Hey, I'll join  
---
Them: Perfect, I'll invite you  
---
You accept invite and poof the guy next to you disappeared and three new guys just appear from thin air  
---
This is what it looks like when you shard a zone into multiple instances currently. It won't be like that in classic though since the first "LFM this dungon" isn't visible to you to begin with because it was sent in another layer (a.k.a. on another server entirely).   
---
The only way you can hop layers, as far as I understand it, is if you get invited from someone that's your Bnet friend already. And then you'll get on his layer permanently. If you two guys then invite a third friend, he'll come to your layer permanently. The only way of jumping layers consistenly would then be to have two separate bnet friends that invite you to theirs but never group up together. Unless they're smart enough to get one of them sent to the same layer as you anyway since you guys are connected through your friends list.
---
&gt;every single announcement is one more thing people who expected a true classic experience have to give up in favour of YOU.
---
What the fuck are you smoking? They are consistently trying to make it #nochanges, but there are just some things you have to consider because if they literally make no changes you will not even *get* the vanilla experience. Things have changed since then.
---
&gt;his change is pure QoL for the wrong people.
---
This makes me think you don't even bothered to read about layering. First of all, it's gonna be only for a set launch period. This is not something that will happen for the rest of Classic.
---
Secondly, how the fuck would you then solve all the problems Classic faces? This is so typical you "hardcore #nochanges" people, you don't even understand enough to be allowed an opinion.
---
WoW Classic will have an initial wave of players that will be extreme - nothing like vanilla, this is way bigger. Making no changes to prepare for this will mean it becomes less vanilla like as well. Just because you can't think ahead does not mean Blizzard shouldn't.
---
Or should they just go #nochanges on this? Sure, what a *great* idea, then once the initial surge is over you all play on dead servers. Oh, or they could just make less servers to begin with and half the people will sit at launch day looking at "full server" on *all* servers. These are things Blizzard have to consider.
---
Or what about totally unplayable first few days? This is not going to be vanilla "fun how many we are in the same zone", this is going to be literally unplayable. Just look at pservers, the only that have ever made this method enjoyable did it with dynamic spawns - which is not Blizzlike either.
---
You are honestly dumb if you think it is a good idea to not change anything. Classic will face issues that vanilla didn't and as such need to look for a solution for these new issues.
---
Thank you for this post, the sheer amount of frothing rage people were displaying yesterday over laying is incomprehensible. Worse still are the ones who are one hundred percent convinced that this will be heavily abused and done so easily. As if everyday people will meet in a zone, see if they can see each other and write down that information somewhere for someone to use when they are getting ganked and want an out. It would have to be updated in real time every day and yet its the first think people scream about.
---
This is the main reason why I can't use massive monitors like that, yeah. I tried a 44" monitor one time, and found that I had to keep turning my head all around just to see either side of the monitor.
---
Get some tech that randomly puts people into 72 hour queues, even when there are no queues.
---
Both are very solid classes, why not flip a coin and get one to 60 then do the other as your first alt?
---
game is basically unplayable with 8k+ on 1 realm.
---
There is a lot of information about layer but it seems spread over multiple videos and different threads on reddit seem to have missed different parts of it so it's all a bit confusing. 
---
The way I understood it is that a layer is still essentially a full server population.  There is probably only like 2 MAYBE 3 layers.  But you don't get to pick what layer you're on aside from friend group hopping but there is no guarantee really that your friends are on a different layer.  Sharding is like 50 people in a zone, layering is like 3000 people in a zone.  How would you know if your friend is on the same layer as you too?  Does your friend run to a black lotus next to you then get invited to all your friends until maybe you change layers?  Or if you're a mage trying to aoe farm.. if the next layer also has 3K people, it's not like the area will necessarily be open and ready for just you. 
---
Also on lower or even maybe medium pop servers probably wont have multiple layers if they have that high of a cap.
---
Dude just snapped. Rip
---
What are you talking about? There is not a single contradiction with what the developers have said.
---
Your statement is false if you've been reading the news coming through.
---
But let's assume you're correct. What is your "blizzlike" alternative.
---
Well I think blizzard will get the reference too... I don‘t think this will work. But good luck :)
---
Yeah, it's too niche for a meme I think.
---
[what actually happens](https://i.imgur.com/YC5lorE.png)
---
Many people in general don't like getting buffs removed from them.
---
Whatever correlation there may be isn't relevant to the topic at hand.
---
This is so very kind of you. Fortunately, I am one of the ones that are indeed able to afford the game. You are a generous person, thanks for being this way, never change.
---
I get it, but your timing is poor with all the salt currently flowing through.
---
&gt; The XP they give is also awful in vanilla and only the quests make them really worth doing.
---
Or... you know, the fun? The social interaction?
---
If you like the lobby based game that is retail better, then it's totally up to you. And everyone else who feels that way. On the other hand there's nothing wrong with players enjoying class and ressource management, team coordination and social interaction. To each their own.
---
My statement is correct you clueless dunce.

---
Ya but the only one of those problems that we can expect today is the long queues. I understand that's a problem they want to address, and I think the best solution to deal with that is to create multiple instances of the same server with a planned merge later. They could have "Illidan-A, Illidan-B, Illidan-C" and when phase 2 rolls around, they merge them all together. They would share stress points of merges (such as character or guild names) so that the merge is smooth. If they did this, you couldn't switch between layers at will by re-logging or accepting invites. That would be my recommended solution if they want to fix queues (which i think they probably should).
---
Oh man, people will be so disappointed when they realize they can't "layer hop" to farm more resources. Blizzard has already explained this like three times already in separate interviews, even with sharding(or layering) it doesn't affect world spawns, that's another system that exists within retail WoW. That system won't exist in classic WoW.
---
You say "On launch layering eliminates the problem of overpopulation of zones."  No it doesn't.  It puts 3k people on a server and 3k on the next copy of that server.  Layering is not zone specific it cannot control the population of individual zones.  Launch day it puts 500 people in each of the 6 starting zones.  
---
I bring this up because my fear is that Blizzard is going to throw this layering idea out and then they are going to say that because 500 people is too many in the starting zones we are going to need sharding too, and then we get both.
---
A subscription will get you access to both.
---
I think the reason people complain, is that they are afraid that blizzard might not end up turning it off at some point, so they rather blizzard did not invest anytime at developing it at all. For me personally i don't mind that much while shading or layering might hurt my experience abit, but it won't be a deal breaker for me.
---
How would have they sustained the game without any new content though?
---
What a nice gesture, you're alright. As someone who has been on the receiving end of free game time because of financial situations, I love seeing this. :)
---
Yup, just don't buy BFA. You've just saved £30.
---
you think maybe they are lying when they explicitly told us exactly how it works? 
---
Otherwise we do know exactly how and why it's different from sharding
---
Thrall plays four dimensional chess.
---
lmao, imagine if the mobs could invite their buddies to their layer when they started getting attacked
---
Same. When I quit, Anetheron was a ghost town.
---
ye I was just musing about it :) I can see how there are situations were people are in college at the moment with army etc. Was not expecting that to be a major issue tho
---
Play what sounds the most fun for you. Classic is not very alt-friendly, so your main should be what you want to play most, regardless of whether a lot of other people play it.
---
And then just keep your number 2 options as your main alt for a little fun and variation. 
---
I'll be going prot pally because I love them, and keep a mage as my main alt to do the things my prot pally never get invited to.
---
No. Classic is free with BfA, and BfA is free with Classic. It's one release for two games. If you want Classic, pay the sub fee that the game has always had. Consider it 15 a month to play Classic and you get a free secondary game on top of that.
---
still gonna die down and thats not worth the server costs
---
Personally? I want everyone in the same server at the same time. I planned on sticking around for the long haul so a week of messing around and chatting to people whilst it dies down a bit is fine for me, I'm not going to get server first and I want the player experience not just silently sitting there questing in an empty world. 
---
At the very least give us 1 of each server type without all the phasing tech, You guys can have your fun me and my lot can have ours.
---
Let's say they do your method. What's your solution if the servers die out because too many people leave? Is a server merge even going to work in your scenario. If it does, how does that positively affect any remaining community?
---
At least with layering you still all exist on the same server. You can still interact with all the players and it's only temporary.
---
Layering is a solution. Not the best solution. Saying it’s the best just makes you seem like a fanboy.
---
There must have been loads of options available to tackle these issues. And once again, blizzard prioritized money and ease over the player experience.
---
They don’t care the layering fucks up immersion. They’d rather pay less money. That’s all Blizz is now.
---
There’s an English version with these missing as well, updated version probably didn’t go out to other regions in time. 
---
Remember kids, poor research is why we have to deal with fake news all the time.
---
I've been subbed since 05 with few breaks, wish me luck!
---
Dude do us all a favor and stay offline until the layers merge.  Your experience and ours will be better
---
It would change because you can walk between zones and doing so *will not change your layer* in Classic. That's what layers *are*--continent-wide shards. :)
---
Recognized it was Burning Legion because I was in BLUESTEEL haha... Night Elf Priest called Darklagoon, before I re-rolled warrior.
---
**bad hair day?**
---
That their plan of fooling people by calling it "layers" didn't quite work out.
---
The alternative being to do monotonous braindead leveling content from 2-12 years ago that scales with your level. So yeah, like he said in the video, you just sit in Orgrimmar. It's even more true now than when he originally said this
---
Also, dungeons don't require CC, interrupts, dispels or really anything. They're basically extended tank-n-spank sequences you warp into and finish as fast as possible so you don't have to spend $60 on a boost
---
&gt;good luck setting that up unless you can communicate with strangers 
---
FTFY
---
Hopping between layers seems possible and easy. It will be exploited. I pray this shit won't last for long, as they promise. Not that they've just broken a promise about only starting zones...
---
&gt;Only according to people on Reddit, not the people making the game. Watch the video. Once people have spread out into more zones they can reduce, and eventually eliminate layers. There's zero reason they'd have multiple layers up towards the end of phase 1, everyone will be more than sufficiently spread out across the world and the tourists will be gone. Don't worry.
---
I get that is there intentions but ion was quoted with it potentially being up to phase 1 and no longer than that. There could and can be reasons they will want to keep the layering aspect after the game is launched up to phase 2. We won't really know until they get there or say otherwise.
---
I like it.
---
I only want one
---
I thought of the same picture :D So true.
---
It's like 6am in California, wait a little !
---
Shaman has a massive toolkit. If you can get familiar with 30+ keybinds, and use engineering, you can certainly outplay 2 people. Scales better then warrior in blues.
---
You simply create a new account and subscribe for $15 per month.  You do not need to purchase anything other than the subscription.
---
no, the plan was originally only sharding within realm, and only for the first few starting zones.
---
I think the reason they switched to this is because their old plan would still not compensate for servers being extremely overpopulated in the beginning, and then dying after a few months. This layering thing with only a few servers at launch does a nice job of solving that problem. Of course it introduces new problems as well
---
Where did I say otherwise? Let me explain how this works:
---
300 Tauren logging into Mulgore for the first time at 12:01 AM is a ZONE CONGESTION PROBLEM. Not a world congestion problem.
---
Solution? Sharding. But there's a problem, this introduces WORLD and community inconsistency.
---
Solution? Layers. Layers solves both the ZONE congestion problem and the WORLD inconsistency problem by:
---
A) Easing the number of players in a zone at the START of the game
---
B) Prevents fragmentation of community and world by keeping the players, nodes, etc on the layer consistent so you're not phasing like you would be with sharding.
---
Sharding is by zone and random. Layers is the world and not random. Both solve the same problem of EARLY ZONE CONGESTION while layering solves the additional problem created by sharding.
---
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't put words in my mouth, thanks.
---
I made most of my friends pre 60. Some people leave sure but just as many if not more stay. 
---
I'll sit in a queue then interact with people rather than getting into an empty world instantly. I'd rather that o really would.
---
I don't have a problem with it. I'll be doing it plenty. When it comes to leveling I don't care about groups or dungeons or anything. I just solo grind until I can start doing scholo and the like.
---
you'd have to leave that "wolves" area for sure, not that big of a travesty
---
\+1 for quality brain
---
i dont know why people cares so much about layering they said it will be removed after. I feel that i would be mostly focusing on leveling the first few weeks because it takes so damn long.
---
I prefer to wait to give a judgment on how its bad. Well see in the beta maybe ?
---
oohh my god yes... 2h enhance shammy all day. 
---
I played a weird hybrid spec that increased the crit damage from my shock spells by 100% but I didn't have SS... which didn't really matter, because my earthshock would crit for like 1200 and then I'd windfury them with an Earthshaker (similar to the unstoppable force, but with a stun proc) and they'd be equally as dead. 
---
And if you get good with your totems, you can be really effective against rogues and casters.... druids, hunters, and paladins are going to be your hardest kills... you should eat rogues, locks, mages, priests, and a lot of warriors for breakfast though. 
---
And if you ever get tired of FRAWSTSHAWK you can always roll resto and chain heal your WSG groups to victory.
---
It doesn't seem to be very difficult of a thing to implement. 
---
Just a variable in a database that can change either with manual input or dynamically according to starting zone populations.
---
No, you won’t.
---
People can layer hop easily by logging or getting invites to other layers.
---
You will not see the same people. Guilds will not be able to ambush other guilds even if they know enemies raid times, because no idea which layer they’re on.
---
Layering specifically *removes* the guarantee that you’ll always see the same people
---
Priests can holy nova farm DM lashers I hear.
---
My husband won't mind. But. We have 2 toddlers who ignore me and everything I say, right up until I sit to do something. Then they become human cling ons. My 5 year old is fascinated by WoW and Hearthstone so enjoys watching (and playing if I leave the room too long....).
---
This will lead to mass exploitation as people try to game which layer they’re on
---
Yeah i don't get this either. The layer solution seems well thought out and they are guaranteeing that they will merge everything to a single layer after a few weeks. Yet tons of people are going "How can they do that? Will they just kick people out of the layer if it gets full? Will they get transfered to another server?!" It's like people are trying to think of the worst possible solutions to layers being full and then assuming that's how they're gonna solve it.
---
Why is Billy missing on layering?
---
WHERE IS BILLYYYYYY???
---
Perfection.
---
That’s pretty much what layering is...
---
thanks for the hard work
---
What's funny is when you pose the question to anti-sharding/layering people... 
---
&gt;"What do you do after several months, after many of the tourists quit playing and a server that was once capped with 5-6k people on it, starts to feel quiet and dead? You can't find groups or people to trade with or raid with..."
---
You know what they usually end up saying...?
---
&gt;Just merge some of the servers!!
---
But this comes with the inherit possibility of character name conflicts and guild name conflicts. Nobody wants to be forced to change their character name by adding an "X" or something to the end of it. 
---
The idea is to maintain high server populations for the indefinite future. An MMORPG is not fun without server population and the rate of people quitting becomes exponential. Server merges are messy and are also not Blizz-like. People have attachment to the name of their server. I still know to this day that I played on Eonar!
---
There is no way to recreate the full vanilla experience of 2004, while also maintaining high server populations for the indefinite future. What they are doing is, in my opinion, an incredibly creative and temporary solution to making sure the integrity of the game lasts for years to come.
---
It is the first day. Does it have to have a name? Firstday?
---
well i read it like it was a problem to you.
---
If you don’t have time go play BFA. Simple
---
Unless layers are capped smaller for the first couple days and expand when starting zone populations reduce.
---

---
I killed him. I'm the captain now.
---
&gt;would you rather everything cost insane amounts of gold because of scarcity
---
Of course, how is this even a question? It is a design choice that some things are scarce. That is the whole idea of some things being rare.
---
Your idea is essentially to make everything easier to get so people don't want to buy gold, but how is that better? Oh great, people don't buy gold now, but that is because you just removed the value of gold.
---
I watched the tipsout interview and did not hear that at all :/
---
I think they ran out of meaningful ideas a long time ago. That's how we wound up with Draenor time travel.
---
there was still an existant playerbase, literally the entire WC3 playerbase
---
Not at all. I'm mad because this massively splits the community. I can't see Garry or bazza because Garry is on shard 1 I'm on shard 2 and bazza is on shard 3. Can't recognise any names either because when bazza loged in again we all ended up in different shards again. There is more than just playing with your small group of friends when it comes to classic, You play with everyone unless you can't see them of course...
---
Not sure about what the others are saying, but I'll give you my two cents.
---
Horde enjoy better travel accommodations and flight path(FP) locations. The zeppelin right outside of Orgrimmar takes you to either Undercity or Stranglethorn Vale, where (as an example) they get an exclusive FP, and a guarded town/questhub. Whereas Alliance have one exclusive FP in the very north of STV devoid of town or guards. I wouldn't call it a questhub either -- mostly a checkpoint to get you to Nessingwary's. 
---
I can't quite remember which, but either Blasted Lands or Badlands has an exclusive FP and guarded questhub for Horde only. I believe Horde have more quests in Burning Steppes, Swamp of Sorrows, and Hinterlands, but I'm a bit hazy.
---
Horde have largely been picked by hardcore PvPers due to their racial abilities, but with enough skill and know-how, racial abilities can be minor hindrances. Still, a flat 25% stun resist in Orcs is an advantage. A .5 second cast AoE stun in the Tauren is an advantage. The ~~30~~ 10 seconds of fear immunity in the Undead is also an advantage. The Trolls, I think, are the most criminally underrated race of them all. Their Berzerk is *insane* to have as a caster, and has saved my ass more times than I can count.
---
As far as PvE, I'd give the edge to Alliance just for quality of life. That's not to say that alliance doesn't have some deadly abilities -- they do -- but 10% flat rep gain for Humans, zero-stress AFK from Night Elves, and the defensiveness/mobility of Dwarves/Gnomes is great.
---
If you have any specific questions about racial abilities, please feel free to ask. I realize you aren't asking about Alliance specifically.
---
Horde also used to have an advantage in AV so long as everyone wasn't stupid. You can skip the bridge, and rush the general pretty damn easy. I did it countless times.
---
The cons, to me, about playing Horde are mostly aesthetic. Not just the armor models really, but the Barrens is just awful to look at, and then followed up with Stonetalon Mountains and maybe Thousand Needles if you're lucky. Why not another desert after that? But like, a salt flat, and then a desolate wasteland. 
---
You can avoid those places, sure, but you'd kinda have to try. 
---
Can't really think of much else right now, but hope this helps.
---
MY BROTHER WORK AT BLIZZARD AND HE TOLD ME IT WILL WORK THAT WAY !
---
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from not getting beta. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck didnt i get beta? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I the Classic WoW Beta. I want Classic to surpass retail and fix this broken game. I cannot fucking deal with this right now.
---
That not what i was implying, I was replying to a guy saying "this is just like lost of realms" and trying to say why it wasn't the same as having multiple discrete realms.
---
I understand that's the goal of what it's trying to solve, but I don't think it does much of a better job than sharding does. It's completely non-vanilla and creates more problems than it solves.  
---
I'd recommend making more servers with planned merges, such as Illidan-A, Illidan-B, Illidan-C, which you couldn't hop between at will when you're getting ganked, need to farm more black lotus, or checking for rare spawns, etc.  
---
What if they incorrectly estimate the number of players that will stick around? They said they're planning for 10-20 servers, which only fits 40-80k people post layer merge, which is a laughably small number. There's gonna be more people per server than were on nostalrius pvp.   
---
It's just an absolute fuckfest both before and after merge, it's nothing like vanilla
---
Sort of.  There's going to be more people playing this time then original retail launch.  If you can use modern technology to alleviate the starting zone clusterfuck I'm all for it.
---
Well to be honest, layering was never part of vanilla. Layering will be a cool twist on the experience but IMO low pop, dead servers and server merging was also part of the vanilla experience.
---
Just get a subscription, nothing else
---
Exactly.
---
Guilds will farm *the fuck* out of multiple layers and abuse layer hopping
---
People will be trading aoe farm spots, rare mobs, nodes, mobs etc
---
People are already prepared to steamroll the vanilla economy. Now with layering it just got 3x worse
---
Hmm maybe it ll be completely new encounters for me after all haha
---
You linked one guy's interpretation of what he heard. Yet there are other sources that specifically have it stated that it's set at character creation.
---
That besides the point of instead answering my question you move to insult and offer nothing of any real substance. So you have any opinion other than "Reee, Blizzard bad"?
---
Thanks everyone. Seems pretty unanimous so I'll look for those guys first.
---
It says so on the fucking blue post.
---
My my my, I do enjoy a good chart.  Nice work, OP
---
Happy pre birthday
---
It's fake
---
You have to start somewhere.
---
Much of this discussion is a response to the naysayers doing the exact same thing, making assumptions about how it's implemented and what problems will arise (and also deliberately assuming it's implemented in the worse possible way so they can be right)
---
It's fake retard
---
&gt; because no one would RP a paladin that are friendly with undeads in vanilla.
---
What does this have to do with RP or RP-PvP servers? Seriously? What if the Forsaken is in a guild called &lt;Argent Vanguard&gt;? Still going to kill them? Well in a PvP server you can, and there you go killing immersion since you just killed an Argent. 
---
I'm hopeful for RP-PvP servers, but the reality IS people don't like having DnD events in fucking Stonetalon or something with their lowbie guildies, while in "uniform" then having some other faction group roll along and stomp them. 
---
Personally I'm all for this, I want to RP and I'm torn between RP and PvP realms as it is.
---
People are planning their planning.
---
People are great.
---
What are you talking about. Major part of the vanilla wow enthusiasm is from people that don't play the recent wow or haven't played for many years.
---
I played during vanilla and tbc and am now coming back for the classic release. The subscription is the regular one. I don't feel like it's paying for two games. 
---
Blizzard is making a good move here. Some people get excited about the main game and keep purchasing those expansions and subscription time, some people from the main game jump into classic and boom Blizzard has more loyal subscriber than before.
---
Was at RSM for about 3 years. Now working in industry.
---
Yo Thrall, it's me! It's CJ!
---
wew lad
---
&gt; they need
---
No, they don’t need. It’s an option. They could simply merge servers the regular way.
---
Instead they chose a method that destroys immersion, just so merging realms could be *slightly* easier on them.
---
It’s perfect example of 2019 Blizzard - screwing their player experience for slight profit or technical ease
---
*cries in Stolen Silver*
---
Sorry, all omnisciient one , please forgive for I have offended!!
---
Nah theres nothing proper. Find me an MMO thats under a year old that doesn’t have a P2W system.
---
15 minute respawn timers?  Wow!
---
I remember we had 19 or 29 twinks and despite being cross realm we would see the same people regularly. I think there were battle groups or something, like some set of 2-3-4 servers, so it was still sort of a recognizable community
---
From what I understand they will still share the chat channels, AHs, etc...
---
Hi, /u/dasyoyo16
---
"Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."
---
The way I read it is you need the active sub to play not to be eligible.
---
Opting into the Word of Warcraft Classic Beta shows interest and if you get accepted they get a sub out of you anyway so that's still a win for them.
---
Thats retail experience before max level. The game is now just skip everything until max. Then play a "collector's" stimulator and do mythics.
---
This was an extremely useful response. First of all, not feeling gimped and feeling content with my gear even if it isn't best in slot is exactly what I'll need. Secondly the closest to a good enhance shaman I've seen has been executus gaming on youtube do commentaries and streams on private servers. And I did notice to a bit of surprise that he very often runs 1h shield against melee opponents.   
---
One of the things that also came up when trying to research this earlier is that not to belittle paladins, I was one for all of vanilla, but it's much easier to be a decent paladin than a decent shaman. And yeah as you've already described playing them correctly they can be a rather nuanced class. However I think I could easily play it correctly. And I do plan on focusing on mainly solo pvp. Obviously making friends will be a part of playing the game and I can have fun with them but fun is my ultimate goal and enhance is where I will have the most fun. So if they can't deal with that then I would rather Bg alone.   
---
Your basically describing exactly what I was afraid of when it comes to warrior. Which is a pitty because I love the class. And basically describing exactly the type of class I need when it comes to not being entirely reliant on gear. All in all the responses here have given me alot to think about, I was 99% sure it would be warrior, now I'm not sure at all and even leaning towards shammy.
---
Jump layers until you're in the lowest population layer you can find, farm herbs, ore, leather.
---
You can use this to get the Tidal Charm trinket too for example.
---
You choose the Realm (server) but layers are invisible to the players.
---
I miss the screenshot of the day feature. I used to log on at the beginning to see areas of the game is never get to see through others screens. Was such a cool feature.
---
They were originally BoE. People would stockpile them before the armored mounts patch and then sell them for thousands of gold on AH.
---
Yeah an abusable system is just what asked for. Black Lotus, Rich Thorium and Devilsaur here we go.
---
I've already let my district manager know I'll be taking a week off when classic is released. Just need to send in my PTO request.
---
do you play every game that happens to be free?
---
Jawohl
---
You too! 🙂
---
It's really not sharding at all. And they guaranteed they will slowly merge everything into one big layer. They haven't done a single thing wrong so far with WoW classic so i don't see why people can't just trust them on this one.
---
Ice cold
---
That is literally what layering is, it's not a difficult concept.
---
Yeah unfortunately it looks like it's not. Oh well, the private servers are more blizzlike anyway at this point (scary) just have to hope they stay up after launch.
---
I linked my source. Can you link one source stating that your layer is set at character creation and there's no possible way of changing layers? No you cannot.

Wiping on twin emps lul
---
I guess I should have been more specific that the timing is poor means it won't really be recognized -- or probably even fully read -- and will be lumped with all the other salt out-of-hand.
---
The subscription was always 13$ (or smth like that I don´t Play anymore :D) for BFA (the main game) and it will remain that Price upon classic Launch.
---
You will not have a cheaper Option just for classic. It is the same subscription Price for both - if you happen to Play both - good for you!
---
If not... well than you still pay what everyone was always paying.
---
The point is that all those people are in a "Boycott MW2" Steam group, while they are all playing MW2....
---
good idea! thanks
---
&gt;You and your friend are creating characters on same realm but ending up on different layers, hence you cannot play together. 
---
You just group together just like sharding.
---
It's not fun if doing a dungeon is actively delaying the fun I could having more of at max level. I don't want to spend twice as long at level 18 because I did Deadmines multiple times.
---
The game is so bad that you are discouraged from doing the content you enjoy because the XP given is so poor. XP just ends up as a restriction forcing you into quest content which is something many older MMO players complained about. The only valid way to level was to quest.
---
like retail on my current PC aint so great. i want Private servers(original graphics) capabilities. instant logins. instant portals. instant summons. fk loading screens.
---
Just making sure. Obviously not the case for the many people that "speak for the classic crowd" on this sub. Lol.
---
&gt; we'd see 3k people across starting zones on each layer  
---
&gt; the exact opposite of what layering intends to solve
---
You're implying that Layering is intending to solve overcrowding. These are literally your words. I don't understand how I'm putting any of them in your mouth, but okay.
---
I'm simply pointing out that neither sharding or layering is being used to solve zone related problems, that's all. It was all about maintaining healthy server populations, period.
---
You're dealing with PVP in goldshire?
---
Troll
---
I mean that's just an assumption as is what I'm saying. You're right about what a layer is but we have no idea how exactly you get put into a layer.
---
They've already learned their lesson with realm hopping and made it much harder to do. In Classic it would be 1000x more detrimental to the game so I honestly can't see them not having some sort of safeguard against it. We'll see.
---
Layering is the entire world
---
Like they confirmed it would come as it comes with warts and all right? A time capsule they said, Just like they also said sharding in the starting zones only. At some point you are burned enough to stop touching the cooker.
---
I meant retail vanilla. This layer thing sounds like you’re phasing people on the same realm, which is worrisome because it completely screws with the realm communities we had before this junk you posted.
---
Very true! Thanks again.
---
Na you just didn't try
---
Troll post?
---
For the first few weeks
---
Good post my dude! People will always complain. But after exeriencing some of the private server vanilla and tbc launces over the past years im happy about layering. People dont seem to understand that its not only to stop overpopulated zones, but to make sure the servers are stable and that you dont have to sitt in a queue for 4 hours every time you log inn. Its not like they put it in because they think its fun, it serves a purpouse.
---
Dude settle
---
I love stimulating collectors
---
Ehhhh Kalender sieht 👌 aus haha
---
You can easily play more casually than that. MC will be puggable after phase 1, but I do see what you’re saying from the perspective of competitive guild progression.
---
Same here. Good luck!
---
1) If Johnny and Karen joins Guild 1, they will be transferred to Layer 1 surely because they are both friends and guildies.
---
2) Private servers implemented Dynamic Spawning which will not be in Classic as it was stated in an interview.
---
$15, but yeah you're right. It's ridiculous that people are complaining about the price, when it's been the same for the past 15 years.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
They do not specify logging changing layers. Do you have an answer to my question now?
---
Yeah miss me with that orc shit, seeya in layer 2!
---
Anetheron ?  character name?
---
ドルイドはベストクラスです。
---
But "the community" arbitrarily decides what is good or bad and then circlejerks dumb talking points to death.
---
This solution is an improvement over anything else I've seen the community suggest. It's not stabbing myself in the foot. Especially not "literally" (???).
---
Hi, /u/Krychek26
---
Potentially as bad as the first 4 months
---
Stop lying when you say “a few weeks” Blizz hasn’t specified how long phase 1 or layering will be
---
hunters are hard to deal with as a caster, if u get spaced ur goose is cooked, if u can get into their deadzone u are gucci.
---
it slows you down by half the exp gained from every mob, but not quests. and since u are killing things supposdely twice as fast that will counteract the exp loss. ofc u might have the off situations where u run out of mobs because u are killing them too quick.
---
the greatest thing about duo leveling is ofc having fun and also u gain more survivability, so if u make mistakes and multipull u will probably be able to handle it, also if u get ganked ull have an easier time
---
Seems like it’s all of phase 1,
---
Nobody got a key yet?
---
Will you be forming massive counter raids in the first few weeks of Classic? TBh I don't think so. Ion literally promised, firmly stating that this is a short term thing, and will under NO circumstances last longer than phase 1, but can last anywhere from a couple weeks after launch to the end of phase 1.
---
Didn't they tweak the debuff limit too? Slightly?
---
ligga
---
That may be a mistake on my part, but sharding works this way in Retail afaik.
---
I can respect your opinion, but the big picture is still there. If layering weren't a thing, they'd have to have a lot of servers, and queues could still be a reality. Then when the playerbase eventually settles down, some sort of merging or transfering would have to take place to keep healthy populations in most servers. And this, in my opinion, would be no different from having layering in the beginning weeks after launch. Obviously we still disagree on whether layering will be temporary or permanent.
---
As much as I want a genuine vanilla back with all its flaws, the ability to actually play and enjoy it comes first. This for me means that I am willing to accept layering for a given timeframe to guarantee a smooth launch, that allows players to first of all be online without queuing, and secondly enjoy the game without having to fight for monsters and quest items against a thousand other players.
---
Finally, you brought up the example of questing in an empty world. As far as I know, no one has any information in how exactly layering works, outside what Blizzard has told us. So implying that layering would cause players to quest in an empty world is a brave assumption if you ask me. Time will tell, but from the dev interviews, to me it seems like this is not a bad way of handling the whole situation. A compromise, of course, but no one knows for certain before beta footage is out.
---
Sadly some of them will turn of with classic release :(
---
So rares and nodes will just disappear right in front of me? Good system there my man.
---
Did you quit the game in a graveyard, or?
---
Possibly. In the US we use astronomical because it's the only consistent way to do it. The country is so huge that weather varies massively between different parts of the country so that's a useless thing to base it on, and schools have different school years as well (I know when I was a kid, school ended mid-late June which many consider summer but is still technically Spring).
---
IF that's how layering works, just think of it like them logging out. Done.
---
THAT IS ALMOST LITERALLY WHAT LAYERING.
---
So what should they do ? Add 150 realms so everyobody can play on launch but they will all be dead within weeks because 80% of the players are curious BFA tourists that won't go past level 20 ?
---
Deciding between Shaman, Warrior, or Rogue. Want to do a mix of pvp and pve. My main fear is being stuck as a healer for raiding if I choose shaman; I healed when I played last and would like to play a DPS class this time. Also, is totem management annoying?
---
That's basically right, but they're not mutually exclusive
---
Shards can and are comprised of people from various servers in its current implementation
---
Numbers are server side. Private servers don't have vanilla server data, they were created from memory, videos, etc.
---
&gt; The vocal minority was happy with the good decisions and criticized the bad / questionable ones.
---
I think the discussion has been a bit more complex than you're describing it here. Yes, the #NoChanges crowd who were unwilling to discuss any sort of changes to the game were a bit tiring. But so are the people who are unwilling to discuss resistance to changes to the game.
---
However, if you claim it was just a "vocal minority" that supported things like the phasing update, then I say that's just provably incorrect. But I guess it depends on what you consider to be the "good changes" or "bad changes."
---
&gt;The rest of you just screamed like the chipmunks you are.
---
&gt;I hope none of you play Classic, like you say you won't. For everyone's sake.
---
The discussions themselves are not the problem. The problem is people like you, who resort to insults and name calling whenever they see an opinion that doesn't coincide with their own. You want an echo chamber, not a discussion of what is the best direction to steer a game that we all enjoy - even when these discussions (which you would labeled as chipmunk screaming) have resulted in positive changes for the game such as the phasing system and spell batching.
---
Instead of shutting down people who you don't agree with and labeling them as incels, maybe actually engage in fruitful discussion on the potential positives and negatives of any sort of proposed changes or systems.
---
i lucked out that my husband and i both play so i didn't have to explain anything to him, but we told our family we're going on "vacation" so we have a week to play uninterrupted without them bothering us lol
---
Lets say you lived in a nice little suburb, had good neighbors and went over to Joe's place for BBQs on the weekend.
---
Then you moved to another suburb. It's just as nice, it has the exact same layout and same amount of people. But they are different people. Joe isn't there anymore, now it's Bill. Bill is a dick.
---
That's how you lose the sense of community. Each time you login, its like moving house to another suburb, with randomised neighbors.
---
Layering kills immersion.
---
At least with sharding, immersion damage was limited to starting zones.
---
Layering now makes immersion damage realm-wide.
---
Blizzard pulling a “you guys don’t have phones?” with this one
---
https://i.imgur.com/Sp6W7C7.png
---
Yes it is me who is lying.
---
He specifically says in the interview that the servers aren't the problem. The problem is having 30k people in Duskwood. That's not a good experience for anyway, no matter how hardcore Vanilla you are.
---
the confirmation is in the actual post from Blizzard...
---
More than 3 football fields?
---
The BFA players of this subreddit (there are a lot) won’t get this
---
As players relog and new players start the load will be balanced. Not perfectly but there will be some balancing. You may see a few less people than you would have on a server cap realm, but not by much.
---
I am saying it could be Cross-realm theoretically. It is not in the graphics, but Blizzard mentions the difference as sharding is duplication of zones, whereas layering is duplication of worlds within the realm.
---
The only way I can see them effectively locking it down is if you have to be in a rested zone to switch to you party leader's layer. That would be a fairly reasonable solution, actually.
---
Remember when people on r/classicwow weren't a bunch of drama queens? Me neither.
---
Work sucks man, take time off for what you enjoy. If that's a video game then it's just as valid.
---
Thanks for everything :)
---
Thats the thing i didnt activate my account for 10 years. I did yesterday.. blizz knows why. They could get additional 3 months from me and further if they let me in beta :P
---
If i plan to roll a holy priest, are alch and herb the best professions to level?  thanks
---
September is usually a fantastic month for sun in the UK. I’ll ask my friends about it in October.
---
Currently at RSM as well, I enjoy working here and have no plans to leave.
---
Do not watch Towelliee. He openly bashed classic until he realized he could make money with it. He’s also just a generally unpleasant person.
---
People are gonna spend so much time re-logging and trying to find the best layer, instead of playing the damn game
---
Sales would heavily stagnate after WotlK though.
---
What do you mean by not affecting spawns? Either layers share spawns or they duplicate them.
---
Yes, I plan to be at home in the week when classic will launch.  
---
But from the week after launch I will spend about 3 hours on working days, not more.
---
Good idea! Another metric to account for: when was your account first created?
---
Find out by going here:  [https://battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html](https://battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html)
---
How is that any different from them logging out? Or going onto a different character? You wont be able to tell if someones trying to change layer, logout, or change character.
---
Ok so what happens when Johhny and Karen are farming devilsaur leathers in Un'Goro, they just killed one and they know that the other spawn spots are on farm, so they decide to join a random guild from Layer 1 just so that they can phase out and find themselves sitting next to the devilsaur they just killed and skinned in Layer 2?
---
Brain messed up but strangely it fits.
---
dang i encountered this bug too! should i just open a ticket?
---
Just to be safe i hit you with a PM
---
Sorry master please forgive I didn't mean to offend can you ever forgive?
---
I know what layering is, i dislike it. It's an untested method for handling an issue and nobody supporting seems to care about the impact it will have on the game. There are other methods and we already know how they function. Layering is just spin doctor shite and nobody knows if it will actually work the way they say it will, and even if it does, it doesn't sound great to me.
---
And how would i handle it? Queues and smaller servers sizes, dynamic spawns are preferable, if the population isn't blizzlike then neither should the mob population, but again, this is Blizzards choice to have huge server numbers. These are solutions i assume you dislike, but i won't worry about the downsides for my preferences as you don't. Let's play by your rules!
---
My priority is how the community functions in game rather than gameplay functions.
---
And honestly no, i don't mind borderline unplayable servers for a few days. I had fun then and i'll have fun with it now. I have good memories of watching hordes of level 1-5 people fucking around, dueling and yelling at each other. I have next to no memories of modern WoW starting zones because they just don't fucking matter apparently, smooth and non-engaging.
---
yeah I'm not so much concerned with how good I'll be at tagging mobs more excited to just drink in the hype
---
Just by simply claiming someone’s opinion and argument as unfalsifiable does not make you correct, it makes you delusional.
---
Large guilds are gonna absolutely milk this, and put themselves so far ahead of the other faction and smaller guilds
---
You can meme about how people already have their friend groups to play with, but the number one thing people miss about vanilla is community and layering is significantly disruptive of organic community building in phase 1. It already doesn’t have a pvp system to help bring that crowd together, so there’s just a lot working against the server cohesion. I think it’s a fairly sensible solution overall, but you’re completely disregarding the main drawback to this system which is a direct hit to the biggest draw to the game
---
Do we know yet how it will work ? name reserving I mean
---
I hope the part about being able to tank 5 mans is true though.
---
&gt;You obviously don't understand WoW Classic. 
---
You clearly don't actually because you're already declaring what people should and should not care about.
---
I can't stand assholes like you who declare that leveling is the only thing that matters and that people who don't enjoy that and instead enjoy max level PVP or raiding are somehow playing the game wrong.
---
Im gonna sit down and think about it.
---
u gotta find a casual guild willing to take a few meme specers. ret paladins do awful dps, and are very boring to play in classic. even if you put in hard yards getting every consumable you will still lag behind every other mainstay dps class.
---
Someone hasn't had to queue for 3 hours before. Or does that magically disappear as players thing out in the world?
---
I just bought an Alienware 34”. I haven’t put tons of time into it yet (was waiting on Classic), but thus far it has been fairly easy to get used to. I played Civ 5 and within minutes I’d forgotten about the screen size difference.
---
Good luck with your decision!
---
Wait he gets his hands on Might of Menethil ! :D
---
No, it's not because he ignored the economy abuse of the layering. If they block layering in high-end zones then it would be good.
---
He already committed to not having sharding for more than a few weeks during Blizzcon
---
Reddit mobile. This isn't even the thread I was replying to lol. My bad.
---
You're getting angry over things you have that are wrong. You will be able to be in any guild on a server regardless of layer. Joining a guild will be similar to joining a party. You'll be apart of the guilds layer of you're not already.
---
How am I stupid by relaying what's being said. Can you make any comment without getting angry and insulting people?
---
I loled
---
added to the list!
---
I keep searching my gmail for 'blizzard' every 5 minutes. No work getting done today..
---
You sound like u r butthurt because either you studied hard and didn't make it or you made it but at what cost...
---
I'm doing pretty fine with a couple companies already trying to get me before i finish my degree. Going to classes is a waste of time, you are much better off studying by urself when u r supposed to be in classes, that's my experience in my uni, and its IST it's actually known for its difficulty exactly because you have to do everything by urself. Don't be so salty if i didn't even mentioned how much i studied lol
---
Unlucky
---
Pretty sure its not live like you said, and pretty sure rogues/war are kings of dps overall on most fights
---
Reckoning procs when you get crit. Attacking a sitting target has a 100% chance to crit.
---
You can move the player/target frames in the default UI, no addons needed.
---
That layers would be changed everytime you log in. Your info was not stated by devs so I'm wondering where exactly you read / who exactly told you about said info.
---
Pretty sure I've decided on rogue.  Really enjoyed my mage throughout all of Vanilla, but ganking people in STV with one shots sounds appealing to me in my old age.
---
Also probably going alliance so I don't have to sit in BG queue times since I imagine everyone going Horde.
---
Will this be the case? You don't know how it's going to work. Layering appears to be session-length, so the only way they're going to change layer is a friend inviting them to their group. As far as you'll know, they've logged out.
---
Lol yeah right, you'd have massive amounts of people complaining about "server identity" and shit like that.
---
And then, when queues are 5 hours and starting zones are unplayable and then when realms are dead they'd be the first to complain
---
"I don't want a solution. I want to be mad!"
---
unless you already have battletag friends who are on a different layer, how are you going to communicate with random players to invite you to a new layer ?
---
Most of these people don't post on r/classicwow. As this subreddit has gained members, the average person on here has changed. This subreddit nowadays is mostly comprised of modern day WoW players who don't like current WoW, and are excited to play classic. It's hard to even look at this subreddit for someone like myself because it's so clear most people here don't understand what made vanilla special. Sure, classic is going to be good, but it hurts deep inside when people don't understand how much better classic could be if they did some things differently, such as layering.  
---
The only reason I've been active on the subreddit at all recently is because I want to clarify to people that layering is basically the same thing as sharding, except it's server and continent based instead of the random garbage that sharding is. It still has all the same issues that come with at-will layer hopping. It's a completely unauthentic to vanilla, and I don't think it's too hard to see that. Most people realized sharding will be terrible for classic wow, so I really hope everyone can realize that layering is nearly just as bad.  
---
Many of the people who are against both sharding and layering have already given up, and have gone into the shadows.  
---
I've been religiously following Classic's development since the announcement. I spent 3-6 hours a day for months reading discussion about classic, super excited for release. I barely look at anything now because it seems so clear to me that Blizzard does not care about creating an "authentic vanilla experience" like they claim. Layering is it stands is the farthest thing I could think of from vanilla WoW.
---
Are you serious? Did you read it all and/or even follow the link?
---
It's parody post and altho I appreciate your concern for my well-being, this was just a bad attempt at humor to get Beta Access.
---
Why do you care so much about how other people play the game. Are you going to get mad when they log off too?
---
Yeah would be justifiable if it was a new game but it’s 14years old, this is why when a AAA game releases I usually wait a year or a sale. Usually save 50-70%
---
It's ok maybe one day you get off your high horse
---
Until then, that EDM will prob keep sounding good LMAO
---
bye felicia
---
People should be rejoicing at this news not trying to throw their toys out of the pram.
---
Ahh thank you.
---
Yeah its only temporary, I'm a purist but this is seriously not worth the time to argue over. 
---
get over it kid.
---
Fucking liar
---
I’m not going to exploit anything. I’m going to cleverly make use of game mechanics.
---
What I have learned from gaming is never take off work around a mmo launch. Rarely does it go smooth. I hope Blizzard proves me wrong :)
---
I miss the old planes walking cows had. Mooo.
---
I think this only goes back so far - for example i've had the same active account since Nov 2005 but this history only goes so far back as 2010 it seems.
---
Yeah, we have been practicing mc/ony with just phase 1 gear and its tougher than people realize, trying to not overheal with 40 people is tough, and if one person screws up they can be responsible for a wipe
---
You can't "freely" travel between them. You use the party functionality, because parties cannot work if people in the party are not on same layer. So if you have a friend (or a stranger in discord, how is blizz gonna tell the difference) you need to play with, and you got on different layers, there has to be a way for you to play together right?
---
And all the consumables.
---
I believe!
---
Damn that's actually a great idea! That would drastically cut down on the problems that could potentially arise.
---
Thanks for the video link bro! One of the things I loved about classic was the minute changes to spec that people made to suit themselves. That sounds awesome! Thanks heaps for the info about counter classes :)
---
The whole concept of flying was SO COOL to think of back when they first announced it! I Remember rolling a druid just because of the flying form! :D   
---
It ended up being a tragedy for the game :(
---
Old style zg bow?
---
The solution sounds fine to me, I'm just saying there has been zero source indicating they are willing to do that many layers.
---
well yeah, but those can be purchased with gold.
---
Cross realm bgs, I don’t think you will be waiting too much
---
same i was hesitating between the 2 but i chose Hunter since i will focus more on pvp, wpvp then pve and i want big crits and easier to gear up.
---
I played warlock a bit on a private server and they are pretty good ! No wrong choice there my friend
---
They are lying
---
once again
---
a change in armor affects the entire skills dmg not just the additional 99
---
a 5,4 % reduction on the estimated 99 bonus damage would equal a gain of 93,6 dmg
---
And relationships are about more than you. It’s completely understandable for a life partner to be annoyed if you take 100% of your vacation time to play a game instead of going on getaway you’ve talked about or having available time off to go with her to her parent’s funeral
---
In celebration of the release date I will be posting a page from "The Art Of Warcraft" every other day. To look back on concepts that predate even the beta of Vanilla. There were some cool ideas out there and of course.. so bad ones!  
---
I really like this Veteran Warrior and feel like his aesthetic would have been welcome. What do you think?
---
Vol 1 was the best but vol 2 made orcs my favorite race
---
[https://youtu.be/Wl2SxjsCcHQ?t=76](https://youtu.be/Wl2SxjsCcHQ?t=76)
---
It's basically the same thing except layering creates a hard segregation of players into different versions of a realm, whereas sharding is more flexible but that might lead to players frequently vanishing. Isn't there talk that layering will be dynamic in regards to the size of the area being layered? It doesn't make sense to layer an entire continent when only a couple of areas are overpopulated.
---
Have you ever actually played vanilla or pserver? You’re acting like people routinely just logged out and quit the entire play session. Even with 10k online that rarely happened.
---
Now - with Layering - it gives such an easy way out of any disliked situation. People vanish logging will be the norm especially in stv and other high density places. Those places will have the worst damage to immersion
---
I would add that you don't need to keep one Prof or the other, too. I know many will take tailoring for BiS crafting at 60, drop it after they've made said items, and go alchemy or engi depending on play style - PvP, pve, etc.
---
hahaha sorry! ;)
---
please do not be a scum and try to ask this guy to pay for classic if you can afford it. His target here are people in countries where 15$ is about a week of work salary. Please put yourself in other people's shoes and be decent human beings. thank you
---
we're looking to buy a house and move before classic, preferably by late july/early august at least, so we can have our game room set up and ready to go so we can no life it for at least a week before returning to the real world.
---
Okay... Like what? No economy will be ruined by sharding in the first few weeks. There simply won't be enough value in low level drops to do that. And it appears developers said they want a high population cap on layers, so probably around 2k. What is the problem?
---
How? Especially if there's not a way to know which layer is which?
---
mine stops at 2006, might be because it just caps at a certain amount of lines
---
And how many layers are there likely to be per server? We just don't know yet. For some there may only literally be 2 layers. Who knows?
---
l m a o
---
You can relog to switch layers, you can group between layers and get locked to a new one and you can switch continents to get a new layer.
---
The issue with sharding was only partly that players/mobs dissapeared around you sometimes. The biggest issue was that you were no longer in the same world with everyone else, people got split up between different versions of the same zones and thus you no longer saw many of the other players on your server out in the world.
---
That's the issue. Stop trying to strawman together some shitty excuse like "immersion breaking". No, people loathe sharding/CRZ/layering because it allows people to be split apart on a server.
---
Could be up to 4 months or as long as p1 lasts
---
Saying 2 weeks is straight up conjecture
---
For 2 weeks.
---
Yeah, most of my comments were before I realized layer jumping would be permanent, you summed it up pretty well. I’m still anxious about not necessarily seeing the same people in the world as you quest around but it’s starting to not look too bad.
---
Well you aren't thinking long term. You're assuming tourists won't exist and that starting zone overpop is the only problem to solve.
---
So you either get sharding which is even worse or server mergings which is worse. This is an in between solution that allows you to play with your friends and should help keep servers populated once layering is no logger needing without clunky server merges
---
I think you need to own the basic game tho to subscribe no?
---
When did you opt in ? 
---
Yesterday
---
Are you a content creator?
---
How long has your sub been active?
---
Started yesterday again before that it was 10 years dead. But it ran from classic to wotlk
---
Are/were you actively playing BFA?
---
Location(EU/US/etc)
---
EU
---
When was your account created?
---
Around 2005 somewhere
---
Did you play vanilla?
---
Will edit if i get an invite =)
---
No keys out yet, but i think its going to be mainly for streamers at start and maybe more invites later on.
---
Wikipedia is *not* a secondary source. It is *an aggregation of* primary and secondary sources.
---
Do you want to know what that makes Wikipedia? A *tertiary source*. Yikes!
---
And those are not “sources” the same way primary and secondary sources are. Most importantly, Wikipedia is not a *reliable* source according to their own info pages due to its very nature.
---
Goes back to my first sub, January 5, 2005 for me.
---
I've seen how this could be possible, but...how big of an impact is this really going to be? How many people can or will be bothered to do it? It may not be that big of an issue.
---
Blizzard should probably not discuss possible exploits publicly and bring awareness of how to do them, as well.
---
you'll have to excuse my ignorance, i haven't played wow in quite some time.  But what does min/max mean?
---
Make a level 1 on that one big server right now and you will quickly see why layering is mandatory at launch. The starting areas should reasonably take 30-45 minutes, but they can take 2-3 hours.
---
Forming a group slows you down but okay. At least until 30ish
---
Happy cake day, bud.
---
I'm not going to be playing Classic at this point, so don't worry. They  already messed it up.
---
Well to bad i won't be pvp flagged (dw im on a pvp server)
---
and while they are distracted we hit orgimmar like a ninja from the back without them ever knowing
---
Yeah the shaman toolkit is huuuuuuge. It's actually one of the main reasons I'm a bit iffy about rolling it, just because it does require a tonne of keybinds and can get rather confusing. But like you said it scales better in the type of gear I'll likely be in.
---
I dunno, I've been playing vanilla for free for years. The work put into creating pservers with none of the resources or old values that blizz has is nothing short of amazing. Sure I'll be getting less lag and a more authentic experience but let's not pretend they aren't screwing us over. Using your example. Would you be happy to pay the same for a 15 year old car vs. a brand new one just because you prefer the older car?
---
Typical Blizzard. Can't force the Casualscrubs to level to 60 within the first 3 Month, that would be way too hardcore. 
---
I can't wait until they patch in the Retard-Finder so they Casualscrubs can see BWL...
---
I have.
---
Are you saying people didn't log out of playing, and that they just played all the time, 24/7, without stopping? People logged out, that's what tends to happen when someone stops playing a game. 
---
You have no idea what's going to be the norm. Stop saying with certainty what you can only speculate at the moment.
---
This makes the meta for Pally leveling become your basic 2H Seal of Command build.
---
Stack spirit, keep wisdom up, and pray for procs.
---
Boar gear with a few gorilla gear pieces as you level seem to be the most optimal build.
---
Don’t feel bad, I can’t stand any ‘reality’ TV, that just happened to be the first one that came to mind.
---
So what’s gonna happen after phase 1 when layering is gone and the servers shit the bed because they can’t handle 5k+ a server? 
---
The modern retail client can barely handle a raid of 120 people on a major city of an opposing faction that is *empty*. How will phase 2 servers survive a single raid day?
---
&gt;IST
---
lol that explains a lot. Things are a bit different here in the US.
---
I was thinking the same thing. If layering works out well I can totally see them implementing this into retail. I imagine warmode with properly large world combat again, that would be glorious.
---
For what it's worth I'm a WoW fan I still find enjoyment in retail but an super excited to relive Classic.
---
That sounds completely backwards. Vote with your wallet! Keeping your sub active eventhough you don‘t play, because you are not happy with the current state of the game, is not gonna achieve anything.
---

---
I think you're failing to understand the difference between layering and sharding.
---
You will have a easier time to get invited for dungeons and raid as a warlock imo.
---
Is that an African or European swallow?
---
Did you even listen to Ion?? The "layering" or "sharding" is only temporary for the first few weeks. Day 1 classic is going have far more people trying to play than when it launched back in the day. He even speaks about how their goal is help and maintain communities to be as close to how they were back in the day. This way I can join a server with all my friends and not worry about having a shit launch experience and then the sharding will go away. Seems like a win/win to me.  
---
You honestly just seem like someone who NEEDS something to bitch about to try and forget how much you hate yourself...
---
Then you'll get it both with RP-PvP
---
He's getting so many downvotes because he's wrong.
---
I heard that too. I believe it was in Esfand and Staysafes(?) interview. I'll try to find the video and timestamp in a bit
---
Lol no worries
---
Exactly. This is why everyone hated trading BoPs. It could, and was exploited by groups when it happened.
---
Now suddenly everyone loves Layering? They really don’t realize how much people are gonna abuse the system
---
How? If the layer IDs arent exposed externally, it wont be possible for an addon to reliably tell you which layer you or other players are on.
---
Don't let facts get in your way, you can get mad if you want to!
---
I recently purchased Assassins Creed Origins and Odyssey so I’ll be playing through those.
---
Bitches about bitching about bitching about bitching
---
see you on the other side
---
What's a better suggestion that doesn't result in either mass dead servers in a couple of months followed by server merges and communities being thrown together anyway or queue times that make playing on any server that might survive player drop off utterly impossible the first month of release? Because so far it sounds like those are the two options thrown around. These people raising "issues" are largely the problem because they contribute absolutely no meaningful suggestions that are practical in any form.
---
it's a feelsbadman

"happy birthday, darling!!! I got you a brand new computer!!! Even better, I got a game for us to play together!!!!!"
---
Wtf
---
It’s the same thing that’s gone down in the OSRS reddit.  
---
Everyone has their own ideal version of classic.  To some any change will ruin it, some are cool with minor QOL changes, and some want it back and are more open to bigger changes.   
---
One thing is constant: they all will complain.
---
The difference is in at-will layer hopping. Layering as it stands lets you hop layers by either re-logging, or joining party with someone in another layer.  
---
This introduces all kinds of problems, with some of the biggest ones being avoiding PvP with layer hops, or farming the same location in the world multiple times via layer hopping (such as black lotus, rare spawns, etc)  
---
In my solution, the only way the servers are connected is that there's a planned merge, with some stress points such as unique names across the servers being linked.
---
Also.. theyre saying that the last layer (as in the right one in this picture) is most likely gonna result in a bigger than 3k people server. So the image above saying 3K total for that one is most likely gonna be wrong. Its gonna be even bigger collectively and hype :D
---
&gt; **People who attack others for their attempts to petition Blizzard into improving their classic experience make absolutely no sense to me. You're literally stabbing yourself in the foot.**
---
Going to skip the first part, and address the bolded(emphasis mine). I posted my disagreement with some of your statements.  And as far as one getting shot in the foot--isn't that what the community is doing?  Blizzard says that they're adding layering to prevent dead servers after the tourists/ease congestion/queues/better leveling experience/reasons, using 1.12 as a base, ordering the phases the way they are in order to improve their Classic experience... and yet all of that spurred complaints from the community.
---
&gt; In fact, you even mentioned a positive outcome of people "complaining:"
---
A positive outcome, sure, but as far as I know, the only time Blizzard said anything about spell batching was to confirm it was in regardless of any complaints made.  If I'm wrong, I'll gladly stand corrected.
---
&gt; Yes, a small minority of people complained about some of this stuff but it's quite different. Phasing was an attempt to make classic more authentic, if people want to push Blizzard towards an even more accurate representation of vanilla, then why not? Isn't that what we all want?
---
Wasn't your position that layering/phasing was bad for the game and not authentic to the vanilla experience?
---
&gt;I'm not really sure what you mean by this. A "pserver experience run by Blizzard" would be a permanent, highly authentic representation of classic WoW, with accurate data regarding things like mob stats, proc rates etc curated by Blizzard. That is not what you want? What the hell do you want then?
---
Pserver experiences such as dynamic respawns, 10k players trying to quest in one zone(obvious exaggeration), progressive itemization, etc.  What I want is World of WarCraft Classic made by Blizzard with consideration for the long-term health of this version of the game, which is what I feel they are doing with layering to draw this back to the original post in this thread.
---
Oh really this is the first I'm hearing of it
---
I could be wrong, but I believe it means making decisions based on what is mathematically most advantageous for your character, rather than making decisions based on what is fun.
---
It's not even just the demand, but the temporary demand being the problem. I would hedge my bets and say half the people that start playing in day one, if not more, will be gone by phase 2. How can you plan for this? Layering is by far the best solution.
---
Yes, mandokirs sting. 
---
It was my first epic ever (even though it was one of the worst choices for hunter because of the 2.6 attack speed back then). But epic is epic, right? :-)
---
Probably safe to just play by retail WoW minimum requirements.
---
Yeah, well in your post you implied people were just going to teleport out randomly, not because they were invited into a group. What are the chances that someone you gank accepts a group invite (from a friend who they'll need to coordinate with outside of game) the moment you gank them? 
---
You're complaining about something that will happen so rarely.
---
same reason they're doing it for CE pets
---
Bonus close up: [https://i.imgur.com/gDznkmH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gDznkmH.jpg)
---
Of course i wont not play because of them not adding the mounts in,but this is exactly their philosophy behind nuwow that made it turn to shit.That feeling that they know better and you can only play their way
---
Nobody cares if you don't get an invite. This whole post is about those who *have.* Otherwise everyone will just fill in the gaps like you did and then we're no closer to knowing any of the factors.
---
Looking to DPS primarily in raids, but I wouldn't mind tanking dungeons. No plans to roll a warrior so that leaves me literally empty-handed as far as I know since pallies and druids can't tank raids
---
Are there any classes similar to Rogue where you aren't spending most of the time buffing/making items for others, do pretty good/high DPS, but have an easier time leveling? Rogue seems to be close to what I want to play but I'm iffy on their solo game sounding as bad as Warrior but with stealth skips. 
---
I'll be closer on the casual side, and unless healing items are extremely cheap on the AH, I feel like I'll be a bit bogged down on the road to 60.
---
exactly. It seems silly that they would not want testers who 1. only played back in the day, 2. haven't played wow before, 3. never played classic but also don't play wow currently. 
---
All 3 groups would provide valuable feedback for sure..
---
More accurate the other way around considering how Alliance used to buttfuck the Horde 24/7 in Vanilla WoW.
---
Yeah, I dunno man. I get a sort of satisfaction from having random Freedom Action or Swiftness Potions and stuff that I scrounged up myself. I realize it isn't efficient, but it's satisfying nonetheless.
---
Build me one too?
---
Asmongold Is great esfand is kinda cringe
---
I sent you that link covering your last point on jumping layers. Not the random assignment. I'm at work right now, but I'm fairly certain I've read that somewhere or in one of those interviews. Regardless, that doesn't change the point that you can zone in and out of another layer.
---
&gt;Nothing there said that you can manually switch layers.
---
&gt;Nothing there said that you can manually switch layers using a friends list.
---
&gt;All that was said was that if you add someone to party that is in a different layer, they will appear on your screen and in your group. And you will be able to interact with them. That’s it.
---
I really don’t know how that one tidbit was blown out of proportion to the level where people are freaking out about manually controlling which layer you’re on to exploit farming routes. Lmao.
---
Lmfaooo, so you think you will remain in your layer, and your friend will remain in his and you will somehow magically interact together in your own little bubble? Some great logic you got going there. 
---
Whoever gets the invite from the other will be zoned to the inviter's layer. It's laid clear. How else would you share resources or kill targets if you're grouped up? How else would you perceive the world around you?
---
Let's say you're right you don't get assigned a random layer every time you login, but you will get assigned a random one the very first time you login and you will be stuck on that every time you login after. And your friend does the same thing except he gets assigned layer 2. The exploitation of the system will still happen because as mentioned in the video, you will be transferred to the other layer where you can interact and meet new people and add them on your friends list, even increasing the frequency of you abusing the layering system.
---
I know you will now make up some bs on how you won't be transferred to the other layer once you get the invite, so please go ahead lmao.
---
"Your arguements are makeing more sense each time, I don't like that. I'm going to block you" - warpbeast 2019.
---
Even if you declare yourself as a "DPS warrior" you will be expected to tank sometimes.
---
If you absolutely don't want to tank, you really should go rogue imo.
---
If they can't afford the monthly sub for classic how are they affording a pc and monthly internet? Seems to me you will get a lot of kids who want to play but their parents won't pay a monthly sub, or scammers.
---
Or maybe not and I am just being too cynical, best of luck.
---
Locks are sick and super underrepresented from the data I've seen.
---
I have heard they can be gear dependent but I don't think you'll be left in the dust or anything 
---
You'll have to compete for the same loot as mages and priests but lock is a good class
---
This will increase my water vendor buisness even more.
---
People who got acces to the firs glimps of Classic (the mini playable demo) already tested that
---
Result: the /sit isn't working, it's a Pserver thing.
---
Now we will have a double confirmation (prob this evening)
---
Since it's based on 1.12,why not add naxx at launch?
---
oh heck yea, thanks!
---
I think they said your layer is pretty static unless you group with someone in another. You won’t change layers every login. But we don’t really have enough info yet to say that for sure.
---
Stop Jebaiting
---
Which if Ion is to be believed, and he's not always been the most forecoming(after all, he was a lawyer before joining Blizzard), is what they're trying to handle with the layers system.
---
I don't think that distinction is worth making... sharding includes people from many realms, I'm sure they could isolate it to your realm, but they don't, so it doesn't really matter that they could
---
I am but I bet they all go to streamers first and high end players first not normal players.
---
im a fucking druid bitch
---
No sub Lol nice try
---
CoD4 might be a tiny bit better imo but yeah literally.. saying that, the decision to switch from dedicated servers to P2P was a travesty.
---
Listen to them talk about it. Based on what they’ve released so far it seems like they’d shoot for 3-4.
---
Having only 2 layers a realm kind of defeats the purpose of having layering at all.
---
Also what happens when a new layer opens? Suddenly that person is alone in the world? That will kill the Classic immersion feel. So many unanswered questions
---
They said very clearly that layers are added as needed. About layers potentially changing every time you log in was probably inferenced. But it is a good inference as they DO say that layers will fold back when population wanes and doesn’t call for so many layers. It only stands to reason that if there are 8 layers during the day and 2 layers worth of players late at night they will end up compressing them, thus dynamic layering will be pretty necessary unless they intend for servers to be unnecessarily dead at times
---
not exactly, you being a newbie wont know your class as well as the veteran and you wont know the optimal route and stuff. So the veteran will probable still get to 60 before you.
---
They'll have it in for the first month. That's way too long already. 
---
&gt;This way I can join a server with all my friends and not worry about having a shit launch experience 
---
You mean worrying about people ganking your quest hub.
---
That’s so awesome. What kind of business? What you’re doing is a dream of mine.
---
maybe i will get 2 of them lol
---
or atleast 1 as my main gaming monitor, and keep my 2 old ones either side of it for videos/browsing.
---
Requiring a active sub is a great way filter out negative people.  
---
A Toxic player would not sub to play the beta.
---
I am torn between maining a rouge or warrior (alliance human pref). I want to participate in PvE raiding as well as pre-mades/world PvP. I’m stuck between nostalgia (fury warrior) and doing something new (combat rouge). 
---
I started leveling a dwarf warrior a month before TBC released so I understand the difficulties in leveling one. 
---
I also understand that the whole rogue combat/point system is completely different in vanilla from what I know now in retail, which could also affect my decision. 
---
Has anyone leveled both rogue and warrior in vanilla? If so which one did you prefer playing over the other and why?
---
Yes, I think it's terrible for the game, and completely unauthentic to vanilla.  
---
If you weren't already planning to take work off for WoW, I'd highly recommend it if layering as it is now doesn't change. Playing pre-layer merge will be massively efficient compared to playing post-layer merge.  
---
I wish they'd just remove the ability to hop layers, and just let you select servers such as "Illidan-A, Illidan-B, Illidan-C" that you know will be merged later down the line.
---
What do you mean mangled version of spell batching?
---
I'm articulating why many in retail who may enjoy parts of max level Vanilla won't ever get to that point because it requires hundreds of hours of tedious content to reach which is the original point of the parent comment.
---
Notice how I don't declare what other people should find important while you do because you're so busy defending Classic you don't stop to think whether it's an element that needs defending. I'm not asking for changes to the game but I'm articulating why people may not like it. So many here however argue backwards where everyone in Vanilla is automatically good and the product of genius design and rationalize back from that. That's how you end up with assholes who declare that it's about the journey and that leveling is what really matters because they know they can't defend that so much of the content that people find enjoyable is gated behind hundreds of hours of content that some find tedious.
---
&gt;And btw, nobody cares about that here. You can flex about that in the retail sub. If you come back here in two years and flex about you having cleared Naxx it'll be a different story. Until then you could've as well said you can tie your shoes - just as impressive.
---
Clearly showing you have done neither high end progression in retail or in vanilla.
---
People hating layering is not the same thing as people hating or disagreeing the concept of sharding.
---
Layering is just a poor implementation of it
---
"Min-maxing is the character-building strategy of maximizing a specific desirable ability, skill, or other power of a character and minimizing everything else, seen as undesirable."
---
The verbage to me seems semantic. As in layering is sharding inside the same server. So besides servers merging, one server is separating. Or am I reading this incorrectly?
---
I think so yes. IIRC debuff limit was 8 until the ZG patch made it 16. In classic we will start with 16 right of the bat. Raid dps will be higher but how much of a difference it will make I can't really tell.
---
The ones that don’t will be issued cease and desists aggressively after classic..
---
&gt;The ~~30~~ 10 seconds of fear immunity in the Undead is also an advantage. 
---
Make it 5s and it will be good ;-)
---
Thats exactly my point. How is this anyting else than sharding then? With the difference being that its online within your realm and the size of the shards.
---
Had a mini panic and thought I booked the wrong days off yesterday...
---
Well i like to be prepared .. is it that much of an issue? If i dont get one i delete the comment.. if i get one i edit it. Maybe its interesting for others to see ( that didnt sub and are similar to me ) that they maybe wont get one even if they sub ?
---
Businesses also normally give seasonal release time frames. Both methods are standard practice. How would it change much for these people who are upset they can't play during their summer break? Does it change that? Are they going to see "Q3" and go "Oh, I don't know when that is, so I guess I won't set my expectations for a summer release." Feel like that's just an insult to intelligence, they are still gonna expect the same thing.
---
Can't argue with that, it would be neat to have one "as it was" server.
---
I guess it's technically not that easy / feasible but would still be a nice addition.
---
being subbed to retail wow tho
---
They are listening to the community, they can change their minds.
---
Only thing I remember is about ion saying how private server bosses had incorrect armor values for some, as they just scales it instead of them having just different ones. And something about some having resistances that private servers didn't have?
---
If your alt joins a guild thats set in another layer than its possible. If you will instantly phase over to the other layer we dont know. And I hope not since that would make dodging fights real eazy.
---
Yes, remove the ability to hop layers. AKA, create multiple servers with the same name that will be merged together in the future, such as: Illidan-A, Illidan-B, Illidan-C. This doesn't cause nearly as many issues as what they're planning does.
---
Some people can't get excited about anything at all, that's a whole other thing. You're doing fine
---
I thought my friends were going Alliance but now it seems like we're going Horde for sure.
---
So...Orc or Troll Hunter? Is bow spec and beserking that much better than stun resist? Also, does anyone know the proper stun resist value for orcs in classic? I feel like the p server version might be overtuned.
---
Jebaited
---
In terms of playing WoW its a food thing. In terms of your business its very bad...
---
I think they want new or returning players to have a chance periodically to catch up to long-time players. If you had to do 6 expansions worth of raids to get to the current endgame, not many players would be interested.
---
Then don't play, we'll have all the fun without you
---
This sounds like one of the old Nintendo uncle rumors you used to hear back in the day. If heard if you kite Gamon to AQ40 he turns into an elite and if you get him to 30% hp he grants you an epic weapon.
---
No, but I’m definitely more likely to try something if it’s free.
---
Good thing I’ll be a senior so I’ll be off at 1:32 instead of 2:29
---
Yeah true, what's the projected 0-60 speed time? Like 60 hours ? gunna be fun Bois!
---
Orgrimmar was under Alliance control for like 2 months before BC on  US Emerald Dream and Kilrogg, Shandris and a few other realms. 
---
Thats the only reason I found out Ally dominated pvp back then. Fuck them.
---
Well, of course
---
I think if you took a minute to understand what they're doing you'll see there's no problem.
---
But it is. The whole point is to solve congestion at the start of the game to give people a smoother leveling experience.
---
That's why they said when the player base begins to spread out and others drop off, they will merge layers.
---
Layers aren't permanent. They are there to solve overcrowding, just like sharding, but people were so against sharding due to community issues it creates that Blizz decided to essentially make world-wide and permanent shards and call them layers.
---
Unsure if you know, but you can't choose to start anywhere in the world. That's not how the game works. There are several starting zones and that's it. If I choose undead, I'm starting in Tirisfal with all the other undead. I can't start in Booty Bay. I cant start in Deadwind Pass. I can't start in Searing Gorge. I can only start in Tirisfal as an undead.
---
This creates the problem of hundreds of people in a single starting area MINUTE ONE of launch.
---
How is this going over your head? The whole point is to not pack hundreds of people in the same zone not being able to do anything because of 5 minute mob spawns.
---
As some folks will level faster and slower, players will be spread across more zones at once, easing congestion.
---
This has been stated by Blizz since we first found out about sharding, when they talk about the opening of the gates again, etc.
---
Do you honestly not understand or are you just trolling? Hard to tell :/
---
If there’s a good chance we won’t experience then DONT PUT IT IN THE GAME. How come private serves can hold that many people but Blizz balls can’t?
---
BICH\*
---
As far as i know, they will open up the registration 13. August. Seems like you'll be able to create up to 3 characters!
---
There will be shit ton of people contesting for starting areas no matter what you do. Sharding won't fix that either. At least on launch.
---
You're right, I fudged the math, summer is 94 days.
---
Correct, it is still about $15 a month but judging by the way the answers were presented in the poll this was intended to be biased from the start.
---
$45 assumes that you will sub for the 3 months until launch in the hopes to be added on a late beta wave. Presenting a worst case scenario is stand panic reaction on this sub. 
---
Personally I am fine dropping some disposable income for a shot at helping fix bugs and help attempt to make things as classic as possible. 
---
Everyone seems to view beta as early access with a rollback/cash grab and shirk their report and test duties.
---
Be in the beta and do the work or be patient and wait for 8/27. It's a beta. Not the last chopper out of Saigon.
---
I think you forgot the issue it does fix, having 50 servers on launch and 20 of them dying due to BFA players trying it for a week or two then leaving because its not retail.
---
Is that Mandokir's Sting?
---
Ion mentions it offhandedly in this interview:
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=341
---
Billy was on a different realm
---
Nobody is going to care except the tryhard guilds, and classic content is so easy and already figured out they won't need them anyway.
---
Don't worry about it - the real issue is whether Blizz should tune raids to be harder since the progressive itemization means people will be geared better and the class changes mean people will do more damage
---
My uncle's wife's hairdresser knows someone who is related to someone who cuts the grass at Blizzard. They said it would not.
---
its fake!
---
Edited above for reasons. :)
---
On top of that its worth noting that they probably use some kind of round robin load balancing to determine which layer you as a user will get put in. 3001 users will probably be:
---
Layer 1: 1500 users
---
Layer 2: 1501 users
---
NOT 
---
Layer 1: 3000 users
---
Layer2: 1 user
---
ON TOP of that they probably use "sticky sessions" for the client so that it return to the same layer and you cannot just randomly get new layers by logging in and out or leaving and entering continents.
---
PepeLaugh
---
Looks cool but I’d much rather prefer a basic square monitor
---
There aren't any sources saying *anything* about number of layers, specifically. It's virtualization, so it may not be significantly more difficult to do 25 layers than 5.
---
Pepelaugh you lack critical information
---
J-J-J-J-Jebaited
---
Your missing the reason why they wanted sharing for classic in the first place, the starting zones. Layering doesn’t help starting zones at all. I think his fears of having both sharding and layering is valid!
---
Its not fake i also have it.
---
PogU REAL
---
HE GOT BETA Pog
---
lls only the true fans know
---
People like you are amazing =)
---
You won’t get to keep your chars right?
---
I personally know of a situation where a uses an Internet cafe but has his own battle.net login.  He just has to pay an hourly fee for usage.
---
you and your 3 different join the server and meet up at BFD ent. All 3 of ya realize ya can't see each other. However you send an invite to form a group, will ya see each other? If so someone just got moved into to a different layer. 
---
I understand everyone is "temp locked" into 1 layer but when it comes to forming a guild, a group, a raid - there must be people moving into a layer for everyone to see each other. 
---
Hence I assume you move to the layer who formed the guild, who sent the invite, the raid leader, the group leader layer.
---
They also said layering could last as long as all of Phase 1. The deadline for no more layering is the end of Phase 1.
---
Hoping it ends before then, but it's possible to see layering for a lot longer than a few weeks.
---
No way that's craaazy...
---
My Shadow Priest could handle decent warlocks until they got to AQ/Naxx gear - at that point they'd become absolute monsters. Anecdotal I know, but my memories match what I've been reading from other shadow priests. My BWL rogue would be destroyed by warlocks.
---
It might just end up being that starting zones are really congested and unplayable for the first couple days.
---
The kind of calendar where it doesn't matter what day of the week it is, I guess.
---
omg how? Pepelaugh
---
I am also not tagged, so until a decide to attack, I can do whatever I want.
---
Min/max is the idea of minimizing useless things and maximizing useful things. Hardcore players cream themselves over this stuff ;)
---
Now, RP-PvP!
---
Pog... 
---
It's all yours my man.
---
Just layering on my opinion dude.
---
You can tank dungeons in any spec really.
---
Prot spec will be more comfortable but you sacrifice every other activities : farming, PVP etc
---
Back in Vanilla the 31/5/15 build was very popular : good for PVP and good for dungeons.
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/nmplol](https://www.twitch.tv/nmplol)
---
if possible take off the 27th - 30th but if not at least take off the 27th because launch day will be super fun (even if it's a bit broken)
---
&gt; The whole point is to solve congestion at the start of the game to give people a smoother leveling experience.
---
No... it's not...
---
Ion, when sharding was announced:
---
&gt; We recognise that launching WoW Classic poses a couple of meaty challenges.
---
&gt; Unlike launching a traditional game that’s brand new, where you can assume that everyone that’s jumping in there on launch day has the intent to at least explore playing it long term, we expect that early on with Classic, there are going to be some people who are there die hard, dedicated, they’re racing to defeat Ragnaros and Onyxia.
---
&gt; There are going to be others who just want to check it out casually and they just want to see what all the fuss is about, they want to see what they missed.
---
**And, our concern is, I think it’s exactly as you suggest, what’s that going to look like? What’s that going to do to realm communities, as some server populations may dwindle over time?**
---
&gt; That is where we are looking at using sharding in a very limited way.
---
This is all about preserving populations after tourists leave. Smooth leveling isn't the imporant part because that will sort itself out organically. How is *this* going over *your* head?
---
Wow 1/10 of the way to epic mount
---
What do these words “sharding” and “layering” mean in the context of the game?
---
Umm, well I have a character at lvl 58 on a pserver right now. Its played time is 8 days 12 hours and I still have another chunk to go..
---
Its a grind for sure.
---
No. Paladins give you BoP and reduce your threat with buffs. WoTF kinda sucks, just re-fear and use deathcoil. You're gonna do more damage as priests are able to dispel your magic DoTs on the horde side, whereas alliance has both paladins and priests to dispel magic.
---

His reaction to getting in!!!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEo9sqzX1lQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEo9sqzX1lQ)
---
1.12 talents also only happened at the end.
---
Deal with it.
---
This is literally in for only a handful of weeks, won't even last the entire phase 1. And it's not like you would know which layer you were in or if you were even in a different layer. And having different servers you will still be able to farm the same nodes and mobs, and eventually the same items will end up in the AH so that's a weak one.
---
My wife is excited since she's rolling druid.
---
Kungen! I remember him. What is he doing?
---
I'm running a dropshipping business. I sell stuff online and as soon as I get an order I'll forward it to my supplier and they ship it directly to the customer.
---
Hi, /u/PasVraimentlul
---
Implying that they stand a chance against vanilla Bolvar...
---
Upvoted for generosity.  Wow helps a lot of people through tough times in their life. During periods of depression I've thrown myself into wow and found amazing people that help me.  If theres a fund where I can donate to help this project please let me know
---
Nope pretty sure I understand the concept fully, but you’re arguing that they will leave layers alone as they empty out until the Big Crunch while I’m saying they will dynamically change which layer people end up on to maintain serviceable populations. If there are 4 layers to cover 10,000 players, and then at night there are only 1,000 players it would be stupid to not try to combine those players. I don’t think they will automatically phase people to other zones on the fly, but new log ins will all be funneled to the lower layers.
---
I can believe that you’ll get a “preferred” layer so during peak times they’ll most likely get you there, but if that layer is layer 8 you might end up at layer 1-2 in low pop situations because duh, no reason to have 8 layers of 300 players each instead of one or 2 decently populated ones. If they are planning to keep you spread out to your assigned layers then they might as well just do more servers with sharding then merge them after phase 1 because that is basically the same thing.
---
Does fear have diminishing returns? I never played classic
---
I read somewhere that i can just reapply it as soon as they cleanse it, because it has no cooldown or DR?
---
This is literally designed for the "first few weeks" (- Actual Blizzard Quote) so you can kill wolves in Northshire Abbey. It's always going to be a tradeoff. Sure people are going to level through content way faster now than back in Vanilla, but still what is the alternative? You have the worst totally nothing like Vanilla 3 weeks of your life because you can't target a single monster. Or you are forced to join a server that could be half empty within weeks. 
---
Just get over it honestly, it seems like such a petty battle to fight over. By the time 90% of people will be doing any PVP this issue will be gone, or going.
---
Damn. Now I see it too ^^:(
---
Honestly, I think the important thing to remember is that this will only be for a few weeks, a month at most. Things like "Selling invite to Layer 3 for 2g" would be a problem if layering was a thing at endgame, but after a month most people are still leveling anyway, I don't see many trying to spend their money to jump layer instead of buying spells and mount.
---
When do they start sending out beta keys?
---
I haven't seen any info on how long the content phases are meant to last. I just know that they used world bosses as a specific example. I, too, would prefer a specific date that layering will be removed, but they may not know that for sure, since it will depend on server populations and how long tourists stay around.
---
It isn't much different than on-use trinkets in the grand scheme. Add a Paladin libram that has an on-use to taunt. This, of course, would have to come during Classic+ if the decide to add scrapped or new content after Classic has run its course for a bit.
---
Nice strawman
---
Pretty sure the priest is a dwarf
---
Little Joey from Minecraft will be playing Classic on release, theres a lot of hype and I could see 3M players the first week. Little Joey and company will be gone in a month. The population is going to drop.
---
Lol I think the fastest recorded 0-60 was 2 days and some odd hours. I would expect most people who are no lifing it to still have at least 7 days /played.
---
It is, yes :-)
---
*Announces release date that’s actually late summer when people go back to school instead of June/July like we were expecting*
---
3 hour camp would be quick compared to other games..
---
Not sure... hopefully soon
---
Edgy.
---
I'd focus the invites on people not currently playing BfA since they are going to play nothing but the beta. But hey I'm just some random dude so what the hell do I know. 
---
Not much point of a beta if all you have are tourists deciding if they want to play.
---
Like people will farm Devilsaur within the first month.
---
It does do something though. If realm pop is say 6000 layering with two layers will effectively cut it in half. So it is better at least...
---
you know they already did this right....?
---
Bro layering will only last a few weeks. Stop it.
---
I resubbed on the 13th (coincidence).  My account was made 2005,  however my account was actually made during wotlk and I transferred my original rank 12 rogue to the account.  I have bfa and my highest character is that rogue lvl 115.    
---
I did not get an invite.   
---
I dont expect one. I never get into stuff like this and I likely wouldn't play a beta unless it was instant 60.   I'm currently lvl 44 on a private server I've been practice leveling on. 
---
I think I'm going to give bfa a fair shot during this 3 month wait for classic.   At the very least I'll get pvp geared and offhand my thunderfury for lols.
---
haha, i don't think that falls into what i'm looking for, so i'll stick with herb/alch to make money.  i'll probably look into tailoring as well.  thanks!
---
I think their plan would be to open up more realms if by the end of phase 1 there are still an insane amount of people playing that they'd need to keep servers layered without long queue times.
---
Have you looked into Holy/Reckoning? Drakova talks about it on Countdown to Classic.  Suggest you give a listen because then maybe you'd be able to enjoy your play style both healing and smashing faces.   [https://countdowntoclassic.com/2018/12/05/episode-85-drakova-on-paladin-pvp-databases-itemisation-scholomance-lore/](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2018/12/05/episode-85-drakova-on-paladin-pvp-databases-itemisation-scholomance-lore/)
---
&gt;Like 60 hours ?
---
Depends on what you want to do, no other class is as consistently good as mage in all aspects of the game. Warriors are great at PvE and PvP but suck at leveling and solo content, Hunters are great for a long time but fall off towards the end, Locks are great but very gear dependant so they only take off later in the game, Priests are all around great but a bit slower than their DPS counterparts. What are you willing to sacrifice?
---
People are too hung up on replicating their private server vanilla experiences not the retail vanilla experience. 
---
Competition at level 1 with 2000 other players for 1 respawn is not a retail vanilla experience that's a private server experience.
---
*Hmmm... 5 second google search, 30 minute post... 5 second google search, 30 minute post....*
---
*Myeeeah, I'm gonna go with the 30 minute post.*
---
&gt; So, would you prefer the entire layering system which comes with negative impacts to server community, economy, immersion, etc. just so the first couple of hours are slightly more pleasant? To me, that tradeoff just isn't worth it.
---
You downplay the issue quite a bit. It will be much more than the first couple of hours and even then... I prefer the layering system until everything stabilzes.
---
Same here on Laughing Skull, Org was on farm 24/7, people had to go to Thunder Bluff which was also getting sacked, and we couldnt even enter Undercity cuz they were camping everyone at the Zeppelin towers.
---
I believe they intend to release the initial server lists before character creation opens up and you'll choose the server before reserving the name.
---
Are they playing it? Aren't there some sort of achievements you could use to quantify time player on BFA and use that to hand out invites to people who are just messing around and not playing it.
---
Possibly a line cap. Mine seems to work. Goes all the way back to my "free month" added on February 18, 2005. I'm assuming I got that with the game purchase.
---
This is quite the trip down memory lane.
---
Well the first invites just went out i saw it on stream. I dont have access so i guess blizz focuses on the people that will quit it soon *shrug*
---
Yep. I'm 100% going to as well if left in. Otherwise your just screwing yourself.  I'm gonna be AoE farming the shit out of everything, and layer jumping using friends on other layers.
---
Du hast vergessen deinen Characternamen im Chat auszublenden. Keppo :) \^\_°
---
Enjoy.
---
Except they aren't significant at all. Maybe 1.5x the resources relative to the population for the first month. Maybe. And if some sweaty nerd wants to grind to 50+ in ten days to enjoy three weeks of less competition on high level resources, more power to them. It is going to mean next to nothing for the vast majority of us. Community is still intact, just larger. So what if you don't see the exact same random Lock grinding mobs a zone later than Westfall. You didnt add them previously, because if you did you could group with them now. Not to mention player drop off is going to be huge in the first couple of months so many players you see at level 20 might not make it to 35 anyway. Even more so if they're waiting hours to log in each evening. Immersion? What? These are continent wide layers that last the very early days only. If for a month you need to jump into a raid group to defend SW and make sure you're on the right layer so what if it means having a healthy community in the future.
---
Dead servers and queue times were in classic, yeah, but they were shit and we have the technology here to help. And to most reasonable people these "issues" you're complaining about look really pathetic.
---
If you don't like it, just don't play until it's removed. There - solved it for you.
---
The jump that if you missed, you pulled half the instance and killed the party :)
---
I'm already over the "Classic is just nostalgia, you'll soon realize you don't want it" crowd.  Hell even Blizz realized they were wrong in this sentiment.
---
Don't worry bro, I got you covered
---
Daft c#nt
---
You CAN pick which layer you're on, basically whenever you want. Re-logging or joining a party in a different layer accomplishes this.  
---
It's even worse if you can't see or easily pick which one you're on, because then it's just more work.   
---
It won't be hard to figure out names for each layer with a bit of problem solving, and figure out how to hop at will. There will probably be an addon for this anyways.
---
So i checked this guys stream he seems to have access... so i guess invites just went out?
---
Yeah, it’s mostly the kiddos raging about this. Honestly, living in a northern state, I’m glad I get to enjoy some outdoor activities without feeling like I’m missing out on wow.
---
bs
---
I’m sorry... do you have a quiver in one of your slots as a priest???
---
Blizzard said that after tourists quit all realms will drop to exactly 3k players so that layers can be removed.  this is a fact.
---
He is in the intro now ?
---
I had this same thought lol
---
Vanilla WoW with additional server stability/technology, additional graphical features and a community that has aged 15 years.
---
To be honest I am blown away. I was certain that they would not be spending dev time trying to come up with this tech.
---
But they did, the absolute madmen!
---
I recommend actually listening to the podcast and reading the parent comment. It is specifically responding to why people who may enjoy retail or may not play the game may not enjoy Classic which is what I wrote about.
---
Everytime you say "If you don't like it, don't play it" you're just showing that you don't have a clue because I'm not arguing that anything should be changed. I'm articulating why people may not like the game as it is.
---
Pallys tank dungeons very well late game. They however cannot tank raids. If you want to tank raids its Warrior or Druid.
---
Good luck!!
---
If you want to PvP, then elemental/resto  30/0/21 and you won't have to respec. For just PvE, priest healing is VERY good and fun.
---
You're not, but Classic losing players in the first few months is not the same as people saying it won't grow. All games lose players in their first few months, as 'tourists' just checking out the game step away.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/nmplol
---
To late as it seems
---
if its NMP hes trolling, pic is photoshopped
---
who? PepeLaugh
---
I am not convinced this means you are not given a chance at an invite. The statement that Blizzard released says "participants" when talking about having an active sub to play the beta. It does not specifically say you must have an active sub to be considered for selection. I have not seen information to confirm one way or the other. But I have seen several comments wondering the same thing. Here's to hoping us with inactive accounts have a chance!
---
I'd say they have their reasons but honestly I can't think of any reason to give a person playing BfA consistently a classic beta pass. Maybe 'they are loyal customers' but with all the microtransactions they feed people I seriously doubt it's a respect thing.
---
You don't need to buy BfA. The base subscription goes up to Legion content and that's all you nee for Classic.
---
Are feral druids really as unplayable as people make it seem? It seems like anything outside resto gets shit on a lot. I know its no warrior or rogue.
---
The Venn Diagram is pretty close to a circle at this point.
---
As someone who played a shadow priest:   rogue.
---
You are starting to contradict yourself. You've given us the proof that we know the armor of the boss
---
we also know the values of the 3 abilities in question
---
sunder armor 450 per stack for a total of 2250
---
faery fire is 505
---
recklessness is 640
---
first bloodthirst hits with sunder armor and faery fire on the target for 615
---
the second hits with faery fire sunder and recklessness + kings on the user for 700
---
we have all the variables we need to solve the problem
---
No way to know for sure that you will change layer in that time, and no way to guarantee that whatever you are going for is not camped on the other layer.
---
Thats.... not a strawman. Its outlining a logical inconsistency in his argument. Classic is including all kinds of great things that were developed throughout vanilla's lifespan - RP-PVP servers were one of those things, so his argument doesnt really hold any weight.
---
But someone in the Horde raid killed an NPC. The entire raid is now collecting DHK. The rankers immediately disband the raid. SW is safe.
---
They never said pop is capped at 3k
---
Yeh he jebaited me pretty hard lol.. just saw him "pause" the intro lol
---
Sons 3rd birthday day of release, 5th year anniversary with the wife on the 30th, next son due Sept 2nd. RIP me.
---
yeah, ur right, CE box is worse.  you can buy a CE today and get the pets in classic.  you actually had to play and experience vanilla to get those mounts, so they deserve the mounts way more.
---
If you know someone on other layers to invite you.
---
I don't get how people defend this crap. I'd rather live with overpopluated zones than with this garbage where people can just switch Layers to level/farm faster or avoid PvP!
---
I read that as "Why are you marrying someone who **ruins** your life?", which I feel is more accurate anyway.
---
I think it will be easy.
---
Have your entire guildies meet up at the mage tower in Stormwind. Now Guild Master figure out who he can see. Those are on Layer A.
---
Now he has someone in a different layer, who they can see, write a list, those are on layer B.
---
Now ask someone else who aren't in layer A or B and get the names, etc etc. Figure out how many layers there are.
---
Now form the guild. 4 from your layer and 2-3 from other layers. Will all the guildies see each other now? did they managed to move into a new layer or to the GM layer?
---
Now have each non guildie form a 5 man group and invite a guildie member. Did we see the guildie move to the non guildie layer? If so, now we know we have 3-4 layers to play with and instead of inviting the rest of the guildies, I will use this knowledge to use the rest of the guilds as scouts. 
---
Lupos camped or down on layer 1 but up on layer 2. Let's get hunter from layer 3 his lupos. Player on layer 2 now forms and invite hunter on layer 3, Bam, hunter is now in layer 2.
---
Same for black lotus - player 3 on layer 3 is unable to pick it, a guildie is on layer 1 can pick it, meets at location and joins player 3 group invite to move into layer 3.
---
It's gotten to the point where I just assumed the title was an insult.
---
I dont get how normal rational adults can try to defend these children.
---
You all know the type.  You may be one of them if you're reading this shit...
---
Lets stop coddling the incels
---
Nah i just got jebaited pretty hard.. thats all .. this guy is dedicated to his troll.
---
Thanks for doing this!
---
YOU WILL NEVER MAKE ME LEAVE SPINEBREAKER!
---
oh wait... I stopped playing at Pandas...
---
I don't think it's a very good solution.  
---
It still has many of the same large issues that sharding has, namely at-will layer hopping. It ruins many things, such as PVP, farming, etc.   
---
It throws the authentic vanilla experience out of the window and shoves in a very intrusive modern solution to a problem that could easily be solved by multiple servers that have a planned merge in the future, such as: Illidan-A, Illidan-B, Illidan-C. I think this solution where you can't hop layers at will is a much better solution
---
Dude you can't pay alone for everything, I think there will be too much requests. Make a website where we can maybe donate gametime or money for gametime. Or just exchange of contacts where we can donate. I wouldn't mind donating, its just I don't want the system to be abused by people who can spend 12,99€ but don't want to because assholes.
---
I have not complained about anything they want to implement. I am all for QoL changes (Who wouldn't tbh?) And I am not a part of the NOCHANGES REEEEEE gang.
---
They could implement a totally authentic classic wow that works just like vanilla 1.12 without QoL and I would be perfectly fine with it. I am just happy we get what we get.
---
What I hate is whining bitches like you. So fine, I can accept that you call me spoiled (No idea for what, but fine) but what is nu-wow? retail?
---
Pathetic trash
---
The most annoying aspect of ammo is sacrificing a bag slot for it, other than that, not a major burden to me.
---
&gt;you can't "transport" into another server
---
actually, you can for most/all of Phase 1
---
Why is it okay to pay to test a game wtf lmao
---
Orc for PvP. 
---
Troll for PvE.
---
Either work fine if you like the look of one over the other.
---
This isn’t a single purchase game. Never has been. People have been complaining about the sub fee for 14 years. It’s not going to change unless the subs completely die off enough for them to switch to a F2P model. Which isn’t going to happen any time soon. Even with the dumpster fire that is BFA. Classic will revitalize their sub numbers.
---
Very kind of you, I hope only people who truly need this will dm you.
---
yea but organized guild won't form right away now. They will communicate via discord and abuse the layering system, so they can form 5 man groups and invite their guildies into their layer.
---
Who is that in the bottom right? Looks like a Druid using a polearm LOLOL
---
shit und ich dachte ich hab an alles gedacht :D danke für den hinweis, ist jetzt wohl auch zu spät^^ werde eh nen weiblichen nachtelfen machen zu classic, da wird der name etwas abgeändert :-)
---
Same here more or less, always wanted to play but as a kid I couldn't pay the subscription so I moved to other games. Now with this it feels like another chance so I'm going to dive in. But to answer your question: Blizzard tries with WoW Classic to recreate the vanilla version as much as possible the only difference being a modern server structure and a modern social interface added to the game. All abilities and equipment functions as in patch 1.12 and they chronologically roll out different dungeons and raids in phases.   
---
TL:DR it virtually is an exact recreation of vanilla WoW with modern server structure and social interface
---
In other words, the moment where Classic will be played by the most people, is the exact time Blizzard has chosen to implement a method which damages the game experience.
---
Neat!
---
I think it probably will grow over time. But the influx of tourists will cause an initial rush, then a sudden drop. This has nothing to do with the growth or decline of Classic, it is expected. Measure the growth after 6 months, 12, 24. Not in the first 3 months.
---
Druid is probably the most complex PvP class imo. Severely underrated.
---
I think if the cooldown is that long I would just get my DM stuff 1 day before raid, log out in orgrimmar and login for next scheduled head drop to get it and log out. Then log in for the raid once it's time to get ZG buff.
---
Short answer: no.  Long answer: druid can be if you're willing to put in the work and farm Manual Crowd Pummelers and really practice hard. Google "Shedo druid".  Elemental just bursts and goes OOM, and enhancement is terrible so shaman DPS is a no-go. My advice would be to heal PvE as a shaman and DPS in instances and PvP and spec 30/0/21. It's outstanding, fun, and you will destroy people.
---
If it were 30mins only... With all those links probably more like 2hrs :D
---
That's the dumbest thing I've heard since your last post.
---
Still not an acceptable solution more than a week out. Once starter zones calm down, it needs to be turned off completely.
---
Will each Layer have its own king of Stormwind?
---
I assume you mean camping.  Sorry you won't be able to camp people for a couple weeks after launch, it think it's something you'll live through though.
---
Especially because some couple million people who just happen to subscribe to WoW get access just for already being subscribed.   No adtl. purchase required.
---
But you can transport to another server in Classic?
---
I envy you in some way. I wish I could experience it for the first time with friends all over again.
---
&gt;And relationships are about more than you.
---
It is, but that is exactly why you should be able to take some PTO for Classic if it is really important to you. Remember a relationship is also about more than the other person - it is about both of you.
---
As for taking 100% of the time off, that is obviously a problem - then you make it all about you, but who says it has to be 100%? It depends on where you live, but most of EU have 5 weeks of vacation per year. If you can't even take just a few days off to try the initial launch, then the relationship does not value your personal happiness enough.
---
Did you play Vanilla when there were Cross-realm BGs?  They were not like this at all.  You knew the other servers well, you knew the guilds that queued and you knew the players.  It's really not like today when you find someone and then never see them again.  We were very familiar with them.
---
Each Battlegroup only had a few servers, so you just see them as guilds.  You knew the servers that were terrible at PVP, and you knew the ones that were good.  If your experienced it and it wasn't your cup of tea back then, then that's all good.  But it seems like you think Cross Realm BG's were like they are today, and that was not the case at all.
---
I... I really don't... I have no clue how else I should explain it to you. 
---
&gt; I'm not arguing that anything should be changed.
---
Have I indicated anywhere that that's what you said? If you can show me the part where I said that I'll give you a million dollars.
---
&gt; I'm articulating why people may not like the game as it is.
---
And I am articulating that one who does not like the game as it is, does not have to play it. So there's nothing wrong with that. I really don't think this sentence is too complex.
---
Level the mage as a main, level a warlock alt using blue bars. Use the warlock alt to summon and park it somewhere useful while leveling. Easy alt, easy leveling, free mount. Chip away at it. Enjoy all of the perks of the mage.
---
the servers are designed for layers.  it's not something they can just rip out after they put it in.  getting rid of layers is just setting max layers to 1, and they said layer cap is around 3k
---
Shortly after TBC launched, I rerolled Horde which left my Vanilla alliance character in almost mint condition with it's gear. I was a noob during vanilla and never saw past MC/ZG but I had so much fun. Rocking 6/8 Tier1, Staff of Dominance, ToEP + ZHC trinkets and both Zanzil rings from ZG.

Popularity != correct.

Give 1000 people a complex math problem and 10 possible solutions. It'd be insane to just assume that the most popular solution is the correct one.

Having never touched it, we’ll need help!

That's how you know it's good - because people are looking forward to it's removal.\

It's the original game in its final iteration, polished up, with a few quality of life changes.
---
From what I've read, they have a working version of the original game, but they sort of remade it to work with the new game system they have in place.
---
So it'll be grindy and weird like the original game was, but you can make it look super pretty.
---
This is why you don’t give them a reason lolll
---
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride~
---
haha, not a very known fact but on \[not legal servers\] quivers increase your ranged attack speed. This effects wand attack speed in the ranged slot. I don't think this was a retail thing, just a odd bug.
---
 Just go to another layer.
---
Why would I sub just to play-test? I’ll watch a YouTube video or two maybe but I’m happy to wait for release thanks.
---
It’s not like I need to see if the game is any good.
---
Not badly geared tbf!
---
Hacked and had all my vanilla/TBC items sold I were :(
---
Posts like these are ridiculous lol
---
Nah not you. All fine mate no invites yet.
---
That’s very interesting! That would be HUGE for priests, thanks for the info!
---
I've been part of many server launches (can't name them due to subreddit rules, but should be fairly obvious if you just followed the post-Nost bandwagons), and it's always an absolute mess, especially after Nost made them so much more popular by getting the concept into the mainstream media. 
---
It's fun for the chaos and novelty of it, but you straight up just can't do anything, and not just for hours, but the first three days or so. People have to [group up and camp even just regular mobs' spawn points](https://i.imgur.com/GIsrLYn.jpg), and since Classic won't have dynamic respawns (which means 5-6 minutes respawn timer) you're looking at spending at least 30 minutes just completing a 'kill 10 wolves' quest. That's just for a private server launch as well, Classic will attract so many more players initially, so at that point you're looking at groups having to compete for every single spawn.
---
I can easily understand why Blizzard don't want to release an official product with a sub fee tied to it in that state, it'd be unacceptable and put off so many people from playing the game. I'd honestly even rather have queues than that, but that's a very poor solution as well as that means a ton of people won't be able to play due to the length of those queues.
---
The good thing about layering is that we know it's not here to stay, it absolutely will have some negative impacts on the game (although I think some of those aspects are being overblown, the primary issue is the potential abuse of layer hopping), but once it's not needed anymore it'll be gone. We'll just need to weather through it, who knows how long it'll even be here.
---
They can add new content that is in the spirit of vanilla's core gameplay. No gameplay changes. Whats wrong with that?
---
Or you just chill unflagged, and wait the 10-15 minutes that city raids usually last before fragmenting, and go about your business because more often than not faction leaders have absolutely no bearing on your day to day business.
---
Your post makes city raids seem much scarier and more common occurrence than they actually are.

Take into account that end-game pve (raiding) will mean as a druid you will basically be a healer and as a mage, frost (until AQ).
---
For leveling all 3 are fun; i myself prefer druid to level; did so in vanilla. 
---
As for pvp it’s a bit different. Both mage and hunter are pretty strong overall; feral druid can be strong in wpvp.
---
&gt;So there's nothing wrong with that. I really don't think this sentence is too complex.
---
"Why do some people not enjoy watching this movie?"
---
*"I didn't enjoy it for these reasons."*

"You don't have to watch the movie!"

That's literally what you're doing.
---
Thanks for the correction. I felt like I was wrong
---
Going TBC &gt; WoTLK and then adding content onto the end of WOTLK would imo be better. I mean I would be ok with them adding content onto the end of classic if they decide to actually balance specs to make some of them more viable in raiding / pvp
---
Sorry Dad
---
This sub seems to be full of people who know everything there is to know about a game that hasn't been played on retail servers in over a decade

Can't hear you from up on your high horse there, bud!

Realm "TRANAFERS" were in classic.
---
Super cool.
---
God imagine playing Titanfall 2 with this monitor. Whew!
---
So you want flying &amp; group finder, other features that killed wow? How about no...
---
Oh, 8 yrs on Reddit and that much karma? I understand now
---
You want post-naxx content, others want tbc. You understand that right? No one cares if you le cringe every time someone disagrees with you.
---
I like that it's on a black surface and right beside a white car too. How perfect is that?
---
But that was the best part?
---
Being able to form a dungeon group by /shout near the entrance to that dungion was never something I was able to do in classic ( low pop server) but was by far the best part of playing on a high pop private server
---
Nice clean infographic! Thanks for putting this out there!
---
You are much older now and if you’re anything like me it’s a lot harder to get fully addicted like you do as a kid when there are no real life distractions. I wouldn’t be too worried. It’s great to have this legendary game back.
---
Yeah, I think we just need more info on some of the details. There were a few sources saying no more than a month, then there was one source saying at least a month, but no more than the end of phase 1. So the timeline would be anywhere from a few weeks to 2-3 months.
---
I don't think it would affect the general player base much, even if it was 2-3 months. More that the 1% most hardcore will ding 60 after a few weeks and start stockpiling, which could impact the economy.
---
I remember fire elemental spawning grounds being hotly contested with all of the new 60s farming fire resist gear for MC. If the first players to ding 60 can farm 2-3 layers uncontested, while the next wave of players has to fight over a single layer, that could make a pretty big gap in progression.
---
Any way to convert this into Android phone wallpaper?

Mine is the same on account management, but you can see your older history on the [subscription payment history](https://us.battle.net/login/en/?ref=https://us.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html?rp%3D%252Faccount%252Fmanagement%252Fwow%252Fsubscription%252Fpayment-history.html%26r%3DUS%26l%3DLOVEOLIVIA&amp;app=bam&amp;cr=true) page.
---
Thexhunter was my main. Thexpriest was my alt. I did not come up with original names.
---
First, I said it isn't trivial; its a big deal.
---
Second, if layering is "pretty much exactly" what merging is then you aren't "stopping anything from happening in the first place", you're just mandating that every single realm endure it (right at the community building phase no less). At least with my way half the realms would avoid that fate altogether.
---
It's not too late to not marry her.
---
it wasnt part of the original game, thats why i said if they have a separate list of servers specifically for post naxx content while keeping servers for the original game that could work.
---
I start to think you are right. The correct term would be phasing maybe, and sharding it just zone duplication within the realm, but still more immersion breaking than layering.
---
So you want flying wich will kill world pvp...wich is one of the top reasons people want vanilla?? Makes 0 fucking sense.
---
I meant for end game raiding. They really start to shine once they get a decent amount of gear.
---
There were screenshots of global chat channels shown on stream yesterday.
---
What is *not* known is whether such channels will have population caps. If only 50 people can be in a channel at a time, that's not really a true Global chat--it's just a pseudo-guild.
---
I actually do know. I know they work all summer, I know they need to grade papers at night, and I know they have to do lesson preps like updating their weekly lessons. I also know that my teacher friends that have been doing it for at least 3 years, have A LOT less work than newer teachers. That is because they are much more efficient at grading by this point, they have their lesson plans drafted and it just requires minimal updates, and they know how to handle problems in the classroom quicker. Trust me.. I have A LOT of teacher friends.
---
TL;DR - All teachers are going to be a hunter in the back of MC auto  attacking trash mobs while grading tests.
---
There is almost zero way to know which servers WILL BECOME low pop.
---
I'm indecisive whether to play warrior or pally. In one hand I like the leading role of the tank, but in the other I also like the more chill support and flexible playstyle of the paladin. Idk really
---
I said my preferred tried and tested options. They are objectively better just because people already know what will happen and people can make solutions. You want sharding to level 10? Whatever, it's a few hours of something i don't like. Layering is longer, potentially endless. Because what if the right amount of people DONT leave like in everyone favourites graphs? What if they stay? What if they want 4000 people on the server but 6000 are left? Do they just give up and split into 2 3000 people servers? Do they just keep it layered forever? Are they now forced to make new servers anyway so people can transfer making the whole thing fucking pointless? Nobody knows, they don't know, you don't know. It's a stupid fucking non solution to a problem that was never meant to exist. 
---
Don't worry, i'm sure Blizzard will have ideas just as good as to fix the problems created by this fix though.
---
Yeah, I was in the process of phasing out my vanilla gear with the largely better early quest green's and blue's of TBC. Not that I had much in the way of *decent* gear as I'd only really cleared MC with my guild. Certainly not a very impressive look mind.
---
What's better about layering than planned server merges?
---
&gt; Imagine waiting 3 hours to loot the quest item because of how many people there are
---
This is why Blizzard said you think you want it but don't. I bet theres going to be a lot of people complaining for those same "quality of life" changes that make the game smooth, easy, and predictable but ultimately boring that caused them to leave in the first place.
---
Firing up your passion and emotion over getting screwed on a movie spawn or drop or whatever is part of the emotional investment that makes people come back. If everything is always smooth and seamless it gets dull and tedious.
---
From his Twitter feed it seems like he's recovering from surgery and suffers from bipolar disorder. A real shame he isn't covering recent events. I hope he makes a full recovery and returns to classic wow.
---
5 thread today. Going toward new records ? Anyway, here is a copy paste.
---
Agree   on changes, and ask the current team, that drove us to want Classic in   the first place, to implement these changes without breaking the game.
---
People   there can't agree and propose changes on potential TBC and WotLK   realms, and you want those people to vote for content? Good luck, with   not turning into BFA after 2 years.
---
"There   can be realms for everyone", yes except the question how will you not   split the community to a breaking point, remains. Maybe you want   eventual CRS again? Heard it's great for the sense of   community...(Cross-realm-sharding).
---
Private   servers kept people for over 10 years with simple fresh server   launches, but for some reason the official one will die. Go figure.
---
I   hope this time blizzard will be able to protect people from  themselves,  but after reading every singe thread on the subject and the  constant  drama of "this should be changed" which is countered ASAP by  "Lol no,  better change that instead", turning into drama in no time.  Good luck  with post content that wont screw up everything. This is  blizzard, and  they have multiple games, if you think that you will get  100% dedicated  team to make SURE that it will always feel "vanilla"  well good luck. It  will be even harder than working on Retail.
---
The   potential for disaster is big, and sometimes it's better to get a  fresh  server or come back later if you are burnt-out, than risking to  one day  come back to a game you have no idea WTF it turned in to.
---
I got 2 :)
---
It depends, they make a pretty decent OT. As dps, they need a shitload of gear that you don't get until AQ
---
They probably want to avoid making extra servers, knowing that at least one third of the people playing on release will quit later on.
---
Or if they don’t they want time to create new servers.
---
Either way we can complain later, if it’s still there in phase 2. Stop pissing in the communal pool.
---
layer cap == server cap for reasons i just explained
---
I’m America it’s pretty rare to have more than 2 weeks of vacation
---
The OP can take advantage of this. Collecting the information from kids and then coercing them through refusing to pay their sub fee.
---
There is no more Basic Game- retail just requires a subscripton
---
So this is 100% speculation, but it seems like servers are world/continent based, rather than shard based on retail.
---
There shouldn't be population lag.
---
Also WoW1 twice
---
They haven’t rolled out yet
---
Keep in mind the population limits are dynamic and 3k is just an estimate. Otherwise, carry on. :)
---
If the population is high, demand would also be higher
---
Poor comparison. A movie is probably 2 hours.

"Why do some people not enjoy driving a Mercedes?"

---
Happy to help. The entire team here is putting in a lot of time this past day or so to try and maintain things, so it by no means is just me.
---
Nah man, feral was viable 15 years ago, it'll be viable again.
---
I would say 8 days is fucking slow for anyone with experience. My first ever character took 18 days but I didn't have a clue what I was doing. 
---
All my PS characters are 4.x to 5.x days regardless of class
---
I think 8 days is pretty reasonable to expect anyone to do nowadays with all the guides etc that will be/are available
---
While i do agree with you, there is little chance they have space to do a big revamp of this before release.
---
Yes I do! 
---
It started with those functions but it got much worst.
---
I atually enjoyed TBC a lot! And WOTLK for the most part. So I would totally be up for that :)
---
Although I could life without WOTLK tbh... Transmog and that shit was just over the top I guess!
---
The raids were fun though and you were actually still socializing a lot!

I’m talking about general chat, I know they’ve discussed how battle.net will work

---
&gt;layering
---
11/10
---
My question is what happens when the layers don't die down, and there are still over 10k people playing consistently on each server?
---
They'll have to split up the layers, how do they choose who goes where?
---
Did you get an email??
---
That's why I skip quests like that if I haven't made it to the mob first or gotten lucky, and decisions like that are what will put me at lvl-30 when everyone else is at lvl-25 and below... oh wait, looks like some guild has mastered layer-hopping with an addon already, and they're aoe grinding the same packs of mobs on 4 different layers over and over. So much for my planning and decision-making
---
You rejoice at bad news? Is it because it means that the only way to go is up?
---
haha, aren't you cute?
---
Why do you insist on spreading this bullshit? You commented on the video of Ion explaining that you cannot relog or switch continents to switch layering. You cannot be this dense
---
I have a feeling that you dont HAVE to be subbed because with the BFA beta I didnt have an active sub but i could still play the beta. If Blizz do actually only give beta access to currently subscribed players then thats honestly a load of shit because I can guarantee that most people who still actually play wow only started recently, literally 90% of my guild were either vanilla or BC players and have left because wow isnt what it used to be. I just hope that i still have a chance even though ive been unsubbed since like october
---
Yeah and that won't be particularly difficult to figure out.
---
That's not what I asked. I asked for the source for your numbers claim. I haven't seen actual numbers quoted anywhere.
---
Can we have this on retail? PLS
---
They should have had dedicated servers. Bad comparison.
---
Ha! Fair
---
Heyo guys - Madseason here again
---
The only cloth that mages/priests won't fight over is fire/frost damage and shadow damage gear. Group levelling is a slow process, whether it's questing or in a dungeon, so it will be difficult to even semi-rush. You don't need prot/holy specs until mid 50s dungeons and they're painfully slow to level as they have low DPS and unnecessary survivability. I keep fury tanks alive with my shadow priest without any problem while levelling.
---
Not an argument. I'll take that as an admission that you don't have one, and blocked.
---
&gt; "Ninja a blue in DM? Let me just layer hop and suddenly nobody knows who I am."
---
Except youre on a static server that will have a forum, etc.  Eventually everything will almost certainly end up 'merged' into the same layer, and theres still going to be all those people in your original layer that will know youre an asshole, and the word will spread just the same as a normal server.
---
I mean, hell...wasnt there a time when trade wasnt even 'worldwide'?  Even if you spammed chat about someone being a dickhead, if someone was in SW instead of IF they werent going to see it, and *everyone* out in the world that was questing, doing dungeons, farming, etc certainly wasnt going to see it.
---
The word is still going to spread.  Just because you can swap to a different layer right away doesnt mean you magically have run away from the problem.
---
Besides that, the way i had been reading it was youre still going to get sent back to your original shard after you leave party/whatever.  You dont get sent to the new shard permanently when you join a new group, do you?
---
Nice troll
---
MBP Mid-2012.. plsss
---
Technically speaking it’s still sharding, just better for players than the previous implementation. It was a bit disingenuous of them to say they’re researching/building new server tech, I’d hazard a guess that the reason for the name was because if they said “we’re doing sharding, just differently” people would just see sharding and complain.
---
Still a good compromise, but I’d prefer nothing at all. Launch events in WoW where everything was overcrowded were rare and made it more interesting, but obviously not everyone agrees.
---
My main concern is the auction house. There will be too many layers and a flood of resources that should not exist. This will throw the economy out of wack big time.
---
Yeah, not everyone can be an Elite Gamer, amirite?
---
What do you plan to do at 60? Raiding will pigeonhole a pally into healing, so they really aren't as flexible as you might think. 
---
Outside of raiding is much more flexible. I've been struggling with this same question since I likely won't raid much.
---
Yeah only shows 2009 digital upgrade and my account is from 2005.
---
Just as long as they don't increase the level cap. God, please don't make the mistake of invalidating all the Vanilla content all over again.
---
I guess that technically could happen, but honestly - considering they spend time and money developing a new system just to make sure the community get what we want I don't think they would continue to "abuse" this system just to solve the problem of not entirely knowing how many realms they need. I mean, they can't be sure of how many people will play at launch nor how many are tourists. They are fully aware of this problem, but abusing the layering system to "solve" it would defeat the whole point of it. If that is their way of doing things they would of just used sharding as they originally planned as well.
---
I take the fact that they developed layering as a clear indicator that they listen to the community and won't try to abuse such a system.
---
Nice, maybe I should catch up.
---
“her parents”
---
The intention is to re-create Vanilla as it was back in 2004-06. So it's not quite a remaster. That said, it's being built on the modern client so there will be some additional polish. Based on some comments from streamers who have played the beta, on low settings you're getting a game that looks and feels very similar to what it was back in the day. On higher settings you will start to get more of a polished or remastered feeling.
---
I think there are two main philosophical differences between Vanilla and where the game is currently at.
---
1. Leveling is no longer really a part of the game. It's more of an extended tutorial on the new features in whatever expansion you're in. It's quick and fairly painless. In Vanilla leveling was a huge part of the game. It was a long journey. If I had to summarize it, that means quests aren't always obvious and can involve some planning (and there's no built in quest tracker telling you where to go and who to kill), mobs are harder to kill, and things generally just take more time.
---
2. Convenience. The modern game has a lot of features designed to make the game more convenient. For example, want to run a dungeon? Enter this queue and we'll put a group together for you and teleport you to the dungeon so you can get started immediately. A lot of people feel these conveniences take away from the social aspect of the game.

Jealous of people taking weeks off work. I make decent money but damn, I get like 15 days off a year (and that’s including sick leave). Between visiting family, 1 vacation, and actual sickness I probably can’t take more than a day or maybe two.

Baby dont hurt me

Yea, I'm aware of that, but being in a support role allows me to have meme shockadin talents and still perform well, while having fun at pvp. I really like raiding tho

#MadSeasonForBeta2019
---
RPPVP Servers are like parking handicap spaces. You're probably there for a free win on \[handicapped\], or you realize that you, yourself, are \[handicapped\].
---
Every time a post like this is made 14 trolls fap to 'wow funeral'.
---
I was wrong. Layering is basically what I suggested but much better. They won't allow cross-realm layers so basically it's dynamic servers within a single server.
---
It does, but the ideal of keeping someone chain feared an entire fight is more of a dueling or 1v1 thing than what actually plays out in group PvP...so I’m not sure how worried you should be about that - it’s your call. Are you mostly going out to 1v1 against horde, or hitting up group PvP for phase 2 and then AV and WSG when they are released in a later phase? That’s the decision for you.
---
I don't think this will be tough to implement.
---
I think it's highly likely that the starting zones will have sub-layers that aren't in other zones.
---
I didn't mean it to mock you, man. It's just like, *so much* more than 60 hours it made me laugh.
---
If you or anyone wants a few games that are beatable in those 3 months try either
---
God of War (PS4)
---
And Diablo 3 has a new season starting this friday (17th)
---
Both are excellent games with loot that will make time fly by
---
But doesn't offset the supply. All dependant on the respawn rate tbh.
---
Sure it’s better than what we would have otherwise had, but they didn’t develop something entirely new.
---
From a purely technical standpoint this is sharding, they just populate the shards up front and don’t dynamically shift players around them.
---
I get why they decided to say it was something new, if they had just said “we’ve tweaked the way we manage our shards” people would complain and going into the technical nuances would be a chore. Still, it’s sharding.
---
One legit downside is that apparently you can hop layers with some help and then double dip on black lotus, have a second shot at the Gurubashi chest, Tidal charm, the STV fishing event or look for Devilsaurs and rar mobs. We end up with inflated valuable resources after the layers are merged. With sharding for starting areas we would only have inflated copper ore and such. I´m still in favor of layering, but it´s not undisputed great. It is just a planned server merge with reserved names and serverhopping unlocked before that.
---
[Nothing personal, kid.](https://i.redd.it/93cm2zmuh7y21.jpg)
---
Those project 60 streams are what got me hyped for classic.
---
It reads like a copy pasta, that's for sure.  I think the point they're trying to make is that you have to play against better players to see where you stand.  
---
Seems like the WoW Arena mentality which is not applicable for Classic.  Sorry, there are no rankings, no pvp ratings, high PVP titles don't even represent skill; they only represent time dedicated to PVP.  I don't think that person will enjoy Classic.
---
I saw my gmail tab had a (1) this morning.  Got mildly excited.  Turns out it was just something useless (gas bill is ready to pay or some shit).
---
...this is going to be a long day, isnt it? :P
---
That's what people are getting at. We're not convinced he changed his mind, many believe that he just jumps on board whatever is popular for the sake of shilling or cash. People don't respect that kind of personality.
---
This is closed beta, very small amount of people that got invited will be playing, mostly streamers and youtubers...
---
&gt;High server capacity
---
All the respawns rates are based on lower player cap.
---
Personally I hope to get in so I can bathe in the hype with others for a few hours. But private servers have been out for years and I don't want to burn out spending too much time on the beta. Good luck all!
---
This is pretty much the arguements over sharding! You think MW2 is the best becuse you never got to experience MW I assume? Everyone championing sharding are thrive players who are sick of live but that means they don't understand the magic they are killing.
---
This isn’t cutting edge tech at all
---
When you say least represented, are you also referring to most needed?
---
For example, there might be 20% warriors, but a need for 25% warriors.
---
There might be 5% druids, but a need for 4% druids in raids.
---
What happens if it doesn't decrease? And only like 20% quit?
---
Haven't be able to check yet. Just wanna give a headsup. My Legion and BfA email for beta invite arrived a month AFTER I actually had access to it, so check your b.net launcher regularly (where you switch between accounts/PTR).
---
The way you communicated made it seem as if it is possible to cross realm with layering.
---
He’s right
---
I'm just pointing out that people take every word as a sacred promise so they better stick to this or all hell will break loose. 
---
I'm all for blizz being flexible in their decisions as long as they stay true to the delivering a vanilla experience.
---
The corect term is crz (cross realm zones). Sharding is what you draw as layering.
---
Performance isn't the only concern: layering is going to allow a higher probability of realms having a healthy population long-term. Realms will inevitably have a certain amount of players not planning on playing long term.
---
The downsides are pretty small imo.
---
LMAO best comment yet
---
I think you need to go look at the graphic someone posted. Because if you think layers = sharding then you don't know what either one is. But you do know, you're just choosing to be dramatic.
---
I start my masters in September I guess ,I’ll just live at my parents the rest of my live and drop out
---
Hi Josh, great podcast keep the good work up! 
---
It's awesome that you are so fast on this hot topic!
---
Chat and AH is server wide.
---
Guide is not 1:1 with videos. For one thing videos from multiple speed runners appear in the guide and they are there for reference. Segments are there which have no video reference because none exist like Swamp of Sorrows &amp; Sililthus. Extra dungeons are made available like Scarlet Monastery/Zul'Farrak. Quest chains like Linken's/Ony attune/Scholomance key and countless others are added. At least take a cursory look at it before criticizing please.
---
I get the meme, but there is enough raging negative stuff in this subreddit to where it just isn't fun.
---
Eh. It might just be my anecdotes vs yours, but we'd just rush them past the field and push them back against their own bridge. Then we'd just push our way in from there. We might've had scrubs on Alliance.
---
I don't understand this post, and it feels like a scam. 
---
WoW is FREE to install. It's $15 a month for a subscription. Are you offering to buy and pay accounts for people? Because that's kinda against the Blizzard TOS.

Ah, the good old full T3 with a horrible strikers mark from MC. Wonder why people never include character name and server in their screenshots 🤔
---
Could always go for a holy/prot hybrid build and build up to sets of gear. Heal in raids and tank in dungeons. You won't be the best at either but you'll be decent!
---
That data can be retrieved from the realmserver. Someone will eventually post it.

---
It has been answered in the comments many times already :)
---
I'm kinda thinking the same. I primarily wanna play Shaman, however my friends group (and myself really) are Alliance players, so my next choices would be Mage and then Priest, however obviously Priests will have it much easier doing alot of the content.
---
Everyone saying this is fantastic and the perfect solution is missing the point.
---
The fact that we complained about sharding is why we got a better solution.
---
Layering has massive issues like abuse of resources/rares spawns/avoiding PvP.
---
Stuff like this needs to be thought about because 100% the top guilds will be abusing layering. I know I damn well will be.
---
1-10 is without a doubt the most easiest time 😂😂😂 glhf
---
That's when you bust out queue times. If one server has a drastically larger population making indecidive people roll elsewhere helps reduce the population.
---
True. It's not a perfect solution. On the other hand, having completely separated servers are probably not the best option either, due to asymmetrical reduction of players over time. 
---
I think the developers are going for the optimal solution that is the most acceptable.
---
Raiding isn't the only way to play WoW.
---
Anyone have an alliance mage leveling guide they like? Or is google and pray my best option?
---
Tag along with a friend lul.
---
Honestly tho, other classes suffer from this (hunter or warlock for example). Just bear with it (see what I did there? =) It's not that long anyway.
---
It's not an authentic classic experience if there's no lag.
---
I don't think layer-hopping is going to be a huge issue here, honestly. The Classic team have been really great about understanding what people want from Classic, and they've done a lot to make the changes (almost) everyone wanted. I'd be very surprised if the Classic team isn't working on ways to prevent layer-hopping abuse, I wouldn't be surprised if they had one already. I also don't see Vanilla/Classic fans attempting to abuse layer-hopping, but that's just me.   
---
Personally, I'd much rather have layers and have the chance to interact with more people more often on my realm than have to start over grinding a good reputation with a server merger, but thats obviously just my opinion.
---
He hope it becomes a clusterfuck of people trying to tag mobs. Like a prober launch!
---
I'm in Europe. It's already been a long day.
---
Hi, /u/nick1894
---
The handle is Ikakku. I also have Thori-dal if that makes you feel any better.
---
not 'added', just abilities that were there in classic ... private servers are wrong.
---
Check the top post of today, it is pretty simple but accurate
---
Just no.
---
It's literally the same situation with layers and classic wow. That's upsetting.
---
This would be the best option since I will be playing with friends but no one else can tank. Do you know a decent build for this?
---
That’s because Blizzard made the wise decision to have a bridge directly next to Thrall.
---
Invading Horde cities is so much easier than Alliance cities.
---
So helpful...haha
---
You dumb
---
I don't think so. In interviews sharding was mentioned as zone duplication and layering as world duplication. Pretty big difference.
---
They don't have added abilities, pserver mobs were *missing* lots of abilities, along with incorrect armor/resist/etc. values.
---
Oh okay, I didnt read all the comments, I'll check again
---
&gt;They are objectively better just because people already know what will happen and people can make solutions.
---
That is not what objectively means. Just because you have tried it does not mean it is better. Yes, some solutions have been tried and tested, but they can still be shit. You might not think so, but many do - and Blizzard is among them. The thing is, if the "tried and tested" is shit, then that also means it is guaranteed shit. Then it is much more preferable to try something new at at least might be good. Now you might not think it is shit, but others do. This is why it is a *subjective* matter. Blizzard can please everyone so they go with one solution they think is best - deal with it.
---
&gt;Layering is longer, potentially endless. 
---
Now you are just making shit up. We don't know entirely how long it will be, but we know for sure it won't be past Phase 1. You are literally making shit up to prove your point, or you don't really know much about layering which means you shouldn't try to discuss it.
---
&gt; they don't know
---
Again, you make shit up to prove your point. You don't know what they have planned, what they thought of. And those scenarios you list are not certain to be true. But even if it happens then having to fix that might still be preferable to the "tried and tested" ways.
---
Essentially the choice Blizzard had to make was either do something they knew they did not like or try something new where there are uncertainties, but it might be good. So either 100% something they don't like, or only a chance of something they don't like but also a chance of things working out. You are just too blinded because you apparently think the pserver solutions are good. Well, good for you - but Classic is not made to your preferences.

mine goes back to Nov23rd 2004, so seems to go right back. But ive been inactive a lot so perhaps it only shows certain # of line items?
---
It's not added it's original, so good,next.
---
Hi, /u/Amsiur
---
That distinction is worth making as sharding is a very specific word meaning a specific thing.
---
Lots of other games uses sharding but without cross realm stuff.
---
Ultima, the game they created the term sharding, used it to refer to splitting up one server into several smaller servers.
---
gut das du jetzt schon weißt was du spielst ...
---
Thanks!  Indeed I found that grouping up in the higher density areas helped quite a bit
---
What I understand (and it may be incorrect) is that layering would be turned off and queue times will be implemented as normal.  At this time I'm sure they'll not only offer server transfers to "dead" realms but also over populated ones.  Just a guess.
---
Oh man i forgot all about the Baron Mount!
---
Never claimed that it did. The evidence for non beast bosses is based on videos and math, not beast lore. Maexxna evidence is based on beast lore.
---
nah i cant find it and dun wanna rewatch everything i did yesterday.  RIP source
---
who is this dumbfuck?
---
This, lol.
---
People are just generally mad.
---
They have to allow server transfer to remedy low pop or lopsided realms. Next.
---
I though each layer was 3000+? Thus they will not cause any issues! /s
---
It sounds great. I mean cmon flying is always awesome. The fact that it destroyed world pvp was sad :/
---
Yeah, I knew it was risky but I thought the "negative" was a good fit at the moment not to mention all that meta I included. I was hoping to gain a lot of traction in an attempt to actually get invited to beta but perhaps I'm just too old for this meme crowd... I suppose that's my bad, the post had way too much text and no gifs.
---
Oh well, I tried.
---
Yup! Sideways progression
---
Your mother
---
I guess I didn't say it the best way but I really ment it was the thing that I didn't like the most.  I shouldn't have said hate when it is just annoying that I can't get something I wanted.  On a scale of 1 to 10 it is for sure a 1.
---
Mails are really sporadic and unreliable. The most reliable way is to check your launcher.
---
Sorry...
---
fuck you
---
No name conflicts, no economy damage, and no community damage are the big advantages.
---
Queues
---
"temporary"
---
yeah keep on dreaming
---
Raid on orgrimmar kills Thrall.  Goes to a safe spot near thrall.  Switch to another layer en-masse.  Kills Thrall again with no resistance because that shard had no warning the raid was coming, and the raid had no clearing to do.  Before a defense can be mounted, Thrall is dead and they move on to the next shard.  
---
I think blizzard is gambling on people not getting high enough level to do stuff like this before they eliminate ~~sharding~~ layering.  I think they are being too optimistic.
---
Exactly, that’s what I’m talkin about!

I don't think it's all that important to spend a ton of money on.  I have way more fun in the game over the next couple of years, and will still just no life it.  Just one of those things that naggs at you.  I used to "compete" on wowpets for the highest number of pets on Illidan and it always bugged me that there were a few that always kept me out of the top 5.  That said I'm glad that this is the only thing bothering me after seeing how much was said yesterday.
---
It's very common for businesses to buy a couple hundred domains for no reason but they might need it in the future or don't want want someone else to have it
---
Name changes aren’t going to happen but server transfers are vanilla.
---
That original post is hilarious.
---
How does it deal with too many resources coming into the auction house?
---
Its simply a question of efficiency.  You have very limited abilities but the monsters are very weak as well.  Use what you got wisely and make use of the 5-second rule.  Front load some spell damage, finish off the mob with melee (while your mana regenerates) and heal between fights when necessary.  Bonus points, heal right before the ranged pull to maximize 5 sec rule. 
---
Don't worry about gear until it starts getting green
---
dps/heal for a warrior, shaman (earth shock holds aggro!) or really anyone that can take a couple hits and generate aggro
---
Is there a way to see the invites without having access to the email? I had my account linked to my university email that was recently removed due to graduating and I hadn't bothered to update it yet.

I been on this subreddit for 2 days and its cringy af.
---
I love that the paladin is Ret.
---
You probably never even played Vanilla and will probably quit at level 20
---
I mean, there are still kids today that get into playing Tetris.  Ya never know
---
People are crazy
---
Yes, once the honor system is implemented. Expect to see city raids to kill the city boss vanish and become rare because no serious pvper wants their honor affected from something they can't control.
---
It does have diminishing returns. You can't reapply it right away because WotF lasts 5 seconds.
---
How does it feel like a scam, its so obvious. Someone gives him a valid reason, and he gifts them Battle.net balance so they're able to purchase a subscription. You're like the IT guy at my school thinking everythings a virus.
---
I don't know the details but you can report it. I've seen other people get their stuff back. Maybe you won't but it's worth a try
---
In one of the interviews https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=646 Ion said that beta will be very small. I wouldn't expect to get a beta key.
---
It would update in your launcher as well if I’m not mistaken!
---
If you have to bring up other games to prove a point that in itself is completely irrelevant then how is the distinction worth making...
---
In WoW, sharding is cross realm, that's it. What purpose does it server to discuss that any further
---
Perhaps the options to use the vanilla unamored mounts(as a skin) after the grind out the gold for their Epic mount 1st, for those who have it from vanilla. This seems like a fair compromise in my opinion as I feel that no one in classic should get an Epic mount with earning it.
---
How long did they play? Yeah lol it died pretty much killed CoD as a proper gaming franchise no im not saying cod is dead just no one within family g circles would be caught dead playing it. Instead it's your Bradley's and your Chads whilst wearing their caps backwards before you try that chestnut. Classic wow is on the same path.
---
Let me put it this way. BfA is the first WoW expansion I did not purchase. I still occasionally sub to play non-max characters.
---
Hi, /u/0wnerer
---
Ask a GM you might get lucky.
---
go level up 60 first
---
This isn't even ideal. Def way too big to be that close.
---
1-10 is the only true druid leveling experience. Balance!
---
I think he's joking...
---
Yes they mentioned it in one of the interviews. Unfortunately I don't remember in which one, I've seen three or four.
---
As a side note, I find it very weird and somewhat distasteful that Blizzard invited a bunch of no-name streamers and we have to watch them if we want a bit more detailed info. Why didn't they wrote up an article at least or something? The Classic page and release news is nice but very information light.
---
Yep my account was accessed about 5 years ago, I had a random hunter that they sold everything and botted to max level, and it had herbalism.  Went on for a few months and then I noticed because the account got banned and I got an email sent to me.  Never would have noticed otherwise.  
---
Luckily all my gear wasn't sold, which was awesome!  And they leveled my hunter to 110 so that's nice.
---
Mine goes back to December 5, 2004.
---
I'd recommend probably 31/20/0 to focus a little more on the healing side. Nut you'd have to choose between Shock and Blessing of Sanctuary. Someone else might know a better build.
---
Ah yeah I feel that. I felt the same for mount collecting, rather for just the # of them
---
Sadly no. Not without giving you edit privilages.
---
Great communication is the key to all relationships. She knows she can speak up against my terms. Communicate with your partners! As long as they understand what this release means to you, youll be okay. After all, to some, this is no different than any other important event in ones life.
---
 Onyxia Raid Wipe Animation was a Warcraft meme. 
---
Leeroy Jenkins is an internet phenomenon and forever a part of internet history.
---
If it would go the route of expansion betas, neither would be required. You could get an invite without being subbed, and you could play the beta without being subbed. There was a time period where you had to be subbed though (like within last 3 months)
---
WoW Classic Launch week is both of what you just described.
---
Thank you for this post. As someone that agreed with the concerns of the community during the begging of BFA, and how some communication was mishandled by both developers and CM's, I wholeheartedly agree that the classic team is doing literally everything they can to satisfy their community, and find the best solution. They are absolutely listening and making meaningful changes.
---
To everyone that complains and whines and says "just make 1 server and let there be crashes and whatever else"...Are you seriously? Do you want Classic wow to thrive or not? This is 2019, the public as a whole will not accept such a messy launch. 
---
We need quality. Blizzard quality. And for that we have to agree to compromise. In my opinion, (at least as far as I understood Layering) it's a great option. Perhaps the best we could've gotten.
---
Mage is also great for world PvP because you can port all over and be wherever you want to be to gank people at a moments notice
---
Not a single one I’ve seen comes from someone actually deploying and maintaining software and service platforms lmao
---
I think Ion is doing a great job with this. Staying strong and keeping to what it was.
---
That's a very cynical perspective, but valid nonetheless. Sharp awareness on your part.
---
I don't think there has been any official word on this 3000 figure. Seems to me someone pulled it out of their ass and now everyone's running with it.
---
Just increase the time period they are available or simply make them permanently available, Blizz. Gives more customization and choice to the players if they want one with or without armor, but same expensive price.
---
Question for Clarity: I see there are only 3K in 3rd circle (3-12 wks). Wouldn't there be 8K (3+2.5+2.5)? My thoughts were that they merge the entire population.

It did work in early Vanilla, but by 1.12 if it was gone, if not sooner than that.
---
Ah yeah I would see it there! Gotta keep my eyes open. I just didnt remember if it required some action from your part after you received the invite.
---
&gt; You are starting to contradict yourself. You've given us the proof that we know the armor of the boss
---
We know the base armor of the boss. You are claiming that we don't know how the debuffs stack - therefore in the equation to solve it we wouldn't know the final armor of the boss after reductions, hence it would be X. But you cannot run the equation if you introduce another unknown like base AP, hence you use the fact that dmg reduction works equally on the crusader bonus as it works on base AP.
---
&gt; first bloodthirst hits with sunder armor and faery fire on the target for 615
---
&gt; the second hits with faery fire sunder and recklessness + crusader on the user for 700
---
No the second is without recklessness too, otherwise you wouldn't be able to do the equation on this.
---
1800, Let the people slow trickle out into the zones and we get to see everyone.
---
Could just log out tho
---
if you have a group of mobs in mind that you want to check, it's all on wowhead already
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=5429/fire-roc#abilities
---
No. Even In wow, sharding is sharding and cross realm is cross realm.
---
The point of the other games is to prove that sharding means simply splitting one server into several smaller servers.
---
Check this guy's post history. Multiple people have explained to him that this is not how layering works and ive even provided him with video proof that you cannot just switch layers on demand. He just stops responding and continues spreading misinformation to the next thread. Its a lost cause
---
Lol waste of time !
---
Server transfers were in Vanilla.
---
PvP servers?
---
Yeah like, a mage aoe  farming in brd, won't work as well, because the dwarves throw nets.
---
ding ding ding
---
Made me LoL
---
Hmm, Dwarf hunter or warrior.. 
---
I like hunter play style, pvp, lots of loot is important to them and they seem chill. Am a bit scared of needing lots of macros and dealing with pet AI though. Not a lot of them in demand relative to population it feels like. 
---
Warrior seems challenging, powerful and can tank which I enjoy. I'm scared that they're more hardcore though, needing groups and multiple builds to succeed and I'm not a very social groupy person tbh.
---
No. People are a plague.
---
To anyone reading this guys spread of misinformation. Ion disproves everything this guy is saying about being able to switch layers whenever you want or when you are travelling continents:
---
It’s much easier than that. It’s not guild-based it’s group-based. You want to farm devilsaur leather ? Ask someone in a smaller layer to invite you in his group.
---
This dude didn’t even understand how the layers work, he did ugly graphic that are based on a bias understanding on how it work.
---
Don't take anything serious that comes out of tipsout mouth. Classic leveling won't be 30% slower. It might be 30% faster though.
---
Ya. I agree. I could bring myself to subbing for a beta. I can't bring myself to sub for a small chance at a beta. 
---
They will probably want more people in later on for stress tests but I don't want to start leveling a month out from launch. Guess a person could sub for a month see if they get in and cancel it.
---
1) Sharded servers have much fewer resources than a continent-wide world server that is designed for the load of many, many players.  So when you force 120+ people into one shard it breaks things.
---
2) Spell batching more like Vanilla did will reduce the load put on by mass combat compared to Retail as there are fewer interactions per second to calculate.  Also the nature of spells will be less dynamic with none of those "spawn 20-40X DOTs on all these targets in an area" type spells we have now.
---
I am one of the people from the no sharding crowd and I am satisfied with this solution. I was willing to slog through an overcrowded elwynn forest if it meant that I get to keep my persistent world.
---
I am convinced people who are against this actually want unstable servers and server queues to make it feel like 2004 all over again. Layering perfectly solves the problem of an overpopulated world while still keeping the persistence.
---
True. I did it to get exalted and Rank 12, but I didn't live there like some people I knew in there. Didn't really bother on my other toons, since it really didn't matter while I was raiding. How often did the meta shift?
---
No it wont, it will never happen. See you in Layer 4.
---
&gt; How is merging three or four layers any better than server merging aside from the economy being shared since day one?
---
Because it's automated and you aren't at the whim of Blizzard, because queue times can be managed better, server identity/community, economy like you said. It's a cleaner implementation to fix problems we know would exist with something that's cleaner and more automated instead of clunky and dated that will have even worse problems.
---
&gt; Will we force a 10k population server to split into two 5k servers?
---
Free xfers off heavy populated realms to lower populated realms if you choose. This problem was solved a decade ago.
---
You don't have to consider the idea that layering is a cleaner version of having multiple servers and having to manage them (something Blizz never really did well), but anyone who didn't have a well-populated, well-balanced realm understands the issue.

I'm overly joyful of this announcement, I was so scared it would be in July or even earlier. I'm working in another country without my gaming computer and won't be home before start of August again, so this is just perfect.
---
I think we will always be fewer, but in the sense, that we are the mighty 300, and the Persian horde threatens us not.
---
Nobody knows, you know why ?   
---
Because the game isn't out yet.
---
It's objective because we have more information about how it works, not because i like it you moron. 
---
And no, now you're making shit up, pretending to know the future. I am just we CAN'T and that a great many possibilities could fuck this 'fix' up. And no, they don't know, because again, they can't see into the future. Why the fuck does this need to be said? Literally every change they make has more changes on live because they are not infallible gods, they are bunch of people making a video game. 
---
Oh, next paragraph, 'there are uncertainties'. Oh my god, you are so fucking stupid it hurts. You can't admit there are uncertainties no no no...  literally forgot a paragraph later.
---
And maybe some private server solutions are good, Blizzard won't use them so it doesn't matter. And yes, Classic isn't being made to my preferences, that was kind of the point fuckwit. But you know what, it's fine, the original was made to my preferences, i enjoyed it a lot. I experienced it already. I imagine leftovers are a person like yours forte.
---
Played the shit out of both of them. MW2 was better.  Better graphics, better sound, and a larger spread of viable gun options.  MW is a fantastic game, and may take the edge in level design, but MW2 perfected COD multiplayer gameplay. 
---
On the wow side of things, I don't really like this sharding/layering thing but at the end of the day if it means I get to log in and play the game with my limited time, PLUS, it guarantees the longevity of healthy server populations then whatever.
---
But the whole point OP was making is that all the hypocrites who vowed to not buy/play MW2 over the dedicated server issue did so anyway, just as those who are bellyaching about layering will inevitably play classic and enjoy it.
---
On the WoW
---
But launch is already playable for everyone.
---
And again I was willing to accept sharded starter zones as necessary to start. I am not in favor of splitting the entire continent.
---
&gt;If you're lucky enough to be in a populous layer
---
load balancing.
---
&gt;That's not how it works, bud.
---
it is. unless you hoped to run some mafia over a particular TS mat / corner a market? probably a good thing that you won't be able to.
---
&gt;Layering doesn't work like sharding does. Sharding actively re-allocates players to different shards to compensate for population fluctuations.
---
every login, every instance, every group invite changes it.
---
&gt;These are real issues
---
well, anti-vaxxer think vaccine are a real issues... doesn't mean they have any credibility what so ever.
---
True, though I never found Leeroy Jenkins to be that funny, especially considering it was staged.
---
Awesome thanks for the tips!  Should definitely help.  I know 1-10 doesn’t take long, but the contrast in play style until you get a feral form is the biggest pain point for me
---
Dwarf rogue was dead last
---
Leeroy Jenkins was staged. So that makes Onyxia Raid Wipe the winner by default.

Cool idea, but I promise you people are going to try and scam you, so be very very careful. Honestly you should ask for a video proof of someone talking about their situation and showing their living situation etc.
---
No, but you can check it yourself on the live day.
---
No DHK in Phase 1
---
The problem with LFR was difficulty, it was super easy so everyone and their uncle had tier sets which devalued them for the people who still ran guild raids. Even if the stats were slightly lower and the color different, it made getting epic gear from raids mean less. It did for me at least, seeing shit players in full epics, what's the point.
---
This is great!
---
Remember Anduin? [This](https://hairstylecamp.com/wp-content/uploads/Young-Bradley.jpg) is him now, feel old yet?
---
I mean I am Familiy &amp; Friends, just not sure, if this counts this time. It counts in BFA and Stuff, but not sure if it counts for classic. Fingers are Crossed tho.
---
Ye thats a good one for alliance.
---
Why instead you don't play for few weeks so we don't have to worry for your convenience requiring back parts?
---
I may not be able to fly away. I may not be able to change servers. My hearthstone may still be on cooldown since that's how I got to Stormwind in the first place. But, I still have teleport Moonglade available and that's enough.
---
Are the names going to be unique by layer or by realm?
---
What if we get to Phase 2 and there are realms that still have like 6000 active players?
---
NO CHANGES
---
Which is insane considering how apparent it can be.  As of a couple years ago at least, a lot of mobs ability to block/parry/dodge was largely guesswork.
---
no need. You can reserve your name starting August 16th in the US. You can reserve up to 3 names.
---
Riddle Master has spoken
---
Arent they running to mulgore? XD
---
You do that, and reply on this thread 🤘😋
---
No server technology today can handle a ton of players? 
---
How have private servers managed up to 12k people in one realm?
---
They've discussed this farther in terms of population and zone overcrowding at the start. That's why they implemented sharding. It's not because of tourists. They know they are launching with a larger population than Vanilla originally launched with AND they will have fewer servers.
---
This has been discussed to death across numerous official forum threads since the first demo where we learned about sharding. You can either catch up or be done.
---
American net income is very good compared to most of Europe. Norway is about the only euro country that I’d consider to not be outright worse for what I want from a job. Everywhere else that has a lot of vacation has a way lower income that I wouldn’t find an acceptable trade off.
---
That seems to be the case. Mine has the farthest back payment being jan 1 2007 while the account was started somewhere in the early 2005
---
rogue or warrior? i like pvping, prob not that much pve, huge damage but also alot of utility. im guessing rogue is for me but just double checking :)
---
So basically you have no idea how much it would cost? I thought you knew and could provide me some info.
---
close its the Logitech G900 for the mouse and Corsair K70 RGB. Can't say I'll be replacing these any time soon lol
---
Yeah the problem is that I like both races aesthetically, although I think raptors look much better than wolves. 
---
Again, for me is Hardiness a 25% increase on stun resist base value, or does it add 25% to the total stun resist value?
---
Why dont you have a ranged weapon slot?
---
Did you ever get a chance to play on an RPPVP server like Emerald Dream? I went there during WotLK and the wPvP there was incredible. Entire guilds formed networks that would work together to engage each other. The Alliance and Horde seemed pretty evenly matched, though perhaps Alliance could bring more to bear. The guild leaders, I heard, would travel with guards so they weren't ganked by the enemy guilds gunning for them. They took it very seriously, but in a super fun way.
---
It was there that I first actually had to fight other players. It's so much different when you are in the open world compared to a battleground. There's a feral struggle involved, that kill or be killed sort of mentality that gets you going. I also faction changed and went Horde during this time, so maybe the disorientation of trying to grasp a new faction made these memories glow even more.
---
There would be calls to arms. Once, we formed actual battle lines just outside the Argent Tournament. We were mic'd up on like Ventrilo or whatever, and leaders would call out commands and stuff and get everyone organized. It was a massive fight, and eventually we somehow outmaneuvered the Alliance and were able to strike their flank, leading to a victory. Didn't always go that well, as Kingship of the East I believe was very, very good at securing tons of reinforcements in addition to being incredibly tough PVPers in their own right. Guilds would establish home bases, and Kingship's was Menethil Harbor as I recall. Sometimes we would try to lay siege to them, Path of Frosting across the ocean to give as little warning as possible. We crashed into that place like water on rock as they fought us off and had their warlocks inside the fort bringing in more troops. So epic.
---
But one thing I remember is my former guild, probably like many others, had bounty hunting available. You could pay a nice sum for a player to hunt down your target, secure the kill, and get the screenshot for proof. It was awesome. My IRL best friend had them come get me just for the lols. He told me ahead of time and I thought it was just fantastic. So later, my new guild had extricated itself from a great fight with the Alliance and portaled back to Undercity. After we dispersed, I was hanging out in the main area by the bank, when all of a sudden a Rogue attacks. Right in the middle of a capitol! I recognized him from my time in the Alliance guild and new he was there to collect. Oh shit! I fought as best I could, but he was well-geared and very skilled and got me. The balls on the guy to sneak into Undercity to collect his kill. I loved it!
---
Little things like that made the server incredibly fun to play on. We would go onto the forums and shit-talk in character and sometimes out of character too.
---
Absolutely loved it. Literally the best time I ever had, and I hope to recreate in Classic. It can suck for leveling, which is why I eventually moved to Wyrmrest Accord, but man it was cool.

---
hahaha entitlement at its finest
---
nice catch
---
I’m maining a druid, so there’s that. 
---
However i’ll also play a warlock, and here’s my question:
---
Orc (female) or undead?
---
He will be doing everything. Mostly pvp, as that is, for me, the most enjoyable aspect of wow. But also grinding, pve, wpvp shennanigans... 
---
First, racials, is the stun resist better than wotf? The enrage(?) is useless so looses vs cannibalize. The shadow resistance is a bonus over axe proficiency and the pet bonus, while nice wont help sm/ruin is better than underwater breathing. So... how good is stun resist really?
---
i dislike the orc male looks with caster gear. I could get over the fact i’m playing a female race (orc gals look quite good in lock armor) and the undeads are just cool (imho)
---
Ps. Sorry for possible spelling mistakes
---
For the record, I am a proud Horde player.
---
So what? Why would not having them ever be better than having them?
---
So they should be allowed to make money on an ambiguous post? Their desire to make money does not justify ambiguous or intentionally misleading advertising.
---
Jealous ?
---
It's still pretty early in the day, I figured I'd wait until at least 9am PST to start looking for who has an invite. I figure by end of business today, we'll have some idea of who has what.
---
This has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
---
???
---
I believe they mentioned that they would be continent wide, not azeroth wide? But maybe that was just because they haven't locked down the specifics of it.
---
It also totally destroys both the economy and the leveling curve. Groups of mages can AoE endlessly spawning mob camps and that becomes the fastest way to level, plus making money off fast mob respawns (since their loot tables don’t change even though their spawn frequency does)
---
If you honestly think forming a group of 2-3 people to knock out 3-4 quests will significantly slow you down (and that the slow down is serious enough to be an issue) then you probably would much more comfortable in retail WoW.
---
OP should change "Unpopular" to "Uninformed"
---
What the do you think they'll go out? 8 am Pacific?
---
Well, you may like that in retail wow, but I assure you, the vast majority of people do it because it's the fastest method to level short of buying a boost.  
---
And it's fucking awful...
---
It means the world is empty and meaningless when, like sodapoppin says, you can just sit in orgrimmar and chain queue lfg.
---
Beacase people still will move between shards and now not only in the starting zones.
---
I play on a 3440x1440 ultrawide and it's perfect for wow full screen.
---
I wasn't there in Vanilla, but to compound this...didn't you have to actually *go* to Ashenvale to queue for WSG? Not your capitol, and not with the BG finder.
---
That's a lot of inconvenience to run across a slaughter.
---
Look in the sidebar. We have flair.
---
It's been there for a while though.
---
Just wondering, will you actually "group" up with your guild in 1 layer? Or does this only happen when you make party's etc. It would be cool if an entire guild was on a single layer by default :D (easier trading at IF bridge etc).
---
Either way, i think its the best they can do.... Even with Layering, week 1 will be hell when it comes to lvling and mob tagging. without it, tons of people would quit before getting to lvl 20.
---
He was likely more worried about how and why people are installing potentially harmful applications on systems he has to manage. 
---
Speaking as a career tech, yeah these are all totally valid concerns.
---
Thousand Needles, Hillsbrad Foothills, Ashenvale, STV to name just a few.
---
Not really. The statement how can they possibly do that implies I'm skeptical that there will be a seamless solution. That is different from saying "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THIS. THERE IS NO SOLUTION". I cannot believe you have actually conflated the two, it genuinely seems like you are arguing in bad faith simply to be combative.  
---
You have a great day now friend.

All hail Icefrog. It's amazing how we still haven't seen his face

Meh, if it were so easy your friends would be able to hack you. I can see why you say that though.
---
This already exists,it just doesn’t show on mobile
---
Sit procs weren't a thing in Retail. That was quickly patched and from then on you got the negatives of sitting in combat without any of the benefits.
---
What we do know is that players of the same guilds will be stationed on the same layer. So if there is at least one way to force yourself to a specific layer, it's safe to assume that players will find a way to abuse it. How exactly and which steps will work and which will be prevented, we obviously do not know yet.
---
We don't need 88,000 people in the sub to comment on people who comment that they didn't grt one.  More efficient would be the people who did reporting
---
So you think a big problem is people having several guilds on stand-by that they can join, and that those guilds will always be on a different layer than the one they are currently on? That seems a bit crazy to me. Each layer is supposedly going to have a server's worth of people on it (or at least what a server would typically have on that continent). You are saying that for the long term we're going to have several layers people can easily hop between?
---
There is no flying in the main world in TBC and TBC was designed around flying.  Flying let you overcome obstacles, sure, but more than that it opened doors.  There were entire areas that you couldn't get to without flying.  Furthermore, flying was checked by cost.  The 1k cost on a low end flyer meant that I didn't even have my flier until a decent way into TBC.  Beyond that, fliers are 60% speed whereas epic ground is 100% speed.  If you knew what you were doing, a lot of the time it was faster to ground mount there.   The only exception was the epic flier, but those were so expensive they were out of the reach of a lot of the population.
---
Holy shiet, aoe farming is going to be INSANE with layering.
---
Early AV had a zerg vs. zerg defensive meta. Less emphasis on tower capture/defenses, no real attrition mechanics, more time for ice lord spawns and whatnot. The honor gain was pretty good and the long games were something you couldn't get anywhere else, so people liked it. On my alliance-heavy server when they pushed too far they would purposefully fall back to keep the game going. The NE hunter spam gave them good control over the game.
---
Then they started adding attrition mechanics and I believe they fine-tuned graveyard/tower capturing times and NPC values, and added turn-ins that emphasized winning/losing quicker for better honor gains.
---
It basically meant that both sides would ignore each other and just zerg rush to the end. And with the alliance side being easier to defend, they'd be able to send a small force to delay the horde zerg easier and the horde defense would always be less effective.
---
I dont know best guess i heard so far was same time when they announced it yesterday.. that would be in 15 mins. 
---
But i also heard some other stuff that sounded reasonable so maybe in 5 hours 15 minutes :P
---
How long has the main sub been around vs how long has this sub been around?
---
i played most of vanilla content when it was live
---
i d9ubt many people other than content creators played vanilla and are still subbed
---
tbh though i dont have the best memory of the game back then
---
Well that's easily avoidable if blizzard just announces it or someone posts them all... I'm not trying to waste 30min to an hour on release just trying to find a good server lol.
---
Feralas and Desolace for chill. For the most part ignored while lvling so ganking is less often. At least from what I remember.
---
Although i agree with the points you have raised, i must inform you that it in fact is guild based. I know this from the recent interview with the head of wow dev and some other guy ( i remember it was someone from the vanilla content creators interviewing them). There they say : "we will be aiming at placing players from the same guild in the same layer". Go check it if you don't trust me.   
---
This aside, i agree that the dude doesn't have any clue what he is talking about, probably never experienced clustering or phasing. The thing that frustrates me is that he made some retarded pic in paint that explains fuck all, claiming he "understands" what he is talking about, clearly never farmed devilsaur leather.
---
this man got me into aaron simpson
---
Billy joined one of those 2 guilds
---
&gt;It's objective because we have more information about how it works, not because i like it you moron.
---
I repeat, "objective" does not mean what you think it means. Having more information about how something works does not make it objectively better. Especially not if this "information" we have says that it is shit. Sure it is subjective whether or not it is shit, but that in it self also makes all of this subjective. In my eyes the tried and tested ways are absolutely shit, so something unknown is better than something I know how works - because I know it works like shit.
---
Essentially, from someone who does not like the "tried and tested" ways you have this: either 100% chance of shit or 50% chance of shit but also 50% chance of something good. From this perspective, the "unknown" is *objectively* better. So which one is better fully depends on whether you like the "tried and tested" or not - and that is subjective.
---
But my god, you are one angry boy, aren't you? Are you incapable of having a conversation without raging and resorting to name calling? Meh, I'm getting tired of talking to a kid that haven't learned that he might not know best. Bye.

They had us all along. Check wowclassicclassic.com too, incase 2034 has something waiting for us
---
I thought they doing original mount system? This means no ivory raptor ?
---
You still going to go after raptor mount ? You need exhaulted at 60 right
---
can anyone give me a quick run down on how layering works
---
He's says whilst ready to lose his mind if he couldn't log in day 1 and play solo.

---
California, attorney, full time (closer to 60 hour weeks), and I usually take 3 or 4 'long weekends' throughout the year. Fingers crossed I can pull away for classic launch though!
---
Durotar, Barrens, Arathi, Tanaris, Thousand Needles, Badlands
---
Big Blue Dress, by Cranius of course. Second would probably be those illegal Danish videos

It doesn't have to mean they're "listening to us".It simply means they're doing good stuff.

---
The issue with Ion in retail isn't him lying, it's people not agreeing with what he says for retail design decisions.
---
Exactly this.
---
Game developers should stop caring about constantly handholding any new players from the tutorial up to the end game.
---
Dark Souls was and still is the embodiment of a type of game where to gain the experience needed to continue you must first make mistakes over and over again.
---
Everyone who played it will never forget its first \*"tutorial"\* part. 
---
In that sense it was the total opposite of the current game industry behaviour and had a huge success.
---
Nowadays we know Vanilla Wow was mainly thought as a more "casual" way to play the game (that back then was even harsher (e.g. Runescape etc...) but compared to present-day standards it's still high in the ranking regarding that fact.
---
Dark Sould had hidden lore that you could discover just by playing the game, and so Vanilla/Classic too since many quests have some bits of azeroth history that can shine under a different light if you didn't know they were there in the first place.
---
If there's still so much potential in a 15yo game, can you imagine how much it will be if the game industry adopt again this  way to make games?I can only dream so much but I'm still hoping it will happen sooner or later, cause we need a cultural \*gaming\* shock in my opinion based on the \*"hard fought, well deserved"\* that was so common during the games of the past.
---
P.S: I'll post this thread on the official forum too then, thanks for your feedback on it
---
Okay. But these layers have a finite amount of players that can be in them. If more than whatever number fits in a layer are all on Eastern Kingdoms then there is now layers 1 &amp; 2 in the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
So what happens then?
---
Because it's still a massive split to server community. Not only will I not get to see or play with Jim but I won't even know he exists.
---
like so [pic](http://www.nationtech.com.my/custom/home/productpage/hyundaicorp/img/15crt.jpg)
---
If I were single, I wouldnt be able due to being a student and increased bills that I didnt have a few months ago. But thankfully I got a GF and split the bills.
---
Playing back then doesn't entitle you to play now.
---
Being a programmer myself, I think it would make the most sense to have layers defined by the amount of players in a starting zone. Once the current layer reaches some maximum average number of players, start all new characters on another layer. This ensures that players stick with other players that they meet during the first few levels. A few weeks later, when the population becomes more stable, you merge the layers into one.
---
This makes the most sense to me given my understanding of the problem. The problem being that they do not want overpopulated starting zones on launch. The issues with this approach seem to only occur in a permanent layering solution, which is what blizz said they would not do.
---
oooh i dont know them. my second would me Pat PVP.
---
Even on a pvp server you are safe to remain unflagged inside a city if you choose to. So long as you have been outside a contested zone for a few minutes of course
---
Tanaris! Slaying pirates all day long :-)
---
I share your opinion regarding cataclysm. I don't like the overhauled zones.
---
Tipsout claims it starts at 11am EST

---
Mine shows April 2006
---
Rogue is better solo, warrior with a pocket healer is more dominant overall
---
No, because other people will be joining our community too, and their bug hunting will be just as valuable. This beta is not to test balance.
---
Do most people have to give an actual reason for taking time off?  I just tell people "I'm not going to be here" and that's it.  Usually they'll ask if I have plans and I just say "I'll figure something out." and leave it at that.  It's none of their business how I use my time off.
---
How about ... we wait more than 1 day past the reveal of Layering until we get out the pitchforks? Blizzard will elaborate in time.
---
They have said in the past that this beta will be pretty small, you probably won't be invited no matter what.
---
Because there isn't one
---
You posted this here **and** on the forums? Jesus man.
---
as a guy that plays exclusively female characters (I feel I have a valid reason at least) fite me
---
This is a good way to farm rank 14 on phase 2 btw.
---
It would be prestigious still because you need to level fast and get gold to get it before they are removed.
---
Still got my physical copy right here :)
---
We don't know, their wording was vague as fuck.
---
Needing a sub to be eligible for an invite in the first place is a mega cash grab which is more likely sadly.
---
If I could get an invite without an active sub then decide to sub that would be a better option. I am not subbing to play lootbox for the invite.
---
Naja ich hab mich quasi dazu gezwungen weil ich 1x täglich meine Meinung geändert hab... Jetzt überleg ich halt die ganze Zeit was mein erster Twink werden soll\^\^

Alright, thanks bud
---
Get the tinfoil hat boys!
---
As layering is full continent as one, sharding could be said to be zone based layering. Meaning instead of making a full continent every time a player cap is hit (and maybe splitting up ppl into those two at times they wont notice it), you are just making 200 copies of elwyn forrest, while theres still only 1 Eastern plaguelands.
---
Layering keeps is consistent to those players in that same layer, you can chase a player half away the world and he doesnt disappear. In sharding going over a zone map border that guy could just be in a different shard and disappear from your screen.
---
alright I got carried away as my initial statement was about faerie and recklessness not stacking. I do apologize for going on this goose chase here
---
so starting from scratch
---
the base is 615, the bonus estimated is 99 due to the bloodthirst formula. (100 str \* 1,1 (kings) at 2 atp per str = 220. Bloodthirst using 45 % so estimated paper damage increase is 99 - not 90. 
---
He/she is a human so there are no dmg multipliers in affect. The final difference is just 85. Therefore the mitigation is 1- 85/99 which is 14,X %
---
Which is the number I've been using for the sunder + fairy stacking statement all along. I just don't get it why you are calculating the estimated bonus at 90 as that was really throwing me off here. Again apologies for that
---
my point is unrelated to that video. recklessness as minor armor recution doesn't stack with faerie (as both are minor armor reduction effects) if both are active only the 640 of recklessness are active. I would never claim that minor armor reduction effects don't stack with major (sunder armor or a rogues expose) as I've stated we got a confirmation from that as a reply to the outcry about the recklessness removal with wotlk
---
My claim was that from 1.8 onwards that all minor would no longer stack with each other (hence the reminder for people that bonereaver's was changed with 1.10 as it's debuff was useless after the 1.8 patch and it caused quite a lot of drama back in the days)
---
Lol how will their bug hunting not be as valuable?  You are clueless.
---
Well we're talking about these specific wolves in the example. There are plenty of other killable mobs besides those wolves. I didn't mean leave the entire starting zone. Also you should be able to find plenty of people to group with to tackle some higher level mobs
---
Mine goes back to my 10 day guest pass in 2005
---
Layering is supposed to effectively go away a few weeks after launch. Trade won't even be an issue because no one is going to have any money to spend.
---
Thats kind of the whole point of this post... aggregating the questions we have and acknowledging we don't have all the info.
---
I guess that's how BFA works sadly
---
This image is not claiming Phase 1 lasts 3 weeks. It's claiming that after 3-12 weeks, populations may approach levels that would only require 1 layer. So layering will technically exist if necessary, but may not actually be needed. It's important to understand that these layer caps are caps on the number of players on at a given time, not on the number of characters created. Every time you log in, it will check if there's less than 3k players on - if so, it will place you in the same layer as everyone. If for example it's peak time and there's 5k players on, it will probably split everyone into 2 layers.
---
Ya, off tank and off heals are 100% guaranteed to be needed, and a boon to any group. Be versatile. Be different. 
---
Just Heal It. ✅
---
Nah you quit in tbc while ive been playing since tbc
---
We just thought we did, but we didn't.
---
No one remembers vanilla perfectly, but people who played back then sure as hell remember it better than people who literally never played it.
---
Thanks, enjoy =)
---
I would be okay with flying in TBC if they nerfed the living fuck out of it, but I'd rather have TBC without it.  I truly think it was a main contributor in the downfall of world PvP.
---
Yeah i was expecting that haha. Gunna hurt. Thanks for the reply pal
---
But I can blink out of a net. Sheep one, frag the other, which is way less epic that some other people do batching a pull with multiple mobs.
---
And isn't the best spot above the arena?
---
I booked two days off and told my boss exactly what for, she said to report back to her on what the game is like!
---
Yeah the hype will be cool for the first few hours, until you've been playing for 5 hours straight and are only level 6 because you can't tag a mob or complete a quest.
---
Never. Every Wednesday till launch.
---
Nah I'm the same. If I want to take time off and I *can*, I just say I'm going to take time off and leave it at that. No one else decides what I do and can do at my own free time.
---
I guess this thread is more about you *wanting* to take time off but you can't since you haven't accumulated enough hours to take a leave, so you have to ask permission to take a day off at the cost of the company being willing to give up your working power.
---
or something.
---
Tbh the odds of getting in first wave in a small beta is so tiny, it's good they give streamers access so people can at least watch if they are hyped about it. I don't think it's disgusting at all, it promotes the game and gives visibility to others.
---
I mean it’s only school.
---
Let’s say you’re taking 15 credits, that’s only 30 hours a week even if following the “equal time out of class studying as you spend in class” rule.
---
It only really gets tough with a job for 20+ hours on top of that. (But even still 50-60 hours a week is pretty normal for career jobs)
---
GF/Friends/Other activities are on you as they occupy the same priority as WoW.
---
Make all the fancy graphs you'd like but this still essentially separates players who are on the same realm.  There is not only one Fargodeep Mine, there are how many?  All these players that are in the mine but you can't see, how does that emulate a true MMORPG experience?  Will we even be able to see chat from these other layers?  What if you are trying to do a group quest and a Tank that ones to do it is in layer 1, the healer in layer 2 and DPS all over in different layers, will they even know each other exist?  Remember when there was a single server and you had to fight against other players for mobs/tags?  I do and it was glorious.  Now we all have to be the same.
---
*Pay us 15 bucks a month to have a 0.00000000001% chance of a beta invite*
---
Yeah, no thanks
---
It shouldn't be a feeling. It should've been spelled out in the post itself. The ambiguity needs to be removed.
---
XD
---
Blizzard should set it up so you can only change layers in certain areas of main cities. Thinking like stormwind cathedral or the drag in org. That way you can freely change layers to join friends but you don't see people dodging ganks or phasing in and out when they join groups outside cities
---
No cap if you pay the sub.
---
In Modern WoW, I believe you can play til 20 totally free, not purchasing the game not paying the sub fee. If you pay the sub, you can level past 20 and play through all non-BfA content. For BfA, you need to buy the BfA expansion. 
---
For Classic, I haven’t heard anything about free to play up to certain levels. There is no base game purchase. To play the game in general, pay the WoW sub and you get Classic.
---
Maybe Classic will require a separate, additional subscription to play (in addition to the bfa sub) so they are wanting to get the bfa players hooked on both for double subs?
---
Loch Modan, always thought it was one of the zones that was worst because of the Cataclysm. I am looking forward to being murdered by Threshadon and the hunting lodge quests. Plus the dam being back to its former glory will be great! I always loved the elite quests they had out there with those orge and dark iron mobs. I am quite excited.
---
My only concern with classic was that I was afraid to spend hundreds of hours into my new char on a server that after 6 months was dead. I'm so happy they did this.
---
maybe im surprised they would want to encourage retail players to beta test classic
---
like do they not want people interested in classic playing.
---
if i was happy with retail i would not give a shit about testing classic
---
Im more concerned with how players were upset about sharding in the starting zones was gonna be done and blizzs answer was to shard the whole game. Either they dont give a fk about their players or they are playing some 3d chess atm and are going to back us into sharding for the beginning zones using layering as the "well at least its not layering" feeling.
---
If you add all your stupid reactions like this one, I'm sure you waste much more time than him.
---
&gt;American net income is very good compared to most of Europe.
---
Well, I guess America is way more equal across the states than Europe is across countries.
---
&gt;Norway is about the only euro country that I’d consider to not be outright worse for what I want from a job.
---
I am curious as to what you do? Looking up average wages Europe have quite a few countries with similar or better wages than Norway. I'm from Denmark and the average wages are around 44000 USD a year, quite a bit above America.
---
There could be bugs that might not be as obvious for those who didn't play Vanilla. Not clueless at all.
---
How about those who didn't play Vanilla but have been on private servers for the past few years? (I know Pservers are different in some things, but for the sake of argument).
---
Blizzard has already said anyway that account age and sub length already play into their invite process, so playing in Vanilla probably does boost your chances.
---
yes
---
that poor bastard deserves a case of beer after today
---
Yea smart idea, learn your class in a dungeon with 4 other people having to put up with it rather than just questing and learning your class there. That seems like a great idea and other players will love you for it.
---
That's not how it works. The domain was created in 2005, doesn't mean it was Blizzard who created it. The important date is the "Updated" one, from Feb 2019
---
Yeah, it can cut it in half, but thats still going to mean like 500-1000 ppl in human/undead start zones.
---
Thats literally the polar opposite of what youre saying
---
they didn't get squat yet
---
Opened doors that shouldn't have been there to begin with. Flying was a big mistake in my eyes. They could have just as easily made those areas accessable by ground mount. And I didn't find the cost too steep at the time as I had (if memory serves) 7kish gold going into tbc. On my server (PvP) people used flying as a way to avoid conflict. I understand it's a personal opinion but I won't play tbc unless flying is disabled.
---
Damnit Ken!!!
---
It's literally a different engine than classic was, and you're making some serious assumptions by gatekeeping that someone who didn't play Vanilla is incapable of finding and reporting a bug.
---
Get off your miniature pony.
---
I refuse to believe that you actually feel like people who played back in vanilla will be better at finding bugs. Just admit that you feel entitled and want to be a special boi so you are deciding to play as gatekeeper.
---
He asked for help and didnt like the answer.  He just wants to play the beta.  Tell him he will definitely get a key and then we can move on with our lives
---
I think this is bringing attention to the fact that there are more active users in the Classic channel then the retail channel. The sub numbers will increase for classic and drop for retail.
---
What if I told you ganking you was my favorite part? How could you deny me this simple pleasure, don't be so selfish man
---
$15/month. You can get gold in Live WoW to pay for your subscription, which covers Classic WoW. Classic WoW gold won't contribute to your subscription in any way.
---
15$ and theres no in game tokens
---
Im F&amp;F aswell pretty sure its random still tough
---
So what, large guilds will find a layer without a large population?  Meaning they soak up the lotus on that layer, instead of soaking up all the lotus for the entire server because there are no layers?
---
This is also assuming that there's no mechanism for balancing populations between layers.
---
Some bugs will be reportable by anyone, but the biggest issues on the demo (for example) were things that didn't match up with actual vanilla. Players who have no vanilla experience wouldn't even be able to recognize those things as bugs.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
[here](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=371) at 6:11 if the timestamp doesn't work for you.
---
Oh I agree with you. I just don't find the claims of others being really hesitant about this system unwarranted that's all. I think they still have probable cause regarding retail to be very hesitant about this type of system. Slippery slope and all that. I am very proud of what the classic team has done which is leaning more and more each day to have faith in them, but I completely understand those that want to stay cautious and keep it close to vanilla as possible and deal with realm repercussions when it gets to that point.
---
Same hahaha
---
my account was created in 2004 nov and have subbed from then since now even when i didnt play.    so i'll let you know if the "old accounts and sub longer get in" bs   because i'm pretty sure it will be friends and family + streamers for atleast a month.  most streamers already have the classic beta loaded on the launcher since yesterday.
---
It is included in the 'normal', retail World of Warcraft Subscription
---
Can’t forget the Sewer backdoor for sylvanas, tb is the hardest I would think.
---
still sounds like a fun epic once in a lifetime experience to me but I totally get people not being into that idea
---
Your lack of common sense is amazing
---
The red trail when you charge was in classic lmao
---
I think we can assume AH will be shared, as will Trade chat. General chat may go either way but with sharding now, it's unique to your shard. Mob spawns will of course be unique to your layer.
---
So much this but barely any people seem to oppose the sub turning into a literal loot box.
---
There's certainly an influx of new posts at least, not in a good way though
---
The what if runs both ways, they are doing the best they can with the information given to them. They either go with limited sharding and merge low pop servers or go with layering and be forced to split large servers. The outcome in the end would be the same and people would dislike both outcomes regardless.
---
Warlock doesn't have a buff to give. Do need to hand out healthstones in raid possibly. Good dps, pet tank for easy leveling.
---
Hunter is the easiest leveling. Not the best dps in raid, but you said casual side. And they are fine to bring until you get to aq40/naxx. Even then I think a few are brought anyway for utilities.
---
Those are both ranged options. For melee, rogue really probably is your best bet I think. Kitty can work, but needs lots of effort from what I hear. Ret stinks. Can't go enhance shaman or warrior.
---
"Mehr Arbeit?" - German Peon (probably)
---
Thats what noses are meant for
---
so we're not allowed to complain unless we're not gonna play classic?
---
Seems silly to punish the 99% of legitimate reasons to want to transfer servers just so we can "police" the 1% cases of bad ninja looting.
---
Most ninja looting is done in 5 mans and someone gripes about it in chat for a minute then it's forgotten about. The only ninja looting that would even cause someone to feel like they needed to transfer would be like ninja looting a guild bank or something and that's a pretty rare occurrence.
---
Do you have a source for those claims
---
You raised some great points here. Hope we get answers soon.
---
The later half of the post contains evidence for FF + sunder + CoR all stacking using horde player on chromaggus (hence it's 90 not 99, because horde don't have kings).
---
Blizzard could have elaborated yesterday when they announced this, instead they chose to give us the information filtered through some 3rd party quasi celebrities.  
---
If the pitchforks are out, Blizzard only has themselves to blame.
---
I'd like to know how they are going to be filled.  Does the next one not start filling until the last one is full?  Does that mean then that I could get stuck on a layer with only a few hundred people or could I be the only character on a layer?
---
Or just don't be an idiot and keep your pvp tag off
---
Yes it does but thats only because they use it to equalize zone population to avoid them being empty on low pop servers. In Classic they are trying to do the opposite: prevent zones from being overpopulated.
---
I loved me some Deadmines, and considered the same thing as you (subbing to Modern and messing around until Classic release). I subbed a year ago because I had missed it. The dungeons were indeed boring. All heirlooms, no gear really needed. No one spoke. No real tactics or roles, just blitz through everything why are you stopping to loot that hurry up go go go go.
---
I don’t recommend it, as frustrating as the wait may be.
---
I mean.. it was stated that this beta is for a very small audience of active players so they can work out any bugs/issues by having experienced players get invited. They're going to do a much more open stress test soon so I wouldn't say it's entirely a cash grab, but a targeted audience beta to make the game as good as possible for its release.
---
What classes have the most survivability in pvp? And im not talking about being a rogue &amp; just running away, i mean able to take a lot of damage but also being able to kill just as well.
---
couldn't you avoid dhk's by just not being in the raid group?
---
exactly.
---
I think the classic community would swallow server merges much better than they would sharding/layering and mucking about with the servers.
---
Lol? Join the real world, every day is shit timing for people with jobs. 
---
I played SO MUCH MORE WOW in college than I have the ability to do now. 
---
College kids need to grow the fuck up and learn an ounce of time management
---
&gt; The alternative being to do monotonous braindead leveling content from 2-12 years ago that scales with your level. 
---
The world has always scaled to your level because you go to zones that have similar level mobs to you because you can't level anywhere else.
---
I think it would be nice if instead of releasing an expansion to the existing server, they make a BC classic server and offer a free transfer to it for any level 60 character that wants to move on to BC. That way others can stay on classic if they want.
---
I don't understand
---
You talk about it as if you are going to be switching layers 10 times an hour. You are not. Most people will not even switch layers when playing through the levels normally.
---
Opposition is good. Hating something and still doing it willingly, quite different.
---
You have to get to the arena.   I know, you can pot, or cloak.  I'm just saying harder.  Which you agree with.
---
Blizzards own homepage about it says this.
---
What's up with this random assumption that one layer will be perfect for every realm in the end? Will ever realm's population naturally converge to 3k? It's only reasonable to assume that some realms will be the popular ones and still have 12-15k people months after launch and still be layered at that point.
---
They said very clearly you’ll be in a layer with the same players, unless grouping switches you to a new layer in which case you stay there.  I think the proper inference is that when merging happens it’ll be clusters of players on the same layer, do even if you go to a new layer it’s within the same community you’ve already existed in.
---
I know how this system works and it will be abused until it is removed. People who defend it can't see beyond "muh smooth launch".
---
This, let's go 4k people on launch with no dynamic respawn whatsoever and constant server crashes with queues just like the vanilla launch which never went down this way.
---
Literally the announcement from blizz. Problem is it redirects me to the german one :
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/de-de/news/22990080
---
All i can supply you with :D
---
This was in Vanilla, people already did it.
---
I don't like Phasing or any form of splitting up people on one server.
---
With that said, this is he best option we got for a smooth launch/levelling experience. No upped spawns and no Phasing in and out (too much). Just see it as two fresh servers that merge when the initial influx leaves.
---
It seems to me that from a player perspective layering will feel like a server merge.
---
Yeah, its really pathetic that they invite Wrathbabies and such just because they have a shitty Stream.
---
But it's not going to be on forever?
---
As Horde player I used that entrance for nearly a week before I found the 'proper' entrance.
---
Will you pay for a babysitter for me so I can play? I can afford the subscription just fine but three kids, two below two, doesn't give me much time to play.
---
Quality childcare should only cost about $40 an hour in this area, and 5 hours per evening should be enough time to play and enjoy classic.
---
And according to some redditor's logic, might as well be released on cata
---
Nah... Lol.
---
At this point why not just do zone phasing? Like we already are going to have 8 separate worlds on the "same server" but the population will not be evenly spread among each layer. Winterspring might be super populated on layer 1,3 and 6 but is basically dead in 2, 4 and 5 yknow? Why create a whole new world when it would basically just be random who has better access to resources? Why not balance it by zone?  
---
I think what gets me the most is that at this point saying that these characters are even on the same server just because they can group if they want to and trade is hogwash. This is just retail sharding but we can also trade. This time they didn't name each "layer" something different, instead of each "layer" getting a new name (like they do servers) each layer will be like Kazzak-1 Kazzak-2 Kazzak-3 and these people may as well not exist to each other outside of the auction house and trade chat. You cannot see if someone else on your server is doing a quest you may need help with because they are invisible to you as they are essentially on a different server. Sure you could invite them but how would you know to invite them? Many are saying general chat wont be shared among "layers" so unless you somehow magically know that there is someone looking for that quest specifically at the same time you are it is basically impossible to ever group with them. This is like they are making each server more fluid, they are sacrificing gameplay integrity for perceived longevity or maybe just less work in the long run.  
---
I'd rather have somebody I cant trade with than somebody I cannot even see.
---
Personal Flair?
---
It's 1 million inactive, passive users vs 100k active, engaged, and passionate users.
---
Cute Kid, I had a Rank13 and two Rank11's in Vanilla and even played the Closed Beta in 2004.
---
I played in vanilla but I’m on my 3rd account. I have no way to verify that I played in vanilla. This is gatekeeping and not inclusive.
---
These private servers also did not use the best hardware available because of the price, and it worked really good anyways.
---
Game CE don't get out of stock on day 1 and have worldwide releases. You can go to your local store and reserve your copy or even just go on day one and grab it. They have limited runs, yes, but I don't think comparing them is fair.
---
For mounts? Or pets? Either can have either... :D
---
I could be wrong, but I believe everyone has a base stun resistance (5%???) and this increases that amount -- additive -- to 30%. From everywhere I read, it is a big deal in PvP.
---
(it was also eventually nerfed in TBC because it was so strong)
---
Whats the difference, in the eyes of you playing your character, of someone logging off and back in again to get a different layer, vs someone logging onto a different character?
---
The immersion from your perspective is the exact same.  A character was there, then they disappeared after getting ganked.
---
They were great for my first character. It is true they take off later with gear, but do you really care if you aren't great dps in MC.  Raids will be a pushover until aq40. So your deeps really are not hugely important. Locks have a solid set if spots in the raid group. They also level and farm easily. They provide healthstones and some CC in raids/dungeons. Fun in pvp. I'm biased since lock has off and on been my main since vanilla, but enjoyed being one back then.
---
Oh well🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Do you not understand why layering is already significantly better than sharding, though? You know they're very different things? If they've figured this out then there's no *need* to go back to sharding. This is a whole-world, high player layer, not a per-zone, low player shard. You will barely notice. You'll still have to fight hundreds of people in Northshire for wolves.
---
Just the sub.
---
No, it's literally just a different deployment of the sharding tech. They are creating more than one version of the same game-space, but instead of aggressively sharding zones they are going to shard an entire continent when it goes over the capacity that a typical Vanilla server would have been at (likely the same threshold we'd  have where we'd see log-in queues). 
---
Not to put it in a negative light, but let's recognize what it is. It's just a different form of sharding tech.
---
I don't remember the name of the creator, but one guy made a bunch of video's using WoW set to Jonathan Coulton songs, like "I feel fantastic" and "Chiron Beta Prime" and many many more.   At work so I can't look them up right now, but they were great.
---
I would think internet is a luxury as public libraries exist where one could go for pc and internet use and if needed and I would question how a homeless person would have a cell.
---
I do get the point now, OP would like to share the fun with people who can't justify spending that money when it could be of better use elsewhere? I still don't like how a person could reach that level of thinking and lack of funds but its possible.
---
Playing BFA currently, have played the game since vanilla. Only expansion I fully skipped was Cata. 
---
It's far from my least favorite iteration of the game right now.
---
I don’t see the problem with this. It’s also weighing tenure - I’d rather one beta invite go to someone who still plays and has for years, rather than some dude who quit in Cata and only gives somewhat of a shit about Classic now that it’s a big thing
---
Well to be fair some of that was because people just want classic to be as best as it possibly can. And fuck Blizzard actually listened and changed the phases from 4 to 6 and added spell batching and some progressive itemization, all good for the game. Sure some people are dicks about things, but some of us just want classic to be great.
---
Thing is, should we really care if hardcore players can get a head start like this? Casuals will never be able to catch up with hardcore players. Hardcore players are hardcore because they are willing to invest the time and energy to be the best. This divide is what made early WoW so great. If you were willing to put in the time you could be better than some scrub who only logs on during the weekends. 
---
The only problem with layering is that it gives hardcore players an opportunity to gather resources ever quicker than they would with no layering. I don't think this is a real problem, though.  It only becomes a problem if a lot of players end up doing this and I do not see that happening. You will need to be in a discord with a bunch of other hardcore players monitoring layers and then have someone in another layer accepting group invites. This is only something that someone who is willing to invest fuckton of time in the game can do. Hardcore players like this are always a minority and you always need a small group of elite players to keep things interesting.
---
Only need to pay the $15 a month. No need to purchase anything more.
---
Amsterdam? Lots of people remember how things were supposed to work.
---
You say we lack passion?   Dude.  It's been 15.  We aren't bored.   We loved that game.
---
More like *gets a space gray iPhone for Christmas*
---
I ASKED FOR A ROSE GOLD iPHONE!
---
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?!
---
*sniff*
---
*entitled sob*
---
I would agree with you but I think the idea is ultimately to have this happen during launch/an over abundance of people in that server, no? 
---
As in human starting zone has 10 layers, Alwyn has 8 westfall has 6, etc until everyone is on the same layer as leveling evens out and population evens out. This is how I'm interpreting anyway, as wrong as I may be. 
---
I can still see basic layering shenanigans happening on the top end, but I don't think it'll be that extreme at end levels.
---
Same! Ahh, the joys of being new to WoW
---
You‘re deliberately misrepresenting the problem. You will see ONLY players on your server for the first few weeks of leveling, then you will see everyone on your server. It is literally just not true that you will „not see 50% of your server at all times.“ if the dissipation of the playerbase will happen so quickly, then why be worried about layering? They will turn it off after a week. Will that „kill the community?“ Do you people think you are gonna be progression raiding in Westfall or something? Gonna kill a world-boss in Duskwallow Marsh?
---
Another big question is: what do they do if the server is too big? Say there is a realm that is extremely popular, with like 20K people. During the layering phase this is fine, because you just have tons of layers. But eventually you have to condense these layers into one layer to have just one version of the server. So what do they do, if one server doesn’t die down in population? Do they split the server up, and make more servers for each layer? Do they just make a massive que to log into this server? If they do split the server how do they decide who goes where?
---
I hate sharting
---
seriously can't believe these people are so gullible
---
remember when sharding was gonna be a 2 weeks thing only on starting zones?
---
now we have this sharding 2.0 for one month in every area, what's next then lol
---
I mean you're right, there are other killable mobs other than the wolves in the starting zone. If we're talking about the human starting area,lfor example, we're probably talking boars and defias and kobolds as well. However if you've got 300+ people crammed into Northshire, even if they are all grouped up, that's still 60 groups of people roaming around killing shit (at a reduced xp gain so they have to kill more). And with say, a 40 second respawn timer on a mob, I'm just worried that it's going to take way, way too long to level past the first few levels.
---
Sitting there for hours on end waiting to try and tag a mob isn't the experience i was looking forward to in classic to be honest. In fact, if we're being technical, it would be more "authentic" if they severely limited population in the starting zones because there was never that many people in them during the first few weeks in classic wow. It's a difficult problem.
---
We all might need one. Did they ever say what time the invites would roll out?
---
Personal flair? If so, I see a bunch of blank pip boxes to choose from.
---
This is the perfect exampkle of how ridicolous classes get when they get to end game gear. Prep premed rogues with a 2.8 MH is crazy with 1k+ AP
---
I don’t think it’s for them either. Vanilla is not and shouldn’t be seen through an esports/ MMR/global ranking lens. It’s about server community.
---
And there’s nothing “brave” about queueing against a larger player pool.
---
But I can just play on pve and not get involved ;)
---
What if they made it so you could only switch layers in a capital city? That'd eliminate most people's concerns about camping nodes and mobs. Flight paths are extremely slow in vanilla so it wouldn't be very time efficient to fly to and back from a city.
---
Oh I know, which is why I meant, we are stronger.
---
Why would you want to? People who think that will actually be a widespread problem are delusional. This is one of the exact reasons people play vanilla, the world PvP, and you suddenly think people will avoid it at all costs? Come the fuck on.
---
It’s still higher TPS dude
---
I expect they'll have *some* kind of solution to that. Reason being that in the tipsout interview they gave an example of a "negative gameplay impact" of overcrowding being "not having any gnolls to kill." They said that they will avoid that experience.
---
(This was attached to a question about the lag that happens in large group fights on retail.)
---
How do you know Onyxia wasn't staged?
---
Arizona actually sucks ass everywhere but Flagstaff during the summer. 
---
I turned into a night walking creeper the summer I stayed there between semesters. If I wasn’t working I would sleep during the day to avoid the heat, then be awake at night so I wouldn’t stew in my own sweat.
---
Thanks, at least there are some people here who havent snorted sharding/layering and hates on everyone who oppose it.
---
I mean, I am. I dont hate it. I just like Classic better.
---
They will because he doesn't know the standards around the world. I'm from Bulgaria and i can tell you that for a teenager here 13€ are a bit more than for west Europe but far from impossible. The boy that he is helping each parent makes at least 500€ a month.
---
OH shit did not know that! Sorry bro!
---
You forgot one major and important thing.
---
"For the Horde!"
---
Alliance, need not apply.
---
You are allowed to complain, but games are supposed to be fun, hating it and still playing defeats the purpose and makes no sense imho, that's at least the perspective of this post.
---
Remove flying and I’ll play TBC
---
Everyone and their mother will be rolling everything. No class you choose will be the magic class that nobody plays. Don't worry about them. Play what's fun. If you can't find a guild to place you for raiding, I'd be surprised. But then you can also make your own.
---
going to be trash just like wow classic... personally i’m holding out for wow classic classic classic, now that’s gonna be a good game! going to leave my characters to my grandkids in my will. hopefully they continue on with my chars when we go into BCCCC
---
not that I agree with him or anything, but to respond to you I don't believe that anyone deserves anything. That being said the leveling experience is exceptionally slower and has been changed drastically than it is now of course. Considering the restrictions of time for testing before the August release date, assuming that they prioritize players that are familiar with that leveling experience and can test more content, more quickly. I would imagine those with this previous leveling experience are more lit  to stick with it until level 30 compared to someone who is just starting it out and it may not be a good fit for them. I do not think it is unreasonable to assume those who have experience in that environment would be preferred. Of course this is highly speculative, and in reality does not matter in the least bit. as they said in their post they would like to bring in members of many demographics, which is reasonable.
---
A cool, yet wildly annoying, mechanic.
---
Maybe they could have, but what's the rush? I'm not saying wait until August 26th to start asking questions about it, but at least give them a reasonable amount of time to flesh out the system. Blue posts happen all the time. I don't understand this petulant need for INSTANT gratification at your whim.
---
They know it's important. There are over 3 months until release. Calm down. You'll be told long before release.
---
# It has literally been one day. Calm. Down.

Going horde this time so I'm pretty excited for stonetalon and thousand needles. Northern barrens gets a shout at the border where it's mountains and pines.
---
Might be most remember better than I do. Still gatekeeping for no good reason.
---
Yes, recognized this too late. But doesn't matter, won't play a male hunter this time. So feel free to use the name if you want :-) 
---
I'll be aniFEmale this time haha
---
Im curious how does the transition happen when you are f.e. in the city in layer A and someone from layer B invites you. Does it instantly "teleport" you to layer B and you will see all characters from A around you disappear and new from B instantly appear? I can see there are 2 options, one i mentioned before and 2nd if the characters that invited you are not around you, it will get you to layer B gradually only like when you are f.e. on mount or when you zone to the instance and such... then it wouldnt be in my opinion too much "immersion" breaking
---
&gt;Like they confirmed it would come as it comes with warts and all right?
---
You are very welcome to give me a source from Blizzard where they talked about that. I'll be waiting.
---
&gt; Just like they also said sharding in the starting zones only.
---
And now there will be no sharding so that's great news to you I guess?
---
Not that I’m aware of but I’ve also been super busy the last 24 hours
---
Meh I work on 12 hours shift on rotation and I have 8 days off every 6 weeks so I have time to let go when I get to that break
---
Well they *are* messing up spell-batching. They are intentionally adding laggier server data handling to be more like vanilla.
---
It's like reducing the tickrate on fps servers so you have more kill-trading.
---
It means you actually get punished for being quicker with your spells when normally you'd gain an advantage.
---
Sure it's more like what vanilla was but if the vanilla devs could have had better networking they would have.
---
You had to have an active sub to play the Blizzcon demo, even if you paid the $50 for the livestream.
---
Are you serious? Isn't the point of Classic to bring back people who quit ages ago? 
---
I want to come back and they literally money and time barricaded me from it. From a damned Beta at that.
---
The majority of Retailers simply won't give a shit. They weren't the ones asking for Classic anyway. They are the worst group to throw invites at.
---
I wish I weren't, I'd be totally okay with the solution if it worked the way you describe it!
---
&gt; You'll still have to fight hundreds of people in Northshire for wolves.
---
Then what is the point, exactly? And don't say server pop - because that can be handled without implementing an anti-community and anti-wpvp game element.
---
Wowhead interview said that if you get invited in a group by someone who is not in same layer, you will switch to the same layer. You might also get another layer on reconnect.
---
They probably try to « force » the same layer for members of the same guild but still, you can play with someone else in another layer by joining him.
---
It’s really look like guild wars 2 channel system.
---
They don’t force your face to the floor?
---
Firstly, you didn't say shit about world bosses exclusively, retard. 
---
Second, it's like you think people won't talk on the server. World bosses being up was a huge event that people notice, no one is going to be upset that there are more people doing world bosses.
---
I think that's the biggest problem they have to overcome; that not everyone's idea of fun is the same and everyone wants something different out of their classic experience. So a solution that works for you may not work for me.
---
Only eye of the storm is confirmed atm.
---
Yes in phase 3
---
Strange, shows 2005 for both of mine. Got a friends account when he stopped playing.
---
Where is BILLY!
---
Where did you go to find that info? The layout of BNet changed and I couldn’t locate it beyond 2008 transaction data.
---
Enjoy hypertension buddy
---
Your right its actually worst then sharding. Instead of having 1.5 to 2x the pop on a server its gonna allow an infinitely scaling amount. The biggest problem with layering is that its essentially making faux servers expecting people to quit the game. If no one quits then guess what? Those faux servers are here for good.
---
The second reason its just strictly worse is its gonna ruin the economy on the server. Lets say a server has 4 layers then there is 4x the amount of mats, gear etc. When it gets scaled back down to 1 server (if it does) the market is going to be so flooded with rare mats its gonna crash the market price.
---
How is this better in any way shape or form?
---
Canvas Bag
---
If it was, they did a good enough job that it wasn't obvious, though I believed multiple people have confirmed that the leader was crazy like that every raid
---
bruh it's about the current storyline in wow
---
This is a gross oversimplification of the system.
---
Everyone can't just be in the same layer if they're either friends or in a guild together. That's impossible, it doesn't just "work" because you say it does.
---
Mark my words, you're going to see people phasing before your eyes during mid combat.
---
Check out Esfands video of his impressions of alpha/beta. He shows exactly what the problem is. 
---
Instant spells basically feel like they lag by .2/.4 seconds before they land. Which they do.
---
In vanilla, you would almost always get the text and hit immediately, but in cases where spells were batched, they were handled on the backend and not shown in the same way. 
---
As it is now, it just looks like hard lag, and given that we are used to playing online games with decent netcode, the whole spell batching thing will prove to be a huge mistake.
---
Because it’s fair.
---
Server groups wouldn't share a game world, so one guy can't jump from layer to layer (server to server) to get an advantage on leveling or obtaining resources. It also keeps the people that you see and level with as the same group consistentlty.
---
Vanilla wow is one game world, no cross realm, no instanced outdoor zones, no duplicate world bosses... Layering the entire continent is way more obtrusive than dealing with sharding for your first 4 hours of gameplay.
---
Joining a party in the basement of BRM to group up for BRD and watching people vanish around you as you phase is way more immersion breaking than phasing from Northshire 3 to 7.
---
on top of it - open the gate, kill fire elemental, open the door, hug the wall while moving up the stairs, watch patrolls and try to squeeze in.
---
I believe people will be unhappy and outraged regardless. If I had to choose I'd rather have layering than sharding or doing nothing and just merging it all later. The former is them actively trying while the latter two is sitting back and hoping for the best anf fixing it if it is not. So one week I could be questing in a world with 10 people then get merged into a high pop wait for respawn in a line server only for us to get merged again if x amount of people quit after a month. I don't think theres a good solution to any of this but they sure are trying for one.
---
You are amazing!
---
Of course I am, sorry you’re so insecure and taken aback by it.
---
You probably don’t really care about the game anymore. Remember that there’s an opt-in - do you think the average BFA casual a) realizes that and b) has done so? Do you think the opt-in page is just there as a placebo effect?
---
This isn’t just *your* game. People want to see how much its changed. And a company is going to try to accommodate its customers.
---
not wow classic, it's for bfa.
---
for those wondering tldr: thrall has been gone for like 2 xpacs and is now coming back.
---
Ion already explained all this. They want as few servers as possible with a high population cap. This is so that after the initial buzz dies down, the tourists leave and some people get bored, each server still has a decent population.
---
So what happens when you open a 10k+ population server with no layering? Chaos. Instead of 150 people in Northshire, which is crazy but manageable and still fun, you have 1000, and suddenly the game becomes borderline unplayable at the start. Some people want that because they think it's "authentic vanilla" even though vanilla wasn't like that, it didn't have huge realms. So layering will actually end up making the experience closer to vanilla IN THAT REGARD.
---
Except it's a BfA cinematic
---
Dissapointed that quest items aren't being dynamically spawned. I'm yet to meet one person who said queueing for 2 hours to loot an item with a 5m respawn time was part of the vanilla experience they enjoyed.
---
Well lists are big, but if you his brother, you should prob. just sign a NDA and join every Test. That is how they did it before.
---
Pretty biased graph, mentions no cons of layer solution.
---
Yeah it's not Classic related.
---
Less than 22 months before launch.  The 27th month in 2019., this gonna be my longest year so far, usually its only 12 months in a year.
---
Gotta grab as many vets as possible for obvious reasons but others can help. &lt;--- Best
---
Some background on me
---
I've been playing since Vanilla but didn't hit level 60 before TBC came out. I've mained hunter for every expansion up until BFA, and only changed because I absolutely love the mobility of playing Havoc DH. 
---
As far as raids, I have always been a pretty solid player when I've been part of a serious group. In TBC, when I was very serious, I got up to Illidan before 2.4 hit. I joined a more serious guild in WOTLK and even scored a top 10 US kill on Freya in Ulduar. After Ulduar I got burnt out and didn't raid seriously again until HFC. Nowadays I only play weekends and dont really enjoy BFA enough to raid seriously. 
---
As far as PVP, I love playing BGs and hit 1800+ in 2s, 3s and 5s back in WotLK but I haven't done any serious PVP since. 
---
My first reaction was that I would play hunter in Vanilla, although I heard that the class wasnt THAT useful in endgame raiding. I'm not sure it matters, because while I think I could be a Naxx raider, I'm employed and married and dont have enough time for a serious raiding schedule. I also am not really sure what the rotation is, I really enjoy a smooth rotation that focuses on smart decision making with little downtime when DPSing (and not spamming 1 button for 8 minutes). I wouldn't mind something that's difficult as I'll have 60 levels to learn. 
---
The other things I've considered are Druid (probably main feral and be willing to both DPS and Tank), rogue or Warlock. 
---
I've never particularly enjoyed priest or warrior at any point in the time I've been playing. Mage is not totally out of the picture although I've never loved it. I've never played shaman in my life so I have no clue about how the class works in Vanilla and more or less the same goes for Paladin.
---
Yeah I guess so. I mean F&amp;F at least gurantee you access to new Addons, onn the first 3 weeks or so but yeah.
---
There is no point. Ppl just want an easier experience lvling.
---
Na, I did most of Vanilla already (4hm) so Im not keen on doing it again.
---
Wow, thank you - I had no idea.
---
So it is basically a different server with x realm trading? That they will eventually just merge anyway? That you can invite your friends to like you can on retail? I see this as the same thing as regular sharding only slightly more limited. Like retail sharding can take someone from potentially any server in your region but this sharding will only take people from a small group of servers that they are pretending are really the same server and just calling them "layers". And upon some research about retail sharding specifics it looks like unless someone is specifically invited from another realm then the general sharding is basically limited to only a handful of servers. I just feel like calling it "layering" is blizzard being intentionally deceptive and confusing.
---
&gt; At least take a cursory look at it before criticizing please.
---
I did. I saw a reference video with particular quests. Gadgetzan Water Survey granted 4,300xp instead of 3,050.
---
&gt;Guide is not 1:1 with videos.
---
Then why have videos to reference? Especially if they don't match the guide?
---
While classic WoW is more grindy than the current version, it was still an MMO for the casual audience when it was created so it's much less grindy than most MMOs.
---
Close... Dwarf Priest holding a staff.
---
if there are 5*normal server population and 5*normal resources, shouldn't it even out?
---
Also a day 1 account, haven't been subbed since 2011... but I have also gotten into every WoW beta since then. I paid for a month last night just in case, so crossing fingers.
---
The mental gymnastics these posts are going through to justify layering (sharding) is impressive.
---
Do you just accept everything in your life at face value? Do you never push for what you want in your life? Do you sit idly by when you see a stranger in public having some kind of medical problem? Do you do nothing when you see someone being bullied in public? 
---
Sounds like you do.
---
Then you just switch layer =(
---
It was actually from TBC onward, but the PvP videos from a Ret Paladin named Kamil are, to this day, the funniest WoW videos I've ever watched, while also showcasing some legitimate PvP skill. He has them uploaded on his YT channel, and I highly recommend them (particularly 1 through 3).
---
Did you get the statue for being subbed since 2004?
---
&gt;I hate the thought that the classic leveling experience is going to be a massive multi-layered 10k population server where you have little chance of running into the same leveling players day to day.
---
I think this is more of a fear than a certainty. If the 10k population is split between A) 2 continents, and then later layers that are intended to house a "server-like population" than there would in theory be only a few layers per server, thus you would probably have a reasonable chance to see the same people again while leveling. Sharding is far more aggressive in how it splits up populations, plus the leveling issue in retail is also tied to how little people care about leveling and how they blaze through it. Not to mention the other issue is that people in the retail shards are often not from your realm, making it more unlikely you'll see them again. This too is not the case for Classic's solution.
---
I think everyone generally knows that. If I remember correctly when they first announced the closed beta, it was for staff and their families.
---
Is this /r/ClassicBetaBugReports now?
---
One of the interviews posted on YouTube yesterday
---
You don't have to sub till it is released, they do not require you to be in the beta. If you want to play the beta you can sub for a chance, but no one is making you. Gl Hf may the Blizzard Beta gods be forever in your favor.
---
Yea a shame, didnt have my authenticator to log in. Just calling Game stop everyday , they have the SKU for it but not available yet
---
How long does Blizard expect it to take for the population to drop from 8 to 3k.
---
So it worse than we ever thought? If layer 1 hits the cap and I get assigned to layer 2 I'm here fully solo no one at all near me unless someone else then logs in? What if someone logs out of layer 1 will I stay in layer 2? Or phase out? Will the layers have resource cap? Will they have faction caps? If I'm one of the 6 players in layer 2 and 6 people leave layer 1 will I sneak up the glass and enter layer 1 with the other 6 guys? Or will it only be fresh log ins? Why would fresh log ins go to layer 1 if there are not enough People for a healthy community in layer 2?
---
My initial thought after watching this was "Yea... but you have to manually form groups to get the higher tier gear." 
---
Then I realized all you had to do was do regular raid finder to get baseline shit, then use the groupfinder to find higher level gear. Prior to raid finder you just do dailies. There are no epic quests to get the epic sword of "fuck you" or whatever. It is just a clear path from point A to B that is not interesting at all.
---
&gt; because you say it does.
---
That's literally what they said in yesterday's interview. You're the one making shit up and coming up with wrong assomptions.
---
The reasoning behind it is quite straight. Engineering is god-like for PvP and even PvE and, while mining/eng makes a good combo,  endgame-wise engineering consumables' mats are rather cheap (since most interesting engineering stuff are active items, only explosives are consumables) whereas herbs are pricey (due to raid consumes). 
---
In the end you end up spending way more gold in herbs than on ores/stone since by then you'll have most engineering stuff crafted (and so, you'll not need it crafted/need to craft it again, bar goblin rocket boots if they explode).  Herbalism helps saving some gold. 
---
That said, this is endgame-only. If you intend to level engineering while leveling mining is the go-to.
---
Pre-deployment training, kid, general house stuff
---
2004 was a long time ago.
---
Same here. I quit during Wrath because I didn't enjoy where the game was heading. I did like TBC very much though.
---
Nothing says they can't come to you though.  It just limits how often one person can bounce around.
---
Short term gratification wins again!
---
I'm quite calm.  I'm just disappointed that they throw this out there thru some 3rd parties and don't bother to elaborate on it.  It wouldn't have taken much effort to type out a full explanation of how they envision it working.
---
&gt;this is a great solution!
---
&gt;gunna be interesting to see how it works!
---
&gt;but I know it will be great!
---
So?
---
I think average income is the number I looked at recently when median might be a better number. The US is higher than all the Scandinavian countries on average income by quite a bit, Denmark slightly beats Norway there. But median the us is just slightly behind Denmark which is quite a bit behind Norway. 
---
Net income us is slightly above Denmark and slightly more behind Norway.
---
The big disparity between average and median is pretty telling about the income gap in the us though. So the us is definitely higher on the high end but lower on the low end.
---
I’m a boiler operator at a large sugar factory in a small town.
---
Dustwallow Marsh - but in a sadomasochistic way.
---
Yeah we're both pretty excited. Going classic warrior priest duo. And I'll solo a warlock on the side. Should work out pretty synergistically. HMU when classic is about to drop. We're on the west coast and will be looking for a raiding guild. It's cool to play with other couples.
---
He isn’t in yet. Lies everywhere
---
I bet a bunch of people are going to burn themselves out on the beta.
---
We do not definitively know the n values or initial number of layers. While the interview did state three layers with OG server cap each, I think that was meant to be illustrative. I wouldn't be surprised if we get 10+ n=1k layers on launch day, quickly merging to the \~3 n=2.5k layers that you are showing and eventually to 1. This would more closely reflect the true vanilla experience where pop was increasing slowly over time. Even at n=1k, starting zones will still be packed but somewhat functional despite no dynamic respawns.
---
You have no life because you complain about a product that you would potentially would buy/invest in? Mkayyy
---
Rule 2 is be civil and respectful
---
By the patch it will be on (1.12) rogues had seen a few nerfs and other classes buffs to bring pvp more in line. You're more likely to see warriors everywhere as they are top tier raid tanks, raid dps, and pvpers.
---
I still felt like TBC had a ton of world PvP. It was less random ganking on roads and more fighting at certain places. All of the Mote farming locations, daily quest areas, and rep grinding places where hotly contested.
---
yeah he's coming back so he can go back in time, to classic
---
Ion saying something doesn't make it a fact. It's just the opinion of one guy who has bosses to answer to. Until there is an official Blizzard statement, like an article off their website, they really can change their minds and do whatever. Once they've said something in an official company it'd be harder for them to go back on it.
---
They've also not said what they'd do if some server was super popular, still having layers when phase 2 hits. Until we know what their actual plans are for all this, I remain skeptical. I suspect they rolled out this tech without even knowing what they'd do.
---
Also as others said phase 1 does not yet have a length set. I highly doubt it's just one month. So Ions claimed worst case could impact for months for all we know. And change the entire leveling experience as a lot of people would complete their full leveling in that time frame.
---
I'm not against layering, but I'm against the lack of concrete info. Blizzard just leaking bits instead of announcing concrete plans with details about abuse prevention, implementation details...etc. And until I see those, I will remain against the idea...not that it matters to blizz.
---
Report it using the in-game bug reporting function and quit clogging up the sub
---
I've played both Vanilla (release &amp; currently on a pserver) and Modern WoW. What I personally love the most about Vanilla is:
---
\- The Challenge. You can't just run into a mob of 3+ mobs alone and destroy them. You'll be lucky to kill 2 at the same time. if you find a way to kill 3+ mobs you'll feel like you really did something. You'll also have to strategize in dungeons and know what everyone brings to a group and then work together to clear the dungeon. This brings me to my next point.
---
\- The Community. It's not only easier and faster to quest in Vanilla by grouping with random people who may eventually become your friend, in some quests it's absolutely necessary. You don't really have to worry about finding a group, just go to the quest area and you'll typically get an invite right away or just make your own random group.
---
\- The Gear. Not saying the gear looks "cooler", that's subjective. Since Cata, I really can't tell which dungeon or tier set someone has. With Vanilla, you'll find yourself running to random people and inspecting them and getting hyped for when you may get that gear and most likely knowing atleast which dungeon/raid it comes from. You'll also get to the point where you don't even need to inspect, you'll know just by looking what that person did for that gear. 
---
\- The Progression. There is 0 welfare epics, no catch-up dungeons that nulls out other content. Even when NAXX gets released you'll see guilds still trying to clear Molten Core. It just feels more special when you've cleared MC, or progressing through BWL with 39 other people (in my opinion). It takes time to get gear and therefore few people will be over-geared making that epic you just won a game-changer.  On these forums you'll see people saying that MC, BWL, AQ40 and NAXX are easy to clear. Personally I don't know one person that has cleared AQ40 let alone NAXX. The other day on a pserver I saw a guild that was still 5/8 MC (with other guilds clearing NAXX). A small percentage of players will clear NAXX.
---
Yep. Sadly its what blizz will cater too cuz as much as they want the old fans back it is way more important to them to maintain the BFA playerbade through content droughts so they will do what it takes to keep those players over trying to get returning players.
---
But hey if nothing else at least we will have an updated client for when the next private server opens xD
---
I'm very conflicted on Shaman or Druid. I'm leaning towards Druid for the Wpvp ability but I Ele resto is fun as hell. War stomp+chainlighting is a fun little combo in BGs. I like Druids for a lot of reasons. Jack of all trades, easier to find a raid spot. I plan to do Herb/Skinning and I feel like being a Druid will give me an advantage for gathering Herbs. Entangling roots and steal the node. Sounds like a lot of fun, but Shaman is the more dominant healer and Chain Heal is one of my favorite abilities in the game. Its animation is so cool.
---
But then someone on layer 2 may have been able to farm a ton of stuff without competition because layer 1 was too over farmed. So the person on layer 2 gets to sell more on the AH and effect the pricing even though it wasn't nearly as scarce for them as it was for the others farming. I'm not saying the AH should be split but I'm saying that this layering will have real effects on the cost of goods and how easy some people can farm things.
---
The more I am eager to play classic, the less I find enjoyment in playing retail. It just feels pointless. So far my expectation was that I would enjoy retail again after playing classic and actually feeling the dowmsides. But with Classic+ suddenly being a very real possibility... I am not so sure about that.
---
yeah that too but not in this cinematic :)
---
A lot of people in this thread have clearly never played on a fresh start realm. Have "fun" fighting a mob of people for a 5 minute wolf spawn.
---
How does layering help their bottom-line in a truly significant way? Whether they spin up a layer, or spin up a server similar resources are being allocated. It would probably be less of a hassle to just spin up a bunch of servers, then forget about it. "Oh is this server over-crowded but this other server completely dead?... meh, we gave people what they asked for."
---
Yeah if you spend all day playing, don't work or run errands or any of the other shit that people have to do day to day lmfao &gt;.&gt;
---
It seems most didn't and this way a bad idea lol. oh well, maybe I'll try to repost with more clarity later.
---
But there are ways outside of layering, which has massive implications on the whole game, that address that problem. So that's just not a compelling argument for including layering.
---
Lol are you kidding me?
---
Did you not see all the complaining for like a week straight when we the community realized there would be cross realm battlegrounds from the start?
---
Because it's fucking Ragnaros my dude !
---
Oh I know, it's a mangled version of retail but it's not a mangled version of what they intend. They *want* vanilla-era spell batching and lag.
---
Vanilla spell batching was all sorts of fucked and laggy. The devs have made it clear that's what they want, instead of just keeping good netcode in.
---
The majority of people won’t get past level 30. 
---
I’m looking forward to the salt the week of launch when people freak out over getting killed by a Gnoll for the 100th time.
---
Unpopular opinion but i definitely agree with this guy TO AN EXTENT. Im not saying the beta should be limited to only those who have payment history from 2004-2006; however, this game was primarily targeted towards the overwhelming amount of private server players who likely played the game way back when and have not subbed since. Though for a proper beta to take place they will need samples of players across the board.
---
Offer free transfers off to lower pop servers.
---
Shove people in a queue like the olden days after Phase 1 is over.
---
I get where you are coming from. The vast majority of the steps are the same. Why not have them?
---
Sorry. This beta is for people who have been subbed for awhile. Which means retail wall of no folks get to decide our fate. Oh and clueless streamers. Good game Blizzard. The one last piss in the face to pserver players.
---
That's a great and valid argument, nothing wrong in complaining. My problem are the people that share bad vibes: you said "Doesn't make me love layering" that's a nice way to speak, some people just share hate and are rude, that's the perspective I have.
---
Well the beta is used to find inconsistencies between the beta and the original vanilla wow. If you have no experience from vanilla then you are of zero value as a beta tester in that regard.
---
The beta is not for people to comeup with improvments or reporting things they think are bugs, it's just to restore the game to its former glory.
---
Stress test part, sure the more the merrier, actual beta testers -&gt; limited to vanilla players (not pserv players)
---
I was speaking about blizzard CEs. Their first ones sold out quickly, true, but nothing like this. And the cata, mop and wod ones were in stores here for a long time (years). Legion a bit less, and BFA I just went on day one and bought one without reserving it or anything.  
---
The Diablo 3 CE sold out quickly and was hard to get as most stores got 1-2 copies only. They made a lot more for RoS and that problem was solved.  
---
And this is less a game and more of a statue. And usually they do not go out of stock in the single day. Don't get me wrong, I am not speaking against the limited model, I am just saying that it really looks like that they really underestimated the demand. It's almost like Blizzcon tickets (but instead of minutes, it was hours).
---
Nope.  Blizz always wants as many different points of view as possible.  New players are just as important (maybe even more so) as returning ones.
---
Stop trying to turn this into an elitist, "I was there first, therefore I deserve it more" kind of thing.
---
Don't forget to include your battle.net account name and password in your post ;)
---
I would GUESS they will. You are assuming all vanilla players have quit. But there are probably thousands of players currently subbed who also played in vanilla -- these folks will get priority. And they already said it's a very small closed beta with a few stress tests for everybody else who wants to help test.
---
You do realize consumables are consumed right? More players means more consumers. A few people are going to manipulate the market regardless of laying or not. By the time people get high enough level for expensive mats only the most overpopulated servers will still have layering. Just avoid a streamer server and your problems will be gone.
---
So did the beta launch already then?
---
Darkshore and Ashenvale. They butchered them in cata.
---
Given the fact that pservers are wrong on numbers/mechanics, I think the quality of bug reporting will be pretty shitty in this beta.. Especially from people who have been playing pservers for the past few years.
---
Wow glad I dont play it
---
Its from the Sellout dude who never played classic ... so screw him
---
In my opinion, many changes have harmed the game over time:
---
\- flying
---
\- lfd / lfr
---
\- transmog gear
---
\- barber  
---
Let me explain the point with the transmog gear and the hairdresser. In the past you knew other people on the server because you came into contact with a lot of them at some point and they had hardly changed optically. By transmogg gear and hairdresser but also lfr and ldr this " society " on the server was destroyed.
---
&gt;Peter, Mark and Justin have a guild with about 15 people in it, they all crash level to 60 and start abusing several layers to farm blacklotuses and devilsaur as much as they can and have a huge inventory head start when it comes to valuable materials. They corner the market and buy any supply of black lotus that arrives while inflating the prices like crazy as they are still camping the black lotus spawns and still have plenty of supply. What little black lotus they dont buy up goes for their listing price of 200g.
---
We still don't have enough details about layering to be certain that this is possible. 
---
There should be ways to implement Layering based on the little we have heard to minimize the downsides while keeping the positives.
---
A simple timer for how often you can Layer shift would go a long way towards preventing abuse while still allowing friends the ability to make sure they can play together.
---
Split chat between layers, so any "LFM 1 Tank DM" you see in Westfall chat is someone on your layer (to prevent layer shifting from regular play), and have a confirmation box pop up when being invited to a different layer through [battle.net](https://battle.net) to confirm that you wish to change layer.
---
Layer shifting is not supposed to be something you do often. Preferably you would layer change a couple of times in the beginning, then the system should balance out to make sure you are in the same layer as the people you play with.
---
For your example, the system would put this guild in one layer, and if they tried using secondary accounts to layer shift, there would be a limit to how much it could be done to prevent abuse.
---
Layer shifting should be a simple workaround, not a core feature.
---
One alternative would be to only allow Layer Shifting in Stormwind / Orgrimar like War Mode. (Possibly allowing it just in Rested Zones) That would kill most potential for abuse, while still keeping the main feature intact.
---
You will have a better memory than the people who literally never played it...
---
It could have a pretty big impact on the longevity of a healthy economy if people are able to farm a lot more crafting mats all of a sudden due to it.
---
Example. At cataclysm launch, herb nodes were insane. They were absolutely everywhere. You couldn't stop to pick one without 4 more showing up on your minimap. I leveled all the way to 85 just picking herbs. They hotfixed probably 2 weeks after launch. But it was too late. I had enough flask materials for the entire expansion.
---
It's not about opinions it's about finding bugs...IT'S A BETA.
---
So clueless, why the hell would it remove polymorph? It never had and it never will, jesus christ
---
Since you are one of the few lucky beta tester, use the in-game bug report button...
---
In your example, there would be at least 160 and probably more people interested in being part of a mafia, which is enough for competing groups. They would fight over each layer. It is possible that one smaller group could dominate all, but I think that's unlikely.
---
People really underestimate how much of an impact this will have especially on resources.
---
Just because someone is hardcore it's not morally right to abuse them financially.
---
There is no sharding. Have... have you not been paying attention or is this a general comprehension problem?
---
I dont have the beta myself, just saw it from videos.
---
\#nochanges
---
Not recognizing a streamer =/= stupid
---
But what if we ring the bells
---
the world of influencers video gets more and more relevant.
---
I signed up for the beta. I might resub if I get an invite. No way am I goinf to resub for a chance to get a beta invite. Fuck that.
---
Only rank 13?
---
Layers being sticky is obviously preferable, but that would suck if you have a friend that ends up on another layer. Every time you group either you phase into his world or vice versa and you end up never seeing the players that you encounter solo or they never see the players they encounter during solo play.
---
What was the warlock pet fiasco?
---
Will sharding/layering ruin this?
---
11/23/2004...
---
Original spell batching was a consequence of the technology at the time.  Bliz already stated that they have recreated it (functionally, at least) in Classic.  Read some blue posts, once in a while.
---
People  that jump are obviously a bot.
---
Ok, except the server caps were what, 3k originally? So there were never "thousands" of horde players planning these epic raids. The entire server's max is 3k so even at 50/50 it's 1500 total horde players, and that's assuming literally everyone at peak time wants to join your raid, so.........................I don't know. I guess it just seems like this is one of those "this is what i do on pservers but i still say 'this is what makes it classic for me' " which just annoys me.
---
So how do you switch your raid to another layer consistently? I think it's easier ssid than done
---
Cross realm BGs (IE: battlegroups) were also in 1.12.  Seems pretty "vanilla" to me.
---
&gt; I understand the intent behind it but you could quickly be overwhelmed if in a bad spot.
---
It changes where the best farm spot is. You no longer have to balance drop value vs. amount of mobs. You can just pick the mobs with the best drops because they will respawn fast enough.
---
Then you ask you're friend to send you an invite and quickly layers away
---
This is what I’ve been telling myself too, the horizon is no longer endless! We may be in the cold wee hours of the morning, but daybreak will come. I’ve been amusing myself with finding profession guides and such, thinking about which alts I’ll do, etc. I’m not a power leveler or min maxer by any means, but I figured knowing how to make it all a bit more efficient might help my casual ass along.
---
Sorry I know this isnt the right place, but what is spell batching?
---
SL lock
---
i got in 
---
been playing  since last year (started in bfa)
---
I think they considered it but felt this was "such a small minority" it wouldnt matter. The reality is that this "small minority" can have huge impacts on server health and longevity. If a guild is hoarding devilsaur leather and making the price unattainable people won't get the gear they want, get frustrated at their fellow players who they cant change, and quit. This will magnify the already shitty behavior that exists.
---
I don't like it
---
Why is this flagged sarcastic?
---
yeah srsly
---
I was not talking about starter zones, just dynamic layering. They have already said that the starter zones are going to be packed. Also they never say 3000, Ion said it will be at roughly what player capacity was at launch.
---
&gt;It in no way implies there will be smaller layers at launch. It's just saying each 3000 person layer will be merged over time.
---
Depends a bit. He is saying that they are going to increase the amount of players in each "version of the world" over time. So it's fairly safe to assume that there are going to be different player caps on the layers as time goes on. My guess is that they might not be exactly sure what those player caps are going to look like before they have done stress tests.  They are also going to heavily monitor this on release and they probably have it set up so they can choose more or less how large layers are going to be for each realm. That being said we won't really know until release if they are starting with roughly 3000 players per Layer, but we do know that that they are going to up that number over time until we end up without layers. (assuming Ion is to be believed ofc)
---
I played as a noob back in the day as a Tauren Hunter.  I came back to retail and HEAVILY enjoyed Orc Fury Warrior, and thought Hunter was lame.  Now I'm picking for Classic and I'm going in circles.  I originally thought Warrior, but I will be leveling alone a lot and I don't want to necessarily tank.  Then I thought Warlock or Rogue but I'm not much of a "DoT" person and while Rogue looks fun I'm not sure if it's my playstyle, I feel like people will own me unless I play a certain way.  So now I'm back at Hunter.   Maybe an Orc Hunter is right for me?  I'd pick Warlock but casting is kinda boring IMO...siiiigh either Hunter or Rogue now...
---
I’m curious which specs of the following classes are the most viable for PvE dps 
---
Rogue
---
Hunter
---
Warlock
---
Mage
---
They literally said in the interview each layer would have a server pop of ppl. If thats true then how the fk does spreading ppl around matter if u have 4x the server pop trying to log into 1 server
---
Such as? Obviously not sharding.
---
No layering on lower pop zones? Dead servers after a short while that will eventually be forced to merge. This has already happened and is precisely what layering avoids.
---
No laying on higher pop zones? Game is unplayable for many people at launch, not just frustrating, but unplayable.
---
Dynamic respawning is shit and exploitable, that's a whole other can of worms.
---
I got pretty lucky, my degree had a requirement Internship in order to graduate so it was just something we eventually had to do.
---
Maybe it does on certain pservers and he wants to check and see if it will on live. It didn't back in vanilla, but don't you think the beta is the time to check and see if it does on classic? If it does then he can write up a report to blizzard saying "Hey, WOTF is removing poly, it didn't do this in vanilla. Is this intended?" You know... the point of a beta.
---
I find Tips as annoying as the next dude, but getting mad at him for trying to use the beta for what it's for seems silly.
---
How did they lie?
---
[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/guild/us/draka/screams-of-the-past](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/guild/us/draka/screams-of-the-past)
---
People were doing level 60 only guilds way back in wotlk with only classic enchants/gear in raids (although everyone had a gemmed and wotlk enchanted pvp set lol). I remember because I was in that guild - the classic movement has been alive for a very long time!
---
Quick warning to everyone: This is an inside joke about Tips Out claiming that WoTF could remove polymorph during his fighting tournament in the Classic Demo. Everyone flamed him for it and I'm guessing that he finally embraced the meme. So, he's PROBABLY not thinking about even testing this right now.
---
ah thank you. this is great news me and my friends are hoping to have a lot of fun on classic :)
---
They weren't referring to the upcoming beta. It was a previous beta exclusive to family and developers.
---
Oh look, the ground
---
account: leeroyjenkins69 pw:leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooooyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
at least it doesn't contain anything for Classic - only retail apparently
---
They sacrificed gameplay integrity for cost essentially. What a shitty tradeoff
---
Pretty sure it was once a day
---
Yeah at least it saves me from rushing I guess, that was the main reason.
---
Whether or not summoning a new demon should despawn your current demon at the start or at the end of casting
---
That one can stay that's amazing
---
Click the link I posted above and sign in.
---
BTW i prim sub him 😂. But only because he was maximum honest till he announced his news. But I don’t like the way blizzard announce thing actually
---
Is it really too far-fetched to possibly fathom that people can play and enjoy their game while still being critical of decisions being made that they don't agree with? If you disagree with a decision you should simply shut up and play it quietly or just complain and not play?
---
Are you seriously gatekeeping a beta?
---
they will remove the layers once the server density is normal
---
I'm literally in tears of laughter, how is this man successful?
---
I mean, sit-crits was pretty much only a flavor thing, anyways.  You "sit" and were thus vulnerable and defenseless.  Very much in line with old school tabletop RPG mindsets.  Functionally, it had no bearing on actual gameplay, other than a few cases in which it was exploited.
---
This is why we have guilds, and friend's lists. If you enjoy playing with certain people you keep in contact with them and not rely on trying to run into them in a world already filled with thousands of people. This argument is silly when we have so many other forms of keeping in touch with people.
---
Or we could just avoid the issue in general and not shard servers. Just release more servers
---
i wonder if it will show up under the classic section or if it's under the wow section
---
That's the friends+families alpha, which they always do. Separate
---
It's a joke, he's poking fun at himself.
---
I shall live through the experiences of the Beta invitees. With great power comes great responsibility.
---
They did. Some of them were part of the alpha...
---
I did not - highlighting that it is sold out. I am so glad you care what other people do with their money though, shows you *really care...*
---
World-sized shard. You will see the same 3000 people in your world/shard no matter where you go, until you relog.
---
I never thought sharding would be cross realm.. that makes no sense
---
Imagine being this petty
---
Tbh I’d be fine with it if they managed to keep it the way it was, but that’s the thing, they haven’t. Your combat text is now verified before it is shown, which basically means you press a button -&gt; action is handled serverside -&gt; response is sent back to the player.
---
This means the game fees like it’s lagging. The beauty of vanilla wow was that it felt really tight, and that made up for a lot of it. 
---
A good comparison today is Apex Legends, a game with mediocre at best netcode, but the way it’s handled and presented, gives players just enough of an illusion to bridge the gap. 
---
Forcing a stupid .4ms buffer is the dumbest nochange bs ever
---
For sure my dude, I'm subbing for classic, not retail come September.
---
The megs thread had tons of comments that used super dramatic language to describe just how dissatisfied they were haha.
---
Ok then report it literally anywhere but here
---
People who played Vanilla retail have more value in finding inconsistencies than those who didn't. Fact.
---
you paid for the updates and new content tho, classic won't have any
---
I think we will be downvoted but I completely agree. If I was struggling (as I have at a point in my life) I would be cutting other things out. OP will be getting messages from people who are careless with their money, and think nothing of running out and spending 20$ to get fast food, yet NEED op to help them pay for classic. Very few people are living bare minimum, and legit can't afford the 15$, while also not spending it foolishly.
---
The way I have been thinking is that it is kinda like players playing at different times. If you play in the evening, and someone else plays in the morning, you wont ever see each other either. Layers just add an extra dimension to that, so the players not in your layer will be similar to the players playing at a different time. Obviously its not quite the same, especially if players have a way of transferring to another layer, but it still seems like a pretty reasonable compromise.
---
On some pservers you have vendors that sell T3 gear for gold. Why not add that to checklist then?
---
It is the original version of wow.
---
A lot of things changed, but here are some of it :
---
\- Reaching max level took time (2-3 days currently, a month or 2 back then). There was a real adventure to reach max.
---
\- Quest had stories and no quest helper. This means you had to read the quest to understand what to do.
---
\- There was no cross realm. That mean you can see someone, and a day later see that guy again because he is on your server. This applies to enemies you encounter in the world. You are playing with people while now you don't even say hello because you will never see that guy again.
---
\- Class had identity. You cannot be everything at the same time. You had a real talent tree. Now you can be all specs at the same time and tree is limited.
---
\- Raid was at larger scale (20 to 40 people). Now it is way more like 10 people.
---
\- Raid was difficult (at least from AQ40). I ask for a huge dedication to get down. This mean that when you complete a raid, you were rewarded and had a feeling of achievement.
---
...
---
Way more but cannot tell everythings.
---
loot box beta invites folks
---
I fear you're correct.
---
In principle no, but I'm just being pessimistic about them being in a rush to clarify this matter
---
Have there been any reports of anyone receiving a beta invite yet? I don't think they have given them out just yet because I haven't heard *anything*... not even from the streamers.
---
Ion is game director for WoW, not ‘one blizz guy’ but ok
---
You're arguing against brick walls, these people don't have the brainpower to go through all these new presenting problems that come with layering, trust I've tried.
---
Or additional servers with free realm transfers. But that costs money.
---
"Beta" will only go to streamers and YouTubers.
---
Haven’t heard anything either
---
hey just fyi, some old and unavailable items are worth a lot (like the now useless ammunition in your bags). if you are lucky enough you might be able to sell them for enough gold to buy a toke to use for a month subscription for classic
---
It wouldnt be but thats my exact problem with sharding. They want to allow x amount more then the actual server pop onto a server because they are expecting x amount of ppl to quit. If x amount of ppl dont quit then we end up with the problems they say they are trying to circumvent which then means sharding or in this case layering has to continue forever.
---
They are setting up to have the game indefinitely sharded which is something no one who wants classic should want. Leave that shit to retail.
---
Any thoughts on Race/Class combos as flair?  It would be a bit more personal than Faction/Class and allow for some more individuality, which IMO is a big part of what Classic is all about!
---
&gt; This is essentially cutting edge tech being developed FOR Classic's benefit
---
resource splitting has been a core part of computing since the birth of a computer. There is nothing 'cutting edge' here.
---
&gt; i'm wondering how players that didn't play during Vanilla will help to find missing or incorrect informations ? 
---
Even if they did blizzard isnt going to be listining, theyre just doing this to people please and garner a better crossover rate from retail to classic.
---
Yes, naxxramas was added at the end, maybe we should add it at the very beginning.
---
So if you see something in classic beta how do you know if it’s a bug from the back port or actual an 1.12 ( which in itself was a very small part of vanilla) vanilla mechanic?  We will basically have to open a bug report for everything and have blizzard check the reference client for everything.  And then there’s no way to see what was already “checked” so you got everyone opening tickets for the same thing.  
---
It’s gonna be a headache
---
When have the lied? They've told us exactly what they're doing the whole time.
---
Everyone knows sharding will be the end of classic. They're not gonna do all this work for nothing.
---
1. Free realm xfers after the population settles. 
---
2. Merging if necessary. Far lesser evil given that merging affects a slim minority of the player base as opposed to EVERYONE.
---
On your points though:
---
1. Higher pop zones having competition for spawns is not "unplayable" - that's ridiculous. You even said earlier that layering won't fix this because you will still be fighting "hundreds of people in northshire for wolves". So I am now confused as to what you are aruging because you have contradicted yourself here.
---
2. Dynamic respawning is shit, I agree.
---
3. Lower pop zones can be merged. It has happened in the past and it was literally fine. So why not do it again? I see no issue. And again, this would impact a minority of players as opposed to impacting EVERYONE
---
4. So is layering about the server pop, or is it about a smooth launch experience? Please clarify. Because from my viewpoint it is a poor solution to both those problems.
---
you can switch to spirit gear while you eat/travel but you're not gonna wear it in combat
---
Did you REEEEEEEEEE when you saw they added auto looting and that little red arrow button to get off when you are on a flight path ?
---
Idk what size you think the layers willl be, but theyre likely to be fulled sized servers each. Also buddy, they legit NEVER said "only starting zones" for sharding, they kept it vague as fuck just incase the barrens needed to be included, they legit said "sharding only at the start" not sharding only starting zones, or only the first week of launch. Phase 1 is the start of all the phases; get fucking baited kid.
---
All armor and resist value on PServers were guessed, since that information was never available outside of blizzard.  Certain mobs/bosses will have more or less armor or resists based on what fits their flavor.  Example, Garr in MC would have more armor since he is, you know, made of out rock, and it makes sense.  Kel'Thuzad is a frost/shadow caster type, and would has less armor, but more frost/shadow resist.
---
What class is best for layering
---
Complaining and being critical is always good with me. Being rude and sharing hate just because you don't like something is what I see a lot of people doing, and this post was made with that in mind.
---
Of course.
---
Just grab an extra 5-10 before you log out.  I find it only to be as annoying as having to load and hold arrows or physically craft poisons.  
---
Or even just log in for the raids a bit early and farm outside while you wait for everyone else to show up.  Probably good to get in the habit of being one of the first players there for summoning anyways.
---
&gt;This idea that the servers will lose 90% of their population in the first few weeks is just completely baseless fantasy and I don't understand why so many people believe it. Private servers would be the closest thing we can look at for evidence, and their population tends to actually increase over time
---
Classic's population will definitely fall off after a few months, but I don't think we'll see a 90% population decline.  Using pservers as a measurement isn't quite right, as those had no monetary cost affixed to them and were filled with players that sought it out(as you said) meaning that they really wanted to play Vanilla.
---
&gt;So to be clear here, you're so sick of people talking about the problems with layering, yet at the same time you don't know what their actual complaints are? How does that make any sense?
---
Why do you think I'm so sick of anything?  Taking a quick glance at your post history, you are spending quite a bit of time responding and posting about this "issue."  I've only engaged you and one other person in discussion. I understand most of the complaints I've read, I just disagree with some of them or view them as being very hyperbolic.
---
&gt;Community: You can meet someone at random, make friends, and then never see them again. You can swap layers by joining a group or a guild and essentially be on a completely new server with a completely new community. There are players and guilds operating on your server that you will never interact with... until "someday."
---
If you meet someone randomly, make friends with them, why would I never see them again?  Why didn't I add them to my friends list and invite them to join me in doing stuff or vice versa?  People swapped servers to join guilds back in Vanilla, so not sure I see your point there--the same with not being able to interact with every single person or guild on the entire server.
---
&gt;Economy: The economy will be flooded with resources at a 3x+ rate, massively influencing prices. In fact, the more savvy players will gather like crazy until layering is removed, and then drop their stash on the AH once prices bounce back from a newly introduced scarcity. So, huge economical impacts that will affect how you play the game. The upheaval occurs more so when the layering is removed, than during it.
---
The main issue I have with this argument is the assumption is being made that somehow people are going to know what layer they are on or that someone else is on.  Given the anticipated size of these layers(several thousand players), I doubt it will be as easy to determine as people think.  That being said I'm sure some addon developer may find a way of doing this or enterprising players with large enough friends list.  Ultimately, Classic is being prepared to operate for theoretically forever so the economy will sort itself out.
---
&gt;Immersion: There will still be players phasing in and out of existence. You will be forced to interact with people outside of the game. There may be a guild on your server that fits your playstyle perfectly, but you would never know that they exist unless you find them through a subreddit, discord, etc. The only enchanter on your server with Crusader may be in Layer 2, so you'll have to do some convoluted group joining to phase over to their layer to use their services.
---
This argument is a non-starter, imo.  In Vanilla, players interacted with people outside of the game all the time.  Finding a guild often involved visiting the official forums(such as realm, guild recruitment, etc.) and guild websites.  I only joined one guild "organically" during my WoW career, everything else came from me researching the forums then going through an application process out of the game.  I suspect that this will remain the way a good majority of folks find their guild--especially if they're interested in organized raiding.
---
&gt;In that case "phasing" was obviously referring to the 6 phase content release schedule.
---
I misunderstood you, thanks for clearing that up.
---
&gt; I'm not arguing for dynamic respawns. I don't even like it on private servers. Progressive itemization would be a great addition to Classic WoW to keep the content closer to the challenge that it was originally designed at. So yes, I'd absolutely argue in favor of progressive itemization.
---
In your Immersion section, you lament the fact that players will have to consult outside resources to find guilds/friends but it's okay to have to consult outside resources to know if an item is good in this itemization cycle, will get better in another cycle, or be nerfed in the next one?
---
You said "expansions" (plural), just FYI, you can only ever buy the most recent expansion, all the previous ones get added to your wow account for free.
---
I am salaried, have great benefits, and live in a state with a great local economy. Yea some places in the US suck, and our politicians are fucking corporate tools. But part of the "beauty" is these things arent given for free. I've had to educate myself to get where I am, and be capable of doing the job well. And I am reaping the rewards for it
---
REEEEEEE
---
In a rush? What about all the people who rushed to sub because they thought it was necessary to get an invite in the first place? What happens if it turns out that the invites were free but access was paid? Do all those people who were misled and didn't get an invite get a refund? Blizzard already knows their answer, they just need to share it. Why are you even defending this? It's basic respect for your customers.
---
Ion is the game director. Higher ups don’t make decisions like that for him. It’s literally his job. His job isn’t to monetize the game, it’s to make it good—fun—blizzard quality. When the guy literally in charge of making the game says, at a media event blizzard themselves cultivated, that “X will be Y, Quote me on that” you can be pretty well rest assured that is Blizzard officially saying something. Ion is also an attorney, he is very selective of what he says, especially on Camera or while being recorded, he said on camera to a “journalist” he could be quoted on something. I shouldn’t have to explain what him lying there would do to blizzards bottom line, which is what you believe is driving all decisions, anyhow. 
---
For all intents and purposes, when it comes to wow, ion IS Blizzard. 
---
Your comment is about as nonsensical as soccer moms who don’t listen to Medical Doctors regarding vaccinations.
---
There is still enough time left for them to make changes. We can only make assumptions around whether they will stick with how it is now or if they will make changes in response to criticism. Do not get stuck on the first four words of a post and disregard the rest please.
---
There were leaks months ago saying like 8 servers per region, 4 PvP 3pve 1 rp (or some combination). Seems low but less than 20 seems realistic
---
And those are going to likly be the people still playing retail
---
and if the population remains high?  Do the layers stay?
---
He calls himself MrGM but he’s not even a GM and he doesn’t even have GM robes on
---
&gt; But hey if nothing else at least we will have an updated client for when the next private server opens xD
---
I like this silverlining! Nerds better be datamining the beta already /*shakes fist at sky*
---
They didn't "correct it" next patch of BFA they're releasing ways to earn flying in the zones just like they did before.
---
Thats ridiculous. Classic wasnt set up around 12k server pops. While it would be a fun fiesta theres no way blizz would accept that. The servers are gonna be double classic at most (about 4 to 5k) anymore then that are going to be stuck in a que. Which they also literally mention as a reason for layering in the interview to stop que times which means they are letting more ppl onto the servers then intended for the final server size
---
That's assuming that the only bugs that could possibly exist are inconsistencies. 
---
There's a million other problems that could happen outside the realm of inconsistencies than people's recollection of their experience 14 years ago.
---
Proof?
---
But in the end it doesn't effect you whatsoever so, in turn, who really cares what OP does, so long as it makes him feel good.
---
Probably because no-one wanted CEs for the shit expansions I guess. This selling out so fast just speaks to how many people love classic, since it's all classic stuff in the box (except a code for retail mounts that I guarantee you'll see plenty of on eBay). 
---
You could very well be right in that they underestimated demand massively; that's good, that means that there really are a *lot* of people ready for Classic!
---
Your post history says otherwise ;)
---
I know that its needed of couse, however, im going to miss the fun chaotic feeling of a fresh pserver.
---
I mean ya that’d be cool, but a beta isn’t some glorified early release. You’d be a jackass to think that people who didn’t play back then can’t add value to a beta.
---
post a screenshot if true, you would be world first
---
well since i will take my holidays to play at launch, i rather to play on a sharded/ñlayered server than not being able to play at all because of server crashes... i would be so mad one or two of my vacation days can't even log or do quests because there's too many people inside
---
Why are you spamming the sub right now with this stupid shit
---
They aren't forcing you at gunpoint to fork up the subscription money, what a load of malarkey.
---
Ion never said you can't switch layer by relogging. It's been clearly stated to be per _session_. You are the one spreading misinformation here, and there's no need to be rude to him whether he's right or not.
---
If you can't afford to pay the monthly fee you should probably not be spending your time on video games in the first place tbh.
---
but but what if I wanna flame Tips because I'm a basement dweller that didn't quite make it in life so I find solace in hating some streamer?
---
So you can get off a flight path at a stop along the way of the destination you picked?
---
Pre-WoD(I think) spells processed from the client(your PC) to the server in batches.  This made it possible for two mages to sheep each other or two Warriors to charge stun eachother at the same time.
---
I don’t understand how layering can be seen as bad news
---
&gt; The beauty of vanilla wow was that it felt really tight
---
Not what I remember. I remember big delays.. you'd often see the player die before you'd see the damage number pop up.
---
I know sharding in BFA was cross realm but was there any proof that sharding would be cross realm in classic?
---
You have no idea what I'm there for and don't try to act like you do.
---
Just a question, is there no way to work one day in the weekend every month and make the money you need instead of cutting down on food?
---
If you think the dedicated classic community wont try to game and exploit every single tiny thing for maximum profit and potential than I have bad news for you. The elitism in this community is greater than any other community I have been a part of and tbh if there is ANYTHING we have learned from blizzs gameplay changes its that: People will push the "I win" button even if it makes the game extremely not fun to play. People care more about winning than they do about quality gameplay, people will abuse this to the EXTREME because if you don't someone else will and they will pull ahead.
---
It won't be for the plebs. It's most likely streamer and youtuber advertising.
---
Yeah there was still lots of pvp. Elemental plateau was the new BG on my server.
---
And then you’d still be with the same people, you’re just also with more people.
---
Rank14 Weapons were useless for Hunters.
---
Yeah nobody cares why I take my earned vacation.
---
You'll be assigned a layer from the get go, and you'll only change layers when they get merged, or if a friend invites you. I'm assuming you keep your assigned layer between sessions (it's the most logical approach).
---
It's not necessarily accurate to say that Layering is "new cutting edge tech." ESO has been using a "mega-server" model since inception. And Sharding is following the same concept, and is what layering is actually based on. Layering is just a different implementation of the same Sharding tech (which is based on the WotLK phasing tech, combined with cross-server/cloud computing upgrades made over the years). 
---
Though yes I do think it is promising that they made these adjustments, and actually didn't even consider that this could be done with Retail if it turns out to be a popular solution.
---
Cannot wait. This is one of my favorite parts of Vanilla.
---
Classic will be more popular than retail, same exact thing happened to RuneScape. Really confused why so many people are saying most people will leave, I think most people will stay.
---
Which class requires the least amount of time/farming for mats? and doesn't require mana pots?
---
Congrats!
---
they're the best in the business
---
Sure. Did you watch any of the clips? Read anything posted about it?
---
I realized flying was a mistake a few minutes after I got my first flying mount in TBC.
---
That was the moment I realized the game was heading in a horrible direction and the developers no longer cared about the things i cared about.
---
"will never happen" yea you fuckin retard, its not like they said no layering after phase 1 , and by the time people will raid a capital, phase 1 is loong gone
---
Nah. RP'ers wouldn't care. RP'ers if they're more busy RPing and ignoring everything else, will just sit there RPing. you can try and try to annoy them, but they'll just RP.
---
Initially they did say starting zones yes, but that was from sharding. Literally the biggest feature of layering is that it _isn't_ just constrained by the zone you are in. It is world-wide.
---
yikes man go easy on me
---
My assumed answer?: Of course they do.  
---
We already got sharding in the starting zones changed to sharding in all of phase 1
---
Less streamer spam
---
The day I ruined my social development. See ya later potential high school girlfriend, I’m chasing epics.
---
Ion explaining it resolved all my anger
---
And then what happened??
---
What about in your post history when you talk about how things were in vanilla and how you started in TBC and have been playing since TBC?    
---
Also talking about mythic dungeons being representative of dungeons in vanilla, lmfao.    
---
you can tank 5 mans as prot. In Stratholm/Scholo its actually quite decent. But its far from effective compared to Warrior. When it comes to raiding you might find a super super super casual guild that lets you play prot but chances are very low.
---
I just watched estvan or how you type it tank a run as prot pally on the beta. 
---
I think you can do it as 60 to if you put in the effort, since I have seen shaman tanks at 60 and they have a kit that is auwfull.
---
Unless Billy has a time machine, he won't find one.
---
Exactly.  And having a diverse group of players will mean that they will all be looking for different things.  An old player might see things that a new player wouldn't based off their experience, but a new player would notice things that an old player always took for granted, and might not have even realized was off.
---
Putting all of your expertise into one group only makes you blind to everything else.
---
Ion stated in an interview (top comment) that they will reduce layers as quickly as they can without harming playability. His hope is that they will be able to eliminate it within a month, but the absolute cutoff is phase 2 due too world bosses.
---
I’ve never heard of 9/80 can you explain
---
The work day hasn’t even started in Irvine. And I’m writing this an hour after your post.
---
That’s not enough, since we are going to be able to reserve names 2 weeks before launch. I’d like to be able to reserve my name in a server that would give me the best ping. It would majorly suck if I get to reserve names on a server with terrible ping and waste the reserves.
---
If the server has to resort to create multiple layers, I assure you there will be plenty of people for you to gank. 
---
If you want to gank a specific person over and over:
---
He has the option of just logging out. Maybe he wont come back. Maybe you want to annoy every single person in the game to the point the game becomes just a bunch of gankers competing for a prey. 
---
Also consider there is probably going to be gankers in every layer. There isn't a "put me in unicorn land" button. 
---
There won't be PvP rewards until phase 2. The only thing you're gaining for stalking someone for hours is some sort of sadistic pleasure. 
---
And if it comes to the point that the happiness of gankers in phase 1 become the focus of the developers, they can just make it so you can only change layers when out of combat or it requires loging out and back in again to the transported to your party's layer.
---
No, you can't "just create more servers". Tons of MMOs did that, tons of MMOs failed partly because of that.
---
We fully expect an insane population spike at launch, which will drop off rather quickly and stabilize at some (hopefully healthy) point. If you just create tons of servers at launch, they will all become ghost towns once a large faction of players drops out because they don't want the grind, find other things to do, etc.
---
&gt;they didn't want it around when 
---
and 
---
&gt;they will pull layering before 
---
Are quite different statements and the first doesn't actually imply the second. Consider the possibility of them not getting to do 'what they wanted' ?
---
Again, I do wish OP best of luck and will be happy for anyone he helps that actually needs it. But him getting his feel goods from potential scammers is not a good thing.
---
&gt;And that's why they corrected it and there's basically no flying in current content starting from WoD.
---
Really doesnt matter when you have sharding and a complete lack of a cohesive community. There's no organic PvP and rivalries like you find in Vanilla.
---
yes. But it won't, it's pretty obvious msot of the curious BFA tourists will be gone before lvl 20
---
\&gt; prebis in a week
---
good luck with that!
---
What if I told you... and I know this sounds crazy... that layering is just sharding by another name. And don't get pedantic with me. You know exactly what I mean.
---
But I'm not in that layer so I'm safe! 😒
---
UI differences like that are asinine and nitpicky to make a big deal out of.  One, because the UI is a direct port from the modern client, and two, most people are going to change their UI with addons anway.
---
If you thought everything was going to be exactly the same, then you weren't paying attention.
---
That's a pretty stupid reply. It doesn't mean he can't afford it. The question is what is it worth for you.
---
The contingency is at least the same contingency we've always had for servers getting too big, make more servers and offer server transfers. That isn't always successful, but layering certainly doesn't make that same age-old problem worse. It could in fact help with it if it means not having to make more servers, then figure out the mess of which to merge and all that jazz.
---
I am probably going to main a rogue and alt a mage, I'll do a mix of pve and pvp on both. What are generally the best/most popular specs?
---
Follow along:
---
Do you remember what Ion said about sharding when people asked him SPECIFICALLY about CONGESTION during world events like the opening of the gates or the scourge invasion?
---
Do you remember?
---
Do you know WHY people asked him specifically about congestion and sharding during late game?
---
Because everyone knows sharding in classic was to limit overcrowding. 
---
Or did you miss the 800 zillion threads on Reddit and the official forums when all hell broke loose about sharding?
---
Until YESTERDAY the megathread about how sharding breaks up communities for the sake of a smoother leveling experience by thinning out zones has been on the front page almost every day on the official forum.
---
Sharding/Layers are to give people room to breathe during the OBVIOUS influx of players on realms day 1 of launch.
---
That's why it's only lasting a very short amount of time - so tourists can leave and players can spread out so they aren't crowding the SAME ZONES.
---
That's literally what everyone has been on about.
---
Since we found out sharding existed.
---
People bitched and moaned they'd rather have queues, wait for mob spawns with hundreds of other players, etc - instead of breaking people up to give players more room at the START.
---
How fucking slow are you? This is an incredibly simple concept.
---
Now stop trolling.
---
Might as well plan what furniture you will bring with you when you migrate to Mars
---
nothing, it's just so rare that people pay gold to own it. it's a collectors item basically
---
lol what the fuck
---
&gt; It will be much more than the first couple of hours and even then...
---
Do you have any factual evidence to back this up? Or are you guessing? Because as I've mentioned several times, I've experienced this same situation recently both with and without dynamic spawns.
---
I stared at this message for a minute or so figuring out wtf A D T L was for. lol
---
Good Lord, are you being retarded on purpose?
---
I mean, why though? If you value your server community, do you really want it disrupted by an entirely different server getting moved in? That doesn't sound like it's necessarily going to "preserve" any server community, but instead completely transform it every time it happens.
---
I heard that you should get an email with a key. That or it might just show up on your launcher. 
---
Not entirely sure.
---
Sharding isn't CRZ.
---
RP servers on Live have sharding only in new Zones, and they don't CRZ unless somebody on the home server invites somebody else into their party and goes to the zone first. The Realm you land on is determined by the person who was in the zone first.
---
No, I am not spreading misinformation. I've had this discussion with him in another thread and when I provided him with video proof he stopped responding and continued to write the same information in a different thread.
---
 not change your layer. I dont know how you can interpret it per session when they very heavily emphasize that you will continue seeing the same people.
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=221 3:40 - 7:03. Please enlighten me on how I am misinformed,
---
I have had an active account on every major pserver project since 2014. Does that count?
---
Thats the problem. If people quit this might be genius but if not as many ppl quit as they are assuming its gonna be a disaster. Im not saying that i have a better plan but id rather tough it out and wait in ques to have a healthy server pop then take the chance that this fks up servers indefinitely
---
Ye thats what i liked about old WoW the big zones with not a lot of quests made them feel even bigger and great grinding spots
---
lol you couldnt be further from the truth....i hope the mods delete dumb ass posts like this

Straight up original.

How to play World of Warcraft for Free:
---
Those of you with wealthy parents (So this excludes a LOT of people including myself)
---
Borrow $4000 dollars. Put it into a stock or mutual fund with a 4% dividend yield.
---
At an expected growth rate of %12 annually, you should be able to play WoW based on the returns alone.
---
This is how the wealthy get wealthier (if you re-invest the returns)
---
If you're a rich kid, you can ask your father for a small loan of a million dollars.
---
Ahh shit I want that, I’m working 5-6 10 hour days a week.
---
Where does it say there will be beta invites today?
---
On the classic webpage it shows this
---
" Stress Test Schedule\*
---
* Stress Test 1: Wed May 22–Thurs May 23
---
* Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19– Thurs Jun 20
---
* Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 18– Fri July 19"
---
Is this not the beta schedule?
---
Yes, I would assume aggressive server merges would need to happen regardless, and preparing for that never hurts.
---
Why dont people know about freeshards? I have been playing classic since i stopped with wotlk...
---
So true.... i start medical school aug 14th. Pretty bummed.
---
Doesn't that ruin world PvP then?
---
preeeetty sure you would notice tho.
---
Not vanilla in particular since I didn't play it much, more WoW in general. It's been a big part of my life and cherish the memories and experiences I've had. Cataclysm was when I started the end-game for real so I have many fond memories of BWD and the other raids.
---
I opp'd in. But Im not subscribing until Classic comes out. Not worth 15$ for a chance to maybe play an unfinished game for a day or two
---
While I am glad that you had such fond memories of the game, you really should try to tone things down.  Coming into the game with such strong emotions means that if, for some reason, it doesn't live up to your expectations, you will only get hurt that much worse.
---
Either way, I sincerely hope you you enjoy the crap out of Classic.
---
Tips said it on his stream at least. At the summit, audience asked developers if guildies would be on the same layer, and they responded with "That's a good idea, we'll implement that".
---
This isn't a 4chan guild is it....
---
That's a very generous thought, but for someone in that kind of financial situation, classic WoW probably isn't the best activity for them.
---
You might be right. It's all speculation on my part at this point.
---
But when I saw gold sellers execute scripts to make 40 level 1 orcs commit suicide to spell out a website in orgrimar I realized that anything and everything that can be exploited will be exploited.
---
I’ve played in “pre-tbc” guilds since... tbc. Yeah, even when tbc was live people wanted to play vanilla. The guild was called “reflection”.
---
Here is us killing Ragnaros https://youtu.be/j6KgHCVJrEo
---
It's not that. You're saying what blizzard needs to do, while I'm saying what I expect them to do. I didn't mean to make it sound like I'm defending them, quite the opposite: "In principle no [, they should not allowed to make money on an ambiguous post]"
---
Vanilla only allowed you to created one faction on a pvp server.  PVE, you could have both, though.
---
If emergency press "Classic"
---
you stay in your layer consistently you dont go to different layers every time you log in
---
It's a meme, hold yourself together. Also it's a sweet hat, I've got 2.
---
Please make a sub rule against classic bug reports.. there's going to be so goddamn many of them and this sub is going to turn to shit like this.
---
There are some  more vids of this raid leader, that kinda was his style. The reason Onyxia was so popular is because everyone and their mom have been in a Ony fight at some point, and we all know the phases and what he is talking about
---
I mean, did you watch it yourself? They very explicitly mention the "play session" [in that same video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=410) and also in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHMd0KC3eTY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=333) (timestamps in url)
---
I'd say mage or rogue. 
---
Mages are nice for Food/water, Teleports, and Polymorph. 
---
Rogues are nice because stealth is real strong.
---
On PvP servers you could only play one faction. I know some nefarious gankers like Angwe actually bought a second account to make a toon on the other faction to catch the more vocal ejaculations from his freshly ganked victims.
---
Was considering doing ultrawide and possibly setting up like this. Was wondering, how easy/difficult is it to get windows to snap into place like this? I’ve always felt like for wanting to have views like this 3 monitors would be easier but I haven’t had the chance to test out ultrawide.
---
Yeah it seems to me the actual player caps can be dynamic up to the limits of the server of course. Just the initial layering is here to make sure we don't have 8000 people on the same azeroth at launch. \*made up number.
---
Man.. I tried the retail thing recently because I've been hype for Classic (I have not played in 11 years). Everyone was flying around on giant dildos and magic carpets and were transmogged so much that it felt a little crazy and bloated, and I didn't know where to start with gameplay. Maybe I'd enjoy it more of I had been playing all along or something but it is not the game I remember enjoying.
---
Maybe read the fucking thing instead of crying. Nobody said anything about crossrealm sharding. Its layering aka sharding per server. Not across every server.
---
Transfers and merges are literally what they're using layering to avoid. Screw that. Transfers and mergers completely kill server spirit and break up guilds, I went through it all on retail, it's awful. I'll take layering for a few weeks over that again *any day*.
---
You're mistaking frustrating for unplayable. Competing with, say, 300 people in Northshire is going to be frustrating but fun and crazy, and way more in line with vanilla, and that's what we're getting. Now imagine there's 1,200 people in Northshire. It's just pointless.
---
Maybe I didn't make it clear enough, sorry, it *is* about a smooth launch, but because of what they're doing in regards to population.  In my eyes it's honestly one of the best compromises they can make. The alternatives are exactly what they're avoiding because they've been *proven* to be bad in the past.
---
Thank you kind sir/miss. You have done me a great service
---
Oh shit. Use old.reddit.com to get access to the flair. We'll have to fix that.
---
I have concerns about classic+. But those arent concerns for now, those are for years down the road.
---
I started playing in January 06, thinking back some of my best memories were from classic and TBC. Ever since then I have remained subbed, but I cannot think of a single time I had any “fun” or accomplished something meaningful. Not really sure why I never just unsubbed, habit or just didn’t want to give up on the old blizzard I used to know I guess.. 
---
I’m looking forward to having to rep grind, unlocking attunements etc. 
---
As you said, we’re going home.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8
---
The two raids, some of the best raid content in terms of encounter design and difficulty in WoW’s history.
---
I will never played? r/titlegore
---
I wouldn't have. I am all for adding new content, but in a progressive, not a resetting kind of way. And I am all for adding karazhan and other things after naxx has been there for a while.
---
How? I don't know. From what I know, there is no good answer so far. In any way, the progression from raiding back to questing new content and then raiding again has the potential to dissatisfy raiders quite a bit.
---
Maybe there needs to be some kind of mechanic that restricts the entry to post naxx content in a way that high level zones restrict the acces via the level difference, when you are low.
---
Or imagine getting reputation for clearing naxx and all raiders get a head start and can enter a reputation-restricted area before the casuals. For them, naxx gets modified to a 10man dungeon so they can farm and close the gap.
---
Yeah, in the end I find it more healthy to give raiders a lasting advantage, that can then be closed by casuals in a easier way, then throwing the same new content at all players, give them all access to it and let people with raiding gear faceroll the content and throw items away, while casuals gear up and equal everything out.
---
Just some thoughts...
---
Oh totally.  Plus there will be so many returning player that just have skewed memories, or just took things for granted and will miss a lot of things.
---
&gt; Beginning May 15, select WoW players will be invited to participate in a small-scale, focused closed beta test.
---
Are you not able to read, bröther?
---
No offense to you personally but I'll believe it when I hear Blizzard say it, not tipsout.
---
I mean it is pretty much sharding. People talking about sharding like it was going to be x realm. From my knowledge that was never the case.
---
as a feral druid main... god, I loved BC
---
According to amazon, it weights 4 kgs. So might not be plastic after all.
---
Gatekeeping a video game? 
---
Take, tsk.
---
nice this was actually one of my favorite features in vanilla
---
i mean, i played RIFT which was essentially a wow clone. im not toally inexperienced. im trying to make up for the route by just playing double what others do, since i have the time. at worst i just wanna be in the top 10-20%
---
Possible but not guaranteed.  
---
My worry is that we'll get caught in a cycle of split servers for longer than expected - sure some servers will be a low/medium pop and do just fine without ever seeing a layer but others could be quite dense especially since people don't feel the density due to layering.
---
Imagine being this entitled. Yikes.
---
Splitting seems much, much worse. I mean, even if you would take guilds into account, there will never be a way to preserve all relations for everyone. Merging is not so bad, really. It's just a bunch of 'new' people you can interact with.
---
Yea it really isn’t but this sub is a hivemind for endless bitching about anything it can seek its teeth into.
---
I bought copies to never open them. Its called an investment. These things will be worth money in the years to come

Perfectly understandable. I originally wrote 'allegedly', but that was a bit too harsh.
---
nah i played vanilla around the same age as you. i thought i'd just move on with my life get a good career, etc. but truth be told i still haven't found nearly as much purpose, meaning, or fun as i did when i used to play old video games including wow. career is fine, but i don't believe in sacrificing my personal satisfaction in life of which i only get one of
---
it's almost shameful to admit but nothing is more enjoyable than reliving the past. still to this day i obsessively play homm3, d2, aoe2, illicit wow servers, etc and they are all just as fun to me as they were a decade or two ago
---
Rogue PvP: Assassin Rogue PvE: Combat swords
---
Mage PvP/PvE: Frost and Fire are both viable. Frost is more survivable, Fire is more damage (PoM Pyro w/ good gear can one shot people n PvP)
---
As described they are different technologies. And yes, such a shitstorm was kicked up about temporary sharding that they would absolutely rebrand it even if they used sharding tech. While it definitely isnt something to be desired long term, it may solve the problem that 'tourists' may cause. In the long term, no one wants dead realms, no one wants sharding/layering, and (I think) that short term we accept (begrudgingly maybe) one for the sake of the other.
---
What exactly are all the lies? They've certainly been guarded and given us very little info at times but I don't think they are "constantly lying" are they?
---
It's not sharding, so keep your shards in your pants.
---
Shadow Priest or Rogue ? 
---
Mainly PvP maybe some Raids.
---
Thanks :)
---
Me too. :)
---
That'll show em!
---
Mate you sound like an SJW liberal
---
The character looks confused by the environment
---
Let's not and say we did
---
And they know you already pay, they don't need anything else from you . It's much more likely for me to get beta invite because Blizz will use that to make me a subscriber :)
---
Sure it isn’t, but garrisons suck massive donkey dick, class halls suck massivecdonkey dick. 
---
As a single player rpg experience, world of Warcraft is terrible. If that’s why you play—I’m sorry, you’ve got terrible taste in games. Wow sees it’s advantage in the multiplayer aspect, whether it’s raiding, guild chat (more gameplay that garrisons), 5 mans of any variety, PvP or grouped world content, WoW shines. I don’t pay $15 a month to sit in my instanced player housing cut off from the rest of the game world.
---
You realize that there are a lot of bugs to find that don't have to do with accuracy, right? If a talent isn't working correctly I'd rather take a newer player with an investigative outlook on why that might be happening vs a vanilla player who looks for superficial level bullshit and cries about the cast bar being 20 pixels off of where it's supposed to be located by default.
---
He might have though that WotF changed the casters unit type to undead for the duration instead of just making the target immune to Fear, Charm, Sleep.
---
Then you know we doing Tauren Druid and forsaken warrior!
---
No, you're still not getting it. It doesn't matter if not many people quit (but they will, it's inevitable). The servers will hold those people, and those people will be spread out across the world, meaning they won't need to use layers, they'll likely just increase spawns as necessary and cap the server population, **if** this happened, which it won't. But **if** it did, there's ways to handle it that involve no layering/sharding and that's what they'll do. People are just assuming evil Blizz will ruin it which is unfair after all the hard work they've put into making Classic as good as they can.
---
Layering is going to ensure servers have a very healthy pop with no queues, that's what it's there for. It's actually really smart, people just deeply misunderstand it. Don't worry about it, play the game in August and you'll never notice it.
---
If you see someone, then eventually you will all always be on the same server; and even if that someone gets on a different layer during the initial roll out,  you can always get them back to your later by giving them a group (or guild) invite
---
Ultrawide isn't too bad, snapping is easy once you set it up. By default it will want to take up half the screen though.
---
Needs more Neptulon and Therazane

it is extremely unlikely because there are different zones for the level range? There really arent that many and you have to go to pretty much all of them. If you have never leveled on a vanilla server and seen at least a handful of people multiple times in the world during the process you are probably the only person alive or never played vanilla.
---
I never said prices would drop from high to low I said they would be lower than they should be because of the layering and because a lot of income comes in fixed amounts (vendor, quest etc.) that is a bad thing. I never said its gonna be doomsday and there will be 1000 black lotuses for free on the ah idk who you are arguing with there, just that its gonna have a significant negative effect on the economy which it obviously will. Also btw the fact that layering might not occur on small servers is not an upside to the system if that is something positive that is proof that the system is a problem.
---
All the zones that have irrevocably changed from Cataclysm. That's most :P
---
Original barrens, non-Sylvanas infested Silverpine Forest, bone dry salt flats of Thousand Needles.  I'm just excited to spend needed time in all those zones that you skip now due to easy leveling.

Can't wait for layering abuse!

I don’t care if it’s made of dogshit, I must have it
---
We don't need 88,000 people in the sub to comment on people who comment on people that comment that they didn't get one. More efficient would be the people who did reporting.
---
Greetings to Africa. Did you main a Shaman?
---
Layering is a garbage solution just like the rest that got us to retail wow. They should be Coughing up for servers and force transfers if they die. Everyone saying layering is a more seemless less clunky process than above is delusional. I'd rather have picked a server that died and then transfered to a thriving one and having experienced a real classic levelling experience.
---
Sick. Where did you get the wallpaper from?
---
They weren’t in vanilla
---
Let's not and say we didn't
---
Hi, /u/cry8a8y
---
CHeck if you have some old BoE's lying in your bank, my old chars got a few ones that aren't available anymore (like the defias set, a green twohandsword etc) and you can sell them for a few 100k on the AH, depending on your server. With that gold you can buy tokens to get an active sub when Vanilla launches.
---
Dun Morogh and Loch Modan are really well designed. Gnomes and Dwarves have a wonderful starting zone and early quest progression.
---
the vanguard video should not be used as a reference because most of the bosses had no abilities or for example, they did not apply any debuffs or have armor/health issues and mobs were missing.
---
I was in grad school.  Got a PhD in WoW. And a masters in something, I think.
---
LiveWallpaper, a Steam app. Just searched Ragnaros. There’s a lot of cool vanilla WoW animated wallpapers on it

I won’t have a lot of time to play at first and I’d like to do both pve and pvp. I’ve played warrior since cata, but locks look really fun and farming gold seems a lot easier. How are warriors with farming gold? I’d like to play arms preferably, I know it’s good in pvp but how about pve. Also, I know it’ll take a longer time to level, but I’m not worried about racing to 60.
---
You should sub and tell us if you got into the beta
---
My biggest concern is that we get forced into a content schedule where you either keep up or miss out on stuff.
---
Pretty sure you wont. The layering happens upon entering the realm,so you wouldn't be floating between layers while playing as you would already be in one. The layer you are in wouldn't change so you wouldn't have ppl popping in and out of it, which is what sharding is. Layering is much less dynamic
---
so for me a lot of my friends and friendly guilds are rolling horde and most of my excitement comes from world PvP against them while leveling.  if all my horde friends are on another layer through STV and onward then that's literally one of the bigger disappointments for me
---
Be careful. Lots of trolls out today, folks.
---
pretty much in same boat, although I'm leaning more Druid as I'll be on a PvP server and they have the ability to pick and choose what fights they want to deal with.  I also like the idea of being mobile, and shaman is a little too turrety/tied to totems.

It says so in the announcement, yes.
---
*"Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."*
---
&gt;backing up the theory about how much stuff private servers have got wrong already.
---
" backing up the theory about how much stuff private servers have got wrong already. " - Blizz are referencing a correct build with the correct regen rates, private servers are not and are guessing
---
I know your question was already answered, but there was a bit more to it. 
---
Correctly in Classic/Vanilla, when you get attacked when sitting, you would automatically be crit. This was not up to debate and was well understood. 
---
On private servers, though, this could be used to proc things such as Reckoning or Enrage from doing so, as they proc on crit. 
---
This wasn't a strategy people recalled very clearly from proper vanilla, so up to debate on if those 'guaranteed crits' from sitting were supposed to trigger those 'when crit' procs. As they drastically change the game play of those relevant classes when leveling. 
---
The OP is more or less reporting that them triggering such was indeed wrong on private servers. Which changes leveling plans for a lot of people who incorporated that strategy.
---
One of the advantages of an MMO for a beta is that other players are "part of the content", so I would hope for a bigger pool than JUST content creators. They need people to group with and run things with too.
---
I’d prefer a hard merge down the road if server populations are suffering but this is why there is suck a lively debate. Everyone has different preferences about what would work best. I just wish blizzard would turn layering off altogether for at least 1 realm so people who are okay with the trade offs can take them
---
Totally agree, I look forward to good ole Dun Morogh.
---
I just spoke with a rep as well. Hopefully these inquiries are going up the chain. It's just not like Blizzard to sell out of a CE in a handful of hours, and I hope they reopen preorders. We were supposed to learn from Nintendo's mistake, not recreate it!
---
This looks good on first glance. Do you plan on trying in beta for early levels and update the guide or is it mostly finished?
---
I personally Don't Mind LFD and LFR.. Trust me at first i HATED it. The way the game is now. How anti-social people are. LFR and LFD are needed... 
---
But i 100% Flying in main world is just broken AF
---
Agreed!
---
What is even trying to be said here... ?
---
Yeah thought so already. Should be a easy fix though.
---
Early? It's evening here... Oh wait, USA = Global time
---
Replying to check later
---
That’s actually not that big of a deal, and anyways, keeping one unified AH is way easier to program ... so their is about zero percent chance they will have multiple AHs
---
Ok you do it and we watch
---
Yeah, it is important to distinct between average and median. I'd say median is the better to look at for this, since average favours rich people, which does not tell much about the general public by it self.
---
&gt;Denmark keeps up with the us in lots of ways but median disposable income its pretty far behind
---
Well, DPI is not that great of an indicator when looking at high tax countries. Denmark is far behind on DPI because we have extremely high taxes, but you have to remember that we don't just loose these money. Healthcare is pretty much completely free, education is not only free, we get paid quite a bit during our education, we have a big safety net for things like when you are "in between" jobs you still get a lot of money and such things.
---
And then there are all sort of things like how living expenses and such (Norway and Switzerland are extremely expensive to live in).
---
I guess it also somewhat depends on the business you are in. The average income for my field is a bit higher in Denmark than in America (engineering), but other fields might favour America.
---
It depends how sticky layers are. If I'm on a new layer every login that chance decreases considerably.
---
I'm still going to be opposed to multiple instances of the out door world that we can phase through regardless of implementation. All I can do is hope it is for as short a period as possible.
---
....why? Most of them will just be running around, trying to push hype, not reporting bugs, or reporting based on their private server "vanilla" experience...
---
I totally disagree. On my server world player interaction dropped by like 70% with the introduction of flying mounts. They made the world feel abandoned because everyone was fluttering solo in the sky, away from any form of interaction. Thus obviously pvp was also effected as a result.
---
I sincerely hope I *won't* get one, because it would be wasted. I am not going to shell out money for a sub fee just so I can work for them for a few days.
---
not really, there are always private servers
---
noob question: what's to gain from raiding an enemy city other than pride?
---
I'm willing to bet money for 99% of the beta 1000 people on this subreddit will get invited lmao.
---
This beta is going to be exclusive to content creators.
---
sell tank runs on dungeons, charge a gold amount and/or get all the items (except the ones that the people paying specifically want)
---
other than that its just profs really.
---
Same. People say others will stop because lvling is long and gearing is "hard" but I think most will play and fall in love
---
Thanks for the hint! I'll let you know if I'm getting rich :-)
---
So true
---
Seeing a ganker phase in and out would really piss me off.
---
39 with three kids. This guy gets it.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Launch is @ 3pm on the 26th.
---
- 3pm 26th until 9pm the 27th - ideally level 32-34
---
- 6am - midnight 8/28 - 9/2
---
140 hours during my vacation. That's ~30 hours (maybe 20 if I'm slow) of farming PreBIS. Should be in a good position to punch onyxia in the face before 1st reset.
---
Funny thing is that I'm going back to college
---
I will do that. Thanks!!!
---
I hope your right but when it turns out to be wrong im hoping ppl dont regret it then.
---
Ragnarok 2 had a great system where when you logged in, you were put into a random "channel" and you could always simply change to a different one where your friends were
---
i'd imagine it wouldn't be too hard to smartly scale down the number of available channels as population dies down or character levels spread out
---
Anyone know if beta keys are sent out already or ?
---
I guess you missed the part where I said "at the outset." Also, the problem of faction imbalance did exist.
---
Thank you! This is the point of my post. Some people will just say "too bad" or say that it's just whining, but I really think there's a problem here and if enough people ask, I am sure it will get fixed
---
lol I've no desire for a beta key. Not going to waste two months of my time just to lose it all in August. I'm sure plenty of people will report all of the changes they have made.       
---
Back to random skill WoW for now
---
That's what I was thinking. If you are in one layer and your friend is in another you have a fool proof way of escaping any open world PvP encounters. 
---
So RIP wow classic PvP, we hardly knew ye!
---
you never stood around an arena in school waiting to fight your classmates to death? you missed out on childhood my guy. 
---
If they don’t restock I will be so fucking pissed. I only found out about it in the evening, same day as the announcement, and it was already fucking sold out! How the hell were there THAT many people jumping on this? Did they make like 5 of them??
---
First sub listed during 07/06. Will edit if invite is recieved eventually.
---
Sending out my resume trying to get a job that pays at least double. Studying for my next cert in the meantime. Tired of ever worrying about money and would rather use that mental energy to enjoy life and play some Vanilla WoW.
---
If you group with someone it will put you in the same layer.
---
If only we knew in which country Blizzard develops its games 🤔
---
damn raptors tying feathers to their arms. what they wanna fly or something? insanity
---
You’re missing the point, this Beta has nothing to do with accuracy. Absolutely no one can find missing or incorrect information. It’s been 15 years, there’s no one living or dead capable of that recall. They have the actual 1.12 client/servers running internally for accuracy testing, they don’t need us for that.
---
You don't get credit for trying to put out a fire that you started.
---
They created the need for sharding (and let's not kid ourselves, layering and sharding are coke and pepsi here) with a shared sub.  They're giving two million retail players free access to Classic to try and keep them from unsubbing during retail content droughts, which in turn is a problem they created for themselves by turning retail into a game where you can complete all current content in an afternoon without ever talking to another person. 
---
Layering is both less intrusive, and less effective at solving the problem than sharding, but it's still bad.
---
I, personally, am tired of them "listening to us" and "compromising" on fixes to problems that THEY CAUSED.
---
The compromise on sharding? Necessary because THEY insist on a shared sub to make more money.
---
It's loot trading all over again.  You want to fuck over your players to make more money? Fine. Do it.  I get it.  You're a publicly traded company.  We expect it.  But don't spit on our cupcake and tell us it's frosting.
---
I hate flying too, but what if they added some sort of flying combat!
---
Yeah, just showing players will probably incentivize enough of them to avoid jacking themselves into long BG queues. If not, they could put a wait time on rolling there. Say there is a 5% imbalance you have a 2 hour wait. 20% imbalance, 20 hour wait? I dunno, something.
---
Dont think you had payed transfer before TBC, you had free transfers from high pop to low pop tho.
---
More streamer spam? Can we cut this shit out already
---
Blizzard:  "We heard you guys loud and clear how you feel about layering so we are bringing back sharding!"
---
Better?
---
Yeah, they don't get to decide anything. They don't make balance decisions based off the beta. This is just to find bugs and stress test the servers...
---
I'm 34 years old. sorry
---
Hehe, been playing Horde since Wrath. I need a change of pace. Alliance has pretty zones and kitty cats. Plus after SoO and WoD and now BFA, I'm so sick of orcs and trolls.
---
Exactly this. Fcuk the streamers. They ALL got beta keys, at least the ones' that were at Blizzard yesterday for their "Media" day, as was mentioned by Ion. Even the streamers that have previously shit on the idea of WoW Classic originally all will have keys.
---
What annoys me the most is that they have the Dev's ear. I just hope they don't screw up Classic with all their "ideas".
---
I'm disabled.
---
you don't need to buy the expansion at least.  just pay the subscription and play Classic servers
---
I think the sustained amount of... heightened emotion in the last few years says yes.
---
And i am fine with a few hours there. Make the journey take longer. I will accept layering, but i think it should be turned off after a week or so, not as long as Phase 1.
---
Get down- he's going to say the word!
---
Classic Gamers Rise Up!
---
Ah, yes, a reddit post of a screenshot of another reddit post.  What a time to be alive.
---
If I haven't gotten mine yet, then no one else has either...
---
&gt; Sharding breaks up multiple servers and stitches them together like multiple abominations.
---
Blizz had said multiple times that there will be no cross-realm sharding. There never was going to be an cross-realm sharding. If 'layering' is to you just sharding on a single server, than nothing has changed by the recent announcement/change.
---
Well, to be *fair*... it doesn't have the days of the week on it. I'm guessing this one is homemade
---
Having one or two servers without any population control could work, I assume they have a way to turn off layering per server. I pity the poor soul who joins the 20k+ server not realising what it is
---
where do you guys say you get feared to if you're already in africa
---
I see what you mean. I guess that's technically correct, but we have /some/ precedent that they wanted to limit it by  zones, at least initially. From what I read, layering seems to be an extension of the sharding tech. Sharding in general isnt new either (it's a concept used outside of WoW), so I'm sure it's possible to still layer and not have it affect the whole continent. 
---
&gt; not constrained by zone
---
Yup, it's a set of zones (in this case all zones in a continent). Its feasible that they could end up limiting that set, so when you go to say, a level 30 zone, everyone is pushed down to layer 1. Of course, it's too early to tell either way, I'm just citing the possibility, before everyone rallies with their pitchforks
---
 8 consecutive days off every 4 weeks without even using vacation.
---
\- Jealous.
---
That’s not what they said though.
---
They said “you’ll be able to see the person in your party”. Nowhere did they say that this action changed layers. Lol.
---
wtf I like layering now
---
I don't think so i remember leveling my hunter which was post naxx patch and i always had wcb and ony head buff
---
Lol temper temper. I'd like to be optimistic that they will follow through with their word, but something tells me there will be a reason why they can't. It will be engine restrictions or higher than expected populations, etc. Also how long do you supposed phase 1 will last? If its anything like the original release 6 phases split up over 3 years, each phase will likely last 3-6 months. There will be a good amount of players already level capped in the first month maybe even the first few weeks.  
---
The solution to layering is active players dwindling until we can all fit on a single layer? What if the opposite is true and server populations grow? Will we be stuck with layering until the game inevitably dies like retail?
---
Yes I did. And while I understand where youre coming from with his mention of play session, I still disagree with you because of the context of the entire video.
---
He mentions the transferring of layers occurring mainly to make sure you are able to play with your friends ie party invites. He then goes on to mention right after that once you are in that layer with your friend, the system will try to stick to you on that layer and minimizing movement. How can this be true if you are simply logging out to change layers?
---
He also says that you could be leveling at elwynn forest, see someone there, and then go all the way up north (which would be many levels later) and still see the same person. This is definitely not an indication of the same login, considering how long it takes to level in classic and that is a bit of a ridiculous assumption to think both you and the person in this scenario are still on the same, no log out session... Do you see where I'm coming from?
---
By inviting those people to group with alts parked in another shard.
---
"huge amount" LOL
---
Ah fair enough, my bad :)
---
Layering isn't mutually exclusive to cross realm either what a silly argument.
---
Best zone in the game imo.  I’m playing horde this time around though so I won’t be enjoying it right off the bat.
---
False
---
BC was amazing.
---
Sure.
---
For a few short kill quests? Sure. But once drops are needed or single use items on the ground thag must be waited for. It's certainly slower.
---
It's part of their marketing strategy. Streaming is basically free advertising for them.
---
now do one for wrath
---
Hmm, I actually can't find it in any of the interviews I watched, it was possibly in a tweet or post. So much info going around from the streamers and youtubers that I can't keep it all straight. So I guess assume false until proven otherwise
---
To Goldshire!
---
I know, what i am saying is i would prefer no layering. Cap the server populations, them merge servers at a later date when some start to die off.
---
I always jumped around the top, landing only on the main beams that ran down from the center of the bank.
---
Having the same conflict. Eventually I keep settling on druid because I'll like tanking 5 man's or off tanking raids, and healing raids, and doing stealth runs with rogues in DM or AV or wpvp. Leveling will be easy. 
---
Lot easier to switch playstyles by putting on some gear as opposed to rerolling, and it's really fun to have bear/cat forms. Can go meme boomkin PvP at some point after I've gotten some spell power gear. 
---
And shaman totems might become annoying to have to keep up all the time. Will still be able to enjoy the chain heal animation even if I'm not casting it.
---
Sorry to hear about that. I know what it's like to live with lots of kids xD  
---
Its unfortunate about the noise but recess and play is vital and frankly most kids/schools don't get/allow enough of it. 
---
I suggest you invest in some noise-cancelling headphones. You can also blare death metal out of your window! That should scare them away! :D
---
Is it like you can only get an invite if you have an active subscription or you can get an invite anyway but you won't be able to log until you buy a sub?
---
Is everyone going in with a 100 people so they can swap layers? Jesus. Most of us I would assume have 4 or 5 friends we know playing WOW, but keep blowing it out of proportion
---
It actually does according to blizzard themselves. Go read the blue post about the beta announcement.
---
I wonder what term ending in -ing they will come up with to apply to world bosses so they continue using modern tech to solve vanilla player frustrations. 
---
We said we wouldn't use phasing in classic and we wont. But sharding may be necessary to handle those starter areas. But it will only be those starter areas! So we're adding a tech called layering to deal with over population but its not sharding and it will only be those first few weeks and continent wide. Ok maybe all of phase 1. Ok so there are issues with world bosses so we are implementing a new tech called 'threading'. Basically a large guild may be part of a different 'thread' while still in the same realm. It's not a different shard or phase or layer. It's the same layer, just a different thread. In that thread they can kill the same world boss that another guild killed that morning, then the server merges that thread with a future thread in a seamless manner and that world boss is removed from that future thread. So no additional world bosses were actually added, but the guild doesn't have to deal with the inconvenience of waiting days for a response or fighting for the raid encounter.
---
Paid transfers were released in like mid 2006 at the end of Vanilla. Definitely before TBC.
---
3.0 aoe abilities were also cancer.  We started to get this with prot Paladins once they geared up in tbc but it went nuts post wrath.
---
The IP addresses on that page are sadly out of date.
---
No they actually said they would add certain resistances etc to bosses just for fun.
---
*fuck the beta*
---

Does it increase your chances for an invite? Yes. Does it entitle you to an invite? No.
---
For those asking about "keys", there are no keys anymore. It either gets enabled or not for your account. You'll see it in the launcher when they enable it and probably an email notifying you.
---
Your face if you realise what classic is all about and how wrong you are would be funnier
---
Don't get scammed, folks.
---
Public libraries don't exist everywhere.  Getting to them is either free, or fast, and often neither.
---
First of all, a cell phone, even a smart phone, can be relatively cheap.  You don't need an active account to use wi-fi or to call 9-11.
---
The resale value of a cell phone is next to nothing, unless it's a flagship phone, so if you already own one when you become homeless, selling it would be silly, since it's the single most useful tool you could really have if you found yourself homeless.
---
I'd buy a WW2 fighter pilot game if I wanted to play a game like that......
---
Much love, thanks!
---
This sub is full of players who have been playing on vanilla pservers. We know a lot of classes have non-viable specs.
---
The point wasn’t to solve mob competition problems.
---
They didn’t have dynamic respawns in vanilla
---
Fun
---
They had them, sure, and the overall player count grew, but this stuff did happen. It happened to *me* personally - we merged and suddenly some our raiders wanted to join one of the new guilds that had progressed further than us. Killed our raid team, caused fights, killed our guild. Happened to a few on our server. Would not have happened otherwise.
---
I get that you think it's good because it doesn't affect everyone, but you're forgetting that the majority of people aren't going to either notice or care about layering either. Most people on this sub alone still don't even quite understand what it is. When launch week comes the majority will not care, because their game will be working with no queues and they'll rare, if ever, notice layering happen, and it'll be for a few weeks. That's the biggest advantage here, it's temporary.
---
There's a difference between waiting a bit and being unable to ever get a tag in on a mob because you're competing with 5x the amount of people you would otherwise be competing with. At what point do you believe it stops being okay? 1,000 people in Northshire? 5k? 10k?

---
With all the "advice" going around that "druids won't get into raids", there might be less of them than normal.
---
Regardless, a healer is a healer, and it sucks to have to d/e gear. You'll get into raids.
---
Ooh it's been so long since I've seen someone butcher the word "exalted". I can really feel the vanilla feelings again!
---
I mean you can always play on a private server, not much different than a beta.
---
Blizzard is based in California so the world (of Warcraft) does revolve around their time zone.
---
When in TBC
---
Not possible in phase2.  But if people are going to do world pvp and city raids at all, there's no reason they wouldn't do them in phase 1 (and honestly, it makes more sense to do them before honor anyway, since DKs would be a non-issue).
---
I completely agree, but Saricc is not wrong. There are lots of people who say "leave Classic exactly the way it was" and surprisingly most of those people I have seen are people who have never played Vanilla. 
---
Those are the people that will quit after a week and are also the reason for the layering due to a massive influx of those types of players for the first few weeks.
---
have u joined the discord? lots of guilds there man. im sure most guilds will have people 'holding' spots one each layer for various "reasons"
---
NATHREZIM REPRESENT!
---
yes. email blizz and let them know.
---
&gt; To all the people who were playing vanilla, was this an option?
---
It was. The restriction to one faction only applied to PvP servers. Also, I plan on doing the same, and I *have* done the same way back when.
---
I wish
---
Then how come most people on here are saying they are going to be a ret paladin in raids?
---
Seems like they're in denial.
---
Was that a guild on Burning Legion? Or are you asking just in general
---
I had come to terms with sharding in starting  zones, it wasn't a totally authentic launch experience, but it was only impacting a very small part of the experience. This is something that is without a doubt worth complaining about and if not at least questioning and having concerns about. This is a massive change to the original vanilla experience. To me this ultimately just looks like rebranded server groups with cross-realm and a planned merge.
---
PVP servers dont let you roll cross faction. Yet another reason PVP servers are the superior choice.
---
I see. I can handle it not being as effective as long as it’s possible at all. I saw a lot of people talking like it was straight up impossible. 
---
Not being able to raid with it is okay. I’m not sure if I’m going to raid in Classic anyways.
---
Welcome to real WoW, where the game is fun and not all carrots on sticks.
---
bin aktuell bei Mage oder Warrior. Warrior ist eigentlich seit 2005 meine Main-Klasse. Deswegen habe ich mal überlegt was Anderes zu spielen. Mal sehen.
---
They were added near the end of vanilla. I think right before Naxx came out.
---
So how do i know if ive been selected?
---
He NEVER mentioned that inviting someone would make them jump layers. Stop saying that’s what he said, because he didn’t. They could have an instance like mechanism where only you two see each other but others don’t. They could also have the invited not able to see resources on your layer, only on his. 
---
No jumping of layers was ever mentioned. Lmfao.
---
MMO champion isn’t blizzard so the accuracy of that post is debatable.
---
Yup, played most of Vanilla on 56k haha, parents didn't want to pay more for dsl/cable, it was much more expensive back then compared to now
---
Gee it's almost as if it was a well designed system from the get go and people started sperging out about it for no reason whatsoever because they didn't get the finer details.
---
Old news.
---
Still no answer on if we need to have an active sub to get picked for beta access.
---
I know you need a sub to access the beta, but I was hoping to get an answer on if I need an active sub just to get picked.
---
I support layering. Seems like a logically way to achieve the goal we all want which is a cohesive classic experience with no sharding...
---
Pretty damn selfish if you ask me
---
Wow had huge amounts of influence from Everquest, and that showed in its class design.  While many people were pretty accepting of the fact, a lot did not like being pigeonholed into certain roles based solely on their class choice.
---
TBC took all of this into consideration and changed that.  While Vanilla holds a spot in everyone's heart, I feel like TBC is overwhelmingly considered to be the best that WoW has ever been.
---
Even my 1440p monitor looked fuzzy on the old one. This is crispy buddy. Thanks

Man I hope youre not a clicker.

I'm not sure you could pull this off consistently cause there's no way to guarantee which layer you log on
---
1. Start twitch account
---
2. Stream for 5 minutes of blank screen
---
3. Receive Beta invite.
---
4. EZ
---
Will they still notify testers via email?
---
One of you switches layers.
---
My YouTube recommended videos are all classic wow content.
---
Presumably they will remove layering when it is “safe” to do so, but certainly before phase 2. It’s almost certainly NOT going to stay until then.
---
Fuck no! lol
---
o7
---
Pre drugs Lindsey Lohan, tendies and football though, OOOOHHHH YEAAAH! I like Macho Man Randy Savage and Motorhead as much as the next red blooded Azerothian, but lets be honest its a tough call.
---
but i already spent $750 on ebay for mine wtf dudes... he said it would arrive in 7-9 business days
---
They're not sharding the continent though, they're sharding the entire world. Layering also doesn't mix realms, unlike sharding.
---
The main question is whether characters will persist on the same "shard/layer" throughout launch. If this is the case then it is essentially just having several realms nested into one "named" realm that are progressively merged.
---
they told you in their classic wow post...
---
Nice try.
---
What I'm saying is there will most likely be the possibility to do it that way assuming that the servers are big enough to have 2 or 3 layers, and if there is the possibility to do it then people are going to try to do it.
---
I know for sure the hardcore players are going to find ways of abusing the system anyway they can.
---
But maybe the system is not going to be abused by the casual players then sobeit, but to assume that no one is gonna use it that way is not being honest either.
---
The answer *has* to be here
---
You don't pay for updates. You pay to play the game as is
---
 Lmao
---
I struggled getting access to WoW when I was a kid too. I know it's not much but I would like to help as well. Please pm the server and character names and I'll ensure they're ganked the shit of out in STV or wherever I find them. It's the least I could do.
---
i mean this is kinda like saying you hate meters but people would be expecting you to not park your car cause of them. like, its a shitty thing but its not a dealbreaker.
---
Because an ok solution is better than no solution or a incredibly bad one. There are changes i'd like to see made with layering like a 10-30min layer switching cooldown, but I am happy that I will be able to get to lvl 10 w/i a week now.
---
Yup I remember JAGD. It was great back then when guilds actually developed reputations on their respective realms
---
To be fair I never played any CoD games before, and I know the PDP system has many issues, but MW2 was such a great multiplayer FPS. Sure there were overtly overpowered playstyles (SCAR-H noobtube, UMP45, heartbeat sensor, thermal, etc.) but for me it was so great for similar reasons that classic WoW is: the depth of flavor. One of my favorite guns in that game is the F2000, just because I love the "feeling" of the gun, and trying to make it viable beyond it's poor recoil/damage. I also love running other strange setups like SOH pro stopping power and ninja with EBR FMJ and an RPG, and button mashing the EBR and using my RPG for hitmarkers. So many great ways to build a class.
---
The community also found so many clever and distinct approaches within the perk system, like knifing, quickscoping, danger close riot shield, etc, that I've never found in any FPS since. The maps felt unique, natural, and fun too, but some were better than others. 
---
Maybe that's not what you were talking about but that's why I love it.
---
Email I guess and it will probably say "classic WoW beta" in your games tab at Battle.net
---
Yes, yes it will.
---
Vanilla servers were 2.5k players.  That means that with only 1250 players per faction, most of us STILL remember feeling like the world was huge and full of people.  You are saying that if that is doubled, then it still feels wrong?
---
Ge out of here.
---
Oh I'm absolutely sure they have the technology to do so, but they haven't mentioned any plans to do so yet. Would be great though.
---
Seems likely, don’t you think?
---
Ever played either in vanilla? I’m Rogue main since MoP but played shadow in vanilla. It was rough leveling till 40 but really fun once you got your full kit. Very strong in PVP but not a great raid spec. I was forced to heal a lot and I didn’t love that. I’m gonna play Rogue in classic.
---
Original account made prior to 2006 only sorry bro shit outta luck 
---
/S

"To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."
---
You do realize there will be tens of thousands of people in the starting areas? There absolutely needs to be SOME kind of instancing, I think layering is the most elegant one.
---
It's literally written stress test schedule just above. You copy pasted it. No, they aren't the same thing.
---
This disingenuously misrepresents sharding by implying it was cross realm zones and ignores any potential issues caused by layering.  Also, layering does literally nothing for overpopulation of starting zones.
---
Does anybody read anything about Classic? Ion said past phase 1 there will never be any layering.
---
Hows the shadow priest? I heard they and druids were neglected in this era
---
Not viable for pve?
---
&gt;  i'm wondering how players that didn't play during Vanilla will help to find missing or incorrect informations ?
---
You assume that the Beta will be about that, but it may well not be. They stated that the Beta stages are more like Stress tests - and in any case, it's often useful to have testers of various backgrounds because they have different perspectives, and therefore are able to find different problems: The ones breathing Classic might overlook something that sticks out like a sore thumb to unfamiliar people, or vice versa, the newbies might just not realize a certain thing actually *is* supposed to work a certain way, and it currently does not.
---
Can’t tell if you’re serious
---
And still relevant.
---
PLEASE beta access for holders of the Blizzcon 2018 ticket.
---
Jesus Christ I didn’t realize it got that high. Insane
---
What if instead of you getting pulled to *their* layer, they just pulled into yours? I dont think this layer hoping is going to work that easily or be an issue in regards to resources.
---
I didn’t get an invite yet
---
Mages can teleport everywhere and make portals.never have to worry about food. Warlocks can summon people which is really useful in long dungeons. PvP they are both great ccers. They are both dps only so groups can be hard to find sometimes.
---
Let’s keep it that way
---
I don't care if they invite streamers and let them interview the developers. I just find it baffling that they didn't put out the info themselves. They obviously did something (the Classic WoW homepage and news), which are really nicely done. They could have just put another page with a bit more detailed info.
---
As it stands now it's not the streamers advertising for Blizzard but Blizzard giving a massive boost to otherwise no-name streamers. :P
---
Then switch to higher stam legit gear and have 80% HP?
---
Cause we play for fun for it's just a vidya game
---
Are they though? I see a few posts asking about it but I can't remember many posts saying they definitely will.
---
Also ret isn't that bad for the raid as a support class. In our Naxx team we have a prot and a ret paladin and I seriously doubt we'd get through it much faster if we switched them out for warriors and rogues. Our problem is mostly that attendance is low and we have to teach the fights to new people every week.
---
We'll find out when people get in. Just have to wait and see for now. :)
---
&gt; I've been playing since EU release and I sure as hell don't feel any more competent.
---
Ditto. Hell, I don't even *want* Beta access.
---
People who don't know the game inside out already are the ones to try &amp; do stupid shit ("play the game wrong way"). That way we can find bugs and not intented behaviour in game.
---
So I spent a few minutes last night looking around for old screenshots from back in the day. I didn't have anything showing ilvl comparisons, but I think I was just confusing my Mage and Priest a bit when I was leveling. My Priest was far more geared than my Mage (he was geared but not Atiesh geared. I PvP'd with him more than my Priest while the Priest was purely for raiding).
---
So there you have it - I'm likely incorrect since it'd been so long.
---
Well that is an RP style event. If they are RPing they would say stuff like "To arms brothers of the allinace! The enemy is upon us!" or some shit like that. Otherwise what's the point of RPing?
---
Test
---
Ritual of Doom
---
Curse of Doom
---
and if kiting works (basically being able to pull mobs for an infinite distance)
---
There are quite a few people playing ret paladins.
---
I have talked to at least 3 friends irl who all wanted to play paladin until I told them what it was like in vanilla.
---
Thanks :D . Are they both good dps or on the lower end
---
I remember having epic battles in spires of arak, nagrand and in front of the garrison back in WoD. But I was a member of a dedicated wpvp guild so ymmv. I agree on the cohesive community part but that's more because of sharding/x-realm lfg and lfr (and gearscore) , TBC and WotLK had amazing community on my realms.
---
Moar dots
---
Haha, gotta love Firebase. Cheers man.
---
"class viability"
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Layering nee sharding, is a terrible solution to a self inflicted problem.
---
Will it make the game worse? I think so.
---
Would I have more fun if they fixed the problem (tourists) instead of trying to treat the symptom (massive population drop offs when tourists leave)? I think so.
---
Was it one of my "If they do X I won't play" lines in the sand? No.
---
I intend to play classic for years.  I can put up with a few months of their stupid bullshit.
---
Something can be bad, but not disqualifying.
---
I don't want pickles on my sandwich, but if there's no other food, I'm not going to starve myself.
---
I think it will be plenty chaotic, since there are no dynamic spawns. So you still have 3k people per layer, split up among the starting zones.
---
LMAO now that was funny!!
---
If you want to raid and not heal, you are going to have a **way easier time** doing it on a rogue than shadow priest. Most guilds won't bring a shadow priest unless they have an abundance of warlocks with them. So if you want to go shadow for pvp you are going to be respeccing to holy every time you want to raid. With rogue, there are some builds you could use that would be "viable" for both, but at least your gear for raiding and pvp will be the same for the most part. Unlike Shadow/Holy because of all of the +heal gear you will need for raiding.
---
so iterate on the concept and make it better
---
Truth, if any of them would spend the time to think about what they're saying, they would realize how ridiculous and counterproductive not doing ANYTHING to fix a problem that plagued the original WoW for the first 2-3 months of its release in 04. But most people who are saying this didn't actually play during those first few months (let alone vanilla), so they don't know wtf they're talking about since I'm convinced that most of them were in grade school of younger when the game was released.
---
It was in the original announcement that you did indeed need a sub.
---
Has any information been released as to whether things gained within the beta are hard wiped on day 1 launch?
---
Exactly the same argument casinos use. But they are still regulated. Come on dude be smarter than that.
---
Nice bait, why do you even care?
---
How does healing as a paladin work? Do they tend to be meleeing during fights as well as healing? Standing back out of the fight?
---
If your major gameplay revolves around farming then it is a big deal. It’s going to make a difference to the people who game the AH all day
---
Is this the new “I have candy in my van” approach
---
I always wondered what the internet tough guys in WoW looked like IRL. Now I know. Thanks.
---
Not to mention who says which person actually switches layers? You may not be the one moving even if you want to.
---
Nope :) You’ll still be here whoopin up a storm
---
I feel the opposite, that they did not listen to us on this. We said no sharding at all, they implemented some form of it. I want a smaller server community. Cap the server population, then merge servers later on.

---
For me, it's going to be the fulfillment of a very very old desire.
---
I was 16 in 2004 and had grown up as a huge fan of the Warcraft series.  I was beyond psyched for WoW, but due to where we lived I could only get like 28k internet.  We also only had one phone line, so anyone using the internet had to disconnect if a phone call needed to be made.  Needless to say, I never got to play the game.
---
Fast forward to freshman year of college, I finally got that sweet sweet high speed internet.  I started playing in the Fall of 2006, just a few months before TBC dropped.  I didn't hit 60 before then, so I went straight to Outlands at 58.  I always wondered what life would have been like at 60.
---
Now I'm a 31 year old man with a gigabit connection and a kick ass gaming PC and 30 days of PTO/year.  Getting to 60 and finally experiencing Strat, Scholo, UBRS, MC, Ony, and DM at the appropriate level is going to be like tying up a loose end that has been bothering me for over a decade, and I absolutely cannot wait.
---
It's not like they can't still shape how people are distributed across the servers.
---
They can always slap character creation restrictions or queues on servers that have way more people on them to help distribute players more evenly, even if they could technically support an unlimited number of players due to layering.
---
Spirit set is “of the whale” spirit, Stam. As well as “of spirit”. So you don’t lose all your hp when you put it on.
---
Do you think the collectors edition wotlk frosty pet would work for classic??
---
Anything can be anything with a few steps thrown in. 
---
&gt;Layering makes some sense if its 5000+ players. But otherwise, thats a like a few months without seeing half your server.. It's.. Like, the whole leveling experience with only seeing a fraction of your server population, how come this isn't bothering more of you?
---
It's dynamic. If one week after launch your server population falls to a "normal" level then everyone will be collapsed into a single layer.
---
usually 2-3 months, but I didn't hard-core-level. Took it at my own pace each day after work.
---
This was over 2-3 years on multiple servers. Played two Hunters and one Mage. Felt like the mage was faster but it was also the last one I played so I was more experienced at that point.
---
What happens if Johnny who made his character on day one wants to play with a friend from a different layer?
---
They're ok.  Not the best for PvE or PvP.  Mana issues...
---
I'd pick a different class honestly, but do what you enjoy.
---
It has been since the introduction of Warmode. Though a similar system to Layering was used since WoD where multiple copies of individual zones were being employed on high-pop realms but were not CRZ (aside from cross-realm grouping). Prior to Warmode, CRZ only kicked in when a zone was underpopulated, to try and get more people sharing a zone.
---
With Warmode enabled, now every shard is a CRZ because it's trying to keep every shard occupied with somewhat balanced faction representation so world PvP can occur, which often means pulling in other players from other servers in your battlegroup and beyond.
---
You have no clue.
---
Ret paladin's are good in pvp. So how isn't that a viable spec?
---
Serious pvpers werent taking part in city raids in classic either.
---
DKs only really affect you if pushing your rank past 8. the vast majority of people will aim for 8 or 10 hit it once, then not give a fuck about rank. 
---
The bigger problem is interest in repeat ability. Once youve invaded Org and killed thrall once, is it nearly as thrilling a second time? that said, if youve killed thrall, what does  killing Sylvanas do for you that killing thrall didnt?
---
That said, ending every raid night for a couple months with a multi-hour camp of the opposite factions capital would be a righteous flex.
---
Imagine a bunch of city raids will happen in p1 and p2, and they will die down after as most people will have done it. Youll see raids later in classic, but i bet the majority of people in those late cycle raids didnt take part in the p1/2 raids.
---
They said they don't want people to feel presurized to level quickly to get them. Source :   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl2SxjsCcHQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=76](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl2SxjsCcHQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=76) 
---
A bit BS in my opinion. People who will feel pressurized by the mounts' short lived presence are probably big passionated players anyway, they'll beat the deadline by a long shot. Giving the guys who invest a lot of time in the game great rewards is very much what Vanilla was about, it's disappointing for them to do that, these mounts are awesome. It's as if they said that they'd launch PvP rewards later so that people do not feel presurized to play all the time to get the best (R14) weapons ...
---
I’m more of an Alliance guy.
---
You have to have a sub or game time to have a chance to get an invite.
---
Any good reasons not to roll a Troll Shaman? PVE and PVP.
---
Wait what how does it give you access to new addons lol
---
You seem pretty desperate to ruin this for yourself
---
Stand back spam FoL, occasional judgement, about it.
---
Well the company and employees who run &amp; develop the game are located there.
---
No problem,  I have dual 1440p monitors and it still looks crispy when stretched across both of them
---
I know you from r/playrust
---
Yeah me too lol that would probably be a rude awakening for that unsuspecting soul. I think that solutions like this are what blizzard is missing. Why not let us have our cake and eat it too? Why not have multiple formats for different kinds of players? Obviously the answer is probably something to do with money but it seems so attainable but also like such a “crazy idea”.
---
Multiple copies of resources existing is my issue. 1 AH serving all the layers is unacceptable. It will cause an imbalance in the economy IMO.
---
Yeah that seems to do it, and both methods were used during vanilla. I remember transferring away from some high-pop server because we constantly sat in queues.
---
The mental retardation of comment posters like you to try and justify their sperging out over a necessary technical asuagement to help the game survive the rigors of initial launch is impressive.
---
Do we need retail WoW installed to access the BETA at all? or would it appear as a separate client on the battlenet desktop app?
---
Lame. I don't want to spend money for a chance at getting into a beta. That's just ridiculous. I'd say to myself "I could try out retail" but I'm so many xpansions behind at this point that's just a flat out lie. Shits not for me.
---
NGL. Opening cinematic when I see the tauren shaman sprinkling dust I tear up.
---
Duh.
---
I can read ok, it seems that comprehension is my weak point.:)
---
I thought that they meant they were sending out invites from the 15th for getting into the stress test.
---
Too much hype for my poor old brain to deal with yesterday.
---
It does seem to be the case, but it's a break from the way previous betas were handled. I was invited to the BFA beta with no active sub for example.
---
From what I read it will work as Sharding does, one of the players will get transfered to that layer until he leaves the party, and then he will be back to his own layer.
---
Oof
---
It's midnight, 00:00
---
I don't know what realm tranafers is.
---
What's the engineering perks ? Been awhile.
---
Human or Dwarf Rogue? I will be doing both pve and pvp.  thanks!
---
You can raid MC as ret... once AQ is out..
---
Fun fact - ghuun infested affix thingy did manage to breake out of instance in bfa by infesting a Hunter pet while the owner was mind controlled.
---
That would eliminate the technical benefits of the Layering, which is meant to balance the load. What would be nice is if they made it so that if someone is in combat or was in combat in the previous 30-60 seconds, that they did not transition to a new layer until that cooldown period. As it stands, I constantly see people abusing sharding in Warmode to dodge ganks when they start losing. Where someone you're fighting suddenly disappears right before they die.
---
If any streamers get beta keys, will they be able to cope without all their adoring fans alongside them to help?
---
Fingers crossed. Bless me based Pepe.
---
They'll prob do this w/ the unarmoured mounts to make the money, its why I think thyre not going to be in at the begining
---
It is said to be a permanent layer transfer until a new one is needed. So if you often group with the same buddies you don't have more layer transfers than 1.
---
To get selected, they're trying to fill up the beta with people with active subs.
---
Ok stop dots.
---
BC is my favorite version of WoW, but Vanilla is a close second. People can like multiple things.
---
The whole point of classic as they first described it was to serve as a "museum piece" to keep classic WoW alive so anyone can always play the game as it first launched. Even if they keep adding content or progress through to BC or Wrath I'm sure they'll keep at least a handful of servers fixed at the 1.12 classic patch purely for posterity.
---
&gt; Serious pvpers werent taking part in city raids in classic either.
---
That's my point, it's a flawed system. People shouldn't avoid any type of PvP because they'll be punished for something outside their control. 
---
DKs just don't serve any purpose but a negative incentive to group up and do stuff in the world.
---
so? what does it matter how much time you had to spend at school while you were at college do you expect it to be the same for everyone all over the world just because you had it easy?

tfw ywn live a quaint life as a wheat farmer on the plains of nagrand until the twisted nether expansion forces you into poverty in the shattrath lower city
---
Billy plays Hello Kitty Island Adventure
---
That wasn’t based on actual Vanilla knowledge though. One of the examples they gave was based on someone’s knowledge of a Wrath mechanic they double checked on the reference and confirmed. You don’t need to have working Vanilla knowledge to question things.
---
"That class can't top meters, therefore trash". Sigh... Sometimes i wonder if you people actually played Vanilla. It has so much more than Raids, but i guess it hurts to be brainwashed by forums and Retail.
---
Also fun fact, you will raid with every spec eventually. You don't need 40 people with optimal builds to farm raids. In time you will go with your ret, feral or whatever you want. Hardcore pushing guilds will bench you, or require you to heal/ tank instead. This will change once you get that content on farm.
---
I truly hope that retarded propaganda didn't  scare new people with it's bullshit. But i guess that's what Retail turned WoW into, if you aren't topping the meter, your class is useless. Unparalleled levels of Tunnel Vision.
---
Gonna laugh when that "useles ret" or Ench shaman oneshot you "rear" in PvP.
---
Lol they already said they aren’t going to be in the game
---
except we dont actually have any evidence thats how that works. we dont know if it will pull you out of combat or how rare spawns will interact with multiple layers. thats all stuff that has to be tested in the beta. everything is just an assumption right now. theres a chance it might work like that but theres also a chance blizzard put restrictions on when you get moved from one layer to another, and if theyre smart thats what they hopefully did.

Keep in mind that any class can beat any other class if the skill gap is too big. A mage won't automatically win over a warrior. You can find ways to even the odds.
---
Pretty much. The old Westfall had a bit of a "run down and deserted area" feel to it. Highwaymen and bad harvests. 
---
Cataclysm turned it into such a joke. Thugs with sunglasses FFS. Alarm-o-bots and a crimescene. 
---
I want to quest in the rundown fields of a thug-ridden area, not in CSI: Westfall.
---
That is the benefit of Family &amp; Friend lol. They put you on a list
---
I see layering as basically two-three small Pservers that will merge at some point. Easier to get behind if you think  the layers as different servers that will merge to create on healthy server.
---
I'm sure the phasing back and forth can be abused so I hope there will a cooldown or something on how frequently you can jump reality.
---
I have a bit of information, take it with a grain of salt but my friend says they will have the same servers that were at launch names won’t change. So it should be easy to just go straight to your original server.
---
Friend works at blizzard if you didn’t figure that out. Also working on the classic team.
---
Yeah, making the epic unnarmored mounts \~1k gold each AND requiring mount skill (as opposed to the \~90g +900g skill for the armored ones) along with making them accessible for, say,  6 months longer would make them both rare and not push players to speed level.
---
That said, their excuse doesn't make much sense to me - as if unnarmored mounts were the primary reason pushing people to level fast ...
---
I personally agree with this. I started playing WoW in early 05 and while I loved the Vanilla experience everything BC brought to the table really fleshed out the game.
---
It obviously wasn't perfect, but I feel BC really was WoW at its best. Raid attunements weren't my favorite, but it helped keep older raids alive by needing to run alts or new/returning players through. 
---
I get raid attunements and rep grinding to unlock heroics were a point of contention among a large portion of the playerbase, but it helped make sure people still did content instead of just afk'ing in Shatt all day.
---
Why? If you enter the game and are put into one layer of 3k players, it´s completely identical to be put into server with 3k players. And when you log off and log in next day, you will be once again in layer with 3k players...not the same players, but that would be the case with queues too, because those 3k people who got into the game yesterday wouldn´t all be there later.
---
The difference is that those 7k players will get to play too instead of waiting in queue for 10 hours.
---
More like accurate comparison.
---
Doesn't answer the question.  Participants in the beta will need an active subscription to play beta.  That's clear.  But it doesn't state whether or not you need an active sub to be selected to be a participant.  
---
You can see dedicated players by how active they've been in the last 15 years and the people that bothered to go in and opt-in to Classic Beta specifically.  Honestly it would make more sense to select people that are NOT active subs, because then they're more likely to resub.  You've already got the money of the active subs.
---
All this being said.......I will not be surprised if it's only for active subs and I am not holding my breath either way.
---
There is a lot of misinformation out there too.  Upon launch there wasn't a plethora of information on how to min max everything.  Also a lot of people don't really remember how brutal it was upon launch.  A small percentage of people that have played wow, actually played back in those days.  I just googled a bit, and it looks like just  over 116 hours was the fastest speed run to 60.
---
&gt;its why I think thyre not going to be in at the begining
---
 Like I said... I was putting a reason behind it... lol...
---
You're wrong and overreacting.
---
&gt;Also fun fact, you will raid with every spec eventually
---
[Oh .. oh no no no no...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhckuhUxcgA)
---
I guess my point is, outside of the 20-30 people per faction who are trying to rank to 14, it doesnt affect anyone.
---
That said, I wish killing flight masters gave a DK. 
---
I couldnt give two shits about the GM hopefuls. They make their own life worse by playing as much as they do.
---
the layering system is a good idea.  essentially creating a second (or third) of the same server, only coming into effect if the server cap is reached.  should help eliminate login queues or severely low pop servers in the future.

lets say the server can handle 3000 players and 6500 people trying to log in. this is a better choice than having 3500 people in a queue, or creating extra two servers to accomodate so there is no queue - with a good chance at least one of those servers will be so low pop after 2 months that people will ask for mergers or free transfers.
---
while there is a chance 3 servers for 6500 players might end up with roughly similar populations, its not likely. most people tend to gravitate to the higher population realms.
---
You’re already taking Creed.  Big ouch.  What’s next?  Nickleback? ... Imagine Dragons??
---
This is still how steam group ui looks if you look at all members. Hasn't changed.
---
That's a lil bit disingenuous - WoW always had a carrot on a stick.
---
I get the mindset that it's just a game, and if we don't get the CE, that we won't be worse off in our lives. However, I would still enjoy having it, and will still be a little disappointed if they don't produce any more.
---
That's how I felt about the Tier 9 stuff. Everybody had it and it wasn't hard to get. It felt kind of like it devalued the Tiered stuff I had worked hard for before that. And it was ugly as sin, at least on Warriors.
---
Just to follow this up  Always, always check your launcher for beta.  It will show up there first before you get the email.  I had the Legion and BfA betas show in the launcher and then I got the email 3-5 days later.
---
thanks man
---
What increases/decreases chances for beta invites?
---
One thing that I see no one has mentioned is the Ony attunement quest at 60 is VASTLY easier for alliance than horde. It’s almost half the amount of steps so there’s that to consider
---
This only alleviates the population from growing further. People who already invested time in the first *x* weeks on the now overpopulated servers would be forced to reroll or quit to avoid queues.
---
The stench of retail scum chokes me.
---
Of course, but not even close to the same extent. The accessibility now is greater than ever. Hell you have a live feed just from going to twitch.
---
I never in any way shape or form stated that not knowing a streamer is stupud.
---
Im talking about the people in this subreddit actively hating and shitting on these people who played a monumental part in the effort to make classic happen
---
Pretty sure they said they have to do sharing to avoid the overpopulation problem
---
You realize addons are 3rd part developed and have nothing to do with blizzard right
---
You need an active sub in order to be considered for an invite.
---
had it easy?
---
Lol. 
---
let me rephrase. Blizzard has no obligation to plan their content releases around the schedules of 18-23 year olds--and it comes off as horribly conceited and entitled when people at the easiest stage of their lives complain about how an entertainment product is personally "cancerous" for them because of their overbearing schedule.
---
I’ve never had Blizz pay out on any jackpots. You might dislocate an elbow with that reach
---
It's an example. Even with a realm of that many people, not everyone is going to be as concentrated into a small number of zones as they would be on launch. That far into the release, there will be people spread out all over the place and thus the natural distance-based state replication separation will take over from there. Which is to say that characters that are too far away to see do not generate extra traffic because the state of those distant players do not need to be replicated to each other.
---
Or to the extent they were supossed to be in cata....
---
Hey.
---
Creeds first album--until you know they are jesus freaks--is fire.
---
Layering is a really nice solution to the problem of overcrowded starting zones. Dedicated servers are better than peer 2 peer and should have been in mw2.
---
I don't want to either...but I did.
---
There is nothing glorious about having to fight hour long queues and when you finally log on, battle for mob tags with hundreds of people. That  will be the reality first week.
---
This change is great.
---
ya imo world first 60 could very well be a mage in classic
---
Not on a pvp server anyway then
---
Human will be better for swords in PvE and it can potentially give you a edge over some rogues or druids with perception.
---
Dwarf will give you an edge over rogues or druids or hunters by letting you remove bleeds and poisons with stoneform.
---

---
if you think literally anybody but a select, minuscule amount of random invites + influencers are going to be getting into this beta, I think you'll be sorely disappointed.
---
this beta is going to be used for hype. all the major influencers will get in. do you remember how the hearthstone beta went? extremely limited access with a huge demand for access to beta. think that but probably even less people get in. they said unlike other wow betas they don't need testers to see if the game is fun. they only want a small number of people just to make sure the game isn't broken.
---
Oh, absolutely.  Let me know how it turns out ;)
---
Awesome! I'm a huge power metal fan myself and Blind Guardian is my favorite band.
---
You have to delete all alliance characters before you create a horde one and vice versa
---
Billy played a hunter, but could no longer figure out how to log into the game when his mouse cursor ran out of arrows. RIP
---
wow vanilla and burning crusade left a void in me... after those games i haven't been able to find another game that i can be devoted to, usually just play a game for a few days then quit and try to find something else.   
---
i'm really excited about wow classic because when i just to play the game i did not have a good pc and i had to save all my money to pay the subscription, there's many thiings that i wasn't  able to experience like AV my pc just freeze in AV or IF so i wasn't even able to move... i met a lot of awesome people that i don't know what happened to them but i still remember they  nickmames i will forever :D
---
Thank god for discord, then
---
I hope people fight back. All I know is now if you say in /1 that there is an enemy raid in the city, you get told to "shut the fuck up".
---
Guilds will be on one layer, this has been said many times.
---
&gt;Classes are balanced around players not having world buffs. It creates an unhealthy demand for certain classes over others as world buffs make especially warriors ridiculously powerful.
---
This is false, classes are not balanced at all.
---
To some extent I agree, but it still matters a lot to those ranking up from 8-12.
---
As for flight masters, I'd just make them more powerful and make their respawn more reasonable.
---
Make it take a 30 man raid to handle them, so people will be incentivized to make a 30 man to fight them.
---
I don't care of someone yells NOCHANGES because nonexistant world pvp mechanics were always on of the most underdeveloped and weakest parts of classic.
---
More world pvp plz
---
People aren't to bothered because it's an entire server population per layer. This means the player distribution between zones will emulate single servers. It's a short term plan to address a large playerbase that will fall off after phase 1.
---
I don't blame people for getting 1 month of sub to try and get in early. When it's getting closer to launch and you aren't in I'd definitely un sub. No point leveling a character a month out from launch.
---
Troll racial probably better for PvE than Orc racial on an ele/Resto shaman.  
---
For PvP hardiness is amazing though, and war stomp on taurens gives shamans a very important disable which their kit lacks.
---
Why are they going to mulgore? :D
---
PLEASE I DODGE EVERYTHING LET ME NOT DODGE THIS
---
This is the time I will get tf...
---
Holy smokes I can’t afford that lol. Damn. I’m buying a new setup for classic and I was thinking like 500$. This is a huggggeeee screen.  Did not realize damn near 50” lol. I’m doing. A three monitor setup but with this I could have done only one. New build is going to cost close to 2000$ not including monitors. But damn while leveling my paladin I could be watching camsoda side by side afk aa things to death while I beat my meat to death lol jp but seriously haha
---
I watched him for a while and he had 3 different timers for nothing, I wouldn't trust much of what he says.
---
Not on other servers.  Probably should have clarified, lol
---
One thing to note as human, sometimes non-human are given priority over daggers in raids and there is a long line of people wanting human specialized weapons.
---
&gt; Gambling is the wagering of **money** or something of value (referred to as "the stakes") on an event with an **uncertain outcome**, with the primary intent of winning money or material goods.
---
Maybe you should pick up a dictionary once in a while.
---
...yeah that's not something you can avoid. Happens to every MMO in existence.
---
They were also doing a lot of things very wrong/simplistically that were not in line with how the game server actually handles things. They were an approximation that lead to a lot of things changing in the meta like front stabbing. Movement was glitchy as fuck because of a low tick rate. NPC AI was very rudimentary by comparison.
---
If you want to dps in PvE pick a diff class.  If you want to just PvP (world and otherwise) it's a fine choice.
---
b4 I ask in a post and get roasted, you are here a lot you might know.
---
Are the beta servers listed likly to have the same names as the fully released or is there just no info on that
---
&gt;quit your bitching
---
Just point out logical fallacies, but I can read that you are obviously super intelligent and know what’s best.  
---
My mistake.
---
leeroy jenkins was horrible because for those of us who had played the beta and already done ubrs, it was obviously scripted
---
As such, it never had the genuine feeling for me and I never cared for it.
---
onyxia wipe animation though, that's a timeless classic
---
I used to play on a pretty populated server back in TBC, and one of the most fun experiences I had was going to the elemental plateau with my friend, and owning it. Nothing spawned that we didn't tag.
---
it would have been cool, just for that fact that there's no real way to be a "criminal" in the game. even if you're a Rogue, you kind of have to RP being a criminal. its not like you can break into houses and rob people in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. the guards only go after opposing faction players.
---
Phew.  That was a good one.
---
Step 3: With bitch drop the 't' because bich is Latin for generosity!
---
Nobody else excited for the possibility of the blood plague resurge?
---
I was not around for it, but certainly enjoyed the WotLK launch event modeled after it. There was a certain thrill to it, avoiding areas because they were too far gone or risk of infection.
---
...And being the guy who got everyone else infected.. Such lovely chaos.
---
I know the blood plague was unintentional and the LK launch was cut short due to complaints. But i think a small planned event wont hurt much. 
---
I am excited for most of it really, but little things like this really spice things up.
---
Merge the servers. Make people get new names. Or give them some designator or something. I would prefer no layering or sharding of any sort.
---
Even after reading the charts I'm still a bit confused. Is it similar to the way EQ2 would do things where a second instance of the zone is made on the same server once the first became heavily populated? I.e. there would be Antonica then Antonica 2, 3, etc? Except with this it's an entire continent and you can't actively change which instance you're in without being invited  by someone already in it? If so that's honestly not bad as far as I'm concerned.
---
Does anyone know if we have to have Retail installed to get access? Or would Classic have a standalone .exe/launcher?
---
Nothing amazing about it. Just pain.
---
There really isn't. They'd rather them do nothing than solve a real glaring problem. LOTS of new people who want to try the game will be logging in for maybe a week, and then never again. Imagine getting to level 50, or 60 - and then having the entire population just up and quit because vanilla isn't for them. You're just king of a ghost town. Real fucking fun.
---
Mods, please delete all these moronic posts with people not knowing WTF they are talking about. Thanks.
---
Yes it’s only for celebrate 15 years of wow..
---
Arms is warrior's worst PvE spec by a significant margin.
---
Warriors can farm gold, particularly well with burst chain kills in high end gear.
---
Hi, /u/polyphemus-
---
I am pretty sure they will not be re-using the same names as the original servers at launch.  We know that one server will be called "Mankrik" or something related.
---
As for beta....who knows.  I would imagine not.
---
Wait, where’s the main hand / offhand slot?
---
I am so looking forward to all the "epic" "magic" bullshit that was happening after Cataclysm.  
---
I could take the destruction, but not the constant flying tornado shit.
---
Because it was more fun to talk crap on the server forums and then get meet ups in TM and Others to go full out all day PvP on a server where everyone knew each other
---
Classic Autumn: Dec 27
---
Classic Winter: March 27
---
Classic Spring: June 27
---
Classic is a prefix for the seasons. 
---
It makes sense now.
---
The expectation is that the initial surge of players will wind down significantly over time. Tourists (people only checking it out with no intention of sticking it out or committing seriously to playing Classic). People who took vacations to play all day that had to start back up with their regular life schedule. Or people who just didn't find it as interesting as they thought it would be.
---
Yeah.  I have been pretty unlucky getting into Blizzard betas for some reason.  I play/played a lot of every game they have made since warcraft 1, and even the WoW beta.  My invite is often after my buddies for some reason, but I just assume it's against the odds.
---
I really think all we need is a blue post on this that tells us exactly what's what. Some of the devs are straight up contradicting each other in the videos, so we're left trying to piece together how it'll work.
---
I believe it can be made into a good solution. It just needs a little tweaking and clarification. I doubt beta will have enough players to really provide feedback on it unfortunately, and the stress tests are only for a single day at a time.
---
And on your last note, I've been called both blizzard shill and hater on the same day. This subreddit is really good at dismissing all dissenting opinions as "they're just haters" or "they're just fanboys". I was very favorable towards their initial stance on sharding that they explained at Blizzcon as well, so I'm definitely on the "side" of wanting Classic to succeed, not for or against Blizzard in any way.
---
I don't think you understand layering, server population capability with the current hardware and what server populations were like in vanilla.

For rogue best PvP spec is probably cold blood/prep.  For PvE the best with low gear is probably combat swords or daggers.

Should be fine I rkn

Karen took the kid.

Nope wasn’t vanilla
---
If I had my way, BGs wouldnt offer nearly as much honor as they do. 
---
BGs should be for rep gear. Wpvp should be for ranking.
---
But then I see killing Alliance (RIP seems like i'll be killing horde this time around) as the primary function of classic. I level up so I can slightly outlevel the horde im killing. I get geared so I can kill horde. I raid and slay dragons to get epics to kill horde. 
---
I like the Illidan-US philosophy to pvp. Kill them so hard and so often all the opposite faction leaves the server. And by wrath/cata, they had. (Im not too concerned with what victory looks like either--like a dog chasing a car, im not thinking that far ahead) I want Alliance and Horde on a given server to have that philosophy: No quarter, red is dead.
---
There are NO KEYS. If you are chosen your account is GIVEN ACCESS to the BETA. This keeps people from selling keys

lol, no. Ion said himself it will be gone by phase 2 at the latest.

I started playing in BC and always wished I'd played sooner (I had owned it, but no computer to play it on). It's a place to escape. I was in my 20s when I started, and am nearly 33 now. When I played the classic demo, even though it was only the Barrens, and things weren't right yet, it was just so...nice? I afk level alts in current while watching movies. In the demo, I had to think just to travel and not die sometimes. The chat was talkative. The community was trading greens at the Crossroads cause we knew it was only for so long, so lets just help each other! It was altogether something I haven't seen in current in many, many years. I loved the farming, the crafting, running everywhere on foot, the whole deal. Just the barrens felt looked the WORLD of Warcraft, and it was so cool. Though I'll make sure I take care of responsibilities and take time for other games and RL, I'm very much as excited as you, Friend. May the wind be at your back.
---
Damnit. I forgot one o
---
It's bothering WAY too many people. First of all, each layer will be able to hold the size of an entire server anyways. It's going to be absolute chaos, just like people want it. You're not going to be able to tag any quest mobs because there will be people everywhere in the starting zones, just like people want it.
---
What this really is is just planned server merges, but you get to see and interact with people that will be "joining your server" after the first couple of weeks. 
---
They're going to stop using this as soon as the launch hype is over and the starting zones calm down.
---
Ian has made it clear that phase 2 can't have layering, because he never wants to have 2 instances of a world boss up.
---
I mean, TECHNICALLY, if the server pop is small enough, there won't be any layering.
---
around ZA Patch
---
I dont think we know enough about the finer details with layering yet. Instead of being outraged, why dont we wait and see how those things pan out. If there are still concerns at that point, then fine, be outraged.
---
*I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.*
---
Comprehension problem then, got it. Try reading some of the official communication it alleviates your "me and 5 horde" bullshit.
---
PvP cheating?
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
But there is other food: private servers.
---
Same except it was coffee bean trying to get me to buy an ice blended.
---
son
---
I am disappoint ;_;
---
Yeah man, some People have done it faster on private vanilla serveres, but there is always inconsistensies there (wrong xp for quests, wrong stats on mobs etc.), so get prepared for the Long haul!
---
Where you dont even need to jump
---
I bet that higher priority than any of that are people who've beta tested before and submitted a lot of feedback.
---
He is a crybaby that's going to be spamming twitter #NoBetaClub. Thank god I unfollowed him
---
Girls?
---
You can tell who played everquest
---
This is simply not true. E.g. assume the maximum layer size is 3000 players and a server has 4500 players online.
---
Do we know when they should be rolling out?
---
I wonder if the layering will allow for merging of servers further down the road if a server becomes super underpopulated
---
Feels more like "Starting with an overabundance of servers and then later merging them down into fewer servers" with fewer steps, to me.
---
The email can take anywhere from a week to a month.  You're better off doing work, then check your launcher at home since that will be updated well before you receive the email notification.
---
Shattered Hand from WoD anyone?
---
Uh no. High level nodes are hotly contested on healthy vanilla servers. They were the center of many world pvp brawls, in fact. 
---
This isn’t vanilla
---
No, it's definitely being turned off.
---
/r/wooosh I guess
---
r/punchablefaces
---
I think that neither sharding nor Layering is a *good* thing but in the end it is *neccessary* and every now and then you have to compromise. Sharding in Classic would be a massive failure, so Blizzard went back and built something that is Sharding-light aka Layering. Usually a game such as this simply opens more servers as demand increases, Classic is the opposite - Massive initial playerbase that will dwindle hence Layering.
---
Creating massive queues and unstable servers are a major PR-disaster and something a AAA-company would do everything to dodge. It's as much player satisfaction as prestige.
---
God damn it!
---
So what if the population is way to high in Phase 2, and the amount still "affects" the player expierence? They cant just shuffle away peaople to some other server.
---
GW2 had layering figured out in 2012. People on here are acting like Blizzard are geniuses for coming up with this wacky and innovative solution in place of sharding when other games have been doing it for ages.
---
Like Skrillex
---
According to your comment I can easily tell you aren’t there for an authentic classic wow experience.
---
You should leave your uneducated assumptions and fears to yourself.
---
Classes are so simple that I literally learned a whole new class in 10 minutes when legion came out and I used my free 100 boost. There isnt much to learn anymore.
---
You are all knowing and all saying great one. Thank you for your contributions to society. Tell us what is next. Asuh 🙏🏼
---
For me, it wasn’t necessarily about the game itself but the friends and community I had within it. In high school, a group of real life friends and myself would hangout and also play WoW together. We didn’t care about raiding or even hitting 60 (although eventually we did), we cared more about just playing the game together and trolling around, having fun. It’ll be a bit different this time now that I’m older, but I’ll find fun in playing with them again, but also in actually experiencing the game. There’s a lot of dungeons I never ran, information I never knew, quests and items I never completed and obtained, etc. 
---
In short, it’ll be different this time around for all of us, but most of us will be able to appreciate it in a new perspective, which can be equally as rewarding and engaging as going in for the first time.
---
/wave
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Leeroy is legendary, however you kinda just wait for forever, it feels like, for the funny bit. While the Wipe animation is hilarious the entire time!
---
How in the actual hell did this get so many upvotes with how bad he represented sharding?  Sharding is not cross realm.  You can share a cross realm zone but sharding does the exact opposite of what Crz is used for.  It is never used to populate areas.  
---
I think someone needs to make a real diagram for OP
---
Good thing that really becomes an issue once people start hitting 60. Most people that hit 60 immediately will most likely be rushing MC. As long as layering is turned off as most people are hitting 60 this wont be an issue.
---
Some of us hope that not every action has ulterior malicious motives.
---
And people will still complain about this for some reason.
---
Why should I imagine stuff that is wrong? They allready stated that layers should hold as many players as a realm back then did.
---
It looks like that Indian girl on the front page of reddit yesterday
---
You do realize, community centers and libraries exist, right?
---
The leveling zones won't be a mess anymore at that point. The world itself being busy is not a problem, not even for the Blizzard team.
---
oh ffs. It's just saying that they aren't giving streamers any keys to give out. They're trying to keep it a small beta group, so they're not throwing out beta keys like candy this time around.
---
You're wrong
---
damn

I keep opening it up hoping I will get a better outcome, extremely disappointed. :(

---
Imagine being this Pepega

No it’s not
---
And on this day ... no one cared.
---
I'm actually ok with this.
---
As a full time brain surgeon astronaut system designer i say you are wrong.
---
I totally see what you are getting at.
---
The layering is (probably) a sort of clustering algorithm that takes into account:
---
* what layer your guild is bound to currently (which may change if imbalance is detected)
---
* What layer you were recently bound to (can change if imbalance is detected or huge swaths of time has elapsed)
---
* What people are in your friend-list (if they go with the integration of b-net we will have friends day 1)
---
* How the current and historic layer-balance (both the layer itself and other layers) looks like (&lt;- This is the one you are worried about, for good reasons)
---
* ?? Insert your own agenda here ??? (can change if imbalance is detected)
---
These are some of the basics I would include if I were to do the Layering decision-making (and also some more stuff regarding how layers themselves can dynamically favor your account, but that's another topic).
---
**The two visions that we are talking about are not mutually exclusive**, though as you see there will be gray-zones. It may be that if you play every day and don't change guild willy-nilly, you will indeed have the experience he is talking about. This can be done by weighing the above criterias carefully. 
---
They simply use the play sessions as the atomic operation in the system. Throughout the session, you are guaranteed to be on the same layer. When you end a session and start a new one, the system gives no guarantees that it will be on the same layer, only that it is extremely likely. If I were them, I would also more-or-less *only* merge layers, not split them up unless REALLY needed (streamer guild invites, anyone?).
---
If it is done as above, you will have the guarantee Ion spoke about (bar extreme situations). I'm sure that they have an even better algorithm in mind, seeing as this was me hashing out how to do it in about 5 minutes of thinking and typing. They are not stupid, even though everyone seems to think so.
---
"hey horde are attacking stormwind, can someone invite me to another layer? i need to turn in some quests"
---
With there being multiple layers it means rare mats will be farmed at potentially 4x the rate they were in vanilla causing prices to crash down hard on them since there will be WAY more supply for rare resources during this period of time.
---
There are serious implications for the economy to do layering.  Full stop, no layering, blizzard stop trying to force some form of sharding on us no matter how much we complain.
---
First day sub here, 11/23/2004. But stopped playing actively once MoP came out. Re subbed yesterday for a month for beta hopes. We’ll see.
---
Wouldn't *you* like to know?
---
Doesnt it bother anyone else that he is leaving an instance and not entering it?
---
I'm looking to heal as a Druid. I know for raids this won't matter as much but for 5 man dungeons would the fact that I don't have an out of combat rez work against me for getting invited? 
---
Should I try to look for at least 1 priest or Paladin/Shaman to fill one of the other roles if I'm the group leader looking for more?
---
I'm a fulltime judge, and I sentence you guilty of being wrong.
---
Who said thousands? Title said 100s
---
You’re still going to sub and play like the little bitch you are. Nothing funnier than someone who whines and cries all day about something so stupid and irrelevant but still does what everyone else does. 
---
If it bothers you enough to bitch on the forums you should just not play.
---
I am human too, we all make mistake. I welcome any correction. It has truly blown up
---
yes. people will frequently avoid pvp by hopping layers
---
And then posts: 'Flying mounts or I unsub' in the forums
---
They don't need to clarify that as it's always the same: no progress carries over.
---
Westfall (along with Redridge and Duskwood) also gave a great sense for the limits of Stormwind's ability to project power. You left the relative safety of Elwynn to find out the surrounding regions have been more or less left to fend for themselves. Made the region feel far more organic.
---
How does this writing make any sense. 
---
Why would Sylvannis send assassins for Thrall, the person who originally accepted her and was fair to her? What did I miss in the writing, are they enemies now, or are they just trying really hard to write Thrall back in and kill off Sylvannis?
---
So how does it fix overpopulation issues with 750-900 humans in Northshire Abbey during launch? Without dynamic respawns of course.
---
Nothing is confirmed either way.
---
Whatever you say
---
I was thinking this too. OP needs to make a gofund me or something similar so the community as a whole can introduce new players, or help players return who may be in unfortunate financial situations. Need to figure out a way to sort out scammers though.

the point of a layer is to prevent congestion in the early stages of the game IE not having 3000 people at barrens at the same time.  Once phase one (or player counts get low enough) all the players will merge onto 1 layer aka the server.  the servers have room for all the players on all the layers so when they get removed everyone will be together and see everyone else.
---
I'm a big proponent of the viability of druids, but I'm here to tell you that they will not usually be topping the healing meters. That is not to say that they are bad; they are extremely useful in a raid, but their hps isn't anything to write home about.
---
you don't need to be friends with people to easily hop layers
---
The left isn’t Al’Akir either. Rag is the only elemental lord actually seen in Vanilla as far as I know.
---
The chromaggus clip proves - by any definition that chromaggus has 5,6 % mitigation with the raid debuffs not 5,4
---
Which is not enough data to verify whether or not he starts at 3741 or 3236
---
It leans heavily into the direction of the implication, but that generous rounding up irks me as it stands against all testing we did in our time.
---
Since I'm fairly sure you know what I'm hinting at. Just for the potential audience. 5,6 % mitigation implies 346 armor. with +640 from recklessness and 2250 from sunder he could be sitting at 3236 or at 3741 if fairy were to stack additively.
---
Though that would go against the claims that the removal of recklessness didn't change anything about the physical dps debuff support with wotlk
---
As for the 1.8 nerf. It was also hitting other minor debuffs as well. hence the q.q and rework of bonereavers later on.
---
I think people are just content or do not think about it too hard.
---
So we’re talking about 3k people on Vanilla, right? So why wouldn’t these layers with 3k people in each node be competing for these same resources?
---
Also, you’ll have 3x the people on the server, so 3x the consume rate for high level nodes.
---
Just tell me what happens in Phase2 if the population is way to high.
---
they are great in PvP.
---
Not in the context of Blizards implementation of sharding for vanilla.
---
They haven’t done beta keys since like BC bros
---
Ya I have bad luck generally. If I put 5$ in a slot machine and spun 5 times I'd end up owing the thing money. So I won't bother. 
---
I'd also like to discourage people from staying subbed if they don't get in right away. I don't like the idea of giving anybody money for providing absolutely nothing.
---
The fact that there seems to be two other actual druids in this pic with no tier gear makes it even better/worse.
---
Ahhh good ol post by someone who DIDN'T actually play VANILLA and has only played Private servers which have screwed up values for a lot of things. 
---
6-8h Cd on world buffs and guilds will need to fight over them. You are wrong here and thus invalidates the rest of your post.
---
I love how many people try and pretend they played vanilla and as if playing private servers validates their fake experience.
---
My hope is that phases are released slowly enough that you can casually (assuming you are making an active effort to as well) keep up with phases as they are released.
---
i guess next time i'll make low effort youtube videos regurgitating old information so i can be granted the prestigious label of beta tester
---
AND THEN YOU ARE LIVING IN A TRUE WORLD AT WAR CANT FUCKING WAIT
---
Queue times. There you go you can give up now.
---
If you don't believe anything a developer says, you can't ever be hyped about anything. Maybe classic is not even coming to PC but only to mobile? It's Blizzard after all...
---
People begging their boss to “skip” work to play wow is pathetic.  Request time off and say you are taking a vacation.
---
Yep, I think al’akir, while done badly, was still represented in classic more than thera and nept
---
I'm both a little relieved and a little sad tbh, i'll be putting in for my days off when i go into work in a few hours and was going to do 2 weeks but i might just do one now and slow down the plan a bit.
---
Healthier for me though i guess.
---
Ya, but there's at least a chance someone reads and understands, so it's not completely a waste of time
---
That was one of the first things I noticed about the state of retail when I resubbed to try the latest expac. 
---
I felt so alone, and the few times I encountered another player... completely silent and to preoccupied with the grind and minmaxing to share a conversation
---
Real answer though is he's on a different realm (as seen in the first diagram).
---
I've always played Horde, but as I communicate with friends that will be playing, I've been repeatedly told "I'm going Alliance" so I'm stuck with alliance now. I've decided on playing a Holy Pally, as the whole making allies stronger is a fun approach to the game for myself. That being said, I'm at a complete loss on how to level a Paladin effectively, as my limited research has repeatedly led me to guides that seem specifically tailored towards private servers. I understand they are easy and slow levelers, but I'm just looking for general advice on how to level effectively via talents and itemization, and the merits of the either available race. Also, I think I've decided on skinning/herb for leveling, then herb alch for 60. Holy paladins don't seem as heavily forced towards certain professions as other classes, is that a correct assessment?
---
&gt; I just want someone to give me an answear to what happens in Phase2 if the population still is way to high for a single layer.
---
Then shit will be crowded.
---
I don't get why you're assuming it's 100% automatic and can't be turned off by a human.
---
&gt;I just want someone to give me an answear to what happens in Phase2 if the population still is way to high for a single layer
---
Open new servers (realms) and provide temporary free migration? It's what they've done in the past afaik. At least this is what I hope.
---
\+1.
---
well done sir, or should i say ma'am?
---
That's him. He gave up sadly. Was too big a project.
---
Agreed, that appears to be what they are aiming for.
---
I'd prefer they only have it in the 1-20 zones, but that may not be possible.
---
Queues and free transfers to lower pop realms. Like in 2005.
---
Ahh I never played WoD. Does he looks like this?
---
Good old server ques ofc
---
Maybe that's the difference. We moved to a new city the summer before highschool. I used gaming to cope I guess.
---
same sized and shaped table, same keyboard and same mouse and even the same damn mousepad
---
are you me?
---
If you are in their same "layer". Some people might never get to see this because of layering.
---
they leashed a lot of mobs in vanilla after the kazzak incident
---
Are you me?
---
This. But no one is talking about it. It’s the same damn thing they just tweaked it a little.
---
I got in, never even played wow im not subbed I play runescape
---
Thanks for the correction and feedback. It was about 4am my time and hadn't had my coffee.
---
This one took me way back
---
https://i.imgur.com/DjIUPxe.jpg
---
Good ol' days.
---
Almost a year of no flying in bfa is still something.
---
its probably got its own exe but using the same battle.net launcher
---
Hey thanks, I appreciate that. I don't want to make a new post about it as mods have ordered all discussion that isn't news should be consolidated into the stickied megathread (and a new comment there will just be lost in the abyss). 
---
Unfortunately as you say people are already forming "sides" on this issue, attacking and downvoting anyone with dissenting opinions. I hope that through constructive discourse and educating people of the practical implications, Blizzard might be more willing to clarify or tweak a few things to settle some of the concerns, and the users of this subreddit may be more open to discussing it instead of dismissing complaints as being "haters".
---
I and many others such as yourself (I assume) just want what's best for the game, and I know Blizzard does too. I believe Layering **with the correct implementation** can absolutely pave the way for that, but there just are some caveats that need to be worked out first.
---
Get placed in the queue to login once there is enough room.
---
&gt; What I'm saying is there will most likely be the possibility to do it that way assuming that the servers are big enough to have 2 or 3 layers, and if there is the possibility to do it then people are going to try to do it.
---
Honestly, let them. It will likely not be worth the effort, thus an inconsequential number of people will participate. Even hardcore players will likely not want to waste time *trying* to change layers and hoping that "new" layer is actually better for farming, as opposed to just going out there and grinding.
---
Is there a particular class that is best for a bank alt or is it all pretty irrelevant what you pick?
---
With a realm like population of its own, which can just as easily form up its own raid.
---
I dont know about that but your thread is still wrong, claiming that to only be an assumption. Its a fact.
---
So do some research before claiming next time.
---
CoR+FF+Sunder all stacked.  I can pull you up an EJ archive of it from 70 and 80 if you want.
---
The theory is that BRE was changesd to prevent 0 armor on bosses (or negative armor).  Since 1.4 BRE has never existed, we cannot determine if this is the case.
---
LOL :D
---
all the people subbing
---
It would be mostly unknown unless you're playing with IRL friends and family. Sometimes you might ask them to make a certain item while you are grouping without them for a dungeon and you'd notice if they never spawned in front of you.
---
Just switch layers lol
---
VR only. Maybe a special server for the neural implant whiners. #NoChanges
---
Doubtful. 
---
They dont want feedback from testers.
---
They want free publicity,  so streamers and youtubers
---
Sharding and Layering are the same fucking thing. They just tweaked it a little bit. It’s so obvious this is the case. If they would have just said they tweaked sharding then people would complain even more but now that they have re worded it and made it sound nicer people are 50/50 about it
---
I have the same display, have used it to play several games over the last year, and it's pretty fantastic.
---
Depending on the game, it's sometimes helpful to move a few key UI elements around if you need to see them constantly. But for a lot of things you look at only when you need them (basic system control buttons, quest logs, etc), having them available at a glance but not impinging on your main field of view is great. And having what feels like natural peripheral vision is impressively immersive.
---
Finally I can make fun of oomkins again!
---
Fuck fucking oomkins!
---
I resubscribed. I'm on medical leave from work, got nothing better to do, was hoping for Classic Summer so got surgery last week. Please Blizzard.
---
I didn’t mind dungeon finder at first, but Raid finder was just stupid
---
I have multiple wow accounts in my bnet account. The oldest is from 2005, the one I'm currently playing is from 2012. Do you think I should add a subscription for my inactive account from 2005 to raise the chances?
---
That's a bad philosophy, it's so boring when servers are lopsided. For both sides.
---
Just use real ID maybe. Idk, but some sort of identification must be. And as I said I think a lot of people would do this for someone who can't afford wow. A lot of people would also stop play on private servers too so it would be a win win situation.
---
"TeetsOut here guys and have I got something juicy for you. You're gonna loose your minds on this one. I have inside info on the beta keys and it turns out, Blizzard somehow thinks I'm a representative of the classic community and gave me 2000 keys to distribute. Unfortunately, I'm a cornhole and won't actually be giving any of these out to normies. Make sure to subscribe and turn your alerts on for more lame videos coming at you."
---
4000 &gt; 700. Plus if you shard only the starting area like Elywynn then the second you cross into westfall or darkshore ect that same exact problem will happen. And it would be everywhere you think you would be able to level.
---
*Laughs in feral druid.*
---
I am 100% ok with this because once upon a time games like WoW didn't hold your hand, wipe your ass for you and give you a participation trophy for showing up. If you encountered a situation like above you would just deal with it, move somewhere else, play a different character etc.
---
I would gladly be slightly inconvenienced if it actually maintains the integrity of a static server.
---
Lol'd
---
People will stay for a long time because Classic just feels good to play. It's the ultimate rewarding experience. I think beyond the people who just wanted to log in and look around for a bit, most people will drop off deep into raiding if they start only logging on for raids.
---
This, the limiting factor right now is (Area + # of mobs + rate at which mobs respawn)/# of players = X
---
When # of players increases,  X decreases
---
When Area increases, X increases
---
When # of mobs increases, X increases
---
When Rate at which mobs respawn increases, X increases
---
Now I understand this is very simplified and not nuanced at all, but I am trying to make a basic point. After the starting zones, Area, and # of mobs both increase extemely, thus increasing our X.
---
They were. On EU.
---
Not blaming the whole guild since they have really nice people in it, but I never saw some racist, ignorant, toxic people that they had, even after 14 years.
---
Anyways lets keep this as a friendly taunt :) i guess many years passed and many people changed
---
Server queues and probably free server transfers to new or less populated servers is my guess
---
This calendar confuses me
---
As I am in work and cannot watch videos, thank you for explaining it as precisely as you did.
---
This is excellent news!
---
Yikes
---
I kind of want to see these guys fighting with each other on the beta servers without their respective swarms of idiots.
---
Dwarf? You sicken me. Lok'tar.
---
While I wholeheartedly agree with the general sentiment of your post, I strongly disagree on layering being the lesser evil to sharding.
---
(Same-realm) sharding would not have been a solution to the tourist problem, but it could easily have ended after a week or two. Layering is no solution either, and might just stay for a long time, if population does not evolve according to plan.
---
Very little beats the gold farming ability of a good mage.
---
Same, mine goes back to 2008 but only goes up to 2017.
---
I know everyone’s experience was different, but even starting on launch day I never saw this happen once.
---
This makes some sense, but it means within your server there will be blackrock mountain battles you can't be a part of, Hillsbrad fights you wont even hear about... until the server merges and you realize you were on the shit shard half without any of the pvp.
---
Hey man nice star citizen wallpaper
---
You raise very good points and I agree with everything youve brought up. We are all here pointing out potential flaws and some people are running with them as the core of the algorithm and losing their minds. They have obviously put a lot of thought and resources into this because they've heard the problems with sharding and are trying to make an authentic vanilla experience. I definitely understand that some people are making noise because they want to avoid sharing, but we also need to be reasonable. I will for sure be against if we are given reason to believe it is going to ruin our experience (ie relogging will change layers), but until then, they've given me enough reason to believe in their decision making.
---
Who are those people ?
---
I plan on playing with about 8 friends. Is there any idea on the number of layers there would be?
---
Sharding is not the same as crz.
---
Layering is just Sharding. The community is still being split and people will still pop in/out of existence. 
---
It "will only be for the first few weeks" supposedly.
---
and most of them were still kitable, you could kite anachronos to Orgrimmar all the way up to cata, I think the leash was only put on Kazzak
---
So you called me out to tell me I was correct? Or you still don’t understand that I was putting a REASON to an action... the word why in 2 posts ago means why, wondering if that’s the hold up.
---
I would be going orc rogue if it weren’t for my RL friends all going alliance 😭 at least I can have black skin and red eyes and roleplay a dark iron to remain somewhat edgy/evil
---
True, with groups you could be in different layers. But, I would take this instance over everyone and everything sharding in and out as you pass invisible lines to mine copper that disappears
---
There would be some merit to inviting those that have not played retail in a long time I think, since their opinion of the game is "untarnished" since then or whatever.
---
No, it doesn't. It literally says several thousand, verbatim. Forming hundred person raids
---
Okay Thank you!
---
Was there enough players on both factions and on the server in generel? 
---
I would hate it if the the only server with enough players would be all alliance or horde
---
After phase one. So after the hillsbrad leveling fighting, and all the leveling process and after some major blackrock mountain fights. Oh but I wasn't on the right layer (shard) so I missed all that.
---
I'm also interested in whether or not the invitee has enabled 2FA or not
---
All servers this round will likely progress from 1.12 to Naxx. Naxx will have more longevity IF they announce they aren't going to jump to BC, at least right away. 
---
If the point of Classic is to serve it as a museum peice, they can either lock it at Naxx, or open up a new 2+ year "Season" that starts at 1.12 again. Would they ever lock at 1.12? That would be quite the interesting server.
---
It doesn't, good luck tagging the wolves and defias thieves.
---
But probably the layers will be a bit more granular than that many people in one layer, initially. The number of people per layer is completely pulled out of thin air by OP as an example case. I imagine the layers will be closer to a couple of hundred people per layer until initial zerg rush of Level 1s spreads out into the greater world.
---
DO NOT PROVIDE THIS SERVICE TO MINORS.
---
it might break laws. contacting minors online, or worse, getting their contact info is, afaik, a felony in the states.
---
Not to mention there's no clear indication that you'll be able to have an alt on the same realm parked on a different layer than your main.
---
Then every review of it says how broken it is at launch and ign gives it a 2/5 because it isn't stable. And no one plays it. Just like for honor
---
I have a 32” curved monitor waiting patiently for August
---
Making for a super populated shard, a very sparsely populated shard, or a few medium pop shards. Not a fan but were stuck with it.
---
They will continue on with the layering, they claim they will stop at phase 1. 
---
They also said they wouldn't shard/layer/instance any of the contested zones
---
And you can level in a few days...lol
---
except hearthstone they did.
---
Actually see how good they are w/o the tons of support
---
Exactly. It's also not about fan service to long-time players.
---
FWIW I played in Vanilla too. Not that I'd ever be able to prove that since I have an account-trade-trail the size of a country mile.
---
I like pain. :P
---
They've confirmed they're going to be using queues and will be prepared to open new servers quickly as needed to stop that from happening. 
---
I'm not sure if this has been confirmed or not but I imagine if they do end up in that situation despite their best efforts at population management they will open up transfers to low population servers like they did in Vanilla.
---
The Plaguelands.
---
Depends on what you want it to do and which level will you keep it. 
---
For instance rogue @ 10 gets sprint.
---
Depending on what you consider keep up, that may require a ridiculously prolonged progression. One of the biggest bottle necks in Vanilla was gear. You got less gear, spread among more people with almost no alternating gearing options. If you were an average raider with no crucial role, it could take you ages to actually get a meaningful upgrade. And while you waited for those upgrades some geared people allready left the guild to play with other people that had gear - because guess what? You couldnt while getting geared.
---
Pwnt
---
I think people complaining don't understand how servers work.
---
12 weeks is WAY too long. Holy smokes.
---
thats not the real one lol
---
I just wanna go back to old shimmering flats :(
---
Is!
---
Pure!
---
Vanilla!
---
I get it that some (or most) of you don't want something like that. You don't want to stand in line to complete your quest. You want to progress your character, because you don't have time for that.
---
But This! is a seamless world, where everyones action makes a difference for everyone else.
---
It matters what you do. You will recognize that ass that blocks you from completing the quest.
---
God i hope they layer it in a way that's still overcrowded for the most part.
---
so I can only complain if I'm not gonna play classic? what kind of fucked up mentality is that?
---
Great point and very well said. I dont think there is a solution to the problem of launch that would make everyone happy. You cant just throw thousands of players at the world all at once, but still any split you do of the playerbase hurts the feeling of community that Classic is based on. Layering seems like a great fix to the problem. I think it's fair to have questions, but I agree that we (as a community) need to stop being so aggressive toward the dev team. They're doing a pretty great job with all the news they've given us so far.
---
screamer :(
---
I saw it/paticipated in one once at darkshore out in the ocean for a turtle shell quest iirc
---
Oh wow you showed him. Badass
---
I understand, I guess my comment was more or less directed at the community.  I know this is just a mistake you may have made but this post alone is going to misinform a lot of people who may not understand it fully.
---
Imagine actually standing in line. I just run over and loot it.
---
Crashing every 5 seconds is immersion breaking
---
not very.
---
Gonna be fun until you’re looking for X bear gizzards
---
its when everyone is going back to school, so summer is kinda over for a lot of people.
---
Still, cutting on food to be able to play a videogame is what it is: life priorities.
---
For once try replacing the word "wow" with "cocaine" on that speech and listen to yourself.
---
Either way you’d be throwing money down the drain if the goal is to get a key.
---
They aren’t playtesting this game, they are stress testing and looking for bugs. These tasks are usually handled quite well internally in modern game design, that’s why most ‘beta’ phases in other games are basically pre order gimmicks made available to sell a few more copies. 
---
They won’t need a lot of beta testers, but for the sake of it, let’s say they cap it at 10 000 (realistically I’d say they’ll give out at most 3500), your odds of getting an invite, even when subscribed and opted in, is still pretty much in lottery territory if we are to believe current sub numbers.
---
Bind interact with mouseover to scrollwheel and you'll be the fastest every time, fuck waiting.
---
Thanks for responding! I’m not concerned with the most needed.
---
The world isn't going to be empty though. The system doesn't even kick in until there are more than 3500 people on a single continent...
---
Sounds like you need new friends. :P
---
Yeah, after thinking about it for a few seconds, I think you're right about that. There's always going to be people who camp nodes, I'm sure the Devilsaur Mafia will make an emergence in Classic, and I'd be shocked if there was no account sharing when the honor system gets introduced. Those people will always exist, absolutely.  
---
But for a lot of people, that isn't what Classic will be about. I know a ton of people are going to be playing just the opposite way, myself included. I've done the tryhard grinds in every game I've ever played seriously and honestly I'm sick of it, it isn't fun for me anymore.   
---
My point with that post was that I don't think Layer-hopping is going to be a big deal. People are comparing it 1:1 with how retail works now, and I can't imagine it even being anywhere close to on-par considering everything the Classic team has done.
---
Yeah, they are orcs who remove their hands and strap weapons instead
---

---
The ambiguity in the post (intentional or not) has led some people to believe that having an active sub is required to be invited in the first place and some of those people to consequently purchase a sub in hopes of getting an invite. Given that beta slots are limited, it's easy to predict that the vast majority of people in this situation will not be invited. The ambiguity should never have been there. They should have specifically said in that post that "an active subscription is not *required* for the invite, just for accessing the beta itself." 
---
Additionally, even if it turns out that a sub **is** required for an invite, then it is clear promotion of gambling anyway. Only an incredibly small portion of the people who subbed based on that announcement will be invited. All the others will have subbed with the hope of securing their invite chance and still won't get in. And don't pretend that the gambling claim is invalidated because the sub purchase comes with another guaranteed item. An official post saying beta invites are coming and the beta requires an active sub. A bunch of people buy a sub around the time that post is released. It's clear they're buying the sub for the chance of beta access. Gambling.
---
Almost sad how desperate u are.
---
It's not just "ok" for UD dungeons, it's quite strong. I finally got my 45 minute Baron run completed (as priest) thanks to a competent pally tank. He wasn't even in raid gear he just didn't buy into the hype that pallies can't tank. I think we finished with about five minutes to spare.
---
this is what nost* is about
---
That sounds like a good mindset. Sounds like how the devs used to be where they actually had fun. Especially GMs
---
Don't be mad when your server economy will be even more fucked up by group like us who will abuse layering if we see benefit in doing so :)
---
Id assume increased spawn rates for day 1 starting zones. But if not it's just like vanilla, and that's what we want right?
---
but it wasn't a 3 hours Q... you can have  quick loss then try again
---
You called it!
---
No u
---
Will I need to buy WoW classic to play classic or can I just be subscribed to the current WoW with my battle.net account and somehow just play classic?
---
I did play cross realm BGs and that wasn’t my experience at all. But I can’t wait to get flamed for turtling an AV and having everyone whisper and complain to me “wtf man need my rep grinds ur server suxxors”
---
Okay, I can't decide and I need help picking.
---
THIS time around I want to role either a rogue or a mage.  Last time I did paladin and oh boy what a journey that was (standing around buffing all day haha).
---
What I can't decide is which experience is better in classic?  I dabbled in some twink rogueing (assassinationblade with agility woo woo) waaaaay back when and had a blast and did a 29 mage twink and loved that too.  Leveling for both was a blast so my main question is, from the real OGs, which one would you say is better?  
---
ah yes, they did it for cardstone so they will naturally do it for classic
---
They followed Saurfang and were after him, Saurfang lied.
---
Must be. I notice an immediate spike in zero vote posts. The elitists are fuming over simple questions. Still a fair share of shit posts and bad-faith grumbling.
---
Yeah you ignore all those people who cut and then later down the line theyre looking to fill your spot in a dungeon and get cucked
---
I disagree, but in the end Blizz could have done whatever they wanted and there would be nothing we could have done.
---
I'll find the actual quote later, but paraphrasing Ion he says it's kalimdor, the eastern kingdoms, all of azeroth and you can take a zeppelin across while in the same layer.
---
I'm interested to see your source on it being continent based.
---
Good luck doing it when it wont even exist after a few weeks. Make sure you don't join a guild.
---
Didnt vote Obama? (that was a dumb joke)
---
Lol what? How are you getting that from the info above?
---
This is a picture from a private server which have much higher populations than Vanilla servers did. Those addons would not have existed at the launch of Vanilla in 2004.
---
Find it funny how this man keeps going from hated to loved to hated to loved to... You get the point.
---
So much (unnecessary) overflowing feeelings about something as... an online video game.
---
Yeah this seems like a wonky story decision. If this is what they went with, I wonder what story beats were turned down.
---
I and most others already know what we're signing up for with classic, like an IGN review means anything lol.
---
Give me a server pop cap and queues, if a server has too long if a queue I'll join a different one
---
Honestly this is more of a pserver thing.
---
eeh no they wont
---
Nope. People will recognize you. You don't want to be the person that fucks all others, you won't get a spot in dungeons.
---
Read your last sentence of your post.
---
&gt;  aug. 27 is not a classic summer, its a classic fall. Yes i know its technically in the summer, but at the very very tail end.
---
The summer solstice is on June 21st, and the autumnal equinox is September 23rd.
---
August 27th is closer to the exact middle of summer than to the end of it.
---
If you LOVE their visuals, than go for it!
---
Now this is what I am excited for. People taking the defense and offense of their factions seriously. It's a natural role play that adds a core element to making the game fun and unpredictable.
---

Ukrainians minimum wage is 135 euros. That's working all month so no, in a country like that working weekends doesn't make you enough to pay for a wow sub.
---
Unfortunately there are still many people on this sub not getting how sharding actually works, even if several of us are trying to explain it for quite some time, they just don't listen ... then wonder why players feedback is not taken seriously ...
---
I have a few friends I'm currently getting into WoW, and while I'm not by any means in a great financial situation, I still want them to enjoy this game, so I offered to buy each of them their first month. I think we limit this to a similar manner. Maybe 60 day time per person? And yes, something like an ID to verify who is who. And must run a reverse image search on them, make sure they're not ones from the internet.
---
&gt; This! Is! Pure! Vanilla!
---
It isn't really though, it's a picture from a private server which likely had a much higher population than any Vanilla server.
---
This isn’t for classic
---
i don't know what part of my reply said they will for classic.
---
Is cold blood/prep garbage for pve? and similarly is combat swords garbage for pvp?
---
&gt;  People who move past the pack are going to find ghost towns where pvp and groups are many times harder to find
---
People who move ahead of the pack, are by definition, ahead of the pack. That means they will not find that many people. With layers they will find 1/numberoflayers the people in the open world, but still be able to group with all of the others.
---
&gt;  Every time shards are reshuffled to even out populations
---
Doesn't happen. You only change layers by inviting people or logging out. No reshuffling.
---
&gt;  If you do it the first way, you will end up with shards that are virtually empty ...
---
Load balancing is a very deep and rich-researched field. This is not anything new, this has been around for decades. There are algorithms that deal with the issues you are proposing. Just because the first two obvious solutions suck doesn't mean there isn't a well researched way to do this.
---
Your last paragraph I disagree 100% with every sentence to the t, so there is little point to elaborate on that.
---
brutal!
---
It'll be a drop-down on the "Region" list of the normal World of Warcraft section of the launcher. It will install the game to the World of Warcraft folder, likely under \_classic_
---
Zone phasing is shit for vanilla because of world pvp.
---
I gotta keep a lookout, I had an early BFA beta invite that I didn’t notice till later

This guy is trash. #streamerssuck
---
It really says a lot about the selfish mentality of players that this sentiment seems common. Same with the people supporting layering. 
---
Yeah, back in the day people liked to do things like this and interact with large amounts of people in an MMO because it was FUN! What a concept! 
---
I see massive amounts of people in starting zones and think that's pretty cool to see so many people interacting in the same environment at once. Lots of retail players just see a slight inconvenience to collecting their 5 wolf assholes for whatever bullshit quest they're doing.
---
About as good of writing as game of thrones season 8 if you ask me
---
When they talked about sharding, 2-3 weeks and early zones were things to take away from their thoughts. Nothing confirmed at that point, but nevertheless; 2-3 weeks of sharding servers for the early portion of the game (early can kind of mean whatever here).
---
Today, we have confirmed layering for the entire game for what is probably up to 2-3 months (phase 1, MC/Ony but no Dire Maul).
---
As can be seen in the threads linked by the OP, playing with people from other servers isn't the only issue people have. And layering adds potential or real problems that sharding wouldn't have.
---
One such issue is that the AH is across all layers, yet you're competing against a pool of 3k players for farming spots. This gives you multipe Tyr's Hands or WPLs to farm Crusader for. Multiple Deadwind Pass ogre camps to farm +9 str to bracers from. This makes prices drop much quicker, as there is a bigger supply available, where traditionally, this wouldn't be the case even on the biggest of servers. Sharding or not.
---
Another is adding people from dungeons to play with later. You're both on L1 on Thursday, but on Friday you're L3 and they're L1. Suddenly you pop from an empty city/zone into a fully living one when you get invited to their group. When the dungeon is finished and you hearth out and leave group? Back to the empty city on your ghost town layer, because there were 6.1k people online and layers are 3k.
---
A third one is the message it sends. Their priority with this feature is to make it as smooth for the so called "tourists". Players who won't stick around, but will give it a shot. They're the ones who benefit the most from this. If you want a thriving community, this is not it. That one ninja looter might be able to ninja on multiple layers before he's well known. The economy will be strange. How will Black Lotus be handled? OG spawn timers but full spawns for each layer? Dynamic spawns based on player numbers? Shared pool among the layers, so a low player count layer is ideal for farming? This goes for rare spawns too. Do hunters want ghost towns to tame Broken Tooth, or full ones, because there's a higher chance  the only instance of the pet spawns there?
---
You can't join your friends in L1 who keeps asking for people to join them in repelling the alliance scum taking over Nesingwary's over b.net, because the layer is full. You can't log on prior to 5pm due to work, so you're almost never in L1. Your layer has brawls, sure, but not the epic slaughter that is happening on L1 right now, where they're posting screenshots to Discord and having a blast while you're envious. You lose out on community-building events such as these, because you were on the wrong layer.
---
These are just some of the worse examples I could find, but they are very real. At least I imagine these will be commonplace. Especially the first two and the last one.
---
What sorcery is this?
---
Aww come on you could get a beta invite 5 days before they close it a month from launch. Yay? Oh right that's total bullshit I forgot for a second there.
---
Hence why its only active for 3 weeks and not the entirety of Classic.  The know the concerns, but it is necessary for a smooth launch, and to keep the servers full for more than a week or two, AND it does that without destroying server community, or breaking immersion.
---
Was it in the form of an email?
---
Actually, yes. Ideally, they'd think of a way to handle the tourist problem too. Like server merges.
---
Ohh someone downvoted me lol gotta love those fan bois
---
Can someone post what this is originally from? I'd be interested in watching it.

With the current state of spring here I feel like we will have a very warm september.

Hahaha, I know I like you just by this one sentence.

For those saying they don't see their full history you can try sending a request for all saved information about you. Even includes the artifacts that I unlocked for the HotS beta when that was still part of the game systems.

CHRIS METZEN IS BACK!!!

(oh yeah, and Thrall, of course)
---
pw: 17hunter
---
Yeah mate i get you. And you get my point i think. 
---
Look, it's less population than pservers anyway, theres no reason at all to layer it. It won't be like this, there will be much less people competing in the world.
---
I get you, opinions are different. 
---
For me, i experienced that and i would love it.
---
In same boat, did paladin from release through most of naxx, not doing that again lol. I've been going between rogue, mage, and warlock. Mage is probably most convenient just because of portals, but I'm leaning to warlock for overall game play of pve/pvp and ease of farming.
---
With all due respect to your Cptstg, what are your trying to say? :D
---
You’re a strange human
---
Can you stop spreading misinformation around the subreddit, they only confirmed that you need a subscription to play the beta, not to be selected
---
"I was so angry, I even made a comment on reddit"
---
I do not understand your statement - you argue that the problem, if solved by sharding, would disappear in a few weeks. However, if you use layering, the same problem will last for months. No idea how you came to that conclusion.
---
&gt; but it could easily have ended after a week or two
---
Easily? and leave you in a realm with 15 000 people, begging for a mob to kill.
---
Found the hacker
---
But you can always choose to stay unflagged for PvP. Your point is?
---
I know exactly what you're talking about, and had the same experience there.  (but this was on a cluster fuck private server)
---
That's because this picture is not how vanilla really was but about private servers that have 4-5 times more population than vanilla ever had.

you can't do TBC without flying. the whole world is built around flying. how do you wanna raid Tempest Keep if you don't have flying?
---
not that I disagree with you that TBC *should* have been done without flying. but your current goals (play TBC without flying) aremutually exclusive
---
StaySafe: "if you don't know you're getting into the beta today, you're probably not getting into the beta today"
---
He said first round invites will be mostly exclusive. Unless you have connections, don't get your hopes up.
---
Can someone clarify this for me please - I’m having a little difficulty understanding layering.
---
Is it basically splitting a realm when the population is high but as the population stabilises merging it back together?
---
Yeah dude, when the raid leader stands there with 5 different rogues and one ret paladin, I wonder who he's going to pick as melee dps. Get out of your fucking bubble.
---
McConnell OMEGALUL
---
Yeah Sad :)
---
Which it will be, and you would know that, if you did &gt;0 research.
---
30, 60 whatever just so that people can play. But this is nice of you. Hope you will have a great time playing with your friends. And yea first shot is always for free, just to get them hooked on :D
---
Wouldn't we have to buy the latest xpac to play it anyway?
---
Honestly they are probably using this to gauge how many suckers there are in the bunch and see what the response would be for microtransactions.
---
Nope everyone on your empty faction already rerolled to another server
---
If stange = good reading comprehesion then sure im with you
---
Are you sure it was blizzard that parked it? When I tried going to the classic website my job’s network flagged it as a parked domain, not sure if that would happen if someone other than a “BUY THIS DOMAIN TODAY” pages was at that address.
---
This subreddit already had significant numbers of readers even when beta wasn't announced. Classic had up to a third of the readers at any given time of wow. And this is with no beta, and no game to actually play.
---
I think that when Classic comes out, and people actually have something to play, retail WoW will take a back seat for a very long time, if not permanently.
---
No it won't. Past phase 1 there will be no layering
---
No. Common sense generally doesn't include thinking of things from unpleasant or uncommon perspectives. Most people take things at face value without overthinking it, which is fine. It takes critical thinkers to help people see things differently. If you have this ability, you should use it to help people instead of criticizing them for not having 'common sense.'
---
Basically, American politics?
---
I was there when he said it... I hope it’s not ALL content creators and streamers. Hopefully there are some regular players that make it in too!
---
&gt; You’ll see new people every day.
---
Up until like the second week, when you have seen basically all of them. If they do 15000 people per realm, with 5x3000 layers, you will basically need 5-10 log-ins to witness the whole realm worth of people.
---
Well they will be capping player counts on each server probably so i doubt there will be more than 2 or 3 layers for any single continent. Id be surprised if most servers except the "streamer" servers even see layering in any noticeable way.
---
The company is not responsible for the player assuming that they have a chance at getting in by subbing. If the sub comes with an additional item, it’s not gambling, because that item is guaranteed. It is not their fault you missed an announcement, or did not read clearly enough. If it were, they could be charged. 
---
Listen, if you want to play their game in ANY WAY, you must pay. The sub has always been there, this is not a surprise. Expecting something out of nothing is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Where do you sign up? I'm probably too late but wanted to toss my name in the hat.
---
Woooa now you won't get to play the test.... You get a CHANCE at getting to play the test. Lol they aren't just gonna give you the beta.
---
I’m sure someone will post it here when they get one.
---
?
---
8 GB of ram is screaming in agonizing pain
---
I love how you completely make up so many numbers.
---
Big mood
---
&gt; That will give you a nice reputation on your vanilla server that will follow you forever. 
---
Wow. You actually believe looting quest items during leveling will tarnish someone's reputation. By all means, I would want to avoid people who thinks like that.
---
Alright fair enough, I suppose I'm not as hardcore of a player as you are. Masses of people would personally ruin my levelling experience more than layering would.
---
I don't think enough people will be high enough level in the first few weeks during which layering will occur, to be able to form a full scale raid on a city...
---
I was hoping someone else noticed this!
---
Omar starts about it at about 4:30 (timestamped: https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=270)
---
Reviewing it myself, I think it might be less clear than I originally thought. Though it would appear, and make the most sense to treat the continents a bit differently because it is their populations that will affect server stability. You aren't helping people with population issues if you are basing the layer size off everyone being clumped up on one continent while another is much less packed. In his example he says you should stay in the same layer as you move through leveling, starting in EK all the way north in a single play-session. I would imagine that if you get on a boat to Kalimdor the game, trying to balance the layers for optimal population size, would check to see what Kalimdor layer you should land in, based on the number of people playing in Kalimdor at that time.
---
These are after all different instances, EK and Kalimdor. Always have been.
---
Arbeit ma.....wait fam
---
Idk if "my future" is really a concern here, I'm an adult with a job and shit so I mean as for my future, WoW doesn't effect that, the fuckin economy does lol.
---
As far as I can see: It doesn't and wasn't intended to solve this issue.
---
The lag of many people in the same place is not a problem according to Ion, it's the fact that if you have 200 people in Elwynn, there won't be a single mob  to kill. But he says you could easily have 1000 people in Elwynn and nothing would happen.
---
Yeah but at least you recognized some of the names in your shitty unfun games, isn't that so cool 😂
---
God the PvP on my server was so shit for so long, when Xrealm BGs came it was so glorious, actually saw more people than my realm than before because they actually queued up now
---
Sounds like a fun time
---
Like in classic, server queues until people reroll on newly made servers
---
That was just my way of saying I won't play it. I don't actually expect them to remove flying.
---
Mage has more group utility, in my opinion, with food/water, ports, sheep, etc. Rogue really only has sap. Plus, from what I hear, Mage AoE farming is quite lucrative for both leveling and gold farming. Both Mage and Rogue are high DPS classes in PvE, and they both excel in PvP. Ultimately, it may come down to your playstyle preference. Having played a bit of both back then, I can say that both classes are quite fun. If I had to choose between which class I had more fun with, I'd probably choose Rogue, but only marginally.
---
Salty people could...and this is just a WILD idea so stick with me...delay starting Classic until the layering is over and merged if they don't like it.  O_O
---
How long have you been playing? If you are a doto1 veteran you might saw him on Facebook as he was registered there with his icefrog@gmail.com email (thats where I saw him). Otherwise, recently there were legal documents released with his real name (same guy).
---
Keep in mind and respect that he doesn't want his face or name to be shown.
---
I’ll  give you $75 in 2 years so you can get it outta your closet
---
I suspect the sub numbers to jump over 12,000,000 at launch. Then fade down to around 2-5,000,000 over the next few weeks
---
Watch the TipsOut interview and pay attention. Omar says the layers will be dynamically scaled.
---
Well if your faction is dead then you won't be running into the same group on the other side every time...
---
Imagine playing retail. Yikes.
---
Yeah, that's not what that means. Layers aren't fixed. When you log in you get assigned one for that session (or until you join a group with another layered person in), they're all going to have roughly the same number of people on. So as a rough example, as the population decreases over the first few weeks:
---
5 layers at launch with 2500 people on each
---
Then 4 with 2000 each
---
Then 3 with 1500
---
By now let's assume the pop stops dropping so much, and players well spread out, so then 2 layers with 2000 each, then finally one server with all 4000. Numbers are totally made up but it demonstrates what they're doing.
---
After release: [https://classicdb.ch/?item=4496](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4496)
---
I did not make them up, numbers that are not confirmed I specifically stated were just speculation or that I’m making an assumption. No attempts were made to lead people astray.
---
Those numbers are baseless and don’t mean anything.
---
&gt; It's just that sharding is easy to turn off, layering isn't.
---
How so?
---
Where did it say that?
---
SIKE!
---
My balls are so wet right now....
---
Good point. But don’t worry, blizzard will be prepared. That‘s the reason for the possibility to reserve the names 2 weeks(!) before release. Blizz isn’t stupid. Most of us would use it, and the other part registered for beta or reactivate the account before launch.
---
TL;DR: Speculation.
---
Feel free to edit your post with a semblance of data to back up your claims.
---
Yes i bet they are expecting to lose 90% or maybe 95% of the player base in the first few months. I remember a statistic around the time of TBC that said _most_ players dont make it past level 11 or something like that.. That was by all characters on an account not just people making alts.
---
Hunter is probably one of my favorite classes to play in 5-man content. Both BM and Survival offer a lot of utility and you can kite for days. As the natural pulling class you also get to set the pace for the group.
---
&gt;I did not make them up
---
&gt;I specifically stated were just speculation or that I’m making an assumption.
---
You contradicted yourself in a single sentence reply.
---
I think most of this post is speculative garbage, sorry I know thats harsh, but random numbers on random numbers really makes this untenable. 
---
BUT 
---
&gt; Then we have twitch streamers. You might be tempted to ignore it, but Classic will have Shroud, Summit, TimTheTatMan, Sodapoppin, Kungen, and many others that will undoubtedly push WoW to #1 
---
I find this to be the strongest and tenable argument, these are very big names and they hold a lot of sway and weight behind them.
---
I don't care how many other people are playing Classic. I'm playing Classic. you are welcome to join me.
---
Waiting for the new YouTube video - "Asmongold reacts to content creators receiving Classic Beta invites".
---
I can’t find an email for it, I just had it in my account that’s all
---
.. you just don't shard anymore? Total population cap is unaffected with sharding, very unlike layering.
---
They clearly didn't see soda wreck asmon in arena without trying.
---
Stormwind is Alliance territory, you would be safe even on a PvP server
---
Some of them are not so professionally estimated, yes, but some of them are real.
---
That's wonky too, Saurfang is all about honor and that would be a very dishonorable move.
---
vanilla collector's edition 
---
it came with a code u can use to get certain pets ?zergling/diablo/?? i forget exactly which ones
---
Hi, /u/billymane
---
The hybrid tax still existed in BC with pure DPS reigning supreme (hi warlocks) but hybrids were worth bringing for their unique utility.
---
Speculation and assumption is making numbers up. Also no source for your 100,000,000 WoW players number, the number you base your whole post on.
---
Disagree. 
---
The appeal of games like PUBG and Fortnite is that’s it’s fast instantaneous action. You die, oh well, just fire up a new game. You don’t have to wait while watching the rest of your team play. On top of that those games are free. 
---
The first time someone goes on a five minute corpse run they’re going to quit and never touch the game again.
---
... you just set the number of layers to 1, the max size to infinity.
---
There, layering turned off.
---
I wish they would just make them cost a fuckload. Like 5k or something.
---
Hang on, by sit in defence stance do you mean they use defensive stance or they use /sit
---
They don't send emails anymore because of scams. They just flag your account.
---
That's it! It's the WORLD of Warcraft.
---
I remember hearing some twitch streamer ranting about how the entire modern game can be played by sitting in SW or Org and never leaving due to LFG and lfr and all that shit

No shit. I stated twice that the post was entirely speculation. The only data I had presumed to be accurate was the amount of total WoW players and the amount of twitch viewers that will see Classic WoW.

No one here is going to get a beta invite.     
---
I haven't been subbed to wow for over half a year.     
---
They said you have to be current sub to get one. RIP that.
---
i honestly expect around 13-14% of the world's population to play classic wow
---
That is very generous of you. I can afford the monthly sub and internet etc. the only thing stopping me is my 8 year old computer doesn’t support direct x metal so I need a new computer to be able to play, but I’m not going to ask for help with that :P I just got a new job, so here’s hoping I can save enough to get a computer in the next 3 months!

And you get a realm with 15k contemporary players. Nice solution!

But theyre are way too many, for this to be a defensive stance you have to have more of an argument than I have this 1 number, if I change it a bunch it becomes this number. 
---
&gt; I reckon over 90% of them know about Classic. Yes that is an arbitrary number, this thread is just my speculation   
---
&gt; Let’s assume 10% of old WoW players will be returning 
---
Why you have to give some sort of reasoning, this is just fluff unless you give it substance
---
What does this imply for the end-game ? The viability of some classes will be different ? I mean, we know that spriests for example are going oom very fast, and it is their #1 weakness, so is it only going to impact levelling or the whole meta as we knew it?
---
You’re going on about the semantics of “making something up” which I believe is different than creating estimates. You’re arguing that they are the same thing.
---
Yea we started during doto 1. Before kunkka, invoker and I think huskar were added. Never seen his face, thought he was always keen on privacy and I respect that. Most respected game designer in my mind.
---
My experience in the PvP ranking community is that it is organized outside of guilds. Most hardcore PvPers are apart of their own separate hardcore raiding guild. However I would love to see a rise of competitve PvP groups that are focused more on winning battlegrounds and WPvP zone control, and who see ranking as a means not an end.
---
Lol have you seen bfa. They dont care about feedback.
---
Beta has always been about money and publicity since the mop beta. It is not about testing.
---
It's for testing, what bias are you expecting?
---
well you are unflag while in a major city so it won't be any different from being in a PvE realm.
---
And if you turn off your sharding? You get a realm with 15k contemporary players. Nice solution!

---
Yes to both
---
I’m not one to usually say this but just google it, it’s not hard.
---
Lok’tar ogar!
---
Good. As long as you got your priorities straight.
---
Or remain unflagged
---
What's the reason
---
When I played on Nostalrius when it first launched there was a long line of people on every spot for those quest items. Maybe 10-20 people standing in line. It worked surprisingly well most of the time.
---
2x27 is by far the better choice. I personally wouldn't go much bigger than 27", it's a good size for a PC monitor.
---
They might nerf game to the ground because leveling is slow and game is hard. Beta seems just for the streamers to get hype up and gain some subs to chance to gain access beta.
---
What do you mean 'technically summer?' There's at least 2-3 more months of summer after August. Sincerely, Texas, where we have no Fall and winter doesn't start until around December 15.
---
So what do you suggest? Because im pretty sure i saw every spec once raids became farm. In fact, why is this game still treated as if raids was the only thing to do? Old players that want it, know what to expect, new players will find enough to do even if they don't raid. Im truly trying to understand the "not viable spec" bullshit going on here.
---
Define non viable overall.  In fact, the OP stated "class viability". How does this work exactly? There are no non-viable classes, only subpar specs. Also there will be one Ret paladin, so even if he picks 4 rogues, he won't pick the fifth.
---
I don't know about books, but maybe nobbel87 on youtube will quench your thirst.
---
This is just a dungeon set  that anybody can get though. A warrior/pally can wear anyone's dungeon set.
---
The content is still quite easy without them. World buffs are not used by players because it is impossible or difficult to kill the content without them; they are used so that you spend the least amount of time possible doing so. 
---
As for your fourth point, since outside of naxx there are next to no mechanical challenges, the competition you alude to will still boil down to drop RNG and raw dps output.
---
Yes, it is highly convenient to invite a priest/paladin/shaman if you are a healer druid. It's a good sinergy with shadow/ret/enhancement/elemental, since they usually are not usually very welcome in groups, so they'll be more than happy to join, and they can definitely pull their own weight in 5 man content.
---
They don't bug test anyway, if anyone here has been apart of past beta they would prob be able to confirm, its a kickback play for those who keep them in buisness and tbh thats pretty good buisness.
---
Couldn't you have googled it before you made your post? It's not hard.
---
The burden of proof is on you mate. Can't make baseless claims then complain when asked to provide a source.

---
Edit: Oh jesus you then make a comparison to dark souls. This is gaming journalism level bad
---
No shit the end is lame. But the journey is fun. If both sides are aiming to pvp so hard the other quits, its a gas. 
---
If one side is like that and the other wants to...well not...it ends poorly...after 2-3 or more years.
---
People are saying the new servers can’t handle this
---
They want people that will actually give them feedback and visibility, hence people that have actively been engaged in the game for a long time and streamers, not people clamoring to play classic after being out of the game since TBC.
---
Recurring alpha/beta invites have always been procedurally granted to people that are known to have provided beneficial information.
---
Didnt they say the beta was going to be capped to 30?  Wont be able to test Doom...
---
Edit: hrm, only seeing that it says a level cap will be in place for the stress testing.
---
Either way, though...Doom is lvl 60.
---
If I am not mistaken there is a link floating around to the OLD world of warcraft site. My memory is hazy but I think they had class lore as well as history of the old gods and such on there too.
---
Doubt it. My IRL friends played religiously from TBC to Cata (4-5 hours a day). All of them still play MMOs, but wow is "boring as hell and way too slow". I got them to try private servers and they didn't make it past level 10. Too much instant gratification in modern games; people become accustomed to that over time.
---
With all the modern games out today I'd be willing to bet there are a sizable amount of ex-wow players that feel the same about the game. They'll see Classic and think "oh that's cool" and it stops there. 
---
It will still have a lot of players, but that 12,000,000 number is probably not happening again.
---
Thank you. I was not attempting to convince people that my numbers were correct, just that people are underestimating the reach that Classic will actually have.
---
While im usually pretty salty at this because i never got accepted for betas before, they want to include people who play a lot, giving out betas to random people that sign up is a crapshoot, they just want people who they can clearly see play a lot.
---
Don't go putting feral into the same group as ret, sir.
---
Sharding does NOT AFFECT OVERALL POPULATION. It's just a way to distribute the 3k more conveniently.
---
You assume we have loved ones???
---
they're saying that they wouldn't bother paying $15 even if it were a guarantee that they'd get beta access, because they're happy waiting until official servers come out.
---
But layers will only occur for a few weeks. Why implement something that will be rendered useless after 14-21 days? Screw that sellout for spreading false info for clicks...
---
&gt; I get a subscription today I can play classic wow
---
No you can't. There's no guarantee you'll get invited, the CHANCE it's actually extremely TINY.
---
If you're subbing thinking you *will* play before the game is released, just do yourself a favor and save your money.

RpPvP servers were added in patch 1.8 and therefore were part of the game at the end of vanilla

---
I agree, but the "no name" streamers are the most popular classic wow streamers.
---
my first thought was "lesbians?"
---
Kinda hoping friends &amp; family get in.
---
where are the servers located now then? I know I get different ping in different servers so I know they're not all in LA
---
yeah i was planning on getting my lock to 60 and getting my epic unarmored mount the only pressure i feel is from myself

Just another attempt to stir shit up and get people upset or divided.

Horrible bait.
---
Downvoted and moving on now...
---
and they were made by a bunch of people on their free time without any special education etc. And they still managed to make something really similar. The point is they improved the cores to the point where the servers could handle a lot bigger population :)
---
I thought so too before going over to the official forums for WoW. Most people i saw on the thread about Classic were saying how they won't be playing it. Reasons were:
---
1. Story matters to them and they would like to see it progressed.
---
2. Grinding isn't fun.
---
3. Rotations isn't more complex then retail.
---
4. Old graphics.
---
5. Repetitive quests
---
6. Paying a monthly fee to play a 15 year old game
---
Now i don't know how much of that is the ecochamber or safespace effect (that we have to consider applies to us here aswell) or just a reflection about how the gaming community have changed. We all like Classic's "hard but rewarding" appeal, but it seems we are the minority. I think i'll be making my char on the highest populated server i can find just to be on the safe side.
---
And make $20 at most? I make more than that hourly, and I’d rather now take up space sitting in a closet. Each to their own I guess
---
Started the morning of WoW launch. Not even close, as others have stated.
---
You're wrong. Let me explain.
---
A car salesman wants to sell you a car that you can't afford. Instead of helping you acknowledge this (doing the right thing instead of pushing profits), he decides he can stretch the loan terms to make it more affordable.
---
The simple-minded rejoice and say I can afford it after all while being assfucked by extended loan terms and worst interest rates. The salesman wins because he has spun the situation to not look as scary as before. Blizzard = car salesman
---
It's bad game design to allow any sharding or layering and the only excuse is greed because it allows more people to play at all times more fluidly (thus pushing profits, less complaints, more people can play, etc.) and significantly reducing server costs. The problem is that it slices through communities like butter now and redacts the original glory of the game. It comes at too high of a cost to the quality of the game and acceptance of it is pathetic.
---
Someone trying to serve me a shit sandwich and wrapping it the most exquisite gift wrap doesn't change the fact that it is a shit sandwich. Raise your standards and quit tolerating low-quality bullshit from a multi-billion dollar company that has more than deep enough pockets to do it right but chooses not to do so.
---
As I understand it, you are correct in saying that Paladin is not shoehorned into a particular profession. Engineering is always useful for PvP, but I wouldn't say it's required if you don't plan on hitting it too seriously. I plan to play a Paladin, myself. My plan for leveling is a Holy/Ret spec--something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxoZZVdxtbcq). From what I've read/heard, some form of Ret is important for a decent leveling experience, but it's subjective. You lose a fair amount of damage if you go deep Holy or Prot. Of course, if you plan to tank dungeons in the later levels, some form of Prot is fine. AoE farming after around level 40 is an option, but it is dependent on gear to be efficient. As far as race is concerned, there doesn't appear to be a significant difference between the two. I'll be rolling Human for the reputation bonus, really. Hope I've helped.
---
I'm not crying, you're crying!
---
Dire Maul and ZG are the 'catch ups' IMO.
---
Anyone know how many were for grabs?
---
Really hope they take into account when people started playing WoW. My account went live 11/04 and was active all the way through BC.
---
Thunderaan and Ragnaros.
---
They should have a pre-launch, where they don't shard/layer/etc 6 hours before the real launch.  And when everyone is still in starting zones at lvl 1, unable to do anything, turn layering on and be like.   See its for you guys to be able to play.  Not to hinder the "vanillaness"
---
Handle it!
---
Exactly zero people are going to be blacklisted at 60 for cutting a line for a quest item at level 10 lmao, that shit is not vanilla
---
Half your argument is assuming that this hypothetical addon that you aren't sure can be implemented in the first place.
---
The second half of your argument is based on an assumption that you can /who people within a zone that are on a separate layer.
---
I don't play wow. I came across this post in my timeline thinking it was about feces.
---
While being feared is a bit annoying, have to remember that taking damage while feared will break fear after a certain point. You can tank all the damage in the world during a stun and there’s nothing you can do about it. Resisting a stun, which more classes have than a fear, will be more powerful than getting out of a fear once every 2 mins. Plus, active vs passive is another whole argument.
---
I really do not see what you are saying. So let's make this precise: you have realm Arthas, with 15 000 players trying to play the game on that realm.
---
Solution Layering:
---
At the start, create 50 layers, with 300 people so they can quest in Elwynn. The third day, once a lot of people leave Elwynn, create 5 layers with 3000 people and distribute them wisely (guilds together, etc). As the player count reaches 12 000, you will slowly stop using the fifth layer, and only use 4 layers. Over the course of one month, you get 1 layer with 8000 permanent players, which fulfills the goal of "we want to have big large servers" which Ion stated.
---
Solution sharding:
---
You create ~500 shards for 30 people each, so they can quest, but they constantly phase in and out, can't herb because the herb disappeared (because they phased into a different shard, common in Legion+Bfa), and really have a Legion/Bfa feeling througout the first week, before sharding gets turned completely off. At that point, you are stuck with a server of 12 000 people, with poor Goretusks dead 100% of the time.
---
How exactly would Sharding solve more issues / the issues better / be in any way shape or form better than layering?
---
If I resub tomorrow will I still get a chance at a beta key or are they ALL going out today?
---
Because they are trying so hard with horrible writing to make sylvanas into a villain, when in reality, she has done nothing at all wrong, and been betrayed a dozen times for her decent nature. 
---
Betrayed while she was alive, betrayed as a banshee, betrayed when she joined the horde, betrayed during wotlk by her own apothecary, betrayed in cataclysm when trying to end the worgen threat.. the list goes all the way to saurfang betraying her and not killing malfurion, so she had to destroy the fucking tree as a show that she can destroy their hope.
---
Faction rivalry. So much fun trying to defend your raid from the other faction while trying to kill a city boss.
---
Unless populations drop at apparently the rates they expect that seems very unlikely
---
The issue is probably much more about server stability than it is making sure the server doens't feel crowded.
---
Seeing how they shard in retail, I don't think the client can handle 8,000 people online. Or hundreds of people in Azshara for when Azurgos spawns
---
No new content! No changes!
---
lel ofc they will

Here you go! These are most of the novels, does not include short stories or manga.
---
Rise of the Horde through Day of the Dragon cover the first 3 wars, equivalent to Warcraft I, II, and III. Rise of the Horde and The Last Guardian are my favorites that I've read so far!
---
I don't think there are any novels that specifically cover Vanilla, just the events leading up to it.
---
Free server transfers on a low pop server, just like in vanilla.

Out of curiosity why the fuck would you think blizzard would say “summer” based around a school calendar year?  Like why would that make sense?  They said summer. It’s a summer release date and beats the end of summer by a month. Like why do you feel betrayed?

Wowclassic.com there is a beta opt in button! :)

It's funny to see people still think feral is anywhere near the meme of a ret paladin.

Saurfangs honor is based on what he wants to do at the moment. Dishonorable to kill malfurion? Honorable to kill women and children in the dark shore.

Ya I'm just laughing about how it's merely a chance at getting an invite for 15$/m
---
5'5" and all

Thanks for all the suggestions . Surprised nobody mentioned Shaman, he was a choice i was considering ( alongside with warlock and hunter ). I researched hunter a bit and alot of people say that i have to watch for the auto attack animation and people seem to find that annoying so i m not sure about that even though i was really digging getting a pet and feeding it again etc ( rolled a hunter as 1st char in vanilla ofc as a noob kid ).  
---
Lock seems really good idea and probably will go for it. Didnt think about alliance warlock and it seems its true that most people go horde warlock it seems?  Mage is something i would enjoy i think but will be plenty of mages and i tend to be the good guy and back up and allow other people have priority over me in raid spots or loot etc so nahh. Druid is something i like as well but he seems only heal in pve and bear in pvp? not sure about that though
---
I knew it would come to you accusing me of not wanting to pay. Somehow you people always circle back to that. Such a tired, stupid, demeaning personal attack that has no place in this argument. I'm going on record now and saying I would happily pay $15 if I *knew* I was getting access to the beta. But not before that point. Paying $15 for a chance to be invited to the beta is gambling and I don't gamble. Regardless, past betas have been free, even if you didn't have an active subscription. But I guess that doesn't support your argument, so you didn't include it.
---
It is their job to clearly outline what is purchased when they advertise something. They advertised that the beta itself would require a paid sub. Good job that's correct. They did not specify that invites would or would not require a sub. Read the [post](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) yourself and tell me where it **confirms** that invites don't require a active sub. I can tell you that it doesn't confirm anything of the sort at all and that ambiguity should not be there. It will lead people to think that they have no chance of getting an invite if they don't have a sub, given that access to the beta itself does require an active subscription. It is Blizzard's responsibility to curb that ambiguity. Who else does the responsibility belong to? Who else can clarify the ambiguity?
---
I love you ^ _ ^

Not everyone gets to play WoW, it's that simple. It's a luxury, like all the other luxuries you're comparing it to.

**More specifically**, it's disingenuous to say this is what Classic is about when this is a screenshot from a private server and not Vanilla (which is actually what Classic is trying to emulate).
---
thanks for the suggestion . will probably go for that it seems. opinion on a shaman with the hybrid build people talk about?
---
Lopsided servers can develop QUICK
---
I care more about having balanced numbers so the pvp experience is always fun instead of just serving as some type of "proof" that "your side has better pvpers" or some strange acknowledgement along those lines. I just don't find it fun running a gank squad of 10 people going around killing one or two stragglers: a challenge is what's fun, where the outcome isn't predetermined.
---
It's already difficult enough to get balanced servers, because there's a positive feedback effect of the lower pop faction xferring or rerolling away. I want my opponents strong so it's meaningful when I defeat them.
---
Lmfao at the people who are worried about mounts in Vanilla. Go play retail if you want customization.
---
i would really enkjoy mage but i think alot of people will try it and will have hard time in loot i guess?
---
Then you can't afford to play a game. Get over it or make life changing choices.
---
I'm crying!
---
Response was concerning server merges not layering
---
That is not what they said. They said phase 1 and that could be 6 months out. Plenty of time to screw up the economy with too many copies of resources.
---
That's completely irrelevant, they're recreating the spirit of Vanilla, not a carbon copy. The Vanilla experience also included buggy items, game breaking bugs and exploits, impossible to kill bosses, an AQ event most of the server couldn't even access and new raids nobody has experienced before.
---
imagine being you and STILL not understanding layering
---
Rofl exposed
---
I agree, but Phase 2 can't be too long without BGs. I meant to say "2-3 months" for Phase 1, but I guess 4-5 would be better.
---
It's because this community takes pride on regurgitating information that they've been told, as if it's gospel. Feral proved its raid viability years ago but its hard to penetrate the perpetual conventional "wisdom" that is circulated by people with almost no experience with the class.
---
I didnt say otherwise. He asked a question and i answered.
---
Yeah me too but don't worry, they'll have a hard wake-up soon enough when they'll meet the real thing.
---
Opinion on hunter fun to play? I read that his auto attack animation thingy is important and annoying but my ocd will make me hate him if i dont do it lol
---
Hi, /u/saucierlol
---
Would be funny to see my 15-year-younger-self hear those words said with such conviction
---
Ion specifically said in the new interview, that they want to do this as soon as possible, and be constantly reducing the layers week by week.
---
People in Diacord Report invite s not sure.
---
but you can completely ignore them since stormwind is not a pvp zone.
---
The point is there is going to be content you cannot do without a clique.  Have fun being on the outside watching streamers get benediction.  Good luck in AQ when you can't get NR gear from the world bosses etc.
---
You think "more people doing world bosses" is a good thing? This is not tag it and be loot eligible, you have to be in the 40 man group dummy.
---
Have fun slowly grinding your way to 60 only to be cockblocked by cliques while trying to relive 2004 glory days.
---
I played a 30/0/21 shaman in vanilla and am a gladiator shaman currently and play it a ton on pservers too. It's great for world pvp and premade BGs. It's terrible for pvp healing though. It also is okay for raid healing but only when you have decent gear. I wouldn't reccomend that unless you dont mind going deep resto for a while first
---
&gt; Look, it's less population than pservers anyway, theres no reason at all to layer it.
---
It won't be lower population than pservers initially. They're going to over fill servers so that they will still have a healthy active population once the tourists leave and people fall into regular playing schedules after launch. While the server is over filled they need to do something to make the game playable. Once populations fall to normal levels then layering will disappear.
---
Meh, i am not even trying because you have to have an active sub to get a beta invite they said.
---
Time to hit the tram

I agree. The worst thing we can do is reward their efforts to be transparent and attentive to their fan base with grief and whining. You don’t have to agree 100% with all decisions. You might WANT to wait 2 hours for your chance to tag a respawning kobold or get DCed for the first week of your classic experience. You might see this as an unsatisfactory compromise, but compromise is a hell of a lot better than an empty promise from the retail team. Or the retail team making drastic cuts and changes or devoting entirely too much effort to systems a majority of the player base doesn’t want. Even if you only 10% agree with this system, you have to respect their efforts and communication. I don’t want these awesome devs to become jaded towards and untrusting of their vocal player base. That’s a big part of why the retail team misses the mark so often. Even when critiquing these guys decisions please be positive and respectful where credit is due.
---
Hi, /u/rock2171
---
How can i combine pve with pvp though? Heal in both? I dont really mind tbh, but i do enjoy doing some dmg here and there
---
This is probably the most logical compromise

A cat druid in decent gear is gonna crit every hit and damn near be as good as a warrior if they get lucky on those crits.

Throughout the world you could find books in the "History of Warcraft" series that tell the entire story from Sargeras through the end of WC3: TFT and The Founding of Durotar. The wowwiki has all of those books compiled into one page. Each excerpt is pretty short but its a good baseline for the story.

Shadow priest?
---
through my wow career I've always felt an extra deep connection to my priest despite having other alts i've mained inbetween times
---
now that wow classic is coming out I want to give it a try and I¨m considering going priest, probably to main shadow. I know classic was completelty different so thats why i am asking here if priest is a big no?
---
im also curious how viable the speccs are, if holy is the only viable option to play as I'd probably play something else. will shadow or disc work?

How long is it until the invites get sent?

I apologize, i did not see a new interview. I am at work, is there a YouTube link?
---
Dungeonfinder wasn't bad at first, but I wonder if that might have been because everyone still had the mentality of old. As I remember it, it didn't take too-too long to turn from nice to toxic.
---
Same here!!
---
Raid loot cannot be obtained by ret paladins, enhance shamans, and feral/balance druids. They will only be permitted to solo farm. Not a single 5 man group will ever accept them. Not a single guild will allow these heathenistic specs. If I want Warrior loot, by golly, I want to bid against the other 19 Warriors in the raid. I can’t have these other classes bringing us down. Not a one!
---
Why are you thinking the phases are so far apart? Just curious
---
People are complaining against layering because it touch to core rules of the game. There will be abuse around this, Q are shit for sure, but at least you can play the game with original rules.Phasing abuse is something that hurt the game, that's why people are pointing this out.
---
I'd take a survival hunter before I took a ret paladin anywhere with me. Just saying. They do negative dps and can't swing nightfall as good as a hunter.
---
Didnt play hunter in vanilla outside of being a mid level one but they are a very good well rounded class that can dominate in pvp and they are never a bad raid dps. I’m not the best to ask for specific details about them though!
---
People are anti-social because the systems are built in a way that makes you not need any other players. If the systems were designed differently, people would behave differently.
---
No idea. Streamers have allegedly been flagged for access but the servers are not open. No one else has claimed to have their account flagged yet. I imagine it'll be clear if and when a wave of invites begin as it happens, although the initial testing is supposed to be rather small until the stress test on the 23rd of May.
---
I choose to think you are pointing out "Number online" rather than total sub numbers. To which I say, yeah I can see it being even at least for the first 2 or 3 months. After that not sure which way it will lean.

I thought it was an additional $7 a month to play classic?  Or was I informed wrong?
---
Dude you dont get to pick your layer. You cant just "layer hop" whenever you want. Also, it's a small subset of people (only the ones on your server) who can make up these layers, so you will absolutely still be recognized and remembered for doing shitty things
---
My coworkers husband works at blizzard for the classic project and there is a ‘list’ which I’m on but pretty sure its streamers only at start :/
---
I don't remember having to pay for beta test WoW in 2003 or 2004.
---
Got it, thanks I see my history going back to 04 now.
---
Solution Sharding: Realm Arthas is capped to 3k concurrent players from the start, which is vanilla-like. Since starting zones are overcrowded still, those get sharded  a few times so only 100 or so players are in the same shard. No sharding outside starting zones.
---
At some point, Arthas might need to get merged with Proudmoore, due to tourists leaving, but this is not very traumatic at all.
---
The End.
---
Ahhh I see, I thought today was when the beta invites are sent :( I guess I’ll keep waiting!
---
I don't want layering. That being said. It is an acceptable solution to me. Unlike sharding. I am glad Blizzard cared enough to compromise. Even if I don't get everything I want. I am glad they are showing they do care what I think.
---
Not when every NPC is dead, you can't.
---
I was going to preorder one but apparently they don't deliver in Quebec. Like wtf

Pls

Streamers are free advertising and hype builders. If you aren't making blizzard money you can fuck off in their eyes

git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "Phase 2" &amp;&amp; git push -u origin master
---
No thanks then.  Wasted sub time with no invite.
---
This would just be the release dates to mirror the original release schedule.  There's no indication that they'll follow this, but it's a reasonable starting point.
---
There are mixed reports out but as far as I'm concerned, invites are yet to go out today. That or the small amount of people that were invited ALL don't browse reddit to boast about it. Seems unlikely ;)
---
They likely have to rebuild and test those as well.  But my guess is to give people time to play the content.  Plus, money.
---
20mb Fibre. 100ms

by decent gear u mean pre raid bis or probably better ? i dont mind healing in pvp. i m cool with both dps and heal and i d like to do both if i m playing a shaman ( its a hybrid class after all ).
---
I was only 16 at launch and had to wait for a little more savings!!  Still long to relive those years, mostly cause bills, but a little cause WoW LOL
---
Did you read the last part?
---
Just watch the interviews from the press/media event.
---
You keep asking what will happen in phase 2 and people keep giving you the answers Login queues and free transfers.
---
They made very specific statements about phase 2 and layering during the interviews.
---
Can confirm that I do not have access to the beta.
---
I’m also looking for someone to share an account with, a non european. I’ll pay your sub and give u some pocket cash every month in return if I can play a few hours a week. I have a busy job making decent money and can’t spend my time farming gear or doing raids, I just want to play a bit pvp and not be terribly outgeared
---
Someone lied to you.

Identifies as gender non-binary
---
I played a prot pally in vanilla. It was super off meta and weird, and that’s one of the reasons I loved it. Everyone was very confused when I offered to tank. I highly recommend going engineering as a prot pally, as the bombs work kind of like an aoe taunt. So you drop consecration and then drop a bomb that stuns everything, that way they take a few ticks of consecration holy damage which has its threat boosted with the buff. Plus the fact that engineers give you so many other tools for combat makes it really great to fill in the gaps in paladins - ‘wait for auto attacks’ - style.
---
Classic was years before you started playing it.  I wonder how many people are planning on playing classic that didn't actually play vanilla.  So many QOL thing that are missing even from the BC times.
---
Haha I can't remember any game that have generated this magnitude of hype before
---
Couch programmer logic
---
They aren't going to wait 7 months to release phase 3 buddy
---
Free advertising cash cows aka streamers
---
You paid for one month in the hope of getting an invite for the beta?
---
Welll holy fuck.
---
That makes me happy.
---
Thanks, friend
---
Billy is WEAK
---
I’m trying to find someone I’d played with in BC, yet it feels impossible and vanillafriends website isn’t the answer (not to mention I already listed myself there). They were older too, three times my age back then. Likely 62 now; I was young. 
---
We’d drifted apart and I was a moody teenager then so I don’t think they’re one of the names from my friend list (just recovered my old account). I know their real first name/gender, class, race, server, time period we’d played, even their favorite song. Just not the character name. I don’t think we’d had a falling out enough for them to have been one of the names on my ignore list (however possible)... and it’s complicated considering they could’ve name changed or transferred servers later down the line. 
---
It’s probably fruitless. I figure if anyone’s still reading this thread maybe they’d have a tip.
---
I guess we will see how well this comment ages.
---
You really don't know how to read mate lol, 
---
&gt; Lol they already said they aren’t going to be in the game 
---
And what evidence your word, come off it mate...
---
You jumped on a comment you did not entierly comprehend and tried to be an ass, too bad you did not read it fully. I proceded to talk about what the word meant because you clearly are haveing an extremly difficult time with it still lol..
---
It's all right mate, it was pretty up on reddit, but got pushed down/downvoted? https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bor1kn/ion_explain_layering_and_duration_best/
---
3 more months, and we’re home.
---
It's awful for pvp healing unfortunately. Your mana just drains in seconds. I would say till content is on farm in your guild, not preraid.

Saving for later :) thanks!

private servers didnt have xrealm BGs
---
vanilla didn't either until the end, when there was hardly any competition so it was manageable 
---
xrealm BGs the day honor is released = account share to R14
---
cheers mate
---
I’ve been in various Blizzard betas before. My impression, especially after Battle for Azeroth beta, is that they don’t care about finding bugs in these betas. What they care about, is gathering data on crashes along with the type of hardware you are using, making sure nothing is critically broken in the leveling and questing process (meaning it is impossible to advance), and finally ensuring that there are no absolutely catastrophic issues that would cause server crashes, rollbacks, or such other headaches.
---
The rest of beta is mainly hype and advertising for the upcoming game or expansion. It’s not about class balance, making sure each spec feels fun, or even that the new systems are good. That’s already been decided before beta and it’s too late to reverse course until another patch. They just need to know what has to be fixed now or the company will experience downtime and loss of revenue. Everything else is incidental.
---
I think that definitely could be an issue if the layering was intended to be more long term. Even if the layering lasts the entire duration of phase one, the leveling process will take so long and the majority of the server population won't even have hit max level. Only a small, hardcore chunk of the community will have. In my mind, the AH will be so new and everyone will be leveling it won't cause to much issue. And if there is some crazy imbalance in the economy, once layering disappears it will begin to fix itself. I think it'll work out just fine!
---
they can develop quick. but they generally didnt on live.
---
I think its a multi threaded reason as to why they didnt. that said, I think with all the access to information and our knowledge of the past, people will take more care to select their servers. In the original, people just made characters and landed on servers Blizzard suggested. I believe many more people will pre select their server this time around.
---
I enjoy some level of competition. I dont get a whole lot of enjoyment from ganking lowbies. But when my sides gankers coerce level 60s to show up in Red Ridge to fend them off so little Alliance guys can keep leveling--now I have a hook. Ill show up to fight the Alliances' counter gankers.
---
In an ideal world, both sides understand the paradigm. So in order to keep their faction populated, they have an incentive to defend their leveler. Further, as wpvp is the best way to rank, they want to kill the 60s for themselves.
---
In reality (at least on pservers), no one responds to the gankers, people get discouraged, people quit.
---
I mean it was nearly 8 months of wow on pvp servers without BGs and the vast majority of pvp servers were within 5% ally/horde.
---
Ion said the zones can handle a massive amount of players, but that layering is only done so that players actually have mobs to kill. So theoretically you could have thousands in one zone (there's a video clip where he says how many but I forget), but they'd be standing around with no mobs.
---
But he did make it very clear and final that it would be removed by the time world bosses are out, so Blizz will be manually shutting it off. If need be, they'd just delay the release of world bosses and other stuff until the playerbase is more spread out. 
---
That's the main concern, is players leveling enough so they're more spread out across the world, as well as the inevitable drop off with some leaving. But the server tech can handle the player numbers either way. He said if a bunch of players are in the same spot fighting over a world boss than that's how it goes (and that's more authentic anyway).
---
How is that any different from those things happening on a different server that later gets merged with the one you picked? Layers are effectively their own servers made with a from-the-ground-up intention of being merged with some others.
---
Thank you for this well considered response.
---
It sound silly to me that you will be mad that other people are playing an mmo, Other people are literally the entire point of me playing mmo's. You take the good aspects with the bad of it being multiplayer.
---
Yeah I doubt that. I have an original unopened the burning crusade collectors edition and I don’t think it’s worth much last i checked
---
Also wondering about this one
---
Server stability has been confirmed to be a non-factor.  Layering is being implemented for the specific case where upon classic launch, thousands of people will be logging in at the same time in a handful of zones to check out classic and the game world doesn't support this situation effectively.  Once this population spreads out, the in-game issues will exponentially diminish.
---
It help's quite a bit, thanks! I'm also heavily leaning towards Human simply to ease rep grinds. Your talent build also seems heavily predicated on being viable solo while still being a competent healer. I'm curious how heavily that impacts leveling speed. I'm contemplating grabbing holy to consecrate, the hit % from prot, then investing the rest in ret, not necessarily in that order, though. Then when I reach an appropriate level to start being able to run dungeons that have relevant gear for level 60, respec to my actual healing spec. To me that seems far more efficient, but definitely kills any opportunity to heal while leveling, without a dedicated second set of gear.
---
Why not ? Pushing out content too quick will decrease longevity of the whole concept
---
I'm on the same boat!
---
I'm using the list Rockzilla posted and halfway done with Rise of the Horde. I had to skip Chronicles Vol 1 because my library didn't have it.
---
I'll be using the books and Warcraft III to determine my race and class lol
---
Old School RuneScape, basically only 20 mil away from BiS melee
---
They said if guilds are clearing the content (more than a few), it’s time to move on.
---
If you're too cheap to buy drinks, this game is not for you. That's, like, the least of your worries.
---
No retcons!
---
ELI5 for ~~idiots like me~~ those who barerly played the game post WotLK?
---
Thank you /u/joshcorbo82
---
 So much going on in this pic
---
he said he wanted to be first world level 5, is that a thing ?
---
It's not really the same becuse the other people **will** be playing at the same time as you, You just won't be able to see or interact with them at all.
---
What kind of demand do they put on your pc? Do you notice any in game performance issues?
---
I think that's kind of stupid tbh. I don't think a *whole lot* of people are going to be swapping for WoW to Classic, show the people who left your game that it's something to come back to again.
---
Well, they are small potatoes compared to the big name streamers.
---
But my main point was why do I need to watch them to get to know more about Classic? Blizzard should put out the info themselves.
---
Orc is the min-maxing race. But 99% still go UD male so why not you as well?
---
Holy shit accurate af
---
If we are going by that logic, as soon as anyone found out Thrall was dead, they would assume its due to her, and she would lose nearly all of her support.
---
Everyone shitting on flying but I think this would’ve been a cool way to counteract the lack of interactivity associated with it.
---
To be fair, their server core (Mangos) was developed by the contribution from various communities of people all around the world over a decade+ (including some small contributions from myself). Nostalrius didn't write the whole thing themselves in a bubble. There happens to be a lot of people out there that know how to write software that aren't employed by Blizzard. Nostalrius team took a Mangos emulator core and started modifying it to bring in progressive content and fix bugs/optimize things along the way. Some of whom did in fact have software development experience professionally.
---
The fact remains, that the emulators are a far cry from what actually takes places with Blizzard servers. It's not that the servers themselves can't handle that many people on a technological level (as long as they aren't all in combat with each other at the same time/place that is XD). It's that Blizzards servers are far more complicated under the hood than a best-guess approximation.
---
On top of that, I wouldn't really say that Blizzards hardware is the cream of the crop. Anyone who owns the OG server blades will know that. They ran those things for multiple years before upgrading the infrastructure, putting them well out-of-date by the time they were upgraded. Whereas Nostalrius had some pretty beefy, modern hardware by comparison. Hardware that probably outranked the hardware Blizzard allocates to individual server instances even today. Blizzard makes heavy use of cloud providers now a days. Shared instances among single physical nodes, etc. I could probably host a sizeable server on my home desktop with 2014 hardware that would out strip the population capacity of the largest Vanilla-WotLK realms on retail, provided I could get the necessary bandwidth.
---
Omg my gas bill also came this morning! #gasbros
---
My guess would be that Phase 1 and 2 are going to be a bit quicker. Combined they'll be about the same length as other phases. I think Rag took about 4 months to down in the original game and it will probably be close to 1 month if not a few weeks in Classic.
---
I would guess, roughly:
---
Phase 1: August 2019, 2 months
---
Phase 2: November 2019, 1 month
---
Phase 3: December 2019, 4 months
---
Phase 4: April 2020, 2 months
---
Phase 5: June 2020, 6 months
---
Phase 6: December 2020, indefinite
---
CoD fans will scarf down any bowl of shit activision serves them no matter how festering it is they will gobble that shit up raisin bran sun 2 scoops style.
---
Man thank you for posting this. Reading these names is bringing back alot of memories now.
---
How come it says level 62 Beast Mastery Hunter instead of just level 62 Hunter?
---
So in phase 1 let's say a 4 raid group invades the crossroads.
---
How aggressive is that layering?  Is it going to allow a 4 raid group to come down from Org to fight for XR or layer them away?
---
Sharding/layering was a perfect way to ruin the community feel of the game.  Shame that they're going with it.
---
That's you, i wont mind his buffs and utility, depending on comp or activity.
---
It's going to be hard to say since we don't know how resistances and mana will compare to private servers, but if you go mage you will not be fire for the first raid tier since molten core.
---
Only streamers will get the AQ mount
---
I am very impressed that this was done using AI, this is really pretty good. The details get washed out _a little_, but it does really make it a nice crispy resolution. Very cool.
---
Ion said in an interview he didnt want players to feel rushed so even if its not 7 months they arent gonna just pump it out
---
Wtf r you on about I never said that I just said the mounts are pointless if some races won't be able to get them because their is no rep to grind or enough quests. Either change so an Undead can get exalted with the trolls or just skip it completely. Also if you will whine like this go back to retail and collect your mounts.
---
Classic WoW sure makes my member rise
---
It was confirmed there would be no sharding in any of the high level zones before this layering announce too
---
I've got a bridge to sell you
---
You're in a thread about them going back on their word lol
---
They won't know if it's stable until they have a few hundred people in azshara waiting for azu to spawn. lol
---
And again I'd bet a large amount of money it won't be at 6k plus on the server
---
I planned to play an enhancer casually. After reaching 60 I will probably mostly play bg‘s.
---
Since everytime enhancer gets mentioned here people start saying you shouldnt play it im a little worried.
---
Should I just do it anyway? The reason is, that my first char on release was a shaman and i never got him to 60. Playing heal is not really an option for me
---
I don’t believe I stated that was said at all, if you’d like to re-read what I posted
---
It's selfish but I don't care if people who dont care about classic have a fun time at launch or not honestly. They don't care about the longevity of the classic experience and want the server split into several which means no community can even start to develop untill at least phase 1 is over.
---
Where is this beta?
---
I've had the same account since Feb 2005, been subbed most of the time since. PLEAAAASE blizzard.
---
Well he already answered and that wasn't the reason
---
They could even release it but don't expect to have better ping, we have brazilian servers but they are all still hosted in chicago, so same 179ms i have playing in stormrage all my life.
---
My boss isn’t an issue. My wife is the bigger hurdle. If I’m home for a week long staycation, she’ll want me watching the kids and doing house work. 
---
Maybe this should be in a legal advice sub. Because I might need a good divorce lawyer.
---
Hahaha what the hell. Seems that you did not entirely comprehend your own comment. 
---
Didn’t try to be an ass, was informing the uninformed on what was said in an interview. It sure does seem that you aren’t as smart as you think you are ☹️
---
I am hoping for the same...
---
&gt; with as few servers as possible
---
Ok, this might be an obvious “yes”, but I really hope there are at least 2 PvP servers in my region (not just NA, but specifically physically located in western US), because I plan on rolling Alliance on one and Horde on the other. 
---
For the Alliance all the way, but I do want to experience the Horde side of the tale too. For once be on the team WITH the advantages 😄
---
At least its finally getting a lot smaller.  Yay for it not being freezing anymore.
---
X-Server BGs gave rise to a lot of realm pride and reinvigorated PvP players. My team hadn’t lost a WSG or Basin in nearly 2 years, teams often AFK’d out or flat out wouldn’t queue, and we were pure PvP w/ ZG/AQ20 fillers, so it wasn’t like we just out-geared everyone. Cross server created new rivalries. You’d have people on the other faction who outright hated you speaking of playing on your server proudly and defending you on the forums. I wish I could find some of the old threads from back then on the forums but they’ve been pruned. The rivalries were intense.
---
*Exactly*, you know what's up. That's actually a really good way of putting it.
---
Yah mon
---
I would go with rogue. And its IMO The best one, since you can get it up abit level your lockpicking to open all your stuff. Also you got sprint. And thats Nice
---
But sharding is random, layering is more permanent
---
Good luck man. Why is he so important?
---
How did you recover i have 2 very old accounts that are not attached to my B.net
---
Yeah, this is more like it.
---
There are more people ranking on a single private server than there were on an entire battlegroup im quite sure of, and they are swift to ban account sharers and they have people from NA, EU and Asia so they are effectively like a cross realm BG. A private server never truly sleeps, there are no off times.
---
You get together and make a pool for your server, it's better and faster for everyone. No need to account share if people just follow the cap. Whoever doesn't follow the cap gets excluded from premades and can't really rank anymore. I speak from experience having ranked both in vanilla and on private servers. You have to play a lot, but account share is not necessary and is too risky.
---
If you play 2 hours a day with a job and a family then yes you have to account share, but then again R14 isn't really for you then.
---
Calm down satan. 5 mans will see every single class and spec, whether if it's optimal or not. That includes Feral tanks, cats and rets for utility alone. In fact if there is a spec i won't bring in a 5 man it will be a DPS warrior. Despite them being OP once they hit aq40/nax gear, which is so down the line, that it barely matters.
---
Still doesn't answer my question to OP, to define "viable" in a game that people apparently keep talking about as if it was raids alone.
---
And they will eventually get raid gear, exactly like they did back then or today in Pservers.
---
Vanilla WoW was one of the fondest memories of my life haha. I often go back and try to dig up as much as I can from what I remember, trying to find bits and pieces of guilds and character names I can remember on the far reaches of obscure forum posts and old YouTube videos. This forum thread does a pretty good job of it. I'm pretty sure most of these people have moved on from WoW and likely won't return, as 15 years is a really long time. With the release of Classic though, it's time to create new memories, except better documented this time around :)
---
You really have trouble reading mate lol
---
Lol what? Of course most people who love retail won't play classic, they aren't even the intended audience. Same group of people shouting "rose-colored glasses hurr durr."
---
1. I think the vanilla story is better. They also probably like to watch 10+ seasons of a tv show that never ends, not my cup of tea. 
---
2. Umm...way more grinding in retail unless I'm mistaken? Azerite? Artifact power?
---
3. Can't speak on this, maybe maybe not. The skill cap is still high which is all I'm concerned about. 
---
4. Tell that to OSRS. Gameplay &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; graphics 
---
5. Like BFA isn't repetitive lol, all games are repetitive to a degree.
---
6. You're not paying for classic. You are paying for a sub for retail WoW which INCLUDES classic at no additional cost.
---
I wouldn't even say classic is a "hard" game it's just different. Definitely more rewarding though imo. Only time will tell what the players prefer, but I'm putting my money on classic every time.
---
That makes sense, thanks for the info
---
Beta Billy
---
bought some a few months ago!
---
Theres only about 2,000 getting in on wave one. For that reason my guess is no. I would be extremely happy and surprised to get access regardless of the region.
---
You're kind of right, the community doesn't complain as much when there's a pretty straight forward right and wrong way to do something (phases are good, more phases breaking content down closer to actual Vanilla is better).
---
The Launch issue doesn't have a straight forward answer and different people want different things. Some people want a complete shit show of a launch, some people actually want queues, while others just want to be able to actually play the game. There is no ideal solution to this and some group of people are going to be upset.
---
The second issue is tourist dropoff and realm populations. There's also no perfect solution and some group of players will complain no matter what. Some people want massive servers at launch, others want pre-planned server mergers while others just want server transfers.
---
When people want different things they don't think about what's best for the game as a whole, they don't think that their desires might actually not be great for the game and they complain anyways. This I think is primarily why people think there's no winning with the community, people are short sighted and complain without actually thinking about what their complaining about or what the alternatives are.
---
Eh, I don't think Thrall originally accepted, it was more reluctant/continent in Classic. Hamuul was the one that accepting of her.
---
But yeah, Sylvannas trying to assassinate Thrall is a bit contrived, since he was off the freaking planet.
---
Dude thats some skynet shit right there
---
So can you be invited to a different "layer" simply by getting a party invite? 
---
If I'm in layer 1 standing at a Black Lotus spawn with no Black Lotus there, can I get invited to a different layer for a chance for the Black Lotus to be there?
---
That's mostly what I'm worried about. Rare spawns being 4x less rare, making them worth a lot less.
---
I don't think Saurfang would lie though.
---
You really have trouble thinking 🤷‍♀️
---
So we better accommodate them by destroying server community. It was always the weakest point of classic wow anyway right?
---
More or less yes I think.
---
I'm inclined to say that they probably will have OCE servers given that they will have them at launch. Their other online games have local servers so I see no reason why Classic WoW would be the exception.
---
Healing and Rolling offspecc
---
Lied about killing malfurion.
---
what if someone joins the guild in another layer? do you get instantly moved?
---
Nah
---
When I see you up voting for sourcing I also up vote for sourcing. Congratulations your a leader now.
---
Dude....
---
Well, OG was that you had 10 hours to complete the quest after the first turn in on your server to get the title and mount, iirc. So it'll probably be the same.
---
It was not ambiguous to me. Your confusion does not warrant a change in company policy. 
---
The previous event was not a beta. This was a demo that you were **required** to purchase a Blizzcon ticket to play.
---
I didn’t include this because I already knew that, and it is irrelevant. No matter how many times you say you’re gambling, you are not. 
---
Here’s an easy example:  You walk to the store to buy a pack of gum. With your purchase, you are entered into a drawing where you could potentially  test out a new flavor of gum before the rest of the population. Are you gambling? No. You bought the gum, not a raffle ticket.
---
I remember not even being able to see the eagles.
---
If you play together you will be in the same layer, don't worry
---
Unless you're a streamer with a pretty big following, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
Are you actually just posting to pat yourself on the back?
---
Ashenvale. Going there from the much dustier and emptier Barrens felt amazing.
---
I have not personally played priest but from what I hear shadow is doable. You will level as shadow, so that's a first. Spriest are very strong 1v1 and in pvp. Holy are most common priests in raids, but some disc are welcome too due to their ability to buff dps or healers with power infusion. 1 shadowpriest is very nice to have in a raid due to them being able to debuff bosses so that they take more shadow damage (which helps warlocks). Shadow can do good dps but they run out of mana on longer fights.
---
Also all the priest races gain different racials.
---
I say no because some races can't get to exalted before they gets removed.
---
Neither - it was the South Park episode.
---
I specifically remember being in Naxx about to pull Heigan when we took a 30 minute break to watch South Park. While Ony guy and Leeroy may have been more popular or whatever, the South Park episode was the most emulated and memed content stemming from WoW.
---
Maybe the servers piggy back off existing ones, since the infrastructure is already here, it doesn’t seem to un reasonable.  But if it’s as small as 2000 it would probably keep it to just na? Have to see what happens
---
My pleasure!
---
I want to enjoy bfa but I can't even level in that nonsense system anymore, the story is horrible, and the abilities are just spammy.
---
Malfurion was about to kill his Warchief so that's not dishonorable (not to mention he didn't kill him). Afaik, he didn't kill innocents at Darkshore because he wasn't there; his Felwood team showed up just before the bombing of Teldrassil. Saurfang leading assassins to Thrall who could potentially kill him and his family just to dupe Thrall into joining the fight is dishonorable and out of character if you ask me.
---
Ahh.
---
Using jagged arrows at 60 instead of wicked arrows.
---
REPREHENSIBLE
---
Project was scrapped.
---
I've been a player since like March 2005, over 14 years, I've never gotten so much as a "thanks for playing all these years" from blizzard, I love their games but their customer loyalty/appreciation is total shit. There was some thing they did a while back for old accounts but I missed the cut off by like a couple weeks or something. I contacted them but got a "sorry your not eligible, we only appreciate people that played for exactly 10 years not 9.9 years"
---
You totally just inspired me to splurge on a new monitor! Love your setup.
---
Rag will likely be down within a week TBH.  Shortly after the first reset
---
I guess people are getting confused about the term 'cross realm'. It doesn't have to be used as a proper noun or whatever weird way people are using the term. Sharding is a proper noun, cross realm is part of how you would describe sharding, because it happens cross realm. I'm not sure what people are getting hung up on about this or why it even matters
---
I got my sub back a while back. I was a clueless 15 year old who just grinded mobs from level 55-60 then had no idea what to do and quit due to burn out. I also had vague ideas that the big end game dungeon was fire, so decided all the other players had fire resist gear which is why my fire mage couldn't get a kill in PvP.
---
Nope, just in level 45 greens that gave me +stam!
---
My little guy looked so out of place in WoD Org and had lost the mount I worked so hard to get so I logged and never went back :(
---
You dont have to buy the game just pay for a subscription.
---
Who play a lot of a game that is completely different from the classic version? OKAYYYYYYY

I'll tell you, and I swear to you, I'm not lying, that this is how I met the best (ex) girlfriend ever. I was reading the WoW manual and this absolute beauty (not even kidding; she had one of those naughty slag looks to her) tapped me on the shoulder asking what class I played. I replied Rogue, but didn't have a clue how to do things. She convinced me to grab a Warrior and play on her Realm with her. I learned later that we went to the same university, were taking the same course and that our mutual friend was the anime club President. She spanked me to hell and back in PvP and was even a contributor to one of the earlier PvP forums on WoW. I don't think I ever HKed her in BGs.
---
 just like osrs vs rs3
---
Sorry, it just seemed overall you were in favour of layers. My argument is why do we actually need them when some amateurs in their spare time with a fraction of the resources managed a single server able to support a global pop. 
---
Why do we really NEED layers if it can be done without?
---
Hits malfurion in the back, that was a dishonorable blow!.  Then why did he do it? His sense of honor as an orc should be if his warchief can't defend themselves they shouldn't be warchief. It's bad writing to make Sylvanas into garrosh, who also didn't do anything wrong until the sha of pride infected him.
---
Less than you quite apparently  haha
---
Nice. Something something pot.
---
Did he?

"“This was your battle. Your strategy. And your failure. Darnassus was never the prize. It was a wedge that would split the Alliance apart. It was the weapon that would destroy hope. And you, my master strategist, gave that up to spare an enemy you defeated."
---
It’s worth a couple hundred at least
---
Except you intended to purchase the gum with your money. These people are aiming to get a beta invite, not to actually play retail. You're getting it backward.
---
I also like how you utterly failed to point out any quote from that post that confirms what you are saying. Good on you for trying to evade the question.

Appreciate the insight.
---
just hit save?
---
So, you say no because you can't grind rep fast enough to get them, so why should anyone else be able to get them? O.o?
---
Gear score.
---
Cool then they should just make a massive queue time and it can all happen while you cannot even play the game. Like those are your two fucking options.
---
I’m on your side by the way ;)
---
Can you post the empty meme template please :D
---
Last I checked on eBay etc it was like $100. Rather keep it.

Imagine being as triggered as this guy is that a 15 year old game is better in every conceivable way than the trash he plays now. Poor fella
---
Source on 2k?
---
"Oh no, some stuff happened on a server different than the one I picked!"
---
Again, how is it different from being upset that the PvP server beside the one you're on had some shit go down? Also, why assume that all the interesting stuff will happen on the layer you don't end up on?

Thanks for linking it so i can dislike. Dont advertise your stream here.
---
It happened before and everyone was fine with it. Biggest reason is because you could see and play with everyone still. Layers kills the option to see and play with a large portion of your server.
---
2k or 3k gold for the Original mounts would be a good compromise between the dev not wanting ppl to rush through content and hardcore gamers who need another goal of just doing raid MC/Onyxia for 4 month. 
---
Common make some effort Blizzard please.
---
I’m glad you’re not on the design team lol
---
Ofc u can play Enhance, they are really good in PvP. For PvE they have their part but dont expect get get invited to every PuG. If someone is LFM MC need dps and heal, and you whisper "inv dps" you will most likely not get that invite.
---
“Riggs! I’m too old for this shit.”

Character name forced me to reference Lethal Weapon.

Actual movie character name is Murtaugh but whatever bc lethal weapon.

As a forever-poor WoW boi, I feel the need to represent my people.      
---
I never wanted to play the Auction House. I hated dailies. I just wanted to get online and do what I wanted to do. I wanted to farm my own mats. I wanted to make friends who would let me use their transmute cool downs.     
---
I was 70 for a few months before I even got the slow flight mount because I never got epic riding at 60, despite being in a progression guild. The joke was always I would be last to show up because of my 40% mount.      
---
1k may be easy for some... maybe even most. But even now, in year of our lord 2019, I'm poor in WoW. I'm sure there are dozens of us.     
---
Can't wait to be poor again!
---
More people know good strategies for finishing it quickly now so I'd guess you'd see more of them if they offer the same timeframe to turn it in. Still rare, but not as rare.
---
They've said nothing surrounding your questions. No one will have priority on mounts and they haven't said anything about not having certain mounts in the game.
---
Classic is made to retain the experience back then. The AQ mounts will be there too. Yes, even the ones you could only get 1 per realm. If not, the experience isnt true.
---
Every other kind of rushing and grinding is allowed as long as it isn't for an unarmoured mount.
---
Removal of class quests
---
Im personally not the absolute biggest fan of Dun Morogh simply because its all snow (i live pretty far north and deal with that IRL for way too many months out of the year), but man...IF alone makes up for that, and Loch Modan is just an absolutely amazing zone.  Peaceful, beautiful, a nice variety of scenery/landscapes (the lake, grassland, nice big trees that arent too close together iirc, etc).  
---
Its just such a serene place.  Maybe i enjoy it because it reminds me a bit of home, including all the beer :P
---
Looking back to the blizzcon sharding discussion, they never said anything about sharding existing in high level zones - they specified that it may be used for a limited time and wouldn't exist when world bosses are present.  
---
Regardless, the way layering is being used is to ensure realm like populations to alleviate game-world issues that would exist with the majority of the population competing for resources in the initial zones.  It's just as easy to assume that once the population spreads out layers will collapse as it is to assume that they will exist until phase 2.  In the end, both are speculation. 
---
What isn't speculation is that it was confirmed that the servers can handle much higher populations that they were able to in vanilla.
---
I've got an apocalypse to sell you.
---
He even said they want it to be only a few weeks in an ideal situation.
---
But I don't own WoW... So just paying $15 a month and nothing else will allow me to play WoW Classic?
---
PvP gear from different BG's or rank 10/13.
---
lol yay
---
until phase 2
---
I’m a Navy green beret delta force combat control sniper. So what?
---
This was me when i saw the announcement on my phone at work yesterday. Take me back to my teenage years when life same simpler and WoW was my obsession and i enjoyed every second of it.
---
Unless they specifically took it out, since the modern client can do this, I would think classic would too.
---
Yes that’s what he just said
---
I'm going pally too and going to be using the same build linked earlier. Paladins are capable of healing during leveling in almost any spec, with some Int gear to boost mana. So you can be Ret all the way to 60, just switch sets.
---
There's nothing to age, at the time of writing all we have been told is the beta requires a subscription to play. 
---
Going around the subreddit posting comments about how greedy blizzard is for needing a sub to even get an invite is irresponsible
---
Same here, GoT has been a disappointment this season and Star wars has a lot of work to do to get our trust back. 
---
They hyped us up then slapped us down with that release date. I am glad we have a date thou. One step at a time...
---
I’m only refuting your points. It doesn’t matter what the player aims to do. You can build a house with a hammer, or you can hit yourself in the dick. Nobody polices what you do with a product. 
---
You mentioned the past “betas” were free. They were not. Are you just pulling things out of your ass now?
---
&gt; If the servers cant handle the players in the first 4 to 8 weeks then why would it be able to do it after?
---
Because usually the whole population of the server is not crammed into the 3 starter zones. Have you been to **any** launch?
---
&gt; They are expecting a ton of ppl to quit but what if they dont?
---
That's not the reason for layering. Retail servers can serve 10.000 people pretty well.
---
ouch man thats a long time to stick around and not be having "fun"....how does that happen?
---
I like turtles
---
I think you just convinced me to try RPpvp, this sounds fucking brilliant
---
Africa (Layer 2)
---
Honestly this is me yelling at anyone who says classic will have less players in sixth months. No my friend retail will be dead in 6 months. Not because classic is the better game which by the way it is. But because retail is an objectively bad game even in a vacuum. Which is why it's dying to begin with.
---
Yes. Just download the battle.net app, make an account and subscribe to wow.
---
Things like that that are so inconsequential that they would also have to actively remove are most likely going to be in. You can also just ask someone that gets in the beta in like 10 minutes
---
bought calls expiring in january to go over $50
---
They could be fun, usually it was just corpse camping groups of 60s sitting outside Booty Bay.

“I  never even got to play classic wow”
---
&gt;calling the people who campaigned for classic wow for years and literally made it possible, crybabies and manchildren
---
Shocking 
---
I never say this, but this post literally reads like a shill post
---
They dont tho. Hence sharding. Eventually everyone will be in the end game zones too so what then? Just shard em like retail?
---
Right?  I remember doing a 48 hour camp in shifts with my buddies just hoping for a spawn..
---
Is that not the point of this post? To get WoW for people who can't afford it?
---
Disregard, you're both right and wrong. He didn't lie about killing him, he lied about why he didn't kill him.
---
&gt;Where is Malfurion’s head, High Overlord?”
---
&gt;“Attached to his body, as far as I know,” he said.
---
&gt;She was not amused. “And where is that?”
---
&gt;Saurfang met her eyes without flinching. “Stormwind, I’d guess. Tyrande intervened and took him away.”
---
&gt;It wasn’t often Sylvanas was left speechless.
---
&gt;It didn’t last long. “Malfurion lives?” she snarled. “You let him escape?”
---
&gt;His lips did not smile, but his eyes did. He was happy—happy!—about this. “I could not stop Tyrande. Perhaps you could have.”
---
I’m not OP, but as addicting as a game may be, it is still just entertainment and no where near as bad as being a drug user.
---
There are people who save up and sacrifice just to go see a movie. Should “movie” also be “cocaine”? Just because they want a mental escape from their life?
---
That's brilliant
---
Quickest fix is a 10-30 min CD on layer switching.
---
Soda is actually chill and good at the game. Just close chat and you should have a good time
---
I have an account from 2005. But I'm still permanently banned from the forums for saying stuff that was a little more socially acceptable back them. I hope they don't hold that against me.
---
assuming population is at the point where a second layer is needed there will probably be a battle there on your layer as well, and also if you have a friend who's telling you about this they can invite you to a group and you'll get shifted over

And that is how we burned down a tree, instead of killing one elf.
---
No time limit WSG is going to be hell.   
---
No time limit AV is going to be bliss. 
---
change my mind
---
Can’t believe people are this whiney.
---
Remember when everyone was whining that sharding starting zones was going to ruin the game?
---
Now blizzard develops a whole new system to ease that worry and fix other problems and people still complain, what’s next then lol
---
Here here, ain't nobody got time to sit in a q for 30+ minutes
---
I don't disagree.    
---
But I remember being a warrior charging/intercepting from a dive bomb attack in the PVP zones in HFP. Waiting above the flag in ambush...       
---
 Felt so rad.  
---
Then 5 more folks flew in and stomped me and we lost the buff. =D
---
Why? Blizzard has an official one on their site
---
I was not a fan of enhance after they nerfed/fixed WF, personally.  No gap close, no disable, gotta just walk up and punch things...
---
If you want to live in PvP/BG's though any class can work, but my pick would be mage/hunter/warlock.
---
Wait do us Canadians get cucked or what?
---
How would anyone know if Thrall was dead? He seems to be living pretty remote and by the time anyone would find out it could be weeks and they wouldn't have a way of connecting it back to Sylvanas, they could assume but they wouldn't really know.  Thrall is a leader members of the horde can rally around there is no Vol'jin figure this time around.
---
Queues ...
---
Yes, you can also play retail wow without paying anything else uptill the newest content (110-120). If you want to progress past 110 you would need to buy the newest expansion Battle for Azeroth.
---
I didn't because it wasn't on me to do so. 
---
That includes trial accounts, which could be a massive number, and doesn't include multiple accounts. The real number is probably a fair bit lower.
---
I’m not, because that doesn’t change anything.
---
Guilds and all guild members are locked into the layer they are made on.
---
But as I said in another comment, if people are smart about it and don’t actually form a guild to get around that, there’s no difference here then if all these guild members happened to enter this later right when it was made anyway. It’s as if they had joined a empty realm. They don’t magically shift back into the first layer. (And this is assuming blizzard isn’t smart enough to make very low pop layers just go into the first one after some time, but they very well may not)
---
As I said in another comment, there is a possibility of a multiboxer or a very (and I mean very) organized guild doing a few tricks to abuse the system that most people won’t even know about. But even if they do it, it won’t hit the economy like people think. There is going to be a massive lack of resources, even if all of this was as abusable as some fear.
---
The only real complaint here is that once everyone is merged, you’ll be seeing new names that you should have seen already. But I just picture it as “this realm had a low pop and was ready to be moved into yours”
---
*Shrug* at the end of the day, I’ll be playing the economy no matter what happens. But with how the game systems work, and are much bigger playerbase, this just isn’t a issue in my eyes (as someone who wants a “true” vanilla experience)
---
How do you want to appreciate Classic WoW, as a Warcraft lore lover in general, or someone who wants to experience the story as it was laid out in 2004-2006?
---
Yes but all but the current expansion is free so you should be good.
---
Not interested in playing retail. I quit when Cata was released. Doesn’t interest me at all.
---
Ok, thanks for the input! Would you say that seems to be the generally accepted leveling build? Or is it more that they are extremely flexible as a class in general, and that build gives you decent ability to both level and heal well?
---
They almost definitely will (with the opening of AQ patch), but it hasnt been explicitly stated **as far as i know**. One of the other comments mentioned "only streamers will get it" which is kind of a joke, but if you look into the way you actually get it (there are videos out) you'll find out that there is a relatively big grind for items in the middle of the quest chain. Common opinion is that streamers will be able to get those items a lot faster than other people because their community will donate items and farming to them, so it will be much harder to keep up (since there is a 10 hour time limit after the first person completes the quest)
---
"Pointless" and "you guys just want something to cry about" sounds pretty condescending and dismissive to me. 
---
You want them to make the mounts available to every race even when that wasn't the case in vanilla, and I'm the one who should go back to retail? No thanks, I gave up on that during Cata.
---
Stun resist is way better for lock than WotF imo.
---
Also female Orc has one of the best models in vanilla.
---
I would kill for this same wallpaper in a 3:2 ratio
---
Yeah for sure there will definitely be things missed because of being on the wrong layer at that time, but there won't be a "bad" layer because who's on what layer is more then likely dynamic in some way and u won't be stuck on the same layer the entire time. The only reason I think layering is tolerable in phase 1 is because I would rather layers then be 42,342 in queue for a server lol.
---
Because as alliance you'll be bringing 5 holy paladins anyways. They're the best raid healers in vanilla.
---
I really have the belt of the defias set! Sadly it's only worth around 1k on my server. With all items I could get up to 10k. Not enough for a token
---
I'm also on a F&amp;F list. We'll see what happens I guess!
---
I have a feeling you're right, but what can ya do? :P
---
I didn't get one. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
---
Nagrand
---
Testing mmo game with 2k players :D
---
Solution Sharding: Realm Arthas is capped to 3k concurrent players from the start, which is vanilla-like. Since starting zones are overcrowded still, those get sharded a few times so only 100 or so players are in the same shard. No sharding outside starting zones.
---
Don't have to this mind is in perfect working condition it seems.
---
I really hope they will listen to the community and put the original mounts for 2 or 3K gold.
---
I understand why they don't want them to be a reason for people to rush through the level, but thoses unarmored mounts were still a big part of wow vanilla.
---
Least represented will 100% be druids I can almost guarantee that.
---
As there's a lot of threads on Layering, including several on the front page, please use one of the others.

The layering is across the whole world and can fit 3,000 people (a full vanilla server) in it. You’re not going to have people disappearing suddenly, because they don’t switch layers unless they log out or change groups. 
---
Also, layering will be gone by the time there are massive raids of lvl 60s going to capital cities.
---
Seeing your entire screen covered in abilities and utilities really brings a smile to my face.
---
[There you go.](https://i.imgur.com/mp4PYmZ.png)
---
Can't kill the orphans though. They are not flagged for PvP. Was leveling a rouge to kill them specifically till I found that out. Haven't touched him since.
---
I kinda hope they let the people that played in during vanilla in first, as they will have an better idea how it used to play.
---
The same thing that is on the WoW classic page?
---
naw there isnt any up atm same goes for some US retailers but when i do see any CA retailers ill list it up and if you see any just PM me it
---
I'm so torn on what I want to play and hoping some of you can help me think through my decision. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. Basically I played during Vanilla and was a mage but was level 50 something when BC came out and from there I went on to have 70s with my mage and a resto druid where I regularly raided and PVPd. I've played since then all the way to MoP and found I liked the game less and less and am super excited to play the way I remember when starting. I've always also played alliance but recently started on a private server and got to 40 or so on my shaman and it was my first time playing Horde and I loved it. So I know at least that I want to play Horde (with a few exceptions that I'll detail below). At 60 I will do a healthy mix of PVP and Raiding and I'm ok with healing if I choose a healing class (druid, priest, sham). I feel like I love world PVP a bit more (particularly I do love an emphasis on fun, campy things in world pvp like pom pyro mage, mind controlling NELF priest out of shadowmeld to walk people off ledges, sub rogues with thistle tea to stunlock kill people, ele sham burst, etc). Therefore I'm torn between the following (in a slight ranked order but I'm so torn all sound so appealing):
---
* **Tauren Druid:** Leveling feral with an end game HoTW/Resto spec to have fun with attrition world pvp, flag carrying, and can heal raids. Love the lore and playstyle, I understand I won't be a master of any one role. World pvp would be fun with stealth.
---
* **Night Elf Priest:** I do love healing and know priests are among the best. I'll level shadow going holy end game for pvp/raiding. Honestly, one of the biggest things I know I'll have the most fun with are Mind Controlling people out of Shadowmeld in Arathi Basin, BRM Chains, etc. I can do that for hours and have a blast
---
* **Troll Mage:** Major nostalgia which is appealing since it was my first toon. I'd likely level AOE frost as I've never played that way before with raiding as arcane/frost until I got gear than id go POM Pyro for the gimmicky one shots as we reach AQ. Quick leveling is appealing. Farming would make money a nonissue compared to the previous two.
---
* **Undead Rogue:** High dps end game like mage which is fun. I'd level daggers for fun world pvp gimmicky specs. Would be fun with thistle tea and ZG trinket to get secured kills within stunlock with a deep sub spec for ambushes and evisces. World pvp would be super fun with stealth.
---
* **Shaman:** Ele one shots, enough said
---
I know it's a lot and I'm probably sounding crazy thinking this much into what class I'm gonna choose but I've literally been torn for months hahah
---
I played on a balanced pvp server and to be honest as rarely as this kind of thing happened, it was the most interesting part of my play session. It's a big world and there were always other things to do. That's actually much less annoying than scuffles getting into DM or BRM sometimes.
---
that¨s a positive reply! I might stick to priest then
---
not sure what race to pick, haven't even come to terms with faction
---
big part of my decision in choosing faction are the leveling zones. for example I really liked quest zones you went through as undead, think I reached hillsbrad foothills or arathi highlands before I stopped question but I remember those zones fondly (this is from later exapnsions). But I really love max level alliance being in sw or ironforge or outside sw to duel
---
The fact that he has a wife and a child maybe? I'm sure the other shamans would sense his presnce go away, and they could easily find out from the elements.
---
WTB forever60 content, with only gear progression, and no nullifying my hard worked raid gear upon new content drop.
---
That looks like an unhatched Mr. Chilly in your bag. Are you sure you didn’t log in sometime around 2009-2010 and open your mail?
---
Feral can be good tanks but on big physical bosses they aren't as good as warriors.  They're a great 2'nd tank or offtank though.
---
Yeah me too, been watching a lot of YouTube vids etc.
---
I loved leveling back in vanilla and was an altaholic. My main was a hunter and I raided and pvp’d with him right up till the end of wrath. 
---
My other main alt was a resto shammy I loved pvping with.
---
But I got a Druid, priest, warrior, rogue and pally also all to 60...but never played them a day past 60 or when they dinged. They are still in quest greens/blues.
---
BC fanbois when they realize there wasn't shit to do outside of Raids/Arena in BC, and that there was next to no usefulness to most of the outside world of Outland once you leveled through it.
---
thats just wave 1
---
Same here May bro. My expectations are low hahaha..
---
They were very formative for me I feel, y’know; I hadn’t spoken to any really mature people yet at that age. It helped me open up, I feel... this spry sixteen year old here conversing with someone of fifty one years as a friend instead of a superior. They imparted wisdom and the like. The encounter opened my mind to relating to people much past my age, being in highschool and all. 
---
Amidst the connections I’m seeing people make with Classic WoW on the horizon, it’s a long shot but it’d be nice to find or communicate with that person again, even if it’s not lasting. I’ve heard a number of mothers play retail WoW (like she had back then when BC *was* “retail”), so it could be a possibility. I wonder if I’d be remembered, too.
---
well if you can't kill even a single boar because there's too many people :P i bet you would be mad
---
Yes Ian specifically said it
---
Because that was the biggest obvious concern
---
You can do your own research, he specifically said not only they wouldn't. But they understood the need to not have multiple instances with the resources spawning.
---
I remember it vividly
---
Yet here we are
---
Human or dwarf paladin? Having a hard time deciding, I will be a healer 90% of the time. But I have a dream, that once I have scraped together a Ret set I might do some dps or pvp ret once in a blue moon. None of the racials seem very important for healing, but humans have an edge in Ret due to sword spec.
---
I dont think you understand what layering even is. Layers do not change from zone to zone. Once you find yourself in a layer with other players, there is nothing that could change your layer except loging out and even then there is a chance that you will simply login to the same layer you were in before.
---
AV has been my jam since real vanilla. Tho i did slip up and participate in honour farming before they added report AFK. I hope they keep that feature in classic. Playing AV all night then ending up in the same game the next day was so fun.
---
Blizzard need to stay true to their word and mage layering for the starting zones only. I'd say let the other ones like Westfall, Loch Modan, The Barrens, Silverpine Forest and ect also have layers. New people are going to quit. Some people are going to get annoyed by the leveling aspect, maybe their memory of leveling will be different, and they'll quit too. Layering for all the zones is going to be a shitfest, especially at high-level zones.
---
Yes it's been confirmed, no I don't have a link.
---
That's very   nice of you, i'm not being sarcastic. But, if someone can't efford playing, the last thing that he needs in his life is to sink time into this game.
---
Me too, love healing in BGs. Defending in AV is epic.
---
Can we agree that LFR was an objectively worse decision than LFD though?
---
Oh nice way of saying it. Good luck again man, i hope you will be able to achiev this goal
---
That's indeed a fact,  but you will see ret's in raids eventually, you know it, i know it, everyone knows it. As for 5 mans i will personally depending on comp, take that ret, shaman or feral. If i feel our DPS is enough, i'd take that utility over another DPS.
---
Thanks :D
---
Trial accounts are not subscriptions. And the vast  majority of players also do not have multiple accounts. It was also 5 years ago. It would be fair to say it is very close or more than 100 mil
---
As far as I know, nothing has been sent out yet.
---
Oh, I can definitely tell you as a goblin, there will be a few of us in the background buying the materials and stock piling them until a fear wave hits and prices increase (if we believe they will)
---
But that will happen regardless of the layering, I’ve seen post for the past six months asking what to stockpile, for how long, ect going off old classic data (which in my opinion we shouldn’t, as that won’t work this time around)
---
But let’s say it happens in the worst way possible and a CRAP load of resources flood the market.
---
What will happen if it crashes prices? I and every other goblin will be buying all of it up.  Because those “extra spawns” will be gone, and this will give us long term profit.  This might effect the economy for 6-12 hours after that, then it will be seemingly back to normal as if all the stock disappeared that fast (in reality it will be stuffed in guild banks)
---
we're gonna make it bros
---
Or maybe people are there because they like the additional rules of RP servers and RP but also want a world where you can't flag off in contested areas ?
---
The streamers are all going nuts because \*they\* haven't got one yet.
---
I think that wondering whether giving your info to a stranger on the internet might turn out badly should be common sense in this day and age.
---
I think MC will be done w/i one week, but I agree with the dates. 
---
Multiple guilds are planning something similar to:  
---
Day 1- 0-20
---
Day 2- 20-30
---
Day 3- 30-38
---
Day 4-  38-45
---
Day 5 - Level 45-50, LBRS key grind
---
Day 6-  Level 50-55 UBRS Glide grind
---
Day 7- 55-60 Silithus rep farm and MC
---
I believe
---
Yeah because eventually someone is gonna have a friend who is a Raid lead who brings him because they're friends. that is how ret gets invites to shit.
---
Pray tell in vanilla wow why you would choose between a ret paladin and a shaman?
---
Has that been confirmed? I know they said they want it to work like that but I don't remember them saying it will be like that. 
---
You could also get group invited and skip this shard anyway.
---
Or just stay guildless, it's going to be well worth it with the abuse you can put into sharding.
---
oh, so you saying I got a chance ?
---
Human looks a lot better in paladin gear, for what thats worth
---
They’re going to remove/heavily nerf the rank 14 grind, mark my words.
---
They’re not releasing the unarmored epic mounts for the sole reason that they didn’t want people to “rush” to 60 to get them. In 4 months.
---
They’re literally taking content out of vanilla because they don’t want casuals to feel rushed. Think about that
---
Which streamers have gotten it ?
---
Has anyone checked world of Warcraft 2?
---
 Hello everyone,  
---
**\[EU-PvE\]&lt;No Fun Allowed&gt;\[Alliance\]** is recruiting for Classic World of Warcraft and looking for exceptional players from any class or role!
---
**Raiding Schedule: (+2 GMT)**
---
Tues: 9pm-12:30am  
---
Wed: 9pm-12:30am  
---
Thurs: 9pm-12:30am  
---
Staying late or adding a day is always completely optional.
---
**About Us:** No Fun Allowed is a newly formed semi-hardcore raiding guild. It's core consists of other former hardcore/semi-hardcore guild members which have achieved many realm first kills. We raid 3 days per week and aim to clear all bosses in an efficient manner.
---
**Goal:** Our main goal is to achieve top 20 realm in terms of raid progression with fewer hours than most high end guilds. We plan to achieve this by researching tactics before raiding and helping each other with their class as well as giving constructive feedback. Strats will be posted on the forums well before every fight and we require each player to not only understand but contribute and find every other piece of information available to them to be prepared for the fight.
---
**Requirements:**
---
\-You want to progress fast with fewer hours than most high end guilds.  
---
\-You enjoy putting in hours outside of raid learning fights and watching videos.  
---
\-You want to enjoy the people you raid with.  
---
\-You want to play with players who put in high effort.  
---
\-You understand that your dps/hps output matters less than mechanical skill &amp; consistency.  
---
\-You are motivated to actively improve your play.  
---
\-You are 21 or more years old.
---
**Application:**

Someone who gets it. This is a free advertisement, nothing more. Blizz has 3, 1 day beta stress tests scheduled.
---
Blizzard doesn't give a flying fuck about testing, that can be handled in the days and weeks following launch.

Titles don’t exist in vanilla outside pvp ranks.
---
My birthday too!
---
This guy knows how to acronymize.
---
It's just so freaking expensive man. You can get access to 3D printers fairly easily and just make shit to put on your desk.
---
This is so perfect 5 days later I have 2 weeks  vacation  I'm so happy dear god I can't wait to play it again :D
---
best part about the news is I don't have to come back to this meme infested shithole.
---
Was it added before TBC?
---
I may be looking back with rose-tinted glasses, but I think mechanically speaking some of the Vanilla fights had more difficult mechanics than current expansions, the difference is that the fights that had difficult mechanics were usually one-tricks, and specifically with Naxx they were not as forgiving as their WOTLK counterparts. The hardest thing, in my opinion, wasn’t necessarily gearing 40 people, but rather finding 40 competent people. If 5 of them can’t get the mechanics down, you’re going to die. I didn’t do anything beyond heroic raids in the expansions, so I’m not factoring in personal experience for Mythic, but I did up to Sapphiron in Vanilla (though we never made it to KT).
---
You got scammed then. I guess you can take it up with ebay?
---
The majority of people that "campaigned" for it. Are in there 30's now. And also appear to be in the mindset that the people whining are crybabies. Just sort by top. 
---
For the record if you are complaining about the release you are a crybaby. You guys are finally getting what you want and its epic piss pants all the way down. 
---
But yes, I'm definitely a shill because I'm not whining. You guys can always stay on your private servers, which I here are better than anything blizzard could ever offer.
---
This is a good change tbh. People with OCD will rejoice.
---
If classic dies it will be because they didn’t give the people who will actually play it, what they wanted.
---
They’re already making huge non-vanilla changes to appeal to casual players. They can’t help themselves
---
What MMOs or RPGs have you played so we can give you some good advice?
---
Layering will be out before we know it I’m sure.
---
BFA? Big Fucking Alligators?
---
Some have been sold to retailers from what I've been able to determine from some of the responses from Blizzard. So there may be some to buy for retail price when it starts shipping in October. I was lucky enough to see the announcement and bought my preorder about 5 minutes after it went live.
---
Publicity will be pretty shit if the people watching see 10 people in org/IF and nobody else ever in the open world. There just aren’t enough content creators to give keys strictly to them unless they go through the trouble to keep track of all the people that stream with less than 5 viewers
---
Imagine being stupid enough to think raiding in classic is better...
---
# No Changes. They lied. It went from no changes, to sharding... but only in the starter zones for the first few days of launch. To now Sharding across the entire continent for months. That’s if I can believe them? I don’t believe them. 
---
It’s strictly a cash grab, they could care less. Having to buy a subscription to their awful game just to have a chance at the beta, buying a sub weeks earlier for a name, etc. $ Grab. They did everything the most lazy way possible to get the most $ possible. Diablo mobile type company, very bad. Bad. 
---
Any form of sharding in an MMO is just death. The start will still be clustered AF,. They could have just made more realms and it would be the exact same thing, except without the sharding / layering BS. They’re just too lazy &amp; don’t care.
---
There ya go!
---
The biggest concern has and always was the initial tourists and ensuring single instances of world bosses.  Resources were mentioned but they never, to my knowledge,  said sharding would be limited to starting zones which is your claim. It was ion who made these statements at the blizzcon discussion on sharding.
---
That spec is pretty optimal in leveling, even if you never plan to heal. The things that are chosen in the Ret tree is basicly all that you need, nothing more to get there really (except Repentance). So you can chose where to spend the rest of the points. Want to heal? Spend in holy. Want to tank? Spend in protection. [Kargoz did a great guide on paladins](https://youtu.be/C8BPATSVpRg) except ignore the part about proccing vengeance via a sit macro, that wont work.
---
That's true, but I was hoping to include all of the videos relevant to this event in the stream, as time goes by. A lot of smaller channels covering their thoughts on classic server could be included here as well (on my huge channel with 140 subscribers :) )  
---
With chat-box next to the timer, and a lot of videos going live next to it, I thought it would be a fun little activity to have while waiting for classic to be released.  
---
I included no monetizing links anywhere on the channel, it's purely just for fun.
---
Y ko u forgot "/s" some people think you're serious.
---
When content is on farm, you don't even need more than 25-30 people to clear it. I didn't say that the Ret will take some fury warrior gear, but eventually there will be space.
---
Depending on a guild and their goals, that hardcore mindset might entirely not exist. Not every guild is going to go for world first, and raids aren't that hard in Vanilla.
---
There is a difference between optimal and viable.
---
But even when Naxx is out you will still run "old" content like MC and BWL. AQ doesnt even provide a lot in terms of gearing options.
---
I just prefer looking at women. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Got hyped cause I thought I saw it on my launcher, realised it was listed under blizzcon demo
---
I played on kil jaeden horde all throughout tbc and wpvp was always happening. It didn't kill it at all. I got dive bombed by rogues a lot and warriors fell out of the sky.
---
There were also items that dismounted people too. Wpvp died when sharding happened. Not flying.
---
We have future info, you can start some of the farming for the mount early
---
I don't think so but it will be needed.
---
I still refuse to reorder my characters, leaving them in the natural order Blizzard assigned them way back when.
---
Which is to say, no clue.
---
Though I'm sure some bugs get fixed, it's no longer the concern. Prior to MoP though, I'm pretty sure all had an NDA attached, so back then I can't really speak for. I've only been in MoP and Legion betas (maybe BfA?).
---
I think shamans will be in higher demand for healing.
---
Windfury totem and top tier AOE heals via chain heal are great.  You also have more options for gear since you can wear healing leather and cloth too, and no one to compete with for healing shields.
---
So your plan for ret is to be a complete leech who provides nothing but buffs and taking gear that could be disenchanted for guild enchants.
---
What gets me, is some of these streamers (who are streaming classic at the moment) were strongly against a vanilla server before classic was announced. Now they've magically become proponents (I think we all know why). They'll be the first ones to abandon it, as well when the next retail expansion comes along.
---
Come 8-27, I just pray I can avoid the server(s) these guys end up on.
---
WhY?!? THeRe iS aLReAdy oNE ON tHe bLIzZaRD ClAsSiC wEBsItE
---
Ouch:X
---
Hahah you're being pretty generous.
---
Lmfao, Bulgarian here also. I hate the fact that OP has been shamelessly lied to by a fellow Bulgarian into giving him a sub. You can easily save up money or do some minor physical work for like 1-2 days to get the money you need to play the game. Not to mention getting money for your birthday, Christmas, Easter and even your nameday! Yes, in Bulgaria we've got a thing called namedays, which is exactly what you would think it would be. A day where people give you stuff and money just because of your name!   
---
There's legitimately poor people out there who can't afford this, but Bulgarians don't fall into that category - even teens.
---
Their wording is vague and can be interpreted both ways. No official statement on which one is true so far.
---
This is really nice of you OP but unfortunatly you'll get spammed with bunch of made up lies by people that just want free stuff
---
What about cats or should i just commit to tank or heal
---
&gt;He mentions the transferring of layers occurring mainly to make sure you are able to play with your friends ie party invites. He then goes on to mention right after that once you are in that layer with your friend, the system will try to stick to you on that layer and minimizing movement. How can this be true if you are simply logging out to change layers?
---
It will stick you to that layer for the play session yes. He doesn't make it sound like if you log out you will stay in that layer.
---
&gt;He also says that you could be leveling at elwynn forest, see someone there, and then go all the way up north (which would be many levels later) and still see the same person. This is definitely not an indication of the same login, considering how long it takes to level
---
I'm pretty sure he doesn't mean at a latter date simply at a later time that same day. You could fly up to eastern plaguelands back down to westfall and see the same people sitting in westfall unlike live sharding. The context of the video is "in comparison to live sharding".
---
Each play session seems like you will get a chance of rolling into another shard layer.
---
We don't care about layering or sharding, we care about how long it will last.
---
&gt;Until the population stabilizes
---
What if it doesn't stabilize, what if there's 10k people trying to play on a 3k cap realm? There's always going to be 3-4 layers going. It doesn't matter if they say they're going to disable them, if there's that many players, it will remain on.
---
I think you're all suckers and fools, me included because I'll be playing, but if this does not get disabled, it will ruin the original point of  vanilla.
---
It will

I’ve never gotten into an MMO such as WoW (the scale of the game) but i enjoy grindy games and RPGs quite a lot (elder scrolls, fallout, witcher) so I know I would enjoy this, I just wanted to know what I would be in for if I really put a decent amount of time into it.
---
Only reason I'm rolling a hunter now is because I played Warlock back in vanilla and I don't want to play it again.
---
But if you never played it, go for Warlock. They are really, really awesome and lots of fun in PvP.
---
I agree, but I think dwarves look better in dresses for that +healing. Planning to wear as much plate as possible though!
---
so obvious, yet so unique :D
---
To say a post about layering in a thread about layering is irrelevant...I won’t get started.
---
Yes, I get that its in the spirit of vanilla, read my post: “layering will be a cool twist.” I don’t really mind layering. But to the point of those complaining, its a pretty drastic departure from how the original server architecture was organized for Vanilla. That’s a really big part of an MMO.
---
I think we all realize that its not a carbon copy at this point. My point here was that, as someone who played on a low pop server that was merged with two others, it was a big part of the experience for me.
---
Nonoo you're putting words in my mouth. I said I wanted no shards on contested zones. Not hat Ian said that.
---
Ian said he understood the need not to spawn resources and flood the server. And that they would not be instancing the higher level zones with good mats. Yet the whole server is layered so that was a lie
---
He did not draw a line like no contested zones as I did. Which is the obvious place to draw it to preserve Wpvp
---
I can totally appreciate and understand the problems that layering can create and the potential exploitation. But has it been confirmed that communication will exist between layers so folks are asking for an invite to a new layer? Has there been word on if you'll be able to easily identify which layer you or someone else is on enabling the moving between? Genuinely curious if there was any confirmation that is how it would actually function because I have seen similar arguments around.
---
None of the people arguing against layering can decking with your main point here. They literally want nothing to be done and for the queues to be insane and for crashes yada yada. It’s ridiculous and an attempt to return to something that will ultimately be disappointing because IT WILL NEVER BE EXACTLY THE SAME.
---
Classic PvP guide:
---
Step 1 - Find a pocket healer.  
---
Step 2 - Peel for your healer.
---
Win.
---
If you are looking to do it the hard way, best option is to find good pvpers on a private server and duel them.
---
Especially frost mages, feral druids, shadow priests, good rogues (most rogues are crap).
---
That's interesting, how do you still have that on your launcher? I had access to it from last year's Blizzcon but it disapeared from my launcher few months later
---
A lot of slow grinding and time and frustration. But a lot of making friends and communicating. I remember a streamer said that in Vanilla since you spend so much effort getting a group together and getting to a place that you don't often just disband or leave, you take the time to figure it out.
---
Oh gosh he’s got the flute of memes equipped.
---
Yes if they are cutting into their FOOD budget. If you're scarificing going out to the bar to play that's fine but sacrificing eating for a video game? Jesus Christ
---
took me 3 weeks of finally playing official lineage 2 classic after 12 years for nostalgia glasses to be rudely knocked off. The hype can rarely be a good thing especially for older games
---
Did somebody say...
---
Beacuse if they put exact time they would be late and even more people would be angry :)
---
What's the point of playing beta if everything is getting erased?
---
Today.
---
I'm going to be going Orc Warrior as my main, but I don't know what alt I should play to be a money maker, should I focus on professions or mob grinding
---
Its a closed beta. The ones invited knows.
---
Now.
---
Lol it's all rogues, hunters, and warriors.
---
Sadly warriors are going to be even stronger this time around =/
---
You're going to have to stare at your character for weeks of real life time on your computer screen. Unless you are planning to be the leetest pvper of all time, do what looks and feels best to you!
---
Thats not an order blizz assigned them.  Its the order you created them.
---
Because he's a "fulltime systemdeveloper" of course.
---
I have played human female paladin and regretted that I didn't choose dwarf tbh. All personal preference
---
Raids will likely want a bazillion mages, so overpopulation of mages is really just an issue for gearing rather than a raid spot.
---
Deep Ret is the quickest, I've heard--kinda like what you mentioned you're thinking of doing. I've chosen the hybrid spec out of personal preference. My main reason for choosing Paladin is I want to be a support for others; I want to be the buddy class that people are always happy to have in their group. That said, I also want leveling to be a pleasurable experience, and, to me, pleasurable means decent damage while solo. Depending on how I feel and the guild I'm in when I get to 60, I'll respec into one of a few different Holy builds.
---
Imagine how much you could sell invites to these layers for? All fresh black lotus, devilsaurs, rarespawns like prince for tidal charm, etc.
---
Log on, see empty Ironforge - “selling invite to fresh layer 50g”
---
That's my guess; I hope it's in. It's one of those little things that's not really important, but I'm one of those weirdos who would like to sort my characters *just so*, and it would be nice to just arrange them how I want whenever I want.
---
Nah I think that dude was just deep in sunk cost for Star Citizen.
---
No....just no...
---
thank you!
---
You're doing God's work.
---
Managed to get mine at GameStop - before they fixed the price. Now I just have to pray they don't cancel my order because I got it at $59.99
---
Rules of RP servers? #DontMakeStuffUp #RPServerVeteran #RPPVPServerVeteran #XGFthings
---
That problem is solved by rolling on an RP server; you can toggle your PVP flag there. There's literally no reason to roll on a RP PVP server unless you're a griefer who wants to prey on RPer's who rolled the wrong server. 
---
\#DontBeThatGuy
---
My plan is to have people that are dedicated. Im not going to make a 30 Ret paladin raid-comp, but i won't decline 2-3 guys just because they aren't playing fury warriors.
---
Cmon man, it's vanilla....the raids aren't hard, preparing for them is harder. If you push, and that's your plan, then i agree with you on making a run as optimal as possible, but it's still something that's up to the guild rather than the game. We aren't talking mythic's there.
---
"first few weeks" inb4 12 months

Fucking cyclops for the SoW boots... fuck that guy so much forever

Sometimes it feels more like an old friend or revisiting your hometown or elementary school. Not as much unboxing old toys or purchasing things you grew up with
---
Y
---
They have confirmed that there will be no character services in Vanilla _except free transfers to low population reams_ (quoting from memory). So you are exactly right.
---
Mottled red raptor &gt; ivory raptor
---
Thank you!!
---
Show us where you got that number, or don't spread misinformation.
---
Could you just do whatever you want or is there a path they throw you down until you can explore ?
---
Progressing addiction.
---
It's most...complete gaming experience I had in 18 years gaming career.
---
horde lol
---
People keep thinking wow classic is gonna be coming out. Rofl, this is all just a ploy by blizzard
---
I just don't want people encouraging others who want to raid to pick a class that will not be invited to raids.
---
It's also assuming everyone from vanilla wants to beta test, or even play classic. For clarity sake, I started in BC, but I doubt I'll get beta anyway so this argument isn't for me. You might be limiting the testing pool to 10% of the old player base +streamers.
---
I don't know if I should be laughing or crying because I've already read people explicitly subbing for that chance...
---
I just got an update, PTR server for 8.2 was just taken offline (from what I hear). Soon (tm) is my guess
---
I'd imagine they would kill the wife and kid as well.
---
Was Kendrick Lamar playing the druid?
---
Ok sorry
---
why even live if you can't kill orphans
---
They’ve said unarmored mounts (ivory raptor) won’t be in the game.  
---
Not to be rude, but please don’t pass on information that you don’t actually know to be true.
---
Layering does nothing for overcrowded starting zones as their description indicates.  It solves two problems: login queues and avoids server merges.
---
The comments I was referring to were talking about the first wave of invites. And the that they thought the priority would be to tester's over content creators.
---
  In the first wave it will most certainly be creators first. This is already known since those people have already been given keys.
---
  And yes in later waves more regular folks will be let in.
---
I'm really hoping they treat each phase independently as far as when it's deemed appropriate, ignoring any sort of precedent from previous phases.  Think there's a strong argument to be made for each phase as far as delaying its release and/or shortening duration.  I'm specifically concerned about phase 5/6 because that's when a lot of snowballing in Vanilla starts to occur due to giant gaps in gear levels.
---
I would prefer sharding in starter areas over layering the entirety of the continent.
---
[Nice! Here's mine found it on wallpaper engine on steam](https://streamable.com/87paj)
---
Why not both?
---
Now *this* is the important shit. Take my upvote OP.
---
One could argue that they might give priority to give beta invites to people that aren't currently subbed.  That way, they will get sub money from many of those invites.  It would be pretty shiesty, but not impossible.
---
You can do whatever you want I guess
---
&gt;It was confirmed there would be no sharding in any of the high level zones before this layering announce too  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt;You're in a thread about them going back on their word lol  
---
&gt;You can do your own research, he specifically said not only they wouldn't. But they understood the need to not have multiple instances with the resources spawning.
---
If it wasn't your intent to say that they are going back on their word because they said that there would be no sharding in any of the high level zones, then I guess we just have a differing opinion on the way layering is being used, which is obviously fine.
---
Correct.  "Scarab Lord" title wasn't added until 2.0.3.
---
People are already using a combination of BFA and the sandboxed beta client to work on addons so I imagine there will be a full complement of all the standard addons you'd expect come launch.
---
Age? Photo? This sounds creepy as fuck.
---
"*Participants* will also need to have an active subscription"
---
"opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join"
---
I really don't see this as vague, but fine. The least we can do is wait for them to confirm you need a subscription to get an invite before adding inflammatory speculation to the dumpster fire that is this subreddit right now
---
&gt;One could argue that they might give priority to give beta invites to people that aren't currently subbed.  That way, they will get sub money from many of those invites.  It would be pretty shiesty, but not impossible.
---
Do it mate, have a great time nuke people who don't want to raid with you. It's all about laughs in the end
---
I'd rather they freeze the game at Naxx. If the core mechanics and design of Vanilla are as fun as we remember and are hoping, we shouldn't need constant content updates. I'd be happy with only receiving balance and bug fixes after Naxx.
---
Excellent, I'll need to rewatch this with a keen eye. I've previously watched it, but I didn't have the baseline knowledge to accurately parse which information was more relevant towards Classic vs. Private Servers, so I felt misinformed to an extent. I think my mental block at this point in understanding their leveling prio, is that even though they are a melee class, int based talents still support that playstyle, just indirectly. I try to conceptually understand the playstyle so I have the capacity to make my own decisions while leveling, rather than blindly following a guide. I really appreciate you taking the time to clarify these things!
---
I got to see them play Descending, and Invincible live last week. Amazing show! My only complaint was I wanted to hear another 2 hours. But I'd feel bad for Danny if he had to put on a 4 hour show.
---
What bothers me even more is the color scheme.
---
Hopefully with layering, no realm should be dead, but I'm worried about faction imbalance. Don't want to play on a realm with 90% horde and 10% ally if i play ally.
---
Yeah, can you freaking believe the nerves of blizzard allowing me to play classic wow in 4k resolution
---
Literally unplayable
---
&gt; they only confirmed that you need a subscription to play the beta, not to be selected
---
Is there a source for that? Last I read was some MVP claiming that they're pretty sure that you need a sub to even be eligible to enter. Yeah, yeah, I know, MVPs and whatever - I just really would like to have it blue on brown that the sub is for participating in the Beta, not for being eligible for it.
---
&gt;In fact, why is this game still treated as if raids was the only thing to do? Old players that want it, know what to expect, new players will find enough to do even if they don't raid.
---
Because everything in the game is raiding-centric. We play a gearing skinner-box and the most effective way to earn better gear is through raiding.
---
&gt;Because im pretty sure i saw every spec once raids became farm.
---
Anecdotes looooooool. I've seen warriors at 60 rolling on daggers, just because you can get a raid spot doesn't mean it's viable.
---
&gt;Define non viable overall. In fact, the OP stated "class viability". How does this work exactly? There are no non-viable classes, only subpar specs.
---
I'm not gonna have a semantics discussion. What I mean by "viable" is "do you have a reasonable chance of progressing?"
---
&gt;Also there will be one Ret paladin, so even if he picks 4 rogues, he won't pick the fifth.
---
Cope. Even if giving a RetPala the fifth spot is the best choice(which I doubt tbh), the chance that the retpala does what is required of them and knows how to play the class doesn't really favor them.
---
Then.
---
&gt; I just wanted to know what I would be in for if I really put a decent amount of time into it.
---
Gamepaly wise, difficulty wise, reward wise, community wise? I'm sorry if Im being obtuse, just wanna answer you the best way possible.
---
Gameplay I love it, even the grindy aspects of the game, I am also a guy that plays somethign like stardew and has to get 1 of each item, im a bit of a completionist.
---
Difficulty wise the game is somewhere between runscape -&gt; Eu4, if you put a lot of time in like you expect then the harder the game will get for you. The difficulty ramps up and better you get in the game, its a great curve and makes for good longterm gamplay.
---
Reward wise the game gives you better equipment and you do more difficult things and, give bragging rights tot he top players.
---
Community wise plently of people are friendly and helpful, but people also don't want their time wasted at the more difficult stages, and most requier a good level of competency.
---
Prepare to immerse yourself in a world so captivating you may lose contact with family and friends. In pve you will experience challenging content and adapting and learning the skills of your class will be pivotal to your progression. You will start leveling with hardened veterans of the game and new people like yourself. When asking for advice you’ll find that the community is extremely willing to help you out. You will quest and make many friends (since in classic wow teamwork is pivotal). You will find yourself becoming a master of your class, and this will make leveling easier and easier. As you level, you yourself will get a better understanding of the game imparting knowledge on those that group with you. When PvP calls you will find it hard to sit out of the conflict as you see your faction members die before you. In Stranglethorn Vale you will find hardships worth telling stories in real life about. You will find comrades willing to step into danger to defend you. Finally when at the end game you will find a guild of like minded people (many of which you’ve leveled with). You will then think about how much you have progressed after the 15 days it took you to get to max level, and you will be proud of your accomplishments. This is a small amount of what you will experience. Sorry for format mobile.
---
We probably should be crying since they are gonna use that to gauge how willing people are to put cash down for basically nothing. If a large % of the playerbase is willing to accept this shit then microtransactions will be more accepted later on.
---
After playing on a private server the last week or so I really think this is a good idea. For quests that require a boss kill you get 10+ people just standing around in 3-5 groups just waiting for the boss to spawn. Most of the time I just give up and don't bother with these quests. Classic servers will be much more populated so levels 1-30 will just be frustrating as hell the first few weeks. imo this doesn't add anything positive to the game, it sucked back in 2004 and it would suck in 2019.
---
Classic is not about the enjoyment, it is about the struggle.
---
Here’s how to know if you’re not selected for the Beta, but were not going to tell you how to know if you actually are selected for the Beta....cool
---
You do have to keep in mind though these content creators were flown out to blizzard HQ wined and dined given exclusive interviews to grow their channels massively this close to reley etc. 
---
They are now in blizzards pocket and wouldn't dare to really question them. These guys are looking to make a career out of this and if they question it or act naughty in Papa blizz's eyes it's all at risk.
---
I wouldn't expect any invites to go out today for non-media or friends of Blizzard.  Don't get your hopes up for a while, just look forward to the stress test coming up.
---
bros we going home
---
Everything except Westfall. That place is AWFUL.
---
Well different zones have different level ranges. And the quests inside those zones USUALLY fit within that range.
---
They have and continue to have the technology to allow server transfers off a server. They did this during vanilla IIRC. The headache is purely in merging servers together. Making the servers "soft-merged" ahead of time eliminates the problem of needing to do server merges which are way more nightmarish/cumbersome to manage. If the population remains too high, queue times and one-way server transfers can address the issue.
---
That xp bar is fantastic
---
it's just sharding with a fancier name, you retarded moron
---
damn this subreddit is filled with blizzcucks lul
---
So not a number, ok.
---
The whole argument started with me pretty much asking why people be like "vanilla is only raiding".
---
I also don't think that telling people not to play what they want is also dumb. I mean, there are many other aspects of the game, and when OP makes some bullshit claim like this, without touching any subject in particular is far worse than anything else.
---
PvP
---
Solo
---
World PvP
---
Leveling
---
RP
---
Utility, depending on situation and party etc etc.
---
Every spec brings something in the overall picture. That ench might do low DPS in a raid, but the totems are here, and you might ask for this instead of a DPS when in a 5 man dungeon. Also getting oneshoted in PvP by an ench shaman isn't exactly making you feel like "useless spec".
---
They aren't optimal, that's true, but there is far more to this game.
---
what about sharting?
---
Reeeeeee
---
He said it in plain english
---
"i understand why we can't have multiple instances of high level zones so we can control resources" or something similar
---
He basically said that all the Lotus zones and Ungoro could not because it would break the game
---
Now here we are, they did go back on their word. lol
---
And I thought you were referencing other comments I made, in apparently another thread (thought it was this one). Where I did draw a line very clearly in another post. That was my bad
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
Watch him, he specifically references thorium veins. 
---
Do you feel stupid after watching that? You certainly should. 
---
No recall pleb, making my head hurt
---
&gt; Will we be able to use basic addons like **damage meters** (hopefully never 
---
Why you dislike them so much?
---
What is that N = 3k , 9K?
---
Exactly my thought process on choosing Paladin. I'm just trying to accurately assess how much choosing the different specs will change QoL in reference to both healing and solo leveling. That's a pretty nuanced question that only someone with a lot of pally leveling experience could answer, so at the end of the day, I'm just gonna have to commit to one!
---
Classic AV will be awesome unless people refuse to defend and only rush.  Then meh.
---
Evenly matched teams in WSG actually trying to win (play objectives rather than just farm kills) is rare, but is just as good as a great AV match if not better.
---
I doubt it will happen much though due to the honor grind.
---
That’s exactly what I’m looking for, a game I can immerse myself with and find myself thinking about the cool things I did within it throughout the day. Thanks!
---
That's literally all I want. The experience of certain players and guilds becoming in/famous to the server was the highlight of my WoW gameplay. Not only to experience it first hand, but what it created online too. There would never have been a Serenity Now raiding funerals without it.

I assume your life has been graced with the lack of poverty.
---
I haven’t done it myself, but I can see why someone would downgrade a few meals to beans and rice or ramen just so they can zone-out of their not-no-great poverty striken life. 
---
t just keeps people sane when they wake up the next day and have to deal with the same shit all over again.
---
Blind
---
Blizzard is the only company that has people constantly defends them and give them free PR despite their long and proven track record of incompetence
---
The reasoning is that this is more of a traditional beta one would have for a software port that is looking just for bugs and deviations from the original software.
---
Heard specifically "2k wave 1" from MrGM's stream. He consistently provides accurate info about classic before the majority of people even know about it. Thus he probably knows a lot more than you or I do. Sure take it with a grain of salt if you wish but I'd place a high bet that he is right.
---
He's joking lol
---
Man i used to love attacking the alliance bosses.. this time around I can't wait to kill the horde ones :D
---
The cool thing about vanilla is that you can play it any way you want.
---
- You can join a BG Premade and farm honor to get PvP Gear.
---
- You can farm Nodes/Mobs and make money, or you can farm Reputation for hard to get Formulas and make gold by getting tips.
---
- You can farm Dungeons for BIS Gear or just to help out others.
---
- You can play a class that is not very gear dependent, skip most of the gear farming any go for open world PvP.
---
You can really do whatever you want, and all of that comes after the ~240 hours you will spend getting to 60! 
---
On they way you will make friends and enemies, everyone does, it just happens naturally.
---
Every class is pretty different and you can make that journey multiple times.
---
I for one hated questing/leveling when I was younger, but now that I have done the 1-60 grind a few times over the years it started being really fun because you get faster and more efficient, like chasing a highscore.
---
Also it was a long time that you could knock someone off their mount while flying. That was some of the most fun times I had in wow, trying to get people fall damage deaths
---
The OP before me used this expression so I followed what he did.  I think he meant it as "Number" or "Server size".
---
N basically means the amount of people on one server.
---
I heard the notification noise that launcher makes, but nothing different on there :(
---
nah they are changing the names to avoid confusion
---
All of that, which is what I wanted. I wanted to get into this game before but felt I was way to late to the party. Now that it’s going back to the classic version I’m really excited to be able to get into it with everyone.
---
No more servers, all in one realm with maximum layers.
---
I believe that to be population
---
But you also didn't need a beta to play that one, right?
---
Who the fuck cares
---
Looking for a semi-hardcore raiding guild. Prefer raid times start after 10 PM EST (Sunday I have more wiggle room).
---
NA | PVP | Faction doesn't matter | Loot Council preferred
---
I am looking for a guild that prioritizes clearing content as well as a strong social setting. When classic launches, I plan on going Dwarf Priest (A) or Undead Priest (H), and dedicating a lot of time initially to leveling. Expect me to be at 90%+ attendance, and will be prepared.
---
I will also be bringing in some friends, but they will most likely just be casuals. They will be experiencing Vanilla for the first time, and they are just along for the ride.
---
Contact me on here. I think a couple people reached out to me before, but for some reason I wasn't able to reply. So if you did, please reach out again!
---
Few things were more fun for a while though than playing flight form chicken with the ground. Literally hours spent doing that
---
This man has mastered being a paladin
---
Vevee, dear lord lad..
---
Man I didn't even think of this as a mechanism for choosing race or class. Love this idea!
---
It’s not about getting my feels good. It’s about giving back to the community that has given me so much during my childhood years of playing WoW.  It has been a great journey from classic to wotlk. And a rocky asf one from wotlk to BFA. Never the less. 
---
The social experience I had from classic to wotlk is something I will never forget and will always appreciate the luxury to being able to experience it first hand in its very prime. Something I believe we all are hoping to relive in classic.
---
Generally, only warlocks have to "farm" for mats (soul shards).
---
No class really needs mana pots unless you are min/maxing.
---
As a hunter, you should carry one whole quiver/ammo pouch worth of ammo at all times. When doing dungeons, you should grab an extra 1000-2000 ammo or so to make sure you don't run out. You'll need to buy ammo every/every other visit to a town.
---
As you level your pet and feed it, it slowly levels up it's affection towards you. When you reach the max level of companionship, you only have to feed your pet very seldom (or after you die/it dies). You never need more than a single stack of x20 food on most occasions after about level 20.
---
Well, by definition streamers are content creators because they create content - quality aside. I get your point though; a lot of great stuff created by a talented community. 
---
You ever hear about EA paying out millions of dollars to streamers on Apex day #1? That shit was nuts.
---
&gt;Lastly, and this is the most obvious solution, is to open new servers. 
---
They don't want to have to delete servers and merge them if the become depopulated like in the past, is the response ive seen here over and over to this.
---
Whoops, you said classic when you meant retail!
---
Me
---
Thanks, but I am only interested into playing WoW Classic, nothing else.
---
Now take a screenshot of this screenshot.
---
They aren't holding the beta to gauge interest in the game though.
---
You can increase the logged in player cap...
---
That's awesome. Having the PC and the time to play=being a kid again.
---
Too many people like you trust completely unverified sources of information,  and then spread it as gospel.
---
you enough to comment
---
I remember those (I think!). I feel like I found one in the Scarlet Library once.
---
The only thing I would add to this is a question. I am not technical in server archetecture etc but what is the likelihood that they eventually merge players onto a layer based on their level? Like a mix between your sharding and layering pie charts?
---
Good way to visually show it.
---
Plus theres a difference between im cutting a meal out a day to play and maybe I'll cut meat out of meals 2 days a week.
---
Probably because people linking them all the time randomly gets annoying. Not that I'm against them by any means. I just remember people linking them for like trash pulls in 5 mans and stuff lol.
---
Sorry but this guy looks so damn awful. How can u enjoy looking worse than ron jeremy in 2019...
---
I’m seeing some threads how phase 1 will be months long... so that means layering could possibly last months?
---
Id definitely take que times over any form of sharding. Maybe thats what blizz should do, give us a fkn option. Be like these servers are layered and these are not, play on whichever you like.
---
Pretty much nothing, don't notice it at all
---
That old map of Lordaeron with the road to Silvermoon and Zul'Aman.
---
Wow man who hurt you?
---
Yeah there's quite a few in the SM and Strath
---
&gt; 3000 people divided by 3 newbie zones is exactly as unplayable as 10,000 people divided by three newbie zones.
---
it's actually exactly 30% as unplayable
---
&gt;Layer hopping would also be problematic, but it will be hard as hell to abuse I think. Doesn't mean abuse won't happen, but that it'll be tryhards and rare cases. I think the people fearing abuse by layer-hopping are blowing out of proportion the # of cases where it actually happens.
---
I disagree with this. I have no interest in raiding classic tbh nor high end PvP or farming rare material but if you give me the option I'm going to abuse this to its full extent. Everyone I know has said they are going to abuse this. Large premade guilds have already split themselves into several smaller guilds so they can abuse this easier. 
---
That is assuming I play in the end. The sharding thing has killed me towards classic.
---
So from 9k people they later become 3k people what?
---
Fair. I see the megathread now. And yes, I too want what’s best for the game. I lean towards the no-changes camp, however, and see the layering system as a pretty monumental change. I kind of want to muse to you a bit to share a thought I have on this topic. 
---
I am dubious as to whether or not layering is the ultimate solution to a problem. And what is the problem precisely? Is it the initial player glut emblematic of the first few days of a new server’s release? I feel like such a thing is not severe enough a problem to require implementation of something as dramatic as layering. 
---
My biggest layering concern is that it seems incompatible with the concept of server identity. 
---
Even in the ideal state of being sticky, a server community that is layered is intentially fractured. Then the definition of a server becomes less a banner that a community can rally around, wnd more a conglomerate of loosely associated layers.
---
It makes more sense to me to just have firm servers, merge the ones with flagging populations and offer transfers off of the servers with bulging populations. People have different QOL expectations, where a queue can be a nightmare for one person and an opportunity to get a snack before a binge playing session for another.
---
Wait, there's a time limit on retail WSG?!
---
I’m with you there, and m just giving you a head up it’s included in the $15/month
---
Thats the biggest downside but true for most classes except maybe druid
---
The humor is pretty cringey.  Normally I don't like that either but I kept watching and it does get a little better in that regard and now I'm invested in the characters, especially Jim and Pam.

Im ok with this tbh. Beta these days just means a demo available to all, this is what a closed beta actually should be. Although i wonder if more people will get in for stress tests.
---
Thanks for this, chart looks good to me; I hope having a clear visualization will help more folks understand.
---
Through the eye of a needle
---
Wait a few days I guess? 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Speeeeeeeeeect
---
I think the worst part was that WotLK heroics were piss easy. Cata came out, and their heroics were almost as tough as BC's. So you had people who had a year in 3.3, ilvl 340 gear, AFKing through the easiest 5 man content in WoWs existence. Then Cata comes, and even guild groups have trouble with the content, let alone 5 strangers who are used to killing bosses in 8 seconds. Thats what really kickstarted the toxicity, IMO.
---
Imagine calling someone retarded when you have no idea what you’re talking about lol
---
When server lists come out... so will the streamer list
---
Yeah this worries me, the objectives will probably be ignored.
---
I keep restarting mine. Wondering if it would even auto-show or requite a restart to pop up..
---
Post a picture of your sorry mug.

But considering there are more materials to go around, prices will go even lower than usually and the amount of materials stuffed in guildbanks will be exponentially high, decreasing the need of buying these reagents in the future. Doesn't that affect the economy longer term?
---
20k invited for beta?
---
And logging in?
---
That's a good question...
---
I know more than the average person with regards to lore (in general), but I don't know a lot specific to Classic. I think I would probably prefer the former, Warcraft lore lover in general.
---
&gt;raisin bran sun 2 scoops style
---
Fucking lol
---
I can't even find m+ groups because I haven't played BFA since month 1 and my ilvl is only 360. 
---
I cleared +7 with 350 months ago, but now that the catchup gear has given everyone 400 ilvl, apparently 360 is too low to be accepted.  It's so stupid.
---
Definitely not the alliance night elf pick. All your other choices sound good, sorry I couldn’t do much but I eliminated one for you :)
---
Cool, thank you.
---
Create your Orc Hunter and run to Orgrimmar, get the flight path. Then run to Crossroads, get that flight path. Then run to the Tauren start area and do the quests in Mulgore. All the quests available to Tauren are available to you.
---
I'm not 100% positive if you can do your pet quest at 10 in Mulgore, I believe you can, but you have that flight path back to Orgrimmar if you need it.
---
It's not just "people who don't care". There's going to be a lot of people that are genuinely interested in this game, but are not going to stick around if they can't play for two weeks after launch.
---
Also if I understood layering correctly, will not prevent the community from developing....A layer is basically a server on it's own.
---
Make sure to keep us posted about every reaction Ron Jeremy has to everything. Thank you for your hard work.
---
You can do whatever you want, depending on your class.  Some classes (hunter, druid, mage) are very strong while leveling and can attack mobs of their level or higher pretty easily.  Some other classes (warrior, rogue) are better off avoiding any monsters that are higher level and focusing on ones that are 1-3 levels lower.  
---
There are typically at least 2 or 3 options as far as 'where to go' for any level range, and often the game has quests bouncing between the zones so you go to one for awhile, then go to another, then maybe another trip back to the first to finish up a few quests.  Each zone typically has a level range of roughly 5-7 levels where it is viable.
---
Also 3 pics from after vanilla, but details.
---
I would have vastly preferred an improved version of a group finder over dungeon finder. But you're right, LFR was much worse. Not only are raids meant to be ran by groups with an actual leader, but they literally just dumbed the content down to compensate for peoples inability to do Normal mode.
---
Yes it does. Only 3000 people are allowed on a layer. So 3000 people in kalimdor is spread between teldrassil, mulgore, and durotar for starts. It isnt massively capping the starting zones but it is a limit.
---
Private server lol
---
&gt;addons like damage meters (hopefully never)
---
Damage meters were available in vanilla patch 1.12 though.
---
That seems very nice. I assume you are playing in native resolution?Is that the 1.12 client? Do you use a FOV hack to get more on screen, or is that just stretched? I can't tell from the screenshot without a normal monitor comparison.
---
Either way having a ton of action bar space seems nice. But I'd really like to get more FOV to see more.
---
Channels are as dog shit as loading screens in every zone. Iterate on the concept? Don't play MMOs with channels.
---
Account since 2007, never got into one beta
---
Im talking about Aggra, not Saurfang
---
Provided you with sources so idk about cornered. And no, I only resort to personal attacks in regards to toxic individuals spreading nothing but negativity like yourself. Have a good day! You need it.
---
Yeah that part is dumb, you pretty much have to play for like 2 weeks to get the gear to do fun m+...unless you get carried a bit. 
---
I actually came back with an 8 key in my chest or w/e. So I just made my m+ groups.
---
and I have friends who still play, so its easy enough to get people who aren't phobic of my ilvl.
---
Which class would be best for for making gold while leveling? I assume its mage, but I read hunters are great at taking out mobs too, and also benefit from aspect of the cheetah.
---
Also, side question. As a mage can I create a portal to a city, log off the mage and onto my alt and use that portal?
---
Yay I'm in the majority! That means I'm right! :P
---
I am set on warlock... But I can't decide between Alliance or Horde.
---
I'd assume this is false. My guess is they'll want a larger base to test out layering.
---
do you need an active subscription to get the beta inv
---
The people are annoying, not the meter.
---
Mages can make free drinks
---
It's a good time. There's a little something for everyone in this game. Challenging PVE content that makes you work together to down bosses, potentially challenging PVP scenarios (depending on your server) where you and your faction band together to kill the opposing faction, tradeskills that you can level up to make useful items and earn gold.... tons of stuff to do.  Research the classes, pick whatever looks fun to you, and jump in.
---
I'm excited to jump into those monstrous turtle games where turning in materials actually matters!
---
MEET BANK
---
the first of each type server on the list.  that's the one that literally everyone will be playing on.
---
Agree. Just trying to give a reason why he wouldn't want to have the meter available.
---
Streamers just got word that it is not opening until 6pm eastern
---
Disappointing. I was expecting an actual odds calculator haha
---
2k could be false, though my guess is it is true, but it was directly stated by Ion that this beta will be uncharacteristically small.
---
And what can I do with your name, age and Lil background info when you come from a developing country that can’t afford $15/month? 
---
Not much I suppose. And it’s Battle.net ID. The one you give out when you want to add people as friends. Not your Battle.net login username. 🙂
---
Yeah I love the support playstyle too. And I agree that guides should most serve as food for thought. And the end of the day the decisions are  yours to make. 
---
Really looking forward to trying to find a group of 4 other paladins at level 20 to run SFK for the class quest. That will be an adventure worth remebering!
---
I grew up playing horde but I'm going to roll alliance for something new
---
Good
---
and now it ends
---
Battlegrounds expected in phase 3 which means you've got something like 6 or so months without them.
---
Why are they running to mulgore?????
---
This brings back such memories... straight out of high school, working minimum wage at a pizza place, living alone, and having wow as my only comfort.  I would only eat when at work swiping the occasional piece of pepperoni here and there, and my 1 allotted personal sized pizza per day.  
---
On days I didn't work i was eating nothing but ramen, spoonfuls of peanut butter, or just noodles cooked and buttered to get by.  
---
Sure I could have spent another $15 on some canned food every month... but I was happy to pay that $15 for the thousands of hours i spent playing a game that made life worth living for me. 
---
Cheapest mental health bill ever.
---
No contact info my man. 
---
Just name and age. I don’t even ask for an email.
---
This may be a dumb question, but do you think the higher refresh rate also makes wow look smoother?
---
Would make sense, to match the actual launch schedule.
---
Option 2.
---
Yes but no.
---
this was not a question about drinks ;-;
---
Hahaha I can feel the truth in this
---
Didn't say anything about the logging out though.
---
Where did all these goalpost movers come from? Are people forgetting that they will just have friends on other layers invite them, to escape ganks, get named quest mobs to spawn, get quest item spawns. It will completely change the meta of leveling. There will be constant abuse of this system and the classic leveling experience will become an actual joke with people phasing in and out all over the place. Even unintentionally with people saying "hey invite me so we can do x quest boss together" in general chat constantly phasing.
---
Doesn't matter what you call it, they said we'd get just sharding in leveling zones, that was far more acceptable compared to this utter garbage.
---
Sorry I drug the demo down. I had played WC3 and Frozen Throne before. When I heard of WoW I had it in my mind that it would a living world but more Sims like(was 14 at the time). When I logged in I was pleasantly surprised with what I got.
---
Holy paladin has you beat...
---
What's the alternative? Create more servers instead of layering and then when the population drops there is either dead servers or a need to merge? Mine as well layer. 
---
Also it's a bit dramatic to act like two or three layers is going to destroy the server community. The chat isn't layered, you can invite your friends and there's still tons of people around. If anything I could argue having a healthy population promotes more community because if there's 2000 in Northshire Abbey alone then you're not remembering names.
---
In that case, Chroncicles is your best bet. A lot of the Classic-specific parts of the lore are actually part of the old website. Like, why we're fighting in Alterac Valley/Warsong Gulch and that stuff.
---
That doesn't make it a good thing.
---
Which one? 
---
How accurate have the streamers been when releasing 'news'?
---
If you’re going alliance priest I’d strongly recommend dwarf instead of night elf.
---
Drop me a DM yo. I’ll help with some of that. How does the first 3 months sound?
---
Fun fact he has 52 talent points in this video, giving him MS and Death Wish, due to a bug that lasted a few days before being hotfixed.
---
u/SQUIRTISPEE has a 1080p monitor and u/PinkGlider doesn’t.
---
thanks mate!
---
Reeeee
---
No, unless your alt is in the same group/party as your mage. Potentially that would work if you have a 3rd person invite your mage to a group. Then create the portal, then log out, then log onto your alt, then have that same 3rd person invite your alt to the same party your mage was a part of (but just logged out), then your alt can take the portal. that's a lot of work though.
---
An elegant solution if the right amount of people leave. If they don't? That's going to turn out shitty.
---
Honestly I always get very statistical on evertything i do. But when it comes to WoW, i'm seeing the game as a source of relieve and damage meters kinda gets it away from me as i can't stay away from damage meters and being you know, statistical.
---
Good luck, some rumors that this first wave has 2k players and might start 4 hours from now.
---
Unless you’re 3020th. Then you’re in a 20 person shard. A smart player will sell invites in trade chat for 50g each for unlimited access to rare spawns, mats farming, devilsaur, etc.
---
A casual is gonna say man this game is dead and quit
---
As someone who is on the fence about rolling priest (played mage in vanilla), can I ask why?
---
I am also on a F&amp;F list, but he told me he doesn't even know how that list is handled.  So, we'll definitely see!
---
I'd like to say the same, but I know deep down inside when the character creation screen loads up I'll leave with a damn Holy Priest again.
---
Thanks for my new MTG playmate
---
Pretty accurate as far as this beta is concerned (at least since last week). A few of them even fudged on an NDA just to show the world they got the info first. If someone actually saw a streamer say it I’d bet it’s real.
---
On another note tho, fuck streamers.
---
Agreed. I'd love to see a no flying TBC server that's otherwise blizzlike, it really would be very low effort to put in teleport NPCs or small landbridges, in the few places where flying is necessary.
---
Don't think the interest is really high enough at this point for anything like that though, especially with classic soon
---
My friend who got me into the game told me if I was a Holy Priest I'd always have invites to dungeons where the best stuff is
---
WHET
---
It's as reasonable as wanting to ban spoons to stop obesity. But maybe the person who made that comment isn't a reasonable person.
---
4h? Though they said may 15. ?😫
---
I'm not saying its the best thing in the world dude, I'm just listing the reasons they are using it and the actual benefits of having it.  Not all of it is actually bad.  Yeah there probably will be people who abuse it.  The most important thing to take away from this is that it is temporary and that it will have a long term positive effect on servers.  That shouldn't be deterred away because some people may abuse it for the first couple weeks&gt;months.
---
I always remember that time fondly but I was r14 and in one of those groups with a dude named maly on malfurion. Was dope to always four cap ab or 3 and 0 wsg
---
Throw $15 into the wishing well. EZ
---
yEs
---
Yeah couple streamers went offline because of that and will be back in 3-4 hours.
---
if we tell people no, we can increase our odds :^)
---
Oh it'll do just fine, good Sir.
---
This video introduced me to soil and made me love wow so much more when I was early teens. Beautiful.
---
You can blink out of one net. But they won't all use their nets at the same time.
---
Fuck
---
i think it's uncertain whether you need an active subscription to get invited or to actually play
---
Anyone that resubbed, for a slim change to get beta access is crazy.  I know a lot of people are going nuts about sharding/layering right now, but I'm a lot more annoyed with needing to be subbed for beta access, and needing to sub weeks early for naming access.  
---
Basically, Beta access is $45 for a chance at one of 3 weekend betas, that's terrible, and reserving names is $7.50.  It's ridiculous, and just further speaks to what Blizz has become.
---
The hinterlands. The somewhat remoteness of it just was great to me and the Jintha Alor group quest was always a nice ending to it.
---
I don't understand why this is such a big deal, I rather play the game and have it removed once the realms stabilized vs sitting at the que screen to login unless you guys REALLY want the full experience of sitting at the login screen for a hour again. As long as it is removed at a timely manner I'm ok with it.
---
You need a active sub but the beta access is not guaranteed, so unless you dont care about wasting $15  and taking a chance go for it.
---
right i think after a week people can see which servers are most pipulated. But there will not known what going on about tourist
---
The warts are now mole. Small pointless possibly cancerous moles.
---
Man, I was on a low pop server and our SS/TM battles were epic lol. Atleast 50 on each side. Ebb and flow between the two towns. Was great.
---
This is the right answer, everyone else is just assuming.
---
I was commiting to troll Shaman for the mottled raptor. :(
---
I might actually go orc now since i’m rolling on a pvp server anyways.
---
I'm not going to pick a class solely on one racial that will give me a only a slight benefit for try hard raiding guilds especially when I'll be having most of my time outside of raids having fun pvp
---
and how do you know every server will "stabilize"? will every server naturally converge to 3k pop?  What about the popular servers that still have 15k pop, won't they still be layered?

I'm not blizzard and I can't tell you what they will do... but there are plenty of options if some servers just happen to retain a lot more people than normal after phase one.  Possible server q's and just cap the servers at a vanilla amount, free character transfers for people who may just want to get off the overpopulated server if they don't want to be on it, and if a lot of servers have this issue just simply open up more servers... not everyone is going to progress to an extremely high level in the first few months and a lot might just want to get off that server.
---
I didn't start playing until WotLK, so I'm running on 0 knowledge of the game, essentially. I've heavily researched class specific information, but I've stayed away from researching the game itself. I want to be able to not be a noob as far as class mastery goes, but to still allow the game to feel like a brand new experience. 
---
I can't wait to experience the little things like you just mentioned.
---
You don't have to run your own damage meter (I never do), but if you're gonna raid it will likely be impossible to avoid seeing them at some point.
---
Yup. I hate the writers so much theyre fucking my girl up so bad
---
Hey guys. So I started playing the game in Wotlk, and been a Warrior fury since then. 
---
Now, I've been reading a lot about warrior in vanilla and looks like even if I play as fury dps, some people will expect me to offtank even being a fury dps. (I really hate tanking/healing in MMOs)
---
So, what do I do? Should I just play warrior fury dps or try another pure melee dps class?
---
If you have a better idea to proof current life situation across the Internet. Please do share. I’m open to ideas. 🙂
---
Let's be real the world is in a shit place right now if you are not one of the hyper rich elites, this is the only thing I actually been excited for in almost 10 years and now I might not even be able to play it.
---
Any veterans from Wowmovies.com here?
---
a lot of the naysayers are saying it will be exploited for rare mobs or whatever, I'm like the amount of effort to even do that, and only for a few weeks when people aren't even 60 yet, would be so low reward lol.
---
But some people won't listen to reason and are like LA LA LA ITS STILL SHARDING LA LA LA
---
It's good to know.
---
How tf does that little warrior stop that hammer with that shield
---
Hopefully they give em out to small streamers too!
---
Vanilla WoW has a story?
---
Better than when I used to live in Central America at least, that’s actually not half bad.
---
lol what?
---
Buddy.. how do you think you can see a friend from a different layer when you invite them unless they jump to your layer..
---
What on earth is ^ ^ 8 Toga?

---
I feel by having it not present at all will leave the servers dead in the water should they ever decide to release them.
---
Not everyone is gonna wanna reroll and then it likely won't run phase 1 through rather starting at the current phase of the current servers etc.
---
Sorry, I ranted a bit and didn't mean to come at you specifically. I guess I was just getting at that back in vanilla people raided cities and did world pvp when there wasn't any reward at all because it was fun. People just dealt with it if there were lots of players in an area because it's an MMO and you're supposed to interact with people. Now everyone just wants convenience at the expense of everything I else.
---
To answer your question, in retail you get achievements but I think that's it. Maybe honor kill points. In vanilla I don't think you really get anything, just satisfaction of sticking it to the opposite faction.
---
How do you feel about casting Smite 100 times a day
---
I'm out of the loop, as I've never played WoW. What's the hype for?
---
Yeah you bring up a good point. They are very likely in their pocket now.
---
I guess to address all your other replies, as I included with the other guys, it’s really going to come down to how sticky they make these layers (ie not switching between sessions). We should definitely be pushing for blizzard to do this
---
It's lower as compared to Private Servers, not Vanilla wow
---
Its good, but its not Pat PVP.
---
There are Orcs there these days? Weird. I haven't made a new Human since before the Cataclysm. 
---
I do miss that distant, ominous feeling.
---
Some of the raids require a lot of tanks, so DPS warriors would be expected to off tank for those fights that require it. Also good luck getting a 5 man group as a DPS warrior unless you are friends with a tank. No one is going to want for a tank when someone who could be playing a tank refuses.
---
&gt;there 30’s
---
Ok
---
&gt;getting what you want 
---
People are complaining because this ISN’T what they wanted, do you understand that? People wanted vanilla as it was, not a new vanilla with sharding, cross realm bgs from day 1, mounts removed because they “may encourage people to rush to 60”. 
---
Fuck outta here, rat
---
&gt; Well excuse me for not agreeing, especially about the raiding-centric part.
---
I mean, you're just wrong. You might say that it shouldn't be that way and to some degree I agree but it absolutely is raiding-centric.
---
&gt;And who said you need to be viable to get a raid spot? 
---
No one, but it is a struggle unless you're playing a viable spec.
---
&gt;More casual guilds will wonder how to find enough players, rather than getting them 20 fury warriors.
---
This would be the case if there wasn't a abundance fury warriors, rogues and other more viable specs.
---
&gt;In vanilla you don't need an optimal composition to clear a raid, especially once it became a farm fest. I will start repeating myself, i explained my reasoning down the line, with the other guy. If you don't agree...well can't do much about it i guess.
---
I agree with your first sentence, it just reeks of optimism. Do you honestly think a raid leader even in a casual farm fest raid would choose to help someone playing a unviable spec over finishing the raid a few seconds faster + less drama. I don't know where you find these virtuous human beings but I sure as hell haven't met them.
---
Excuse me for being out of the loop.... but Pat?
---
Streamers are definitely paid, just not by Blizzard.
---
That’s not necessarily true.
---
It could just be instanced and not necessarily on any specific layer.
---
We don’t know the full details so going to conclusions like “jumping between layers” is silly.
---
heart says rogue
---
brain says priest
---
wut do?
---
I mean obviously, sorry but this response in no way answers anything i asked in anyway shape or form or counters or agreed anything i stated :). Thank for answering though :)
---
You can expect a good, frustrating, hateful, wonderful, odd, excruciating, community driven, wondrous game.
---
If on a PvP server dont trust anyone from opposite faction, dosnt mean you should attack...but do not trust. Unless you are in a heavy pvp zone like STV or Highlands then either attack or run. Because they are just waiting for someone to come and help
---
&gt;  friends on other layers invite them
---
Didn't they said friends and guild mates will all be on the same layer?
---
I'm 100% on board with layering, assuming they plan on addressing being able to switch layers at will, and if that's possible, taking action against people utilizing layering to exploit multiples of the same mob or node. 
---
If people are able to change layers at will via grouping with specific players, it could cause problems in regards to farming rares or farming herbs/ore. If I'm able to switch layers at will, I could essentially possibly get two rich thorium veins every time I find one if I'm able to switch layers at will.
---
Ball Buster!
---
It just makes my teacher heart feel like someone paid attention. &lt;3
---
You should remember this sub and private servers will represent the more hardcore players. Casuals will likely influence the demographics heavily
---
Why would they select people who aren't even able to play the fucking game?

I think people think it's as easy as adding more ram or something. They don't remember how painful it was to play vanilla when there was large scale pvp going on, which is what it'll be like on launch.

horde if u have any ambition in pvp

Gonna be funny seeing all the Paladins trying to tank in Classic. Oof

---
It shouldn't make any difference at end game. You only regenerated mana while casting through talents and certain abilities which most were quite negligible anyway. Shadow priests IIRC don't have any regen while casting talents so they are going to go OOM just as quickly. Spirit only started its regen after not casting for 5 seconds so dps won't have any benefit from that.
---
It will only affect leveling down time. Guess you just need to stack more spirit if you don't want to drink as much.
---
You dont have chance on beta if you are not currently subbed sadly :/
---
first wave has gone out already. if you didn't get invite now your next best hope is for the stress tests

---
As a frost mage? Not too bad.
---
What source do you have that states it will function like that?
---
I genuinely hope your motives are purely altruistic. I'm horribly cynical so I don't actually believe that's the case, but I'm not about to try to make that someone else's problem. 
---
Regardless of the motives, this is still a post about offering people a free game subscription in exchange for their personal information. The kind of personal information that, albeit seeming innocuous, isn't the kind of stuff people share publicly online. Rule of thumb, if you aren't willing to share it publicly online, you probably shouldn't share it privately online either. 
---
Someone could also make the argument that you're targeting children for their personal information. Someone who actually gives a damn about kids. Someone who isn't me.
---
He cant attack you unless you attack them - otherwise you are not flagged for PvP. So no.
---
Regen rates were always slow as balls. Food/water is a straight up requirement for leveling no matter what class you have. End game fights were always filled with people slamming down mana potions on cooldown just because it would buy you another 30 second worth of fighting time.
---
Agreed. It's been proven over and over that more servers tends to be worse. It's hard to redistribute players as the game (naturally) settles without server merging. And whenever games start closing servers you naturally get people acting like it's a death knell for that game. Layering for a few weeks is a solid compromise, there is no answer that doesn't have compromise though.
---
Obsessed beyond repair. My life has been consumed by classic. So much so I started watching a dungeon and dragons show on youtube that takes place during classic wow.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCriigZ3FMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCriigZ3FMs)  I can't get enough of this world
---
You can't really. If you're doing a guild run they're normally only linked after a boss. If you're doing a random 5 man you just ignore the guy that keeps linking them.
---
Lmao I have a 34inch curves ASUS ROG monitor and it’s similar to this. Definitely don’t need all that land for WOW but man is rocket league beautiful.
---
I'm gonna roll troll shaman and heal raids and pvp.
---
Good idea? 
---
I will be in high demand right?
---
I played a private server and DPSd some 5 man's and almost died of boredom
---
oof
---
Layering does not eliminate the problem of overpopulation as the layer pop limit is roughly the same as server pop limits in vanilla. Same for leveling experience, little to no difference.
---
You can, quite easily, and merge them as needed 
---
Layering was one option to a problem, and was a poor one at that. Surely Blizzard, multi million dollar company, could’ve come up with a solution that doesn’t involve immersion breaking.
---
I don’t buy that layering was the best solution here. Just because Blizzard is proposing it doesn’t mean we have to accept it as the best option. 
---
Clearly what’s important to Blizzard doesn’t match what’s important to players, otherwise they would’ve gone with one of a multitude other options for dealing with this issue
---
Very true. Lmao 
---
"dude I'm getting ganked invite me"
---
"ok"
---
*he fades in next to you*
---
"...fuck"
---
Had a pretty big bearing on actual gameplay levling as a mage on a PvP server.
---
I generally found proffs do be weak moneymakers
---
besides passive cooldown like arcanite or mooncloth cuz it takes minimal effort but also brings minimal gold
---
and unless you have special rare recipes it's quite mediocre for money
---
might be better to just grind the right mobs especially the ones with vendorable loot and skins like the EPL bats
---
Oh okay, now I get you. I think that the current solution of going for servers that are big is way better than creating one hundred 3k capped servers and then merging 70 of them, because they died to dead numbers. This is way more immersion breaking than any implementation of layering IMO.
---
What the heck are you on about.
---
RP-PvP servers are interesting precisely for one reason. If you choose to help someone of the other faction in combat. You have to choose what to do carefully, no AoE's etc.
---
RP servers have a ruleset which requires naming conventions etc which are not suitable for flat PvP or PvE servers.
---
The issue with always being flagged is that you have a massive disadvantage against other players that choose to exploit that mechanic to first strike you. For example you can't drop an AoE to knock a rogue etc out of stealth that wants to backstab or sap you etc.
---
You appear to lack experience with RP-PvP and don't act like some of the trolls we have to deal with currently. RP-PvP serves the best way to introduce new players into the roleplay community.
---
In other Classic related news: Carrots are healthy.
---
I think the idea is that the servers can handle a good amount of overpopulation. Just not in the first few starting zones. After that its all fair game.
---
hard to say. free publicity is always nice, but that'll come naturally. anyone who gets beta will likely stream it and people will flock to watch them.
---
people likely to get beta will be those with a long history of being subbed. people who play the game religiously and can spot something out of whack immediately. some texture that isn't quite right, or something accidently still in place from the legion client.
---
I felt that shielding requires too much mana sometimes, I would just renew most of the time.
---
It sucks. All those smart people and they couldn’t just figure out a way to get players the experience they want.
---
Instead, they screw the player experience for corporate means.
---
It’s so far from the blizzard we all grew up with
---
Cousin works for blizz.  I haven't received a F&amp;F "key" in years.  They just add your BNET email to a list, and you get an email when you get added.
---
humans are really bland looking
---
dwarf is strong in pvp btw
---
&gt; the items in Naxx are already ridiculously powerful and nearly break the game.
---
Nearly? They do break the game. T2 was probably the peak of balance in vanilla IMO. 2.5 started to be sketchy but it gets a pass because it brought in gear for off-specs which I consider a good thing for the health of the game.
---
Blizzard has a bad habit of this actually in my opinion. The second tier of each expansion is usually the most balanced because it corrects the mistakes of the first tier. Then the third tier they have to keep going up to keep people excited/invested in raiding and they usually blow up their game. PvP goes to shit, class balance gets fucked up, the gap between the tier 3 items and anything else in the game grows to an insane degree. 
---
It's why I think it's good that Blizzard has raised the level cap every expansion. They get to reset the mess they get themselves into and start fresh, with people hopeful that the next expansion doesn't make the same mistake, even though it inevitably does.
---
been playing their games for 20 years, no invite :)
---
You really think there won't be 100 different ways to manipulate it? There's no way to insure your discord buddies aren't each going to have a layer to themselves, ready for invite at any time.
---
Blizzard just don't care.
---
&gt; Few things were more fun for a while though than playing flight form chicken with the ground. Literally hours spent doing that
---
Ganking people who AFK'd on their drakes by spamming moonfire until they dismounted and barely getting out of combat before hitting the ground so you could get into flight form.
---
They need to support the game somehow. Blizzard compared to Activision as a whole or even worse, EA has never nickel and dime anyone. They’re always committed to gameplay. They have to make money dude, offering $8 for a better chance at names you want is not going to hurt gameplay and isn’t opening the door to any kind of additional fees, they’ve been pretty open about that.
---
Goodbye possibly good, thoughtful and lovely friendship.
---
Gotta get their biggest free sponsors the content
---
where u got those wallpapers from ? would love to get em too
---
There were streamers yesterday talking about trying to get beta keys to give out to their fans, so...
---
Hahaha imagine standing in line in an mmo waiting to be serviced. Kill me lol
---
Yeah I understand. I’m a semi-casual player so I figured by the time I get that far the BG’s would have opened up by then which is where it shines the most.
---
It’s as easy as logging out / back in.
---
People will switch as many times as they need to get to the layer they want.
---
Terrible solution to the problem. Blizz decided to sacrifice the player experience in order to save a little bit of money on server costs. It’s sad how far they’ve fallen
---
Yes i do think that is the only thing they haven't adressed yet how they will handle?
---
I don't have any reason to doubt your intentions are genuine but imo its not right to solicit this kind of information over the internet specifically because it can be used to scam/exploit etc.  Best you could probably do without said info would be an opt in draw or lottery or something.  In a perfect world you'd just get a copy of the person's tax return )
---
:O
---
we all want one server that can hold a billion players and will dynamically spawn enough mobs to handle them, but even this ideal will break the second some streamer gets the idea to play on it and all 20,000 of his followers travel to the same zone :P
---
we need to figure out where we're going to allow compromises
---
oof.
---
Then the second class I'm interested in maybe is rogue. Thoughts on rogues for pve?
---
What should you do? *Sunder Armor* x5 Then carry on.
---
Naxx came out in 1.11
---
Do you have a source on 3 weeks? Blizz said it could be longer than 4 months, or less depending on how they feel
---
Thats apples and oranges. If i picked a PvP server and shit is going down on a different shard i cant be apart of but they are still calling it my server that hurts way more then just having 2 seperate servers from the get go.
---
I just want them to give us an option. If we want sharding play on x server (since you wont need more then 1 due to sharding) and have like 3 or 4 other servers open that wont have it. Let people pick. Of course they wont do this because they dont wanna admit they were wrong...again...
---
cmon papa blizz gib key plz
---
Gotcha. So itd pretty much heal or tank or bust until aq. Rough.
---
&gt;	This is horrible.
---
It’s definitely summer break, you kids are ridiculous.
---
Wouldn’t you want people actively playing the game to be the one testing? And not Joe Shmoe who hasn’t played in 5 years randomly seeing if he can get into the beta for shits and giggles?
---
Something that will last for a couple of weeks, creating server stability..
---
&gt;slices through communities like butter now and redacts the original glory of the game.
---
Lol.
---
Get over yourself. This is amazing *new* server tech they having implemented for classic. Once the layers are meshed, you'll have nothing to complain about. So save yourself the hate.
---
I think you're missing the point. The amount of info given to the OP would be minimal anyway, nothing identifying. It's that after the first month when the subscription is about to expire, OP can now say "well I'll pay for another month, but what are you going to do for me?" Of course no one wants to think the world works that way, but thats a *possible* reality of the situation that shouldn't be overlooked. Especially since someone who can't afford a wow sub is in all actuality  a vulnerable part of the population to begin with.
---
Because people dont want to play BFA, duh.
---
Rip epic mage manuever
---
when weird al was still funny
---
Falls apart if servers don't reduce in size by like 70%. Overall maybe maybe that will be true, but it won't be true server by server and some servers will remain very high population. So what is their answer then? Implement queues at that point?
---
Do they even exist in classic ?
---
No, id want people who used to play testing. Not people who still pay for a piece of crap... Those people who still play have no tastes in video games.
---
You mean you hav to pay to play?!
---
I know it's so freaking annoying. Nobody should have to pay 15$ to pick their character name and server.
---
Let alone pay 15$ to get selected for a beta.
---
It's not that...
---
It's not that fucking at all.
---
People remember a living breathing world of azeroth. Cross realm Sharding put a dagger in that back of that idea and twisted it.
---
People just want to play in a world that feels like a living world. Layering seems like a great solution, in my opinion. But people still know and experience the shittiness of Sharding so of course they're wary.
---
Also Blizzard entertainment does not have any real technical or monetary limitation here. They made 3k player servers in 2004. Like they could cram 20k people on a server now if they wanted to throw away the money for that. Hell I think I could rent a server capable of that from AWS right now if I had the scratch. But that wouldn't give you a living breathing world. That'd give you an absolute CLUSTERFUCK.
---
The world of azeroth only works for so many people, get too high and everything becomes impossible to complete. Get too low and you never see another soul.  Layering makes it so you hopefully encounter neither of those problems.
---
Oh man. I played Alliance Pally day 1 because I never really played an MMO and I wanted to heal myself in case I was trash. After I hit 60 I immediately re-rolled a horde lock. I remember there was this guy "SmokinTroll" (or some variation of that) who I had this standing slot in his PvP group (either on Windrunner or Rexxar cant remember) and we would just PvP all day long. Good times. 
---
Long winded way of saying Horde for PvP. Undead gets my vote.
---
Flying most definitely contributed to the death of wPvP.  You are delusional to think otherwise.  Just because people randomly dive bombed eachother in the air doesn't mean that isn't a shitty thing in the first place not to be touting about.  
---
Land based PvP = fun and everyone always crosses paths with eachother
---
Air mounts = not fun and the amount of path-crossing is significantly less
---
Flying also really has zero point in the game.  It could just be replaced with flight paths.
---
I would be in favor of a stat nerf to naxx gear for the sake of not breaking the game, but I know the mere suggestion would drown me in a sea of downvotes as I get accused of being in favor of #changes.
---
DPS classes t3 like warlocks and hunters start to have so much raw stats and damage that they can quickly apply thousands of raw damage in an instant.
---
This is why I'm usually quite eager to point out potential new horizontal content should be around the same gear power of AQ/BWL. Leave naxx as it was and introduce new stuff to fill out gearing options without the massive powercreep blizzard loves to put in.
---
The queues could exist from the start instead of tricking people for 2 months.
---
2 days away for me...damm...outta luck.
---
Yeah bad business practices is sooo funny. SJW's and greed is so hilarious and not world ruining and economy destroying at all.
---
Donate to charity that feeds starving people lmao. No one needs to play WoW this badly.
---
What happened here, tell us a story grandpa
---
A subscription to WoW is NOT the same as a subscription to BFA.
---
I wish the mods would do a better job of culling these morons and their posts.
---
Which was fun.  I remember many a time where I'd call my guild/friends/randoms in the zone for help, and it often spawned wars in STV.
---
Why because I don't want to pay 15$ to get into a beta? Dafaq? You dumb?
---
I'm not a kid either, so yeah, you dumb.
---
This is one of those things I hope we give more pushback against.
---
And if you dont get the unarmored mount, you can still get a badass Dreadsteed
---
It's a win-win either way
---
OP is FOAMING at the mouth, how dare they lmao
---
So the same meme that’s been reposted for weeks, but with 8 minutes of time spent in Windows movie maker? Feels a bit like low hanging fruit.
---
Lol the beta is for bug testing, not to see if it's fun, so your taste in games doesn't matter.
---
Sounds like you are the one who shouldn't be beta testing if you want to play for fun instead of to test it.
---
15 BUCKS
---
LITTLE MAN
---
PUT THAT SHIT
---
IN MY HAND
---
Could you even be more entitled? I think you've reached critical mass.
---
December 25th, 2004 (Free month) - I got WoW for Xmas!
---
&gt;Those people who still play have no tastes in video games.
---
The Hinterlands and un'goro cool quests sometimes action with pvp
---
This is what happens when you ask for mom’s debit card instead of just taking it out of her purse.
---
I was totally joking. I mean I do have the kids who are going to really cut into my time, but I'll find a way to play a bit while watching them myself, the extra challenge is fun.
---
Major props to you if you are completely serious though!
---
Actually, it is the same as a subscription to BFA.
---
15$ a month. It's actually exactly the same.
---
Are you daft? Are you mental? Are you a pile?
---
I couldn't give a rip about the armored vs unarmored mounts, I just want the original mount color. That ivory raptor lookes bitchin'. Not to mention it would fit the priest class fantasy perfectly.
---
Awww yea! What’re you rolling?
---
Why?  It sounds to me like OP is disgusting the post from wondering why they didn't get beta....
---
I’d just save it for the actual launch
---
You have to pay to test, and pay for 2 weeks of nothing to get your name/server secured.
---
How about you stop whining like a little child?
---
I think this is a good visualisation but there is one thing which may not be correct.
---
I, like you, thought initially a second layer would be introduced as the first one is filled. However this causes a problem where you have some players on a full layer and some players on an almost empty one.
---
I think a more realistic solution for the launch period is a default of two layers and the login queue being split as characters appear in the world. (Odds on one, evens on another for example)
---
If over the launch period the population persistently stays below layer cap the layers can (will?) be merged permanently.
---
Punch the keys!
---
This is what I said
---
hol up
---
I agree blizz is a bit wacko on the political spectrum sometimes on the 'SJW' stuff, but how the fuck does this have anything to do with it, are you thick or?
---
Sounds more entertaining than most of the streamers out there today. Do you have a patreon?
---
oh my bad, i didn't know it was posted a lot, i'll delete it then.
---
It’s Prince Thunderaan the Windseeker from Silithus, you face him during the Thunderfury quest chain.
---
The joy of working from home, means I’ll likely not sleep for a week
---
im going to log in and level before you
---
Also i like bfa for all its faults its alright
---
Lol, games ruined can't play first.
---
You are so fucking wrong lmao
---
I'm with you friend, I plan on subbing 4 hours in advance to release. They are milking us for the hype that's been built - DONT FALL FOR IT PEOPLE - it's a beta for a game we have played. I can totally understand reserving your name asap, this we get them early subs to be sure
---
Lol you're a buffoon for saying that. I literally have years of college degrees for design and I know a whole lot about what goes into making games. And I know a whole lot about wow classic and early days of wow is when I played. I would be playing to ensure the game is as similar as possible to the original.
---
So far theres too many changes. Particularly being able to select your realm and name 2 weeks early, that's a major change that needs to go.
---
True.
---
The game sucks now, BFA is crap, it's not an edgy opinion. It's a true opinion.
---
The codes were valid until 10.2017 though
---
If you just hearthed, you're still flagged for a few.
---
That's when they get ya.
---
It is you fucking moron. Do you not know how to read a calendar?
---
Cool to see this halpen! Im bulgarian too so thanks for helping a brotha in need
---
Old classic MMO. Not the modern kinda MMO like BDO, BnS, even Tera.
---
Pretty slow. Questing is the primary and intended way of leveling, but quests aren't optimized at all. If you take all quests in a village you'll get markers all over the map, instead of doing quests in chunks like in Tera or FFXIV. You need to figure out the order and the pathing yourself.
---
Big PvP aspect. Lots of world pvp along the way. Leveling takes forever, so you'll be exposed to world pvps a shitton. Plus of the first ~6 months of Classic - you will likely never encounter high level gankers, so in most (if not all) cases you'll be able to properly fight back in world pvp. Later there's also battlegrounds.
---
Pretty easy PvE content by today's measurements. The content itself is easier than any PVE activity in any modern MMO you can find. The hard part is the management (getting into 40ppl raids) and the preparation - lots of farming for consumables and whatnot.
---
Also pretty complicated and thus flexible gearing. It's completely different from modern MMO. Your gearing doesn't look like this: get boots with X haste and Y crit, next upgrade is the same piece with X\*1.2 haste and Y\*1.2 crit. Lots of gear has unique properties, procs, even abilities. From it you need to compile your build. Also big contest for each good piece of gear - you can be trying to hunt down some rare mob who drops your desired piece of gear for months, as an example.
---
Leveling takes forever and leveling is easier in a group. Every monster 1v1 bears threat to your life. You need to regen your hp/mp after every mob; every other mob later on, every 3 mobs later on, but it never turns into the hack'n'slash in that regard. So when you're in a group of 2 you suddenly start being able to kill more monsters quickly. This promotes the social aspect a lot. Also many quests like "kill one big dude" which are easier and more convenient to kill in a group since everyone can finish the quest this way, not just one person who tags it first.
---
I.... wha....? Sigh.
---
The classic everyone thats ahead of you is a no-lifer
---
Were we fine with it? I wasn't that fond of it when it happened to my server. It also hasn't done much good. We were one dead server, now we are 1-dead server with "-\[Server Name\]" behind our character names. It's just a bunch of people in general/trade going "Ah don't you guys miss the old \[Not my server\] days?" At least with this the community is there from the start. They will be around. I may not see them \*every time\* I log in early on, but they won't just pop in with their own community and personality several years from now, disrupting the established community on my own server. 
---
Merges/connections are not adaptive enough to keep up with shifting populations. By the time they happen, it is probably too late to fix anything.
---
It's not a drought. It's just BFA is terrible and the only decent thing is M+ and raids. Everything else is garbage. =/
---
I'm completely fine with this if you are assigned a layer and remain there regardless of logging in &amp; out. If you are placed in a different layer each log-in, that would make you a foreigner on your own server- no good! 
---
Any potential exploitation of this mechanic will hopefully done by a very select group of mix-maxers, leaving everyone from casuals to optimisers to play a standard game. 
---
PS. Will Auction Houses be server-wide or layer-wide? That might be the single most massive gameplay right there.
---
Nah nah naganaga nah-nah.
---
Sounds like you should be playing retail
---
I am playing on mine without any restrictions, Launcher shows me active sub for 1 month.
---
Maybe it is different in my country (germany)?
---
Information wasn’t quite so widespread back then. I remember a rumor that magni would drop Crown Jewels and a ton of gold - being the king of dwarves and all.
---
Its almost as if they would rather let people that support them play instead of a random thats only interested in one game
---
Your salt sustains me.
---
You have to be subbed to be eligible.
---
The beta is for bug testing **and** looking for inconsistencies. This comes from Ion himself.
---
Layering is objectively better than dead servers, from the inevitable tourists fleeing. Layering fixes problems sharding does, without (some of) the negative impacts. 
---
In a perfect world, we wouldnt need layering. Unfortunately reality isnt perfect.
---
I'll still be playing retail, at the very least to get tokens for game time.
---
Correct me if im wrong but doesn't the key ring stay hidden until you get a key then the icon for it appears?
---
Now time will pass extremely slow for you.
---
That's the thing.These casual guilds will look for dedicated players rather than Optimal specs. Ofc that doesn't mean that you can achieve some equilibrium. Having like 10 rets isn't something that will happen, but having 3, because it's hard to sustain an optimal pool of people, wont hurt your raiding. It's vanilla, the hardest boss has like 2 mechanics...
---
People that play sub-optimal specs will know this eventually, and they won't look for hardcore guilds. That's how i see Classic turning out to be.
---
I think we also lean too much toward Pservers here. Gearing these fury warriors and rogues will be pain since they pretty much share the same BIS items up to aq40/naxx. I highly doubt a casual guild will want the drama that will ensure. Better take few sub-specs and have an easier time gearing the rest, you will clear that raid anyway.
---
Speaking of Pservers, well these people know the drill so we shouldn't be worried for them anyway.New players will have to understand that if they want to push, they will have to heal first and then ask for off-spec items. If they want to play their DPS spec, hardcore raiding guilds aren't for them. 
---
I agree with you on general principle, but i refuse to put every guild under the same roof.
---
Pat was great. Vurtne was the best.
---
Pat was good, but it's easy to make highlight videos as a warrior with the gear and support he had.
---
Vurtne's skill level was so far ahead of his time it was just comical to watch people try to keep up with what he was doing.
---
So she convinced you to roll a Warrior on the opposite faction?
---
I share your concern about layering and I agree about the general sentiment of this subreddit changing over time.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
gamers don’t deserve rights
---
This is the case
---
You have to get a key before it shows up, iirc.
---
this is correct
---
why are you bitching? you feel left out and privileged so now you're going to vent?
---
Am I entitled to play a game they stole from me 15 years ago?
---
Am I entitled to test the game i've been waiting to play? 
---
Am I entitled to not pay for the game early just to get a name and server and waste 2 weeks of pay time?
---
These are all really scammy shammy business practices by Blizzard. 
---
And most of you are either filthy rich or shills.
---
Yeah this is correct, same way every private server has always played too
---
It doesn't change wpvp at all retard
---
I had no idea this was a thing. I thought an empty bag still opened. thank you!
---
You don't need to subscribe to BfA
---
I though I remember that being how it worked. You loot a key for the first time and then the key ring starts light pulsing at you showing you it is there now.
---
Yeah.. one of the biggest issues :(
---
Sarcasm isn't your strong suit. You might be on the spectrum.
---
You don’t seem to understand he’s doing us a favor by telling us the obvious
---
All your points lead back to being circle jerked
---
Sponsors for people viewing that have known about classic for months most likely since the streamers have been talking about it. They'd be better off promoting more info on their website and maybe offering interviews for articles on news sites or something. Its about reaching people not in the Blizzard loop still. But I'm no promoter, so what do I know.
---
"To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing **dedicated players** who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an **active subscription** or active game time on their Battle.net Account."
---
they've already confirmed an active sub is a requirement.
---
if that money doesn't show, you owe me, owe me, owe.
---
I agree with this. I think LFR had good intentions but was ultimately a mistake. I actually think LFD was good for the game.
---
I hope they eventually put a LFD into classic wow, only WITHOUT teleporting anyone anywhere for free. You can search for and create a group using the UI, but you can't gearscore or raider.io or teleport anywhere.
---
I played since the original Beta and all throughout classic, and really the ONLY thing I don't miss about it, (honestly, the only thing), was sitting in IF or ORG for hours, spamming chat to try to find UBRS groups.
---
&gt; I think this is a good visualisation but there is one thing which may not be correct.
---
&gt; I, like you, thought initially a second layer would be introduced as the first one is filled. However this causes a problem where you have some players on a full layer and some players on an almost empty one.
---
&gt; I think a more realistic solution for the launch period is a default of two layers and the login queue being split as characters appear in the world. (Odds on one, evens on another for example)
---
&gt; If over the launch period the population persistently stays below layer cap the layers can (will?) be merged permanently.
---
I'm just going off of what I heard from the guys who went to blizzard over the last couple days.  This is how they described it to work.  Maybe it's wrong but that's just what they said.
---
again, sarcasm. Spectrum?
---
I didn't start until Cata but have researched a bit and look forward to trying out this game that has been praised endlessly. I won't spoil the class quest for you, but if you ever see a Paladin, standing on a crate in Stormwind proclaiming this message you know that it will be me: 
---
"Looking for 4 brave paladins seeking the Legendary Verigan’s Fist (class quest). My companions must be gallant enough to protect the innocent from harm, Relentless to face the snowstorms of Dun Morogh, Stalwart enough to brave many dungeons, Bold enough to venture on a cross-continental journey deep into enemy territory and strike at the very heart of Evil. And they must stay true to the very end (no leavers)."
---
Correct but I did watch Esfands videoo where he grabs the key at the end of SM and it went into the regular bag and no keyring appeared :o
---
Yepp. Alliance och svensk ^^
---
Except the servers can be jumped between. So it's more like cross-realm server groups with a shared economy and planned merging.
---
I'm opposed to cross-realm server groups. I don't my leveling experience to be a mass of 10k players who phase in and out as they or I  swap parties.
---
And companies don't either, blizz/activision should be burned down for their BS&gt;
---
Doesn't seem like a big deal. Just wait till it actually launches.
---
I believe this was confirmed by streamers who played the Beta.
---
&gt; I literally have years of college degrees
---
Could've fooled me with that grammar.
---
Why would anyone willingly support a steaming pile of garbage?
---
Are you sure it isn't the feminists who are forcing you to play BfA?
---
To get people to resub.
---
I feel you. My childhood was filled with abuse of multiple forms. As an adult I'm basically a large shell of a man. Alexathymia(sp?) Look it up. 
---
Anyway, classic was my ONLY escape until I was 16 and able to be free, at which point I played until I enlisted in the us navy, around the end of BC. Once I got home from the navy 4 years later WoD just came out and it kinda ruined it for me. 
---
I'm excited to pick up where I left off.
---
Good for you weirdo intentionally trying to trigger someone simply based on their tone.
---
You must have a huge penis. Wait, no you don't.
---
They removed the toggle from retail quite some time ago. Considering it doesn't affect anyone other than yourself, I guess there must be some technical reason for not allowing it.
---
Here's one I've seen.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bok2r5/mark_your_calendars_wow_classic_launch_and/enhe357/
---
I'm okay with this. If it activates while I'm the only one in the vicinity I might get frustrated but that might only happen a couple times. I don't see it often enough on Retail so this should be a positive addition.
---
Your the man now dog!
---
Yes, absolutely. When I first tried 120hz I noticed a difference just moving my cursor on the desktop.
---
I just don’t understand why people get angry or confused when streamers get stuff before randoms with little to no influence. Personally I’d love to get classic beta but my audience contains myself, GF and dog lol. From a business side I would 100% give out keys to the top streamers/people in the media to get it talked about and hyped up.
---
Why would Blizzard take that risk? They want invites to go out to players that will play. I'd sub.
---
Maybe. When did you buy the movie is the question?
---
Beta is for loyal customers - I understand this, why you can't?
---
Yes, you may be on the spectrum.
---
Nah, I make games better. How about activision stops trying to scam us. And how about you stop shilling for corporations you awful individual?
---
This is why game developers never actually listen to the masses. Literal children whining about how they're entitled to video games. Go cry somewhere else.
---
Lok’Tar warrior! Your parents are fighting alongside the Alliance! Help us crush their advance by securing the numbers on the credit card and the three digits on the back. Blood and thunder!
---
15 bucks, little man, put that shit, in my ... Bowl
---
No, but she was Alliance and I loved being an Orc too much to change sides. She was a Human Rogue. That, and I never asked which faction she was until I logged on, leveled almost to 20 and found out she was on the other side, so brain fart on my part. By that point, I made too much gold to change sides. A whopping 11g!
---
I may be foolish for re-subbing to get a chance at beta, but I least I don’t buy the demo
---
What did I say that was inaccurate?
---
10k is a lot. Even having 1k on a server, let alone a single continent is a pretty good turnout.
---
The world in WoW is not very big
---
Like I said they should check out other platforms.
---
I'm not saying they only look at Reddit but you can see how bad it is to only look at Reddit, if you look at osrs. The devs at jagex only listen to the autistic cry babies on Reddit and it's very obvious when you don't get customer support unless you posted about it on Reddit with a bunch of upvotes.
---
When the fuck is it man Ive been refreshing reddit and reloading my [battle.net](https://battle.net) client for the last 5 hours now...
---
I’m not gonna call bullshit straight off the bat, but there are a few inconsistencies. 
---
You have a spec already, and there appears to be a pandaria weapon icon in your bag, along with the mr. chilly pet.
---
It has to be
---
&gt; Am I entitled to play a game they stole from me 15 years ago? 
---
They didn't steal anything. Read the fine print in the EULA.
---
&gt; Am I entitled to test the game i've been waiting to play? 
---
No. They don't owe you anything. You got the game time you paid for.
---
&gt; Am I entitled to not pay for the game early just to get a name and server and waste 2 weeks of pay time? 
---
Poor attempt.
---
I love you.
---
You are acknowledging the topic of the thread.
---
You aren't shilling.
---
And you are making valid arguments/warnings.
---
I hope you have fun with the game man, and I hope it isn't ruined by these scammy business practices.
---
I don't like layering but it's a compromise i'm willing to make for high pop servers, with that said however the main reason I'm am worried about layering is the effect it might have on the economy in the long run, more layers means more gold, herbs, ores, skins etc. 
---
This might not seem like that big of a deal to a casual player but the fact that you can manipulate which layer you are in by simply inviting a friend to your group could be exploitable.
---
Is it worth it in the long run? I guess we'll see.
---
It's not a complaint, I'm just stating facts
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Keyring
---
Thx, new wallpaper. :)
---
Of course that would be the most logical thing to do. But I could always code something up that will analyze a number like that and give it to a person if they meet the cut for some financial aid. But that would not make me any different from going to an actual financial aid. 
---
I just want to get to know and understand the difficulties people are facing all across the world. Be it big or small. And maybe, just maybe try to fathom what their life is like.
---
I know right
---
And attitudes like yours are probably part of why it's subscribers only, considering how often you're attacking people in this thread for simply disagreeing with you. 
---
Hold up, pause,and take a breath. Then maybe you'll remember that Blizzard rarely makes any notable changes during a beta and more or less for stability testing (Individually, and on scale). So in just a few days, you'll realize you're not missing anything.
---
Im not talking about WoW but Blizzard in general, Im kinda glad people like you wont get to participate, this isnt even the final game so quit your bitching
---
And the exact people you speak of come here to downvote you lmao
---
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, eh?
---
They hosted [the game's manual](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/LO0VQ46XB1281555957773363.pdf). That is just awesome.
---
That's a smart idea!
---
OH WE OH WE OH
---
I think I wanna know ya, know ya!
---
This is cute, thanks for sharing :)
---
It will be even more without some layering or sharding going on lmao
---
It's text you mudsocket.
---
I asked blizzard support earlier if you need a sub or not - you do.
---
[https://imgur.com/6Ijfqn2](https://imgur.com/6Ijfqn2)
---
And regarding past betas, I got invited to BFA beta even though I had not had an active sub for over a year at the time. So classic beta is different.
---
The only WoW YTMND I remember is: ONYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!! ONY!!!! I wish I could find the song but I forgot the name.
---
No its actually the complete opposite. An opinion is an opinion, not a ”true opinion” as you hide as a fact.
---
Whether you like bfa or classic more is completely subjective.
---
Seems a bit shitty I have to pay 2 weeks in advance to claim the name Legolasx. I'll probably pass up this opportunity.
---
- They stole, and scammed us out of our favorite game.
---
- Yes, I should be as equally viable to test their game as any one who subscribes. (it's not a game, it's a beta)
---
- They owe me a server fresh start with everyone, not a game where people chose and filled servers 2 weeks before release and took my name because they paid 2 weeks in advanced and lost 2 weeks of their 15$ monthly membership.
---
Pathetic attempt.
---
Your ending brought me to tears, my husband got me into WOW a year ago and i dont think i would be able to play if anything happened to him.
---
Yes, starving yourself is the only way to spend $15 less on food every month. Everyone already spends the exact minimum possible on food, so there is no conceivable way someone could lower their food budget without skipping meals.
---
Um, just wondering what do you mean by "new idea"...?
---
Taking into account what you said about mana, I still recommend warlock.
---
That's still May 15 in California, US
---
Wouldn’t it be something if the demo was another criteria for the beta
---
It’s like playing classic wow on heroic mode 😉
---
Yep, I hope they extend instead of reduce phase lengths. There is no rush and the more people that don't feel they are behind progression, probably the more that will stick with it.
---
read the text.
---
That's where we differ. I actually liked that TBC was structured to where you had PvP specifically around level 70 farming areas. Fair fights with same level players. I don't find it entertaining to be level 30 and spend 5 minutes corpse running because a 60 killed me with zero counterplay.
---
I don't get why people can't read.
---
&gt; But I don't own WoW... So just paying $15 a month and nothing else will allow me to play WoW Classic?
---
Getting a subscription **gives** you Vanilla and the first 6 expansions.
---
Warlock if I go Alliance and Shaman if I go Horde, no questions asked.
---
Then some people might want to check with their doctor to see if they're mentally fucking challenged or not.
---
Ew
---
Yup I remember that. Cata had you actually CCing stuff where wrath was just an AoE circle jerk for ever class. Nobody wanted to play a game where you actually had to communicate with each other.
---
Haha this has to be a troll post
---
clearly not you, since it was warcraftmovies.com 😂
---

---
Hardware improved a lot in the past 15 years, the servers are able to handle high pop, only initially it prevents fluid questing
---
Listen buddy i gonna set up a chair in westfall and watch noobs die to gnolls while you complain on here and watch your favorite streamer :-)
---
Mine too lol
---
And that's why so many people get taken advantage of in every walk of life. It's not cynical to take an active interest in not letting other people fuck you.
---
&gt; To say a post about layering in a thread about layering is irrelevant...I won’t get started.
---
Your post isn't irrelevant, the comment about layering not being a part of the original vanilla experience is. Most people don't want to be part of a dead server and be forced to merge, not having to dela with that is a better experience for the community as a whole and layering is a solution to this.
---
Why the hell haven't we been able to just randomize ringtones yet? Ringtones are dying because of it.
---
I like that guys mullet. 
---
That reminds me of those bad guys from "Quest for Camelot".
---
What's in a name? Why should I care if my server/layer is "Mankrik 1" and the one beside is "Mankrik 2"? How is that different than me being on "Mankrik" and the other server being "Zanzil" or something, and them merging later? What functional difference is there, when we all end up on "Mankrik" in the end?
---
Edit: it's probably more helpful to look at it not as one server that's split up, but as several servers that will be merged, with a *small* amount of cross-play just so you can group with your friends, which seems an acceptable concession to me.
---
I mean yeah.. Sit there for half a month with no game, but a reason to subscribe... It kind of is bung.
---
why would you post this here ?
---
Damn, that closing sentence though.  I'm sorry your brother is no longer with us.
---
Nice share man.
---
Well I have no idea how it works then and I also bought mine around 2 years ago
---
The actual shills are out in full force. Like how does OP even have 2k upvotes, did they even read its text? No doubt blizzard are botting votes on reddit as we speak.
---
Identity is the word you are looking for ;p
---
I totally disagree, you're listing a worst of both worlds scenario.
---
Launch competition will be super shitty which sharding would have fixed and the world will still have multiple instances of major communal areas which a single world wouldn't have caused.
---
Now we get massive continent sharding AND a crowded af launch experience.
---
Just you wait until we get those sweet, sweet 72 hour long AV matches back.
---
Hey, want to make fun of an individual in masses on the internet like literal socio-paths?
---
Join reddit.
---
Look at yourselves, you're monsters. You're evil.
---
This is wrong.
---
Oh boy cant wait to abuse the layering system and see people layer hopping on my screen!
---
Yes, that's how retail works too now. No need to buy anything, just sub and you'll have the game and all xpacs except the latest.
---
Same sub will let you play both Classic and retail.
---
It's to claim your server too! It's kind of a big deal. Could ruin servers with layering. (Those who select their server first will be on the first layer) so.. yeah it's a big mistake.
---
Get Hype!
---
Why is layering bad, again?
---
Do you want to be a world pvp king or a kid diddler?
---
Not so much debating what i play. Just how i play it
---
Leveling as ret till around 40 maybe even 60 
---
IF I manage to stay ahead of the zerg.  I may skip all group content entirely.
---
If i get behind or the group that gets over thr 20 and 30 hump with me is larger i might do uldaman and zf once.
---
How big would it be to be level 60 and getting a head start on blacksmithing plans?
---
Because so people can enjoy some entertainment 👍😅
---
Yes, exactly that. Priest/Paladin/Shaman. If you are alliance, then paladin is your #1 choice, since they have fantastic survivability in dungeon groups.
---
Jeez I hope not, that would be embarrassing
---
what's this app? I can't find it. TELL ME
---
Edit: It's not available on Iphone
---
You have no accurate source that can be proven that invites have already gone out.
---
Were you subbed at the start of the beta ?
---
So, let me see if I'm reading this correctly:
---
A) I have a bunch of pieces if paper that say I understand have design so I'm better than you.
---
B) #nochanges
---
C) I should be allowed to beta test so that I can bug report every single thing that's been changed from how it was in Vanilla, because #nochanges
---
D) I can't forgo a meal at a fast food restaurant to ensure that I get the name that I want, and that's absolute bull-ish.
---
E) I'm super salty because my opinion is worth more than anybody else's just because I played during Vanilla.
---
That about sums it up, right?
---
I started playing in Vanilla, subscribed pretty much consistently through until about a month after BFA launch, when I realized that I was only still playing to raid, and as I want raising any longer the game was no longer fun for me. But even I don't have the levels of entitlement and same you are exhibiting, despite the amount of money I've given blizzard in subscription fees, purchasing expansions, two paid boosts, a few race changes, a couple of server changes, and purchasing all expansions (some expansions multiple times due to running the different accounts concurrently during Cata, MoP, and part of Warlords).
---
My suggestion to you; take a breather/chill pill, relax, and try to enjoy Classic WoW when it launches. The game isn't even officially out yet, and you're already getting super worked up and letting yourself become a cesspool of toxicity. Remember, the game is Classic WoW not Vanilla WoW. They never claimed to be creating a true 1:1 experience. In fact, Blizzard said from the beginning that there would be some things that they would change based on lessons that they learned in the past 15 years, but that they still aimed to create a FAIRLY FAITHFUL (not perfectly copied) recreation of Vanilla World of Warcraft.
---
\&gt;I'm an adult with a job and shit so I mean as for my future, WoW doesn't effect that, the fuckin economy does lol
---
Oh sweet summer child....
---
Didn't nostalrius have less than 20% player retention? And it was free?
---
Well are you focusing more on pve or pvp? In my opinion rogue is the most fun pvp class in vanilla just because world pvp was so fun
---
Exactly. Ion made personal claims with no evidence of how they'd handle situations like that. As a software dev, I pretty much agree with you, OP. Unless an official Blizzard statement is released on it, I dont trust the word of one dev. What he wants to do and what upper management wants are not the same...and guess who wins every time :(
---
Well for example, before the release date was announced everyone swore to God that it was going to be a beta that they'd get to log in and play , with nothing but speculation. But if you asked "how do you know its a playable beta?" You're barraged with downvotes, and any comments are basically just saying you're dumb and don't know what you're talking about.
---
Thats the problem is that we all end up on 1 server at the end. If i cant see the people ima be with at the end then whats the point? I want a MMORPG with a server community, not whatever the fk retail is now. If i wanted that id play retail.
---
Who the fuck are you and why do we even care?
---
Why would warriors be stronger?
---
If you don’t want to pay 15 dollars to the company which you seemingly despise you can always wait until end of August. 
---
No one is forcing you to pay a subscription in order to play the beta.
---
It seems more reasonable as a business plan to let the active subscribers be able to play the beta, rather than old players which may not be loyal anymore.  
---
Would it not seems unfair if someone who has been playing since Cata til now we’re able to test classic beta? They’ve shown themselves as loyal costumers.
---
How is this trolling? This is literal concern. Cant you tell that I don't want this game ruined by activision trying to scam people like they always do? Are you so blind? Well? Are you? 
---
(this is the only answer I want or will reply to, you answer me, have you seen activision lately or are you blind?)
---
Only 2 genders tho
---
I mean I know that wow can totally upend that lol, Ive heard the stories
---
No it shouldn’t. It should be random to people playing the game currently
---
"Rogue can't touch you, he's in Narnia"
---
Not a big deal profession wise, the important plans will be world drops.
---
I've got mixed feelings about trying to rush ahead of actually doing dungeons to level up.
---
*laughs in PvE server*
---
Woke up on the rich and entitled side today?
---
Blizzard has announced that BfA subscriptions and Classic subscriptions will be one in the same. So it's not obscene to think they want a subscription to World of Warcraft to play, or reserve names, for World of Warcraft.
---
What's more importen than WoW?
---
You can also easily be removed since its so easy to find people.
---
Second time you post this now? Mods ban him from the subreddit please.
---
Dude, I've been all about the WoW &amp; Halo Soundtracks as of late.
---
Implying (shadow) priests aren't remotely amazing at WPvP.
---
So they are wrong for rewarding people who a actually play their game? And not giving access to people who haven’t played in a long time.
---
Because most people that want it wish to use it as a status symbol of showing they leveled quickly (in my opinion).
---
Cool well you're reported.
---
They are fun, as fun as any of the other DPS classes. There will just be a lot of people playing rogue.
---
At this point I think you would be better off on Pservers.   You are clearly an entitled troll who is trashing a company while foaming at the mouth to play their game.
---
Hi, /u/papayaj
---
Removed Rule 7. Repost

Mage or rogue is the issue for me now. I kicked Hunter out for a rogue, I don't think im good enough to control a pet.

---
Troll does nothing for PvP and you'd be giving up two amazing PvP races (Hardiness 25% is crazy, Warstomp can help connect a chain lightning or heal). 
---
For PvE the differences are less relevant, though Troll ekes out there. Unless you're dead set on the appearance, you'll miss not having either the Orc or Tauren racials if you ever plan to do a lot of PvP.
---
And you sound like you don’t understand how businesses and testing works. If they give beta keys to subscribed players there is a much better chance that they will actually get bug reports and people will find problems. If they gave keys to unsubbed players what’s stopping some guy who has never played wow from signing up for beta for fun, getting access, not knowing how the game works, and then quitting an hour later? Or even worse, what’s stopping people from mass creating new bnet accounts and then signing up for beta access on all of them? Requiring a sub is the only realistic way that blizzard can handle this.
---
You do realise blizzard isn’t going to read this, right?
---
\*actually
---
Thank you my friend. After 6 months I finally found a worthy background pic.
---
Yeah, that's the one that allows for both interpretations. Oh well.
---
While yes, I was a wotlk baby, I have played on the "big" private servers and know how it is- however it's less about classic and more about wow being fun again, it's about having that game you can get obsessed about, that game that makes you say "just one more hour" at 2am
---
The experience as a whole that players I'd say even up to cata would know, the Good Grind™
---
It's been far too long since I've had something make me count the hours till I have to wake up and go "hm, yeah 3 hours of sleep is enough, I'm sure it'll be fine"
---
reading isnt your strong suit is it
---
Yeah, they do.
---
A lot of dedicated wow streamers can actually provide very constructive ideas for classic wow. Esfand, Staysafe, Tipsout, Towelliee, Asmongold all are wow vets and are dedicated to making the game as best as possible. These are the people who I think will contribute the most effective feedback for the devs.
---
Don’t think so, Unsubbed during the first month of legion
---
Oh fuck that's hot
---
It would take a dev about 15 mins to put some teleports and paths in that would make tbc completely flying mount free. It is not a big issue lol.
---
The incentive to resub is a chance for the beta invite.  They aren't going to invite players who aren't currently subbed.  The fact that any of you guys are reading this any other way is pretty silly.
---
Taken offline has nothing to do with classic. There’s still much more that needs to be tested on PTR.
---
This is a silly thing to be worried about. It's basically like separate servers that will get combined in a few weeks. No big deal.
---
I'm more worried about the devs hinting about cHaNgEs and pOsT-nAxX cOnTeNt and everyone who was cheering them on yesterday calling for transmog and class balancing and getting upvoted for it. I hope that was retail trolls and Blizz plants and not actual people from this sub.
---
&gt; Epic games for example, always listen.
---
L M A O
---
Yeah I completely agree, that is exactly what it sounded like. It was only on further reflection that I considered they might implement something like a queue split to avoid a significantly less populated layer.
---
Tbh i read the first message pessimistically, assuming it was sarcasm. My bad. With that being said, I don't downvote/upvote cuz I think it's a stupid system that only helps the circle jerking.
---
25 seconds to summon flying mount.
---
I won't miss "archiv" that's for sure
---
I want to level every class eventually, maybe a couple at a time together to cycle and avoid boredom. My big question is this, I'm leveling Mage first since it will save lots of time and money with conjure food and water, but after mage which classes should I knock out? I'll be playing horde exclusively so no paladins! Sorry Alliance, maybe if TBC drops.
---
My planned groups post mage look roughly like this:
---
A) Warlock/Shaman
---
B) Hunter/Rogue
---
C) Priest/Warrior/Druid
---
Which group would you level first and why? Should I mix up the groups more?
---
&gt;Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.
---
Yeah you’re probably right. *sniff*
---
Emotions aren't a bad thing y'know. Despite what the internet edgelords would have you think
---
I was already planning on playing Rogue but you've convinced me 100% to play it now, thanks for typing this out, its greatly appreciated. :)
---
At least the demo was guaranteed access, subbing for a *chance* at beta is definitely the worse deal. 
---
I did both though so I'm definitely the saddest fuck here.
---
Did you not take the time to continue to see that the layering will eventually be peeled back after a couple of weeks or did you rage flip the table before you read that part?
---
At blizzcon they said they were looking at new tech for the early zones only. Now layering impacts every zone. It's clear you cannot trust the opinions of one dev. They change over time and unless there are official Blizzard statements in writing, dont believe anything that is said. 
---
Why do you think they are letting streamers release the info secondhand? Why do their official posts have bare minimum info, then we get the rest from one off dev interviews. Because it reduces their liability to not state things officially. They are more free to change their minds
---
&gt; Well that is an RP style event. If they are RPing they would say stuff like "To arms brothers of the allinace! The enemy is upon us!" or some shit like that. Otherwise what's the point of RPing?
---
Nah, that's more of a PVPer thing. A lot of RPers play as non-affilated to the A/H. and more to like the argent dawn, the cenarians, or various others. a merc hired by some everlook goblin isn't going to be entirely keen on throwing down with the horde or alliance in their battles.
---
On RP-PvP servers, there was a lot of people RPing as &lt;faction specific hub here&gt;Kind of like the troll villiage in Hinterlands vs The Wildhammer dwarves. though and it was more faction warfare based.
---
Point of RPing is that you can be more than just "SOLDIER OF TEH ALLIANCE/HORDE"

Reminds me of Guild Wars 1 where if a District (The Instance City/Outpost) was full, a new District was created. 
---
So you could have District 1, District 2, District 3, etc. Only thing is that you could move to different Districts, but if they were full/highly populated, you would wait a short time before joining/failing to join.
---
wait... you don't want to look at NSFW memes focusing on blood elf boobies?
---
You're tired of peoples furry fantasies?
---
You can't stand a new updated shit hand drawn POS sketch of some shit mage every time they ding?
---
That about tier3? Should they also get it on classic if they got it in retail?
---
Your paying to have a sub to play retail not to play classic im sorry to dissapoint you if you do want to do that wait till August
---
The demo was a guarantee, now you're just throwing money out the window.
---
See "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?".
---
\&gt;taking it personally that you weren't selected by a random sampling algorithm
---
Sorry man. The last paragraph gave me chills, I feel for you. R.i.p. to your big brother, it will be nice to relive the good memories you made with him. ❤️
---
Neglected is an exaggeration. They have their place, they might require some more work in certain areas. Namely for Shadow Priest, at most you'll take 1 for a raid so chances are you won't be that 1 shadow priest and have to heal. Dungeons you'll do fine. 
---
For PvP, Shadow Priests are stellar. They burn through mana quick, but they hard counter a lot of classes. Also fairly straight forward to play.
---
You tell your boss why you're taking vacation time?
---
Imagine paying 15$ for a CHANCE of beta invite and only to lvl 30.
---
/r/classicwow poster checks post histories and attacks anyone he mildly disagrees with. Sounds about right.
---
No pls watch my streamer
---
You're welcome :)
---
You got to be fucking shitting me.
---
Sounds like I for sure should go rogue or mage then. I think im going to be a pvp guy mostly, based on my friend group.
---
No no there could never be any problems with classic, shh. You are meddling with a lot of nerd rage if you proceed m8. Anyhow, not forever ever no, I imagine it’s possible to swap between using friend invites, but yes, very much an immersion breaking.
---
Ehe druid flight form as a NE was op back then.  
---
( as you fly and see a hord switch to bear and spam charge as you fall.  Wam no fall damage and charge stun.  ).  
---
Hord is winning double tap shadowmeld/Flight form macro and go up.  /wave opponent.  
---
Flight made ganks easier as a pi could come from above.  And made them easier to avoid.  
---
Flying was a mistake even tho flying was practically needed in tbc due to layout of zones.

Until management wants it left on because they are worried about long queue times on servers where the pop hasn't dropped away leading to less $$$.
---
Thank you for this great podcast, Josh. The quality of topics and guests the last few months has been so good. You've got one loyal listener hee mate! (Picking up some cool australian lingo as well as you can see)
---
i was realy hyped for the red wolve :(
---
I mean... I usually find people that scan peoples post history looking for ways to trash them are the worst kind of people. Just saying.
---
You can be invited to the beta but not participate. Participant means actually playing. In the past you needed an active sub to participate in beta, but not to simply be invited.
---
Hopefully Blizzard realizes that PvP servers are a mistake and changes all of them to Normal and RP like we have in Retail. Who has time to get ganked? This game is for casuals not nolifers. This game was made for casuals from the start and I hope Blizzard remembers that.
---
I wouldn't count on it.
---
We got "brazilian" servers since Cataclysm but they were never located in Brazil, they are located on the same hub as the EST servers.
---
So even if you got a SA server, you'll still be playing with high latency just like us.
---
Hopefully! I have 3 accounts, two of which were made in 2005. Fingers crossed.
---
I'm a loyal customer, of the original WoW (classic/vanilla), that we currently cannot play right now.
---
No. Druid is the most resilient healer, then pally
---
You should respect for reckoning, it’s always good to respect holy warriors.
---
Sure, like all americans rerolled a Kul'tiran ASAP :p
---
Uhh... Then I don't know what the f*ck to do. I just want to be pure dps doing good damage (At this points I'm open to ranged dps tbh)
---
You forgot your ‘some’ in front of WoW classic players. Some of us actually wanted to play WoW at launch.
---
Little private server congested leveling memes are incongruent with the stable release of a playable game which was available when vanilla was first released.
---
Aw, there goes lorelol unless someone saved it somewhere else.
---
They can. We are exaggerating the tiny bit of ambiguity so those without an active sub can hold on to a glimmer of hope. It's fairly clear that you need a sub to get an invite, but it doesn't actually expressly state this and leaves room for a question from the non-subbed hopefuls. Participant=/=invitee
---
Don't play the beta and don't reserve your names then. 
---
This has been posted 10+ times today alone.
---
My concern is that these layers and servers will overall handle less people than classic wow. 
---
The current servers can't handle the same amount wow used to on the original server blades. Everything is sharded to hell.
---
Unless Blizzard plans on bringing back classic server infra I don't see how they're going to make it work
---
Leveling: Warlock is a lot faster. They have no downtime, Mages have a lot of downtime. Keep in mind, it'll also be *worse* than private servers as regen rates are usually a lot quicker on private servers. Meanwhile, Warlock are top tier levelers. 
---
They're both great choices for PvP, BGs and WPvP. Warlocks are more complex in general, have fewer hard counters. Either way, both are very rewarding in PvP. 
---
PvE they both get picked without issue for raids and are good for dungeons. 
---
There's some quality of life additions for mage through conjuring food and teleporting/portals. Warlocks meanwhile have to deal with farming soul shards which can be tedious.
---
dworfs &lt;3
---
If blizzard can generate money for a beta, they will do it.
---
And the minutes head start for some people is not a big deal.
---
But it has a shared economy meaning materials can cross "servers".
---
And depending how sticky the layers are you could log into a different layer than you were the day before...
---
It's a renamed cross-realm server group system which is not reflective of the vanilla experience.
---
probably :D
---
Lol you’re delusional, or a good troll (I hope it’s the latter for your sake)
---
&gt;Most of the time I spent just watching him play and I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
---
As a younger sibling to an older brother, I have so many of these same memories with games like Final Fantasy, Diablo 2, Toe Jam and Earl...the list goes on.
---
With a patient older brother who lets their younger sibling ask (stupid) questions, and gets excited with over game achievements, any single player game is a co-op game.
---
Going to text my bro right now and say thanks.
---
Just get 2 cases of Mountain Dew instead of 4 the next few months and that will pay for your sub. Problem solved.
---
So preordering a game you cant play for months is bad practice?  It is just to gauge how much traffic they will get on launch.
---
Dont play if it bothers you
---
It's k, i could of have asked a bit better myself.
---
Almost four, four, four, months to go              
---
I wanna be sedated              
---
Nothing to do, no where to go,                
---
Just get me to the Flight Master, put me on a Wind Rider-thing                
---
Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane                     
---
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain                 
---
Oh no oh oh oh oh
---
I think you are vastly underestimating the queue time then. Seems like you want pure vanilla which means they should put server cap of 3k, but they also want as few servers as possible so you might seen 10 NA PVP. That means your queue time on the average Friday night will probably be about 10k people. Great way to kill the game you seem to want to play. 
---
I ask that you (and many others) make a small, limited time, sacrifice to improve the overall health of the game and give this version of WoW the best chance to succeed.
---
Is it too late to sign up now to get a chance in?
---
Depends on what my friends go for. I'll probably go Priest or Lock for the group, and have an alt Rogue for just being by myself.
---
No, don't allow people to pay to win. 
---
Dont allow people to pay to reserve anything that's a freaking change!!
---
#NOCHANGES
---
Cry more.
---
It's a vague path. But there will be so many people playing and forming guilds there will be no way you won't be able to find your way
---
So much this.  Stormwind had heavy influence on Elwynn Forest.  Then, less so on Westfall, Redridge, and Duskwood.  After that, it was into the jungle where civilization just ended.  
---
So much scope to that journey.
---
No, it’s basically not possible and a lot of work for little gain. I’m going to spend my time working hard leveling and making gold not wasting my time trying to take a short cut.
---
&gt; So I've been asking people at blizzard and they are telling me now that it doesn't look like they will get F&amp;F keys to give out even.
---
That isn't how F&amp;F has worked for quite some time. There is a list and when the beta goes live you get an alert, there is no "F&amp;F keys".
---
Well, in the spirit of jokes from classic;
---
At least if I play alliance quest mobs should be easy to find.
---
All mages/hunter are waiting for you on STV
---
That's not how layers work, at all. Your only valid point is that you're paying for 2 weeks for nothing, because you seem very confused about layering.
---
If you don't wanna pay $7.50 for the top three names you want, then just don't do that.
---
Drives you crazy doesn't it?
---
There are so many people playing the game... ugh this sucks? Like is that seriously the first thought that crosses peoples minds? Not: haha so many people, let's make friends, so many people, let's troll a few of them, let's /dance a few of them, fight over resources, etc... the first thought in people's heads is "Blizz should do something to reduce the number of people so I can play this like a single player game".
---
It wasn't always like this and I personally blame "gamer culture" and its obsession with powergaming and optimization.
---
If you didn't know about beta and name reservation you wouldn't even notice it.
---
You get to choose, because if you are 1st on the server. you are on the 1st layer...
---
So giving someone 2 weeks to choose their server almost guarantees they are 1st layer.
---
It make Blizz more money, and people let that shit slide sadly.
---
On the changes thing, this is just one of many changes. I agree that it's not good, but they've also broken that rule a hundred times before.
---
Paying for a beta is a joke, a beta is supposed to be there to stress test and fix bugs. People are paying to work for Blizzard, it should be at the very least free.
---
#cringyguy
---
if you could read it that is.
---
Then they should just make it an option? Make a server with sharding, since it can shard infinitely or more servers if they want?, and make a few servers without it. I have no problem waiting in ques for a few weeks.
---
Edit: im just saying i dont see why we cant have an option, if blizz and you are right then the non sharded servers should be dead after the initial wave leaves which will force us to re roll anyways onto the previously sharded servers and if we are correct then we get the server community we wanted and you guys still got your smooth no que launch. Its a win-win for all.
---
Man I hate this art style. It's so prevalent
---
That's not how layering apparently is supposed to work. For instance check out https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY @ 4.03 onwards. Thus reservation of names in advance is not connected to the potential layers.
---
Were you even born when Vanilla was out? I'm betting no.
---
This isn't a showcase of skill. It's a showcase of a fully buffed R14 warrior shitting on everyone in sight, and it's fucking **awesome**.
---
Pat and Maydie were literal Gods to the Warrior community. These videos were much earlier than the showcases of Laintime, Vurtne, etc, as well so it's much more raw. Even clicking some skills. That would never be accepted in a video today.
---
In terms of pure influence, this is probably the number one warcraft movie ever.
---
How is being able to choose your name two weeks prior to release P2W? 
---
You can play on any server you want regardless. Maybe you won't get the specific name you want, but that's it. 
---
It's not Pay 2 Win in the slightest.
---
1st level of layering will go to those who create their character first on a server.
---
Yeah pretty much.  Sometimes though if you're in a raid as a tank but a tank isnt needed on every encounter you can justify doing cat dps, it's generally not great though.
---
i just looked at the coupon again and you are right, it says vaild until 1st of Oct 2017 at the bottom, it still worked! :D
---
I have no desire to play the beta
---
I played ret extensively in WoTLK, so I can really relate to your love of that spec during that time period.
---
That being said, PVE ret is absolutely nothing like WOTLK ret, and is incredibly boring/underpowered.
---
Wow you really are foaming at the mouth.  I understand your entitled but if this is your argument on how this is Pay To Win it seems pretty slim.  Good for you on your troll but I think you might just enjoy playing on PServers at the moment.
---
does anyone really do that tho?
---
they can still raid and get t3.
---
there is no way to get these mounts, so it should be given to people who got it before.

Tf you talking about I remember stalking an alliance friend easily by talking to someone on aim. Accessible in the sense that more people use the internet and the technology is smoother better faster but it was still pretty damn easy back then. Lol that's not even breaking immersion though spies and snitches exist in time of war. Kind of hard to miss a bunch of orc and tauren on big ass mounts going across a continent. People would usually find out when they see you passing through small alliance towns destroying them.
---
Thats so wrong on vanilla... History proven on so many servers, alliance gears up faster T1/T2, while horde pvpers still crawl around on pvp blues. Then alliance dominates PVP
---
Sure, theres a marked difference between being wary, and assuming the worst in ever situation.
---
Yeah only 3 weeks before fall... so I guess it's still technically summer... RIP to teachers and students
---
&gt;  is it absolutely impossible to rank even 5 mans as Prot Pally?
---
You absolutely can but there are a lot of obstacles. They're actually beasts in dungeons, but they require a lot of game knowledge (and better party coordination) so might not be an ideal first choice unless you're willing to read through guides. 
---
Unlike Druids and Warriors they have no taunts, meaning they struggle with panic moments. Unlike Druids and Warriors they can run out of resources (mana), as a result they require more specific gear to do well so knowing where to get that is massive. Unlike Druids and Warriors they have no ranged pull, meaning either you let a party member pull for you (which means you lose a big threat bump) or you 'face pull' which is riskier.
---
Oh I will. Forgive them they are caught in a hype storm, it will dawn on them one-day

Your definition of winning is silly, l e l

Jeez these posts are embarrassing to read, it’s insane that people really get this emotional about a computer game.

You are complaining like a child who is not getting their way. Grow up, play a different game if it’s going to bother you that bad.
---
Reverse sharding.

You're dedicated to your craft, I'll give you that. Unfortunately your biggest flaw was being *too* obvious of a troll. People see right through it.

Anyone who actually cares about min making enough to worry about losing the few SECONDS it takes to make a new character is in the extreme minority. You’re most likely just completely nitpicking and it shows. It’s actually laughable for you to call this pay to win, especially since you’re better off making your character late and getting on a low pop layer if you’re trying to get ahead of the curve. Lastly, being able to get an idea of which types of servers people are rolling on 2 weeks before game launch and being able to get an estimate of even just the MINIMUM number of players off of just early sub numbers is incredibly useful for blizzard, not to mention the fact that they’re a BUSINESS and offering some useful perks for players willing to throw extra money their way is an extra bonus.
---
It’s $15 who really cares? Like seriously
---
I've always wondered why there was no faction incentive for downing leaders besides fun and honor
---
I do love Dorfs!
---
Pedobear? Wow this really is 2004.
---
So? 1, that's not an advantage, and 2, you aren't stuck on the same layer until they merge... People will float between layers when joining guilds and groups, and likely each time they change continents and log in/out. It's like super big phasing, not completely separate servers.
---
11/2005 me too.
---
What do you think happened in 2004/2005? Are you under the impression that you didn't need a guild for raid content? Or that you could just pug every single bit of content? 
---
I remember multiple world bosses that were nothing but a killing field. Multiple horde and alliance 40-mans killing each other to prevent the other from getting the kill. If you think one streamer and their clique is going to be able too monopolize world bosses you are sadly mistaken. 
---
Also if you think some random streamer  is going to do any of that without a 40-man guild behind them you are going to be shocked at what vanilla was really like. 
---
As a proud bitter vet I can't wait for all these live players to see what WoW was really like and what a hard mmo actually looks like.
---
No it shouldn't. It's a different game
---
The chorus is one of Wierd Al's finest!
---
Pedophiles weirdchamp
---
The name reserved is also a way for them to judge how much people would be on and not everyone is creating there character at once, everything they are doing is so we have a nice smooth launch. Would you rather then do sharding.
---
Wtf are you even talking about dude... lol are you seriously comparing the launch of a video game to a mentally disabled person or a person being bullied? Wow man... wow hahaha I will say it again. It’s a game. Look its your right to have an opinion and our community unfortunately is one that loves to be outraged.
---
oh look another spastic person who doesnt understand layering or what pay 2 win is spouting the regular #nochanges, #shill bullshit to anyone who doesnt agree with them. who woulda guessed we'd see another one of these?
---
But tauren look so op in blue and hwl warrior gear lolll
---
No, you are put into layers when you log in, and leave them when you logout, they are session specific

Human for Perception and increased rep gains
---
Yes I would because server layers.
---
Stop acting like a huge game and server mechanic aren't going to be game changing to an MMO that relies so much on community.
---
In the same boat here.
---
&gt; So, what do I do? Should I just play warrior fury dps or try another pure melee dps class?
---
As a general rule of thumb for Classic, you should pick a class, not a spec. If you find a class you enjoy the whole talent tree / roles available, you're going to have a better time than playing a class where you REALLY like one spec.
---
Go PvE, problem solved! :D
---
I feel like the word participant by definition would mean someone who already has been selected for the beta
---
...to test the game for bugs
---
Also cannibalise, saves a good portion of time
---
How would you notice the layers?
---
They made people pay 50 dollars for a scuffed demo. They do whatever they can get away with. 
---
If Blizzard all of the sudden acted differently I can understand why people were upset, but this is a company who wants to suck the last penny out of you.
---
because they saved 3 seconds from not having to type their name in?
---

sir please step over there, the fbi would like to speak to you

Yup I'm constantly gabkingthe air/fire eles in smv and since I have epic fly while most people don't yet almost no one can get away. Love it but I can see why people are against flying lol
---
Yeah, that happens all the time.....
---
That was the post bud. It was all about the common sentiment amongst those who are complaining. I think you’re misusing the word irrelevant/relevant. It happens to me with some words too, I’m not perfect either!
---
Hmm I bought it on Vudu, time to scour my emails to see if I missed any game time...
---
Just received this in the mail the other day and the dungeon companion is coming Friday. The dungeon comp is like $26 USD on amazon and covers everything from RFC the last dungeon before Naxx.   
---
This 2nd edition guide has some good tidbits in it and was actually revised for the 1.12 patches. When brady was still good haha.
---
But selecting your server first, is related to potential layers.
---
If you are on the server 1st, and your character is locked in 1st, you are on LAYER 1.
---
No one yet?
---
Yep, just like all things in life, a balance is needed. You want enough players that grouping up is fairly easy, but not so many players that there's no real penalty for abandoning your group halfway or makes it easy to cherry pick like crazy while forming the group.
---
Also fewer people per server means a stronger reputation and identity per person. Much more easy to get lost in a crowd of 100K total players vs 8K total players...and part of why Vanilla was so good is how recognizable people became and how often you'd see the same folks around.
---
Better buy Bitcoin!
---
Don't have 15 bucks to spend?
---
Same.  I have debated 49".  My biggest reason not to is the asthetics of the 49" every other moment I am not playing.  34 just kinda hits the sweet spot, and it still kinda fills my entire visual field.
---
Now it just sounds like they shard 2/3rds of your server every time you log in.. And act like if you don't see people fading in you wont notice that 2/3rds of your server is missing.
---
What are you talking about I want to get exhaulted with troll on my undead rouge for the riding skill
---
Everything about this post is wrong. Druids and priests get worse due to their Mana Regen talent and t2 3 piece getting worse. Shadow priests get that same talent. Ultimately this probably means you need 1-2 more healers doing mc/bwl progression
---
This needs more upvotes FFS. I've been refreshing Twitch all day to see if anyone is in yet and nobody even seems to know when it's supposed to start. One dude just stopped streaming so people think he has inside info that it was delayed.
---
Either way yes they all do the above and it's irritating.
---
well first saying "classic beta today" is confirmed by blizzard. second, alot of them have said they dont know when its coming out and that theyre just assuming its later, i have yet to hear one of them say something like "its any time now i have inside information." and third, who ISNT watching old vanilla videos right now?
---
From what I've read enhancement shamans are not the highest tier, if I want a strong melee dps it seems to be rogue or warrior - which one plays more similarly to enhancement shaman?
---
lmao accurate
---
"13 and 40" is a biiiiig range, brother.
---
Yes like the first 10 streamers.
---
Ion says "where unlike what we do with sharding in the modern game where we have many copies of the individual zone we're going to run multiple copies of the entire world. A single cohesive Eastern kingdoms, Azeroth. You can take the zeppelin across and you're staying with the same players you're traversing the same world but will have multiple layered copies of that same world.
---
[Source](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=315) (timestamped at 3:15)
---
I think Ion's description is definitely describing the whole of Azeroth being a single layer, but Omar isn't super clear. There's definitely an emphasis on continuity across the world but it's not concrete. While continents make sense for instances you can still have 2 separate server instances for the continents with a single layer, so I don't think that's too important.
---
Hopefully this tech is on Beta servers so we can see how it works for certain
---
Ah, memories of MP5 gear and breaks from casting for regen to kick in....

This is how mafia works.
---
I'm literally building my first gaming rig since my last one got hit by lightning more than a decade ago. After that computer was fried circumstances just didn't make the time and money worth it to re-build. I played from August of 2005 until February or March of 2007 (freshman through sophomore years of college).
---
When I looked into jumping back in around 2011, so much had changed and it was too overwhelming. Being able to start again fresh with everyone else in a format that makes sense to me is VERY exciting.
---
This is a great book I was so surprised when I first read it how detailed it was for releasing way back when it was out, information filled.
---
na no thanks
---
Towelliee
---
He used to say how it would never happen and how it would be bad for the game now he's all for it.
---
Friends and Family
---
I felt for this more often than I would like to confess
---
So is it an active subscription or if you have play time? So if you pay month to month are you still eligible?
---
I absolutely can not fucking wait to relive my childhood. Seriously after years of depression, this is the first happy thing I have had to look forward to. Can’t wait.
---
It's a sign that they don't want actual testing done, they'd rather look at it as another venture to profit off the playerbase. Betas in the past have typically been used as ways to market players into coming back to the game, I found that those who were unsubbed seemed more likely to get invites to previous expansions ironically. This seems like a scummy way to suck money out of the desperate Classic WoW playerbase. I just wanted to clarify, I ain't subbing nor do I even care to be part of the beta at all.
---
Have they confirmed that's how it works? AFAIK (haven't checked any news today) it was just sharding except continent wide, and you'd be put with friends/guildies.
---
Hi, /u/Yogg_the_Legend
---
I think it's very unfair of you to assume they're doing those thing in ill will. The background with the login to beta it's because a lot of them are actually trying to log in every now and then to check if it's playable already. They are watching videos from Vanilla, yes, but not to *pretend* they're playing, but because they're discussing all kind of stuff, talking about the game, answering questions and preparing lists of "things to check when beta releases". And they WILL play it in the first second the beta opens, it's what they intend to do, so of course the title is related to what they're excited to do too.
---
But if they want to create an experience close as possible to Vanilla, then they need to roughly maintain the weekly uptake of resources per person on an average realm back then. If there were 600 Lotus being herbed on servers with 1000 avg players online...then a WoW Classic server should be able to produce 6000 Lotus if it has 10,000 avg players on.
---
They need to maintain the same scarcity level they originally balanced around.
---
If flasks are 300g then the devs made mistakes. I recalled them being more like 50g back in 2005.
---
There is no locking. You'll join and leave layers each time you log in and out.
---
Would you like to prove your lack of reading comprehension and point out the issue that you have?
---
And it all gets peeled back after a couple of weeks. Educate yourself.
---
This was not true for any Beta ever, many of my friends got Legion Beta invites after having left from WoD long ago.
---
This happened to me with about 10 stacks of linen cloth during wotlk.   They all sold for about 80g when I meant to post them for 80s.   They all sold at the same time so one poor soul lost alot
---
To have a chance at it, yes.
---
None of them. They're completely different.
---
\#1: This is not server changing and will help show the expected traffic per realm for server resource allocation.  
---
\#2/#4: Literally are not put into a layer until your character is logged in on. Think of it like plane tickets, you don't show up on flight day, they re-sell or just don't fill your seat.  
---
\#3: Life isn't fair I guess? If you wan't your name, you will pay the price.
---
\#5: See #2/#4 about layers. And its not a waste, see #1 on that point. Sure they are going to make money, but again if you can afford $15.00 take the trash out or do some chores for your mom.  
---
Or you know get a job, like the rest of adults. Literally crying over a wasted $7.50. Skip your starbucks order one day this month.
---
Keyring was a later patch than 1.12. Probably will come with one of the phases. I hope. It was one of my favorite things.

High five 🙌
---
Beta is for TESTING the game and ensuring it works properly. It doesn't matter who does this, nor does it make sense that you have to pay to be a game tester (this is a job some people even make money to participate in, not pay for it..). You're joking right?
---
You don't have to be hostile when retorting any response. I meant access as in all things, not just logging in. Layering accomplishes many things at once. 
---
Private servers do not come close to what retail/classic will see trying to access is the point I was getting across.
---
&gt; same reason they're doing it for CE pets
---
I mean, if you gamble when to take your vacation time based on a predicament then you probably aren’t very smart.
---
Ohh
---
Yeah, if you read and pay attention to the quests, Vanilla WoW has a story that is miles better than the cringey anime/Overwatch style story that Retail has. That's because Vanilla is Azeroth after the events of WC3:FT, back when Blizzard cared/had good writers.
---
My first ton was a rogue named shadowbladez, then my second character was a pally named flameblades. 
---
Anyways, when I went back to my rogue to see how he looked mid tbc, he had robes from sfk on and a bunch of other stupid shit.
---
Nope. Rumors are it'll be a few hours.
---
Still impatiently refreshing email, battle.net, etc.. tho
---
I hope most of us waited lol really stupid not too
---
Family and friends. Blizzard employees usually get a handful of free game keys for new releases or special priority for F&amp;F in betas like we're talking about here.
---
Not if you're alone. It just fixed the situation of arriving at your favorite farm spot and having to basically just leave if someone is there already. That worked fine in Vanilla but would happen in every single spot of WoW Classic if they increase the server popn.
---
You definitely got scammed my man. I already got my beta client running and am currently running around Azeroth. I just had to download this client from WoWPrivateServer.com and Paypal BetaWoWClassic@B1izzard.com .
---
10k? That’s probably why you didn’t get yours! That was the best $50k I ever spent!
---
Wow deleted in less than 20 minutes. I think he figured out he was being stupid.
---
It would probably depend on which iteration of enhancement shaman you're imagining in your head.
---
Classic enhance plays more like a Arms warrior with a big 2h and swinging/praying for a huge Windfury proc to chunk a mob/player down.  
---
Current enhancement on live is probably closer to a combat rogue/fury warrior, leaning more towards fury just because it's still fairly "proc-ey."  I honestly haven't played my shaman in BFA though so not sure what might have changed from 8.0 onwards.
---
Either way, you're probably going to enjoy warrior if you like either version of the shaman (both past and present) since the two warrior DPS specs align pretty well with both iterations of shaman.
---
You also have the benefit of off tanking if you ever want to switch it up, and are warrior will be a more in your face play style, similar to shaman, whereas rogue is more hit and run or controlled/methodical killing.
---
Just my opinion.
---
Friends and family
---
ty guys
---
Neither is very similar. I just leved an enhancement shaman and they are quite boring just due to the complete lack of melee abilities outside of 31pt Stormstrike on cooldown. Most of your combat abilities are totems, shocks, and lightning shield when soloing.
---
Rogue and Warrior are both strong melee, but I can't really compare to Shaman other than Warriors can wear mail/plate compared to leather for Rogue and leather/mail for Shaman.
---
Everyone expects a September release because its technically summer.   (Blizzard)... let's make it RIGHT BEFORE September so they're wrong.
---
They doing a midnight release? Have off that last week in August anyway
---
When they were first introduced, yes. I forget what patch added battlemasters in, but you could queue from major cities. Ironforge had ot by the warrior/hunter trainers.
---
Thats true. I believe there were a few people at least who went all in on the July 16 day and likely are just screwed now. There were at least a couple people though who chose early September, etc. just to better guaranteed some playtime though which was smart.
---
If you get a 32" or 34", you will realize you can never go back.
---
PSA spirit is best leveling stat
---
Yeah. I'm thinking I missed out :(
---
I would prefer we remain a small and enthusiastic 100k rather than the Retail people coming in and demanding changes to the game, no matter how large it would make our numbers.
---
You didn't need an active sub to play beta at all, you never have. I've been in 3 betas and I wasn't subbed during any of them while trying them.
---
No, I paid for 3 months xD
---
Shaman vs Hunter for **solo** wPvP and BG's? Opinions?
---
&gt; Layering is server meshing tech Star Citizen is trying to implementing in the coming year. This is essentially cutting edge tech
---
As someone not familiar with the latest news on SC or game/server tech, could you elaborate on this more? Do you have news or article links?
---
Got mine 2weeks before release so got 2 weeks of hardcore gaming at least, will try to postpone vacation one more week at least
---
thanks mate.
---
Why are you private server kids so confident that all is retail vanilla players were clueless?
---
Of course we used world buffs, we used it on 1st raid boss kills after tons of practice. In vanilla world buffs were much harder to get with very long cool downs.  In private server you can use multiple world buffs every few hours. It’s the main reason melle are so overpowered on pservers.
---
Well, Classic is about feeling like Vanilla. If something ends up being way more annoying in Classic because of differences in realm capacity, then it should be changed until it more matches Vanilla.
---
Vanilla servers were dual one-core Xeons with 2GB of RAM. I could spawn close to 100VMs on my current workstation that would each be more powerful than a WoW Vanilla server.
---
So yes they will need to adjust things to make it feel right.
---
The prefrontal cortex doesn't finish developing until around 27-28. People younger than that are physiologically incapable of making good decisions.
---
So... yes.
---
I have not been very productive today.  So much F5ing...
---
Fortunate enough that I can take time off when necessary. Have some vacation days lined up for the 28th, 29th, and 30th.  
---
Will be playing until I have to work on September 3rd haha.
---
Or let people play the game how they want to?
---
Not exactly something you can farm for being world drops. Unless you mean to just farm gold to buy the plans off AH.
---
Ah, I don't blame you then. I'm on the F&amp;F list and have been playing on pservers for years. I'll gladly throw 15 bucks in to have a chance.
---
Finally someone who gets it, thank you!
---
same thing - I was deployed when the game released and couldn't really sub until I got home. Missed it by \*that much\*
---
I always liked this one, big ups
---
These screens are a real eye opener showing how many people ditched when TBC came out.   I loved tbc myself.
---
If properly geared they certainly can be
---
Stormwind? Outrageous. Everyone will be in Ironforge.
---
Maybe try healing as a paladin.. rather than standing around
---
Manstein with the movie «Poor Little Lyckystrike» here! 😂
---
It starts today but it's a closed beta, not an open beta, so refreshing like that only checks to see if you've finally been selected. I wouldn't bother checking so often but I would keep an eye on your email.
---
Not really "missing" but some people are gonna get surprised by sap and hunter traps in vanilla.
---
My accounts were attached. The only issue I had was none of my characters showed up on the realmlists so I had to try to remember which realms all my chars were on and select a lot of them to check. Once I found the char on the realms, they would display on the realm selection list.
---
Yeah, you're not going to get people behind changing Classic in such a major way. Honestly, the whole movement behind adding new content to Classic feels weird to me in the first place. Holidays? Sure. A dungeon or two? Sure. A new raid boss or two? *Maybe*. Revamping the itemization/progression system to allow continuous content drops without raising the level cap? That's unlikely to happen. It arguably shouldn't happen. In my opinion, "classic" WoW is everything from vanilla all the way through WOTLK. *New expansion drops are part of that experience.* Stagnating classic to level 60 while adding content seems so weird. Just IMO of course.
---
Isnt there quite a bit in BRD and strat?
---
lol you can clearly see how you're heating yourself up as you were typing up that comment.  
---
You talk about reading comprehension, I guess you totally missed the point where I said that they did mention it as a problem.  
---
However, again, the promise they made (after the "That said..." part) was that within the first few weeks, when everyone is packed in starting zones, they could use sharding in a time limited fashion, to solve launch problems, while ensuring that in the long run a single world would exist after population has regulated.  The single world in the long run would ensure the problems referenced with sharding and thorium veins, bosses etc would not be an issue... because sharding would no longer exist.  
---
He never said that there would never be sharding in those zones, however recently they did say there would definitely never be sharding for world bosses.  Aside from that it's just as easy to speculate how long within phase one these will last, but as of now, they havn't went back on their word.
---
You're amazing reading comprehension also happened to miss that I was previously referencing that clip as a source.
---
&gt;If there were 600 Lotus being herbed on servers with 1000 avg players online...then a WoW Classic server should be able to produce 6000 Lotus if it has 10,000 avg players on.
---
This has nothing to do with what we are discussing. We are talking about dynamic respawns, what you now describe is just static scaling to the amount of players. I fully agree that if they increase the players per realm they also need to increase the amount of resources, but that is not what dynamic respawn is.
---
&gt;If flasks are 300g then the devs made mistakes. I recalled them being more like 50g back in 2005.
---
That is just wrong. This time around literally everyone will know what is meta and what flask to use. In vanilla a lot of people didn't use flask or even knew what was meta to use.
---
In other words, the *demand* of flask will be much greater in Classic than it was in vanilla, and as such follows higher prices. So if the prices are the same that means there are too many resources which would lower the price to counter the higher demand.
---
Furthermore, the general economy will be much different this time around. Way more people know of efficient farming so overall the total amount of gold will most likely be higher. If people on average have more gold, then prices *also* rise. The thing to remember here is there is a static amount of resources, so more money with same resources available just means higher prices.
---
My ding ding dong!
---
how so? the rules for them are different?
---
Checking
---
I always wanted to try ESO and now I have three months to do it
---
What kind of drooling fungus do you have to be to request days off work to play a game before you even know when it's releasing?
---
Also, requesting Day 1 off is a novice mistake. You'll be plagued with queues, crashes, bugs, overpopulation, etc. Better off to wait a few days, when all the poopsockers are back to work.
---
I did but I had no choice. Had to submit it by March 30. I gambled on July 16, got bamboozled. It's still better than no vacation at all tho (because if I didn't submit anything I wouldn't have gotten anything). Tourism is merciless when it comes to vacations during high season xD.
---
After mage (or at the same time) do hunter and maybe whatever other class you want most.
---
People say mage and hunter are the easiest farming classes and also pretty quick to level.
---
I used to think I would do mage then paladin, but now I don't know!  I want all the classes and all the professions!
---
In a few months we'll be back to having full action bars of very situational spells &lt;3
---
Keep that racist shit off here, thanks.
---
Just the world map for wowpedia i think
---
Unfortunately I had no choice but to book something or else I wouldn't have got anything with the way holidays work here.
---
I chose too early.
---
Luckily I've also got the first week of September off so not all is lost! Also got release day off as I'm not contracted Tuesdays.
---
Lol what?
---
This was 100% true for cata for example.
---
Exactly! A large part of my dissatisfaction with the current game's story &amp; feeling is that the scope of everything is so far beyond what made the journey out of Elwynn seem impactful. Bandit gangs &amp; Orc incursions are insignificant when we're used to the major political powers fighting Titans with literal space ships. The 1-60 journey felt grounded in a world far larger than us but still full of problems we were capable of tackling ourselves.
---
Ah so you’ll JUST miss it? You’re time is at least off in August though so I guess you were pretty conservative with the dates, just a little too early.
---
Amen brother, fuck min/maxers
---
Hunter. Shaman is great in BGs and OK in wPvP, Hunter is great in BGs aswell (albeit a bit worse than Shaman I'd say, but Shamans thrive in a good group - you said solo) but outright amazing in wPvP
---
Salesmen sticking their foot into a person's door is a thing for a reason. It's not a fallacy. Once there is a prescient further changes can be made easier , much easier.
---
I would rather expectations be adjusted based on the limited supply rather than everyone expecting you to have everything all the time. 
---
Rather have certain extreme styles that diminish my enjoyment(like aoe farming quest mobs) have a reduced return on investment compared to questing like the rest of us are trying to do.
---
Rather things like the “devilsaur mafia” have less of a return on investment for the hours put into it.
---
Rather limit gold inflation since the amount of world generated gold outside of instances will be much reduced. 
---
Just to name a few things
---
It is rarely discussed but what about going herb/alchemy and making troll blood potions?
---
Hopefully you can at least land yourself a beta key so you’ll still have some classic to play over your first vacation if that’s something you’d like.
---
If shards are large enough they act like Layers, like whole regions for instance.
---
Really depends how they implement it
---
Stronger itemization and cleaner talent revamp
---
Yeah I havent been refreshing AS MUCH but Im still refreshing lol. Now Im watching Asmon get every single question wrong about vanilla trivia.

Soloing is slow as Warrior, especially before 30/WW Axe. Groups are going to expect you to tank as you are simply the best class for that and it will make everyone's run easier. If they have a warrior or paladin tank, that person isn't going to want to take you as dps simply because you compete for their gear. 
---
I'd suggest Rogue or Hunter for pure dps as you don't sound like you want to be a caster dps.  All classes are expected to do some roles in dungeons. Even as rogue or hunter expect to be asked to trap, sap, pet tank, etc.  This is an innate part of any mmorpg though.
---
My best suggestion is probably Hunter. They have relatively good dps until very late game, good utility, very easy soloing, and if all you do in a group is sit back and use your mana to dps and auto-shot most groups will be fine with that.
---
I just picked this up for $5 from a used bookstore about a week ago!
---
Here’s to hoping you can get into the beta at least and still grind some levels out. :)
---
That's perfect! The only issue I'd have is tabbing out of the porn I'm watching only to see Thicc Boi Ragnaros beckoning. 
---
Actually maybe that isn't an issue at all...
---
What does that have to do with twitch?
---
Hunters are great in PvP though, don't let their fairly poor PvE scaling in the very endgame fool you.
---
You subscribe to the live game, you don't need to buy BfA. Get your facts straight before you go on a rant.
---
he hit level 33 and quit like 90% of people will
---
Tanking 5 mans paladins can do if you gear correctly.  You will need mana regen rather than lots of defensive stats. I wouldn't even bother defense capping
---
To use an old Canadian quote: "Income Tax was sold to the public as a temporary measure."
---
You are the one putting words in Ion's mouth when you say that he drew a very hard line at thorium veins. Ion literally gave you a caveat after talking about resource scarcity: They are looking at tech like sharding that prevents zones from being overrun. He did mention Valley of Trials and Elwynn specifically, but he did not limit to these zones in any way.
---
The hard line he did draw was Kazzak and he is sticking to that one, even with layering.
---
It's not the layering that will Ruin PVP battles in your eyes. It is the individuals choosing to escape to other layers that will ruin it. Remember their names. Shame them or something.
---
Mature pvp servers are a nightmare for leveling. Having aq40 geared players wiping out quest givers, ganking you over and over in stv, it gets old.
---
Ion also said earlier in the development cycle that a phasing system would only be implemented in the starter zones, now they're being applied to entire continents. So tell me, why are you taking his word for gospel truth?
---
Luckily my payroll lady let me wait longer then most are allowed to book time off. September 1-17 I'll be deep in Azeroth :)
---
Just think of downranks as their own unique healing spell.  Mana is a lot more precious in Vanilla (infinitely so in comparison to WotLK where you couldn't run out of mana on some classes even if you used every CGD to cast.), so, if Healing Touch Rank 5 heals for 1k and costs 300 mana, but Healing Touch rank 4 heals for 700 and costs 100 mana, and your target is at 500 health missing, it only makes sense to cast the Rank 4 heal and save mana.
---
IIRC sap breaks stealth without talents in it, and traps can’t be set while in combat. You had to feign death and quickly set it. Also no trap launcher, it’s just set at your feet.
---
I honestly don't care about layering in the least.
---
I never argued it didn't exist, your strawman is weak, but it IS going to be more prevalent this time around
---
If I get to try the stress test, I'll be able to be sure then
---
I suppose I could then shift rogue to the Warlock/Shaman group then I'd be able to go 2/2/3 for leveling. Not a bad idea! Thanks :)
---
I'm so excited to just level a suite of characters slowly since I'm a bit too busy to raid/gear characters at max.
---
nah
---
The dungeon guide's true value is a list of all the quests for each dungeon.
---
I'm not a mod
---
&gt;Molten core and Onyxia and the level phase are huge phases
---
Literally 1 phase, appropriately called "Phase 1."
---
I have my dungeon guide, atlas, and Vanilla instruction manual ready to go.
---
Welcome to classic. Its def more of a concern on druid as they are really mana inefficient. You get used to the downrank stuff pretty quick though. Just watch some old videos or find some posts from 2006 or so about which ranks to use and when
---
Some people have to request vacation at the start of their fiscal year or else they lose their vacation days. I agree on your point of it being best to wait though.
---
lol....
---
Man I feel this for sure. My brother and I shared an account and being the younger brother he got priority, but that time spent watching him play his Troll Shaman and just hanging out made some of the best memories. 
---
We drifted apart for quite some time due to reasons and with the announcement of Classic, I recovered our old account and sent him screenshots of all our old characters. Spent a good while on the phone reminiscing and it was a great time.
---
This sub gets upset about everything.
---
How you gonna survive the vanilla environment?
---
Yeah I don‘t think Classic will be too interesting for most streamers‘ audience. It‘s way too slow paced and you as a player have to be really involved. So most streamers would be losing viewers playing Classic. I figure they‘ll abandon the game for something more suitable for mainstream audiences quite quick tbh
---
It's really more on Blizzards part for not having more clear information.
---
It's been really hard to focus today and I assume it's just as frustrating for the streamers as for us.
---
Yeah, those were the 3 I was considering the most. Probably Warlock &gt; Hunter &gt; Mage for me in terms of preference. Thanks for the input
---
Depends on the situation. Most likely you are tank healing and wont have much time to use other abilities besides judgment. Which due to the debuf limit they may or may not allow light or wisdom or crusader
---
Yup...
---
Good thing it goes live in 7 minutes though. /s
---
Using Sap breaks stealth baseline, you can talent it in sub to make have up to a 90% chance of staying in stealth.  
---
Traps need to be used out of combat.
---
Actually you don't have to double-click anymore
---
Most people did wsg yet it thrives. That's because there's incentive whereas dishonor kills and no world PvP rewards worth mentioning is the opposite. It deters world PvP when bgs release. I didn't like it then as it first happened
---
I mean, you literally can fly away. They haven't killed the flight master yet.
---
&gt; Better off to wait a few days, when all the poopsockers are back to work.
---
You mean when all the poopsockers are 60?
---
Everyone loves shamans - so Im pretty sure you wont have any trouble finding groups. I would go orc just because of stun resist for pvp.
---
for a few weeks.
---
Wow nice so you got a full 2 weeks right after any login issues should be resolved!
---
Joana will have a good guide soon. Maybe today on his website
---
&gt;  although I heard that the class wasnt THAT useful in endgame raiding. I'm not sure it matters
---
Hunters get picked for raids just fine. They're very unlikely to be top DPS (that's generally Fury Warriors or Rogues), but nevertheless they get used. Don't have to worry there. 
---
&gt; (and not spamming 1 button for 8 minutes)
---
Vanilla didn't really have very complex rotations for raiding, regardless of class. Hunter's roughly comes down to Aimed shot &gt; Auto Shot &gt; Multi Shot &gt; Auto Shot. Get an attack timer addon because weaving in auto shots is very important. The actual rotation (or cycle) varies on your (cross)bow attack speed. Doesn't sound very complex? It isn't, but that's just vanilla for you. Mage and Warlock is definitely not what you want to go for if raid rotation matters a lot to you as that is exactly spamming 1 ability for the most part (but if you care less, they both easily get picked for raid DPS). 
---
Rogue is a bit more involved as well, mainly because you have 100 energy and regen 20 every 2 seconds. Opener aside, in raids you'll probably be sword combat spec and it's mostly about building up combo points with Sinister Strike until you Eviscerate while keeping a 100% uptime on Slice and Dice. If your guild is fine with you using debuff slots, you might end up using Garrote and Rapture as well. 
---
Druid's the oddball here. Most Druids will end up healing. If you're good with that, you'll be set. Some Druids will end up as an off-tank but this is very guild-specific. Definitely possible. The feral DPS rotation is quite unique if you ever end up doing that, lot of power shifting. 
---
For dungeons they all get to do a lot more (main thing that keeps these rotations simple is debuff slots in raids or in the case of mages resistances from mobs etc). Mages, Rogues and Hunters bring solid crowd control that all dungeon groups will love. Druids can do DPS/tank/heal with 1 leveling spec. 
---
They're all amazing and different choices for PvP.
---
I actually think layering is a nice compromise between sharding and just nothing at all.
---
Because let's face it. Launch week will be a cluster fuck. And the *absolute* purists are saying "I'LL TAKE A DAYS WORTH OF LAG BEFORE I SUPPORT SHARDING! NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY ON LAUNCH DAY IS PART OF THE EXPERIENCE" are just... I don't even know where to start with that.
---
**Not being able to play shouldn't be a feature.**
---
Layering is similar to channels like in other MMOs. Everyone is on the same server still, just on a different channel that we can freely hop between. Now this isn't the case with Classic, and that's ok, since the channels are going to be merged once the world gets settled in.
---
Some die hard fans might be able to tolerate it being that way, but others will not. They want classic to succeed but it will have a hard time doing that with issues such as that.
---
Its a temporary evil and I wish others would at least give it a chance for the health of it long term.
---
Nope, I didn't take any time off work so far for the game and I don't intend to.
---
I'm not even sure I'll play day 1, it'll be total madness.
---

---
Hello, it appears you tried to put a link in a title, since most users cant click these I have placed it here for you
---
^I ^am ^a ^bot ^if ^you ^have ^any ^suggestions ^dm ^me
---
Mottled Red was better, but yes, dream dead :(
---
They literally said they’ll combine the layers regardless of population.
---
I can see them offering free transfers if, after they remove layering, the population on any specific server is still too high after Phase 1 instead of breaking their promise of no layering after Phase 1.
---
Did they even change anything to make it harder? IIRC I was doing +8s on Month 2 in nothing better then Mythic reg gear.
---
I mean, the people streaming the game are a pretty good source.
---
You phrase that like a 10 year old is equally capable of making just as good of a choice as someone who is 20. 
---
Sure, the brain might not be done developing until 27-28 (supposedly) but I feel by age 18 you’re capable of making good decisions. Not the best, but good choices nonetheless. 
---
I think I found the kind of person us kids don’t want around in our fantasy role playing game.
---
Priest healing 100% both PVE and PVP.
---
\^this. So much this!
---
Twitch streaming is cancerous
---
So stoked. Any news about pvp servers, things like this?
---
Welp, that's a shame. Sorry to all those who are subbing purely for a chance at an invite and don't get one.
---
Lots of people who were there from the beginning want to play again but without 7 hour queues.  I am willing to make a small sacrifice to the "community" to have that happen in August.  By the time most people quit playing classic there will be no layers and it will be fine.
---
Are you cuuuuuuuuuuu cause you post a lot like cuuuuuuuuuu. Layering will be fine.
---
Sorry about your loss. He will indeed be watching you play this time around.
---
Uhhhh... Blizzard literally said in their [Announcement post](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule):
---
The only thing the streamers (or anyone else for that matter except Blizzard themselves) don't know is the TIME OF DAY which the beta will go live.
---
The idea of a dead server comes from the private server Community, where players call a server dead when it feels like they're not surrounded by countless faceless strangers.
---
It's pretty silly.
---
Pat PvP... Ahhh yes.
---
Yup, good choice. If you're dead set on Troll visuals go for it, but for PvP (where it matters the most) you'll miss out on two top tier racials (Troll doesn't really bring anything at all there, unfortunately). Hardiness (Orc stun resist) is insane. Warstomp from Tauren can be great to confirm a heal or chain lightning.
---
Hunters couldn't (auto) shoot while moving until Cata
---
Thanks all for the insight. I want to roll paladin (my classic toon was a shaman, so kinda related I guess) but the idea of JUST being a healbot isnt super appealing. But if I can be active in dungeons and use my raiding as a way to get prepared for PVPing, then I can accept that role I think.
---
Well got 4 weeks vacation so still got 2weeks to play
---
They have already said that there is no way layers will stay passed phase 1. If more people stick with the game that’s great for the playerbase and just trust that the classic team will find a way to work it out without screwing the players over. In the meantime find some friends to play with or a guild. If you’re in a “bad” layer you can always party up into a more active one.
---
Damn. This hurts my druid feelings. I guess ill just heal and maybe try feral around aq.
---
What about Seasonal WoW
---
If you only want an alt for farming purposes, you might want to do the math on how many hours it takes to level the alt, versus the amount of gold you'd make if you spent that time farming. Even as a Warrior.
---
If you want an alt anyway, then by all means go for it. Hunters, then mages are the fastest gold farmers. Crafting isn't really a great money-making method and you could just do it on your main anyway.
---
&gt;	be me, level 12 night elf hunter
---
&gt;	3,000 people in layer 1 having time of their lives
---
&gt;	haven’t seen anybody yet, am i logged in a private server?
---
&gt;	mfw when 3,001st player, all alone layer 2
---
Good bot.
---
Yep.
---
I mean, their helpful hints like, "You should bring a tank to this dungeon" aren't there to do much more than pad out the page count...
---
[5 hours 8 mins](https://imgur.com/a/nSUUf13)
---
I remember buying a book that looked almost exactly the same back when WoW was released (but it showed a female NE IIRC). It actually praised Paladins  fast leveling speed &amp; DPS using Crusader Strike ... man was I pissed when they removed it early on, only to re-introduce it with TBC.
---
And all the plebs were like "OMG paladin active damage ability, iNbA!"And I was like: you cheeky little bastards ...
---
I’m worried Blizz will underestimate the lasting concurrent population numbers, and they won’t peter off as much as they think it will. So either we have too high populations, or long queues. But those are both better and more likely options than extended layering.
---
No one knows. I don't think anyone has actually gotten an invite yet.
---
imagine there's a park that nobody uses, it's overgrown and there's trash everywhere.
---
one day some people decide the park could be a good place to play soccer, so they go and clean it all up and set up a field.
---
the next day the park is taken over by garage sellers.  let people use the park how they want to?
---
Fair enough.
---
Lets say 6521 people are logging in and you get lucky enough be 1 of 21 with crazy easy nodes, rares and chests or unlucky enough to never see anyone else?
---
They obviously do it to bait views. Where you born yesterday? Thats why people use click-bait titles as well, it gets views.
---
Still despicable behavior. But I would love to live life with rose-colored goggles like you. Makes the world seem so much nicer when you ignore what people really are.
---
Yeah it's clearly him. They must've banned his other account so he's circumventing. So to him I say QQ PVP server
---
A pserver fake video? No thanks.
---
I understand a lot of the general blizzard hate lately but the classic team in general has been doing s fantastic job. I trust that they will keep their word and layers will not last past p1.
---
Lolwut. I never used the word starving, and he didn't just say lower his food budget, he said he would be sacrificing whole meals not just meal prepping instead of going out to eat, for example.
---
They mean the hat. Lol
---
Wouldn't be a problem without layers in the first place.
---
So I genuinely try to help out and Reddit downvotes me. Makes sense!
---
No information on servers yet, but undoubtedly PvP servers will be a thing (it's the most demanded server type by all accounts). RP-PvP is the only one I wouldn't necessarily count on, but PvE and PvP absolutely will be.
---
How to make me avoid the wow section on twitch starter pack
---
Lol. Imagine being triggered over words
---
? You can obviously who people on your server, thats just retarded of you to believe otherwise. You have no idea what layer people are using /who though.
---
And my first half is not assuming anything. I am just telling you there is a possibility
---
you can easily avoid reverse search by modifying the image a bit
---
My wife asked if I was going to wait a couple days to let the lag and queues clear, or if I was going  for the authentic launch experience. 
---
Think I might just work from home. Porqueno los dos?  :D
---
So what happens then, ques?
---
Is there any way to find the stat weights that are presumably used to calculate these BiS lists? Reason is that I think this site is great for finding the best item or two per phase, but I would like to enter the stat weights into Wowhead so I can search for instance the top 50 items per slot instead of the top 2.
---
My second choice is actually a female Orc. I really enjoy their looks. 
---
But this would be the first time I play female and I'm not sure how much I will like it later down the road. Thanks for the input!
---
Yeah, I was thinking the same and was heavily inclined to Hunter. But do we go NE, Dwarf or Tauren? Can we actually do sick stuff with Warstomp? Cows are awesome and their region is amazing (unlike other horde desert areas :/ )
---
“If that means queues, then yes”
---
I see. I think imma go for rogue even tho there will be a lot of rogues, because u/Stephanie-rara said that I should look for the class and not the spec. So I've been watching some videos about rogue and it seems fun and all that.
---
Maybe if when the time comes I don't like rogue as much as I expected, I'll try hunter first for sure.
---
Thank you for helping me decide!
---
Lol, that looks like you guys grabbed flag and farmed groups for 5 hours.
---
Stab brain with dagger, it has betrayed you.
---
Damn your post made me tear up. RIP
---
&gt; or don't want want someone else to have it
---
This right here. Does anyone else remember when whitehouse.com used to take you to a porn site? Like, 15 years ago? 
---
Or shit even modern JoeBiden.info
---
From a different perspective, the game got royally fucked up by TBC -- and I would instantly quit if they decided to just rehash all the mistakes made by the expansion.
---
So in personal bias, I would much rather they add "vanilla+" content at level 60 with horizontal content to no obsolete or make irrelevent current content than the proposal of "lets just play TBC again" if given the choice in direction for the future.
---
Its hard to reason with the #NOCHANGES REEEEEEEEEEE gang that this guy is a part of. They dont know what irony is.
---
My guess is that he is not joking...
---
I recall shamans lightening ranks had varying dmg, cast time, and mana cost per rank. Higher ranks took longer to cast and were more expensive. So dont quote me on this but heals could be the same way. 
---
But also consider your gear as you rank up at 60. You'll have spell power to offset selecting a lower rank heal thinking it's too weak when it wont be.
---
 I remember in tbc overhealing was a thing to think about but as a pally in t5 I was able to ignore it. Then as a class as a whole I could in wrath at any lvl or tier. I was a HC rading in cata and I remember t11 in blues weeks after launch and mana management. So I'm personally gunna put myself back in that mindset of prioritising heals on targets and memorizing ranks heal amount and hotkey each to mouse.
---
Hey, thanks for your answer. I've decided I'm probably going to play rogue. Have a good one!
---
You pay for playing retail game - not access to beta. No one cares that you don't wanna play BfA. Talking about scam is ridiculous in this case, you know? Stop moaning and wait until 27th August
---
I was on Illidan to start. The server had large queues and when the option to transfer to a new server came up, our guild had a vote. We voted to stay on Illidan but more than a few people took it upon themselves to transfer to Stonemaul and since server transfers were permanent, we all ended up transferring there.
---
Sharding and Layering are about as similar as Gravy and Chocolate you gronk. You didn’t shut him down; you made yourself look like a dickhead..
---
I’ll save you the need to respond: I am a blizzcuck. PS. You speak like a teenager.
---
Better quality gameplay than 15 years ago when people had absolutely no idea how to play the game anywhere near its skill cap.  
---
Enjoy your BiG yElLoW nUmBeRs though.
---
If joining parties allows you to pick layers will it force solo people randomly out?
---
What people want now and what they want in a year or two may be vastly different. We haven't had any persistent vanilla servers for long term to see if they are even feasible. P Servers are not remotely similar with their limited shelf life before being shut down and starting anew over and over.
---
If a stagnant classic server leads to heavy population drops I guarantee the classic enthusiasts will start asking for new content themselves. An MMO without the pop to support it is garbage.
---
Most of you guys are so cynical lmao
---
Makes sense. I'll have to adapt I guess. Thank you for helping!
---
Maybe they are already playing instead of redditting ^_^
---
Pretty sure most other mechanics will still have dynamic ticks.
---
Woops I'm in a different layer.
---
Oh shit that's right! Damn it's been too long
---
Thanks but I don't have my hopes up since I do not have an active sub and my account was only created when the demo released. The opt-in is ticked at least.
---
And if everyone rolls on a low pop realm, what kind of realm will it then be?
---
That’s right, a high pop realm. 
---
I swear this planet’s getting dumber by the day.
---
why so streamers act like billy big bollocks when they have more info on a game than you. Why can't they just be normal about it.
---
Over a hat with words on it said by bad orange man though!!!
---
It most certainly will increase the amount of herbs mines gold etc in the world for sure. But it's all relative. If you have 6k players instead of 3k thats double the farmers and consumers of said farming mats etc.  
---
It's not like the other 2 layers aren't going to be purchasing just as much as they'll be selling. Why is it you take into account the extra resources, but you don't take into account the extra consumption at the same time?
---
The ultimate scrub..
---
im interested in this, can i DM you with some questions?
---
damn you were willing to provide $40/hour for THREE MONTHS? 
---
what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?
---
Well he wasnt wrong. He just omitted the part where soloing sucks balls
---
First off this is a completely trash example and not actually representative of the layer/realm situation. Secondly, you don’t tell random people who have friends at a different park that they have to go play on the small soccer team if they don’t want to.
---
More like she couldn't be found for comment. XD
---
Yes it is still pretty much the same if i recall awesome zone
---
REEEEEE cry more about a joke hat that's actually at the expense of the original MAGA hat, you guys will cry over anything.
---
Theres a difference between a packed starter zone (30?) And an impossible starter zone (500+).
---
Flamdar is correct. It does not specifically say you need to have an active sub in order to be *invited* only that you need one to be able to 'participate'. The invite could be sent out asking the invitees to sub in order to activate their invitation.
---
My heart
---
I dont understand why people watch other people play video games, i should invent a website called crank where people can watch others watch porn. There has to be a market for it.
---
The way it’s been described a layer naturally can hold a certain amount of people but that amount can be exceeded by invites. So in theory you could invite thousands of people into a single layer temporarily.
---
*many high pop realms*
---
instead of the just 1 per type we're about to get
---
I hit 60 in Nost the day of its shut down =(
---
I played on a decently balanced, high pop realm though.
---
Indeed this zone was also ruined after Cata / MoP
---
Maybe for you. I recently bought it (after missing Legion) and I kinda like it. Zones are fucking beautiful, music is amazing in some zones (Boralus with the sailor songs!), dungeons are gorgeous in terms of art and design. As I don't care about "endgame" anymore I spend my time pvping, farming transmog and mounts in expansions I missed (which is the true endgame, cause it stays with your through expansions), hunting rare pets with my hunter and just messing around. And I didn't even touch Horde side of the story and quests, so there's more fun to be had with my original Vanilla tauren shaman
---
Are people actually streaming wow classic though? Some of the titles are misleading but I dont see anyone playing it yet.
---
No, they absolutely do not. There is no overarching plot like in later expansions. Its a bunch of stories, that is, quest chains that are mostly unrelated.
---
This isn’t something that I have seen discussed by the dev team but I would expect it to work in a way similar to how sharding works in retail which would have the answer of “no” as far as I’m aware.
---
Spiffworld iirc, so many good videos
---
Insert ["wow there's so much hate lol streamers are literal gods how dare you question their holiness"] response here
---
Like damn I like some streamers but not when they vomit clickbait or drama instead of actually contributing something
---
All realms will be low pop at launch.  But if you want to wait a few months to play so you can find an established low pop realm, go for it.
---
Because I'm at work and can't play right now?
---
If 30,000 roll on ten low pop realms, though...
---
There's a point when a realm is no longer low pop. It's kinda looking like you're part of the problem. 😂
---
Oh nice, so you’ll still have a decent chunk of time to play. :)
---
I played on illidan from vanilla to mop when I quit. Good times.
---
Sad
---
You are understating the issue, MC is also at its nerfed naxx version with 1.12 talents, nerds that occurred throughout vanilla, and itemization.
---
It would be more numerically authentic to buff MC until later raids come out.
---
I will take that bet, whats the wager? I have complete trust in these devs. They seem to be really passionate and seem to really listen to our feedback, there is no way they keep them in forever.
---
Well i'm definitely not going to pay for a subscription just to get the "chance" to participate in a beta. I still want to see how the classic beta looks though so i'm going to watch streams.
---
God what an annoying voice.
---
clearly they came to a better solution to their problem that they either were not aware of at the time or didnt think it would work.
---
&gt;for nearly 2 months of leveling.  
---
Its alright, i started in Burning Crusade and leveled as a Prot Paladin.. it was the longest grind ever.. then right before wrath they got a huge buff and were playable. i had no idea how much easier the game was supposed to be if you werent handicapping yourself.
---
Well, age-bracketed servers have certainly also been on the list of things people have been requesting from Blizzard for the last 15 years. Perhaps they will make both our dreams come true.
---
Well for many dungeons like Temple, BFD &amp;  the shitty dungeons in Barrens this thing was G-O-L-D-E-N! Had actual maps of them in it leading the way lol
---
Esfrand was told to be ready at a certaint time. They had a range of time that the beta would start and was streaming for it
---
It appears blizzards range was incorrect
---
This is very sweet :) Just remember, everything in moderation, even World of Warcraft!
---
Its despicable to hype your video in the title? In an era where people gloss over unappealing titles? What's malicious about it, if the video is about what the title claims? 
---
It crosses the line when the title is heavily suggestive of a hot topic, that they have no new information about or use a small portion of their stream/video to talk about.
---
Baiting is the absolute basis of advertisement, it's only despicable if its falsely advertised
---
yeah it is.  everybody fought for vanilla wow.  we're about to get a mega-realm with features like server hopping and no real community, not anything like vanilla wow.
---
u cleaned up a park, ur about to get a garage sale.
---
sure there's other parks, but this was the only park that was between all your frriends houses, you can't all get to the other parks which means you don't have enough people to play a game.  u could have had a dozen soccer games, one at each park, but because everybody's at the garage sale they won't go play soccer
---
I'm just watching to see if the beta is open yet. Holding out that hope that I'll get in too.
---
They have shown already they are taking a much different aproach to Classic then they have for BFA. One of the ways theyve shown that is by already listening to feedback.
---
Yes, so at best you can do them one by one. Then dogs, then maybe a mining node if it spawns. Not really fast unless you need rep or some rep items from there.
---
Yeah but then we would have lots of other, worse problems. Honestly at this point IDC what Blizzard decides to do because people will be pissed regardless.
---
My older brother and I used to bond in much the same way, just not over WoW. You’ve really inspired me to reach out and make sure he’s doing well. Thanks OP, hopefully I see you in Azeroth one day soon 💙
---
Then what is the point?!
---
Thank you for reminding me. For a sec I kind of agreed with the poster, and then I remember the feeling of defeat and frustration.
---
Huh? He explicitly says he’ll still be eating, just beans, rice and ramen instead of ‘real food’
---
Taking the last week of august off was a good move.
---
brilliant
---
I know you said class, but did warrior have any (other than prot tanking)?
---
Resist the FOMO. Liberate yourself. You'll get your turn.
---
Honestly I’m super surprised that first post got so high, it’s all wrong
---
oh.... so i'm not the only one that renewed a 5 year old account and signed up for Beta?
---
And it's over in phase 1. Phase 1 will likely be 2 months. Hilarious.
---
Content creators are going to abandon this so fast.
---
It'll be the same with Classic. You don't think that layers will put you with 5 other players, do you? Layers will have something like 100 players per zone, I'm sure about that. So you'll see that competition.
---
Yeah, sorry, not going to fall for the tired "just a joke bro" line.
---
Allow me to be your first:P Its not necessarily that I enjoyed that but I do enjoy the tedious struggles because struggle adds appreciation and gives a sense of reward even in the smallest things. Even if its fighting for mob-tags and itemspawns. 
---
Its also just temporary overcrowded for launch anyway so Id rather have that super competitive tedious alive feeling than dynamic spawns that are iffy with nodes and shit in the future.
---
I don’t understand why a lot of people like doing stuff I don’t like but hey that’s part of what makes life fun. I enjoy twitch
---
Can we all pretend that we know there are ways to move unit frames?
---
rip
---
I'm playing subtlety rogue simply because of nostalgia. My first character :)
---
those won't exist anymore.  your choices are low pop or mega-realm.
---
Ally has no flight point in northern stv, that was added in tbc
---
&gt; Why do you think they are letting streamers release the info secondhand? Why do their official posts have bare minimum info, then we get the rest from one off dev interviews. Because it reduces their liability to not state things officially. They are more free to change their minds
---
This info is literally coming from them. This isnt like some article that the streamers wrote. It is videos of the devs speaking about it.
---
I don't think they would, and I can almost promise that blizz wouldn't want to make those changes lol, a healthy pop = more fun, a fellow vanilla boi should know that
---
Human mage or dwarf hunter for pvp? I will only play those race/class combos
---
Can't decide between 'Lock and Hunter. 
---
Mostly BGs and wpvp but will be raiding a few nights a week. How dependant is a hunter on their weapon in pvp, is Rhok'delar then Ashjrethul a must?
---
Can you level a warlock just wanding behind a voidwalker similar to levelling a BM hunter just auto shooting? I work from home so this would save me so much time haha.
---
Could you explain how your wage system works a bit? As an American minimum wage come in an hourly form. You work 40 hours a week for a full time job with minimum wage being $7.25/hr. The Sub is 15$/month. Do you get a weekly salary as a standard? For example your 135 euros would be the same as 40/hr *40=$290/week. And most companies pay their employees bi weekly here.
---
good luck everybody \*pray\*
---
I'm a huge sucker and just bought BFA and a one month sub. I have had my account since the battleground patch in vanilla (1.5?) so I am hoping they will take that into account haha. I got into the sc2 beta and HOTS beta so maybe blizzard likes me for some reason?
---
Don't know.
---
Loneliness has its perks, but to friends, family and coworkers most people take vacations around that time anyway. If anyone asks what I did I can just as easily say 'housework' if I want to avoid saying I was playing WoW the entire time.
---
The 135euros are per month
---
I want #nochanges. So, servers better be crashing and I better be getting comp time.
---
Calm down Elon Musk!
---
That was exactly my thought. Hopefully the usual server hiccups at the start will iron themselves out after a few days.
---
I had a pally named chuckknoris
---
I agree with you that the majority of players won't notice or care. But that doesn't mean it doesn't impact them tremendously.
---
I also agree that it is a good thing this is temporary (the shorter the better - I fear it will be in place all of phase 1 which would be very disappointing for many reasons).
---
However I don't think this prevents server merges. That will happen down the line as server pop dwindles. It's unavoidable. So this really doesn't solve that problem. I also don't think server merges are as awful as you say. I mean - you're still around trying to play the game aren't you?
---
To answer your final question: I don't think there is a point where it stops being okay. It's a sandbox MMO - go do something else in the world to gain experience. Group up with people. Go fishing. There are lots of solutions to this non-problem.
---
What streams r u watching
---
all of the realms will be low pop in a few months, except 1
---
Rip Brian peppers
---
Yeah, that's the hardest part because it's based on such an unknown.  However, if it gets to the point where Phase 2 is about to launch and the server pop is still like 7k, I believe at that point they'd just say "to hell with it" and let it be a massively overpopulated server.  Even go back to queue times if necessary, as well as offering free transfers off of that realm.
---
2 in 20,000 (guess) vs 1 in 20,000? Is that worth $15 to you?
---
The joy of PvP for me is that it does not require structure. Whenever I want to pop in for 20 minutes or an hour to do BGs I can. I don't have to wait until 8PM and hope enough people show up, then feel tethered to my computer for 2 or 3 hours.
---
hahaha juicy did not know this
---
Want
---
Vanilla WoW is the story.
---
This seems nice but it's not.  This game is entertainment. If someone is unable to afford the fee to play they don't need to play. They need to be doing other productive things until they have enough disposable income to afford it. Don't enable people to be lazy.
---
Each class misses major improvements I think. (Don’t quote me 🤷🏻‍♂️)
---
As a shadow priest, even in tbc we gained shadow word: death and vampiric touch. 
---
Didn’t play wotlk or beyond bar a week here and there
---
One of the big issues with layering I don't think they've addressed is how populations will be balanced on them.  
---
Presumably if there is less than 3k players, say, 2k there will be no layering.  But what about when we hit 4K.
---
Does that mean 1 layer with 3k and one with 1k?  Will they split the people up from the initial 3k and balance the 2 layers out to 2k/2k?
---
They've said dynamic, but they haven't said how it will be balanced.  Seems like if they balance it dynamically by splitting there is none of the consistency people claim will be present.  On the other hand if they balance it to only create a new layer for players (N+1) and beyond, aren't those players getting a windfall by essentially being on a completely underpopulated realm for the purpose of farming/grinding?
---
It just seems unhealthy and unfortunate that someone has to make those decisions. But youre right, I don't understand it from my perspective.
---
10 realms with 3k players &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 realm with 30k players
---
But it’s not classic or vanilla, shouldn’t even be posted here.  He posted a video of vanilla saying its the best from vanilla, he wasn’t asking for comments on awful pserver videos.
---
But I can get that in any game. Vanilla was the only time I could play a game and actually have a chance to know the people that I'm playing against. For me, it was the first step in community erosion.
---
I can't tell if this is /s or not
---
The devs have already said they are turning it off before some patch so no chance
---
auwtch ok good one ty hunter looked interesting for a bit but i feel like there will be a lot of them anyway.
---
My older brother played for a while. Instead of it bringing us closer together we just fought over who's turn it was to play lol. He eventually quit and then it was all mine.
---
I leveled a holy paladin recently on a private server. Its a breeze until 40 then youll notice it takes some time to down mobs but honestly it wasnt too bad at all. Im the type to do other things while playing so tabbing to other windows while auto-attacking was cake. Of course just keep your weapon relatively up to date.
---
I liked being holy because the utility of healing groups when needed and how ez it was regarding my survival-ability. One heal + autoattack, you can fight forever and take on multiple mobs without too much hassle. I ended up going holy/reckoning and had a relatively good time overall, just beware it can be a bit repetitive
---
What?  Lol dude you are so lost here.  Sharding and cross realm zones are two completely different systems.  They fix the exact opposite problem from one another.  Just because you can have sharding on and crz on at the same time does not make them one thing.  If I mix M&amp;Ms with pretzels that doesn’t mean M&amp;Ms are made of pretzels.  It just means I happen to mix them up when I wanted to.
---
Sharding has nothing to do with CRZ
---
Its disgusting
---
Early on because of low mp5 you're gonna have a bad time if you use high rank spells all the time and you'll also overheal which is bad. But by the time you have BWL gear you shouldn't really have problems with mana but you should still use low rank spells because they have lower cast times.
---
Vanilla raids actually look at healer overheal statistics and name and shame the healers who have high amount of overhealing. You would start up a heal and cancel it if the tank didn't need heals and start casting a heal again, rince and repeat.
---
The concept of down ranking is to get more bang for your buck.  You don't really want to over-heal and waste mana so you want to down rank, but also (depending on the rank) you can get the full benefit of your +healing gear.  So say a certain rank heals for 1K base, and you have +300 healing it'll heal for 1300 at about 300 mana.   But another rank heals for 700, so 1000 after your +healing.  But It only costs 200 mana.  You can now cast 3 of the lower rank for 3K healing, or 2 of the higher rank for 2600 healing, at the same mana cost.
---
That is a general idea and made up numbers for the example of course.  But the concept is you get more for your limited mana pool. Yes in an "oh shit" moment you may want to cast the big 2.5K heal for a ton of mana but that's more for a 5 man where you are the sole healer.  In a raid environment you'll have other healers too so you'll want to preserve your mana but keep everyone healed so that you can heal for longer fights.

Locks level mostly by just dotting and wanding, its pretty simple.

Because its English only. We get fucked on like 99% of special editions because of our language laws.

yeah this is the kind of info i was looking for, so no tools to get out of cc without trinket/racial?
---
I want to bet you are a permanently salty contrarian nerd who will never be happy with anything Blizzard does no matter what because it would ruin your elite contrarian status that you depend on to feel special and feel like you are more intelligent than the "normies"
---
There are plenty of skillful players around. 
---
Many just don't give a shit about streams.
---
and if we don't actively try and convince people to spread out, we're just going to get the bad result...
---
Imagine paying for a $15 lootbox
---
Staysafe and tips "contacts" were saying on the hour every hour.
---
Guys, guys, guys, if we get 10 twitch prime subs right now my contact said it would start. 1 in the chat if you believe this is legit guys. no joke guys he just text me right now, yeah yeah 10 subs.
---
Fuck that grab some buddies and defend the King! FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
I dont understand why the fuck Blizzard feels the need to advertise a fucking game thats already been out, it's not like any of Asmondgolds window lickers hasnt been aware of Classic for a fucking while now, this has to be as dumb as advertising this new game called soccer in Brazil, hope they get some new people interested!
---
I totally agree with this post! Sure, sharding have it's drawback, and in a perfect world, only "dedicated" classic players will be present at launch. That's not the case. I know that, you know that, Blizzard knows that. So, what are our options besides layers? A complete lottery regarding if you picked a "dedicated" realm or a "tourist realm"? Sure, layering will probably have it's drawbacks and possibilities for exploits and what not, but if we take one step out of the fantasy-world of #absolutleynochangeswhatsoever and into the real world, I can't think of a better way of catering to all the needs of different player demographics.
---
**TL;DR:** Layering might have it's drawbacks, but it's the best solution on the table.
---
No one wants to stoop down to your level of intelligence and explain it to you.
---
When you were told you were wrong, and why, you make the completely logical conclusion that everyone must be shilling. I can’t even imagine the thought process behind that when there’s like 6 posts on the frontpage explaining to you in detail why you’re wrong.
---
well, they are on twitch.
---
There is a class color functionality some of the youtubers said that you can do it
---
Bingo.
---
No one understands slippery slopes, nor does anyone understand Activision here.
---
I seen one streamer baiting people to drop there Amazon Prime sub for a non existent beta key.
---
Ignoring the park example because it is not helpful to this discussion. Some people want to play on RP realms, some PvP, some normal, and others want to play on RP-PVP, there won’t be one mega sever because not everyone wants the same experience from their server. But mainly, wow is a social game and you’re trying to push the idea of having a community. Most people do not play WoW solo, most people have a group of friends who have other friends or a guild that they want to all be on the same server to play with. If everyone played solo sure it would be a little easier to tell everyone to pick a low pop server (which is still an insane request and not at all reasonable to ask for) but since the majority of players have groups that they want to play with it’s not at all something that you can expect from anyone. People are going to choose to play where their friends are, and those friends are going to choose where their friends are. You aren’t going to have your group of 50 friends all wait and then role characters at the same time on a low pop server because everyone plays at different times. Someone is going to make a decision and the rest will follow suit over time.
---
This is a common theme in raiding life. My partner is a more hardcore raider than I am, but they have experienced this several times. It is not unusual for guilds to fall apart because just as they are getting somewhere with their gearing, the best geared members found a guild that was progressing faster. This causes the guild to stagnate and so other members jump ship, thinking things will be better elsewhere (it rarely is).
---
It makes me wonder what would happen if a guild was set up that just embraced its role as a gearing treadmill. By stating up front that you are basically a farm league for other guilds, you may in fact make your guild more stable.
---
Does anyone know of any guilds that have done this and how it went for them?
---
I have never run a guild and always thought that it seemed like a massive chore, but this has got me thinking...
---
Ah you're right, I need sleep. I still can't imagine making the game a priority over 'real' food but more power to him.

Are your work weeks based on 40 hours a week or more/less? Do you get paid the same even if you don't work all of the normal hours? like if you have a sick day or leave early for one reason or another?
---
They aren't removing the class color functionality. They said in an Tips interview that they are keeping it.
---
Idk man i live in switzerland so im fine.
---
Follow up: I think rhokdelar is one of the coolest weapons in the game and really want a Tauren hunter with one. How hard is it actually to get? I consider myself fairly skilled at the game but will it take me 30 corpse runs anyway?
---
You can take a portal up to tempest keep. Wouldn't be hard to redesign TBC for ground only..
---
Even if you are stuck on Layer2 of server x for all of phase 1.  You will still play with 95% of the same 3-4k people the whole time!
---
People calling this innovative is one of the biggest eye-roll things I have ever seen. When MMO's started coming out with Megaservers a decade ago this was the first thing they started doing, with subservers within a server where the overflow population would be put in a different "layer". 
---
There is not one advantage of layering over dynamic respawns.
---
Too on point
---
Don't expect to find any WoW players amongst people who earn less than 15 $ a month to be honest. Not only such salaries virtually do not exist in Europe/America/East Asia/Oceania (which are the zones covered by WoW services), but anybody who earns so little money shouldn't really play WoW in the first place, unless he's a goldseller and makes a profit out of it. This is going to be 99.9% scams.
---
I have to say, this sub has exploded over the past few months. Specifically, just the past two-ish weeks. What's it been, like a 10-20k member gain?
---
Dude idk if that's true, but either way; fuck this.
---
The rogue poison quest is going to be either that or beyond cancer having to wait 10 minutes for the bloody chest to respawn with hundreds and hundreds of rogues all trying to get it at the same time.
---
Oh another question I forgot to ask...I really want to heal dungeons while leveling but read that enhancement is the preferred leveling spec. Can I still heal dungeons as enhancement? At 60 I guess I would put my points into ele to heal pve/pvp?

That's not really feasible, I don't think.  I imagine there are massive chains of friends, I.E.  player A is friends with B and C,  B and C are friends also with D, and E and F and G respectively, and so on ad infinity.  I imagine there are very few people who wouldn't be connected via friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends.  Can't have them all on the same layer.

That seems a very specific and extreme example, but I suppose that person would be extremely lucky for the few weeks it takes for them to merge the layers post launch. 
---
Honestly it's not like this is going to be a long-term thing. It's quite short-term from everything they've stated.
---
The entire backlash is due to the belief that it's not a better system; that's what people are debating right now. What I'm trying to bring awareness to is that blizzard has reneged on old promises, and is already showing greedy behaviour (opening character creation for classic two weeks before its launch, like wtf why?). It's entirely possible that layering will exist through all phases of wow classic.
---
Just don't worry about beta, and wait for release.  nbd.
---
Warrior leveling is not that bad, I had a blast on private server. Everyone says how slow it is but I was pushing through content with ease. Even with 1h fury, people on the forums will mention how it has terrible hit...miss miss miss....i mean kinda, rng can be a pain, but overall it was nothing that would have made me not want to continue playing. So dont let that prevent you from rolling warrior, youll enjoy it.
---

---
Yeah the biggest phases of the game.
---
Literal community construction and 2/3rds of the community will be missing from the leveling process?
---
Blackrock mountain battles will be meh with 2/3rds of the population around us invisible. 
---
So yeah.. we'll be raiding, and we'll come out and there will be no one there. But in the other layer there will be 2 guilds there.
---

---
I think someone said it's at 6pm EST same time as release if that helps
---
Hey all, I'm having a crisis of decision making and don't really want to do what I did at launch which was alt jump for two months trying to figure out what I'm going to do.   I'm looking toward casual world leveling and Solo PVP and BG's (maybe with a group... I'm just a lot less hardcore than I was when I was in my 20's)
---
So at launch I mained a Combat Rogue and a Shadow Priest.   I really don't want to Rogue again.  But am not opposed to priest.   
---
I'm kind of on a:
---
-Shadow Priest again (I recall being pretty self sufficient)
---
-Hunter - which I tried a bit on a private server and also found self sufficient
---
-Holy Pally- as "plate priest" always seemed interesting.
---
So yeah, 3 wildly different classes but hopefully someone will have some insight.
---
This is the kind of stuff I am really looking forward to. I miss being able to equip things that aren't designed for your class, just because you can!
---
.... Chuck Norris who still evades capture... lol
---
Wait, what is the risk to blizzard?  That you might not join the beta?  Ok, so they invite someone else...
---
I'm sure they're not expecting a 100% response rate even among those with active subs, why would it matter if they send invites to people who cancelled their subs like, 6 months ago, and only some of them join?
---
They're all pretty boring, which are YOU watching?
---
If the only Scrabble worthy words you know are incongruent and congested, I gotta say, you're one dumb fucker.
---
Right I get watching it because we cant play it but I mean like after it's released, why watch when you can play? it's fucking weird to me, just the concept in general, not really judging.
---
On top of that things like Agi for melee while giving less AP than Str is a far better leveling stat. The amount of Str needed to reduce an average mob from say 10 weapon swings to kill it down to 9 is a lot. But the same amount of Agi will increase crit chance, more crits will randomly increase a mob down to say 7-9 swings.
---
They're not sending their best!  We're building a big beautiful wall, and the Orcs are going to pay for it!
---
See you on the other side, brothers.
---
No he drew it at world bosses AND thorium
---
it's a two minute clip
---
watch it
---
My pleasure :)
---
This is actually an idea i could get behind.  Streamsniping in Wow.
---
Delicious.
---
Cause its a beta and it is not a big deal.
---
Its funny because its true!
---
I don't understand why people watch other people play sports. I should invent a concept named football where people kick a ball around for 90 minutes and show it on TV. There has to be a market for it
---
Thanks for the kind words, so glad you’re enjoying the show!
---
"Still, I admit giving streamers access first is good for business but I still find it absolutely disgusting as a practice."
---
You are entitled to that opinion. No matter how retarded it may be.
---
Just type /camp
---
There’s a lot of valid criticism to throw at streaming and YouTube gaming culture, but “I don’t understand it” isn’t one.
---
Redridge if you are going horde
---
&gt; I always used max rank spells and never had mana problems as a Druid in WotLK
---
Well there you go, if you do that in classic you will go OOM. Overhealing is bad, and you're being less efficient. Overhealing is easy to understand, if someone is only missing 500 HP and you heal them for 1000 HP, you could have spent less mana, cast a weaker version of the spell and only healed 500 HP. Boom, you are using less mana, with zero downside compared to using the bigger heal. Now let mana efficiency with downranking:
---
Let's look at two versions of flash heal:
---
&gt;Flash Heal rank 6: 644-765 for 315 mana = 2.04-2.42 health/mana
---
&gt;Flash Heal rank 7: 812-959 for 380 mana = 2.13-2.5 health/mana
---
So off the bat, it actually looks like the higher rank is *more* efficient than the lower rank. But, once we account for healing power from gear/talents, it's suddenly far better: Let's take a situation where someone has 250 healing power on 1.5 sec cast times and look at the same spells:
---
&gt;Flash Heal rank 6: 644-765+250 for 315 mana = 2.83-3.22 health/mana
---
&gt;Flash Heal rank 7: 812-959+250 for 380 mana = 2.79-3.18 health/mana
---
Now, the downranked spell is more efficient in terms of mana/health restored. As your gear gets better, you start getting higher HP/mana the lower rank your spells are, because you're adding so much from the base +healing on your gear.
---
The difference between newer edition healing vs. classic healing is that *you are limited by the amount of mana regen you have, not casting time*.  In retail, you're looking at what has the highest HPS in terms of heals/cast time. Mana efficiency takes a back seat, because the threat is not being able to put out enough HPS. You don't do that in classic, you look at heals per mana; it's much more of an endurance game of keeping your mana up throughout the entire fight.

Cyclone, spell reflect, ice lance, water ele, invisible, shadow fiend, swd, vt, dispersion, bladestorm, cloak of shadows, shafowstep, disengage that jumps back and probably a ton in forgetting
---
This post will not age well.
---
&gt; there is no limits with layers
---
Do you have any sort of proof or source of this?
---
Either for or against.
---
There is no way they are stupid enough to not put a limit on the amount of layers that can be created.
---
They chose 6 pm for launch so even if people call in sick they have to wait all day to play it
---
That’s cruel and unusual punishment Blizz
---
I don't think you had to buy BFA my dude, only the subscription.
---
Keep telling yourself that. Layering is here to stay forever now that it's been allowed a little.  
---
But go ahead and enjoy the watered down version of Classic WoW.  
---
I'll remember her former glory days.
---
I beg your pardon?
---
Desolace, red ridge if horde
---
That wasn't my "bullshit" dude. I think you just belied your own comprehension problem lmao
---
Players are the story. We create what Vanilla WoW is about. So no, Vanilla does not have an overarching story like the later expansions do.
---
Common sense says streamers should get it first. Why? Because the average player would much rather have someone who they can watch play. Get the beta over some nameless random.
---
You can't wield range and melee at the same time anymore.
---
it really is like a derangement with you people. I have never watched streamers but one can say something completely reasonable and people on twitter and reddit just see red.
---
Funny how bad people were back then
---
I always camp at Shimmering Flats its pretty good also Thorium point
---
Hasn't Tips twitch been offline for a few hours now? I get this forum doesn't like him but it looks like hes been offline for a while waiting for it to come online
---
MAzGA Varian Wrynn 2019
---
I gotta say that first screenshot of people actually talking to each other is something you don't see anymore.
---
It's too bad nobody with substantial influence actually attended that summit. Last night I watched (for a minute) two young Jersey-shore-esque girls streaming their footage from the summit. I kept thinking "who the fuck are these people, and why is Blizzard giving them inside access to Classic WoW?"
---
I've already explained the risk. Blizzard wants people who will play. 
---
So who do you send your invites out to? The players that can play right now? Or players that can't? 
---
You're coming at it from the angle of someone that wants to get in without paying. Think about it from Blizzard's standpoint. What makes more sense to them?
---
Stonetalon
---
I did jump in prematurely with the holiday time but I've always been a lucky son of a bitch and somehow got the right week without even really meaning too! :D
---
Sounds good to me.  I just want to level with my buddies and do classic dungeons.  Which is all layered already.   Then maybe do some BGS, which again..is layered. 
---
And If they split serverX layer 2 into a new server called serverx2, that is also fine with me.
---
Wtf. I'm just fucking pissed now that I couldn't get that CE because of that bullshit. Fuck this
---
That's just an asshole move there
---
High five😄👐
---
about 1 hour but i was referring to the 8 hours prior to that.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if I got the beta. I have gotten most of them since WOTLK. I think the reason is that when they did give me the beta. I actually took the time to report every bug I could possibly find. Even asked other people for bugs to report. If you ever get a beta and, want to get into one in the future. I would recommend you actually submit reports. Won't play even if I get though. My heart can't take having the progress erased. Not for classic.
---
Well ya I'm a rogue main
---
How can you understand \[common\] as an undead?
---
Love how they originally planned WSG to be something "people could play during their lunch break". LOL
---
I will usually watch at work or on a second monitor. Its nice for background noise and to potentially pick up on something you werent aware of before
---
Do you have any proof? Because I definitely played the MOP beta without having an active sub when I was invited, nor did I need one to play it. If it goes back as far as that, why would it be any different for Cataclysm?
---
There are dozens of us! DOZENS!
---
NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA CLASSIC!
---
Not sure if this mean anything, since I am o nF&amp;F List I get every as well, sometimes Week / day 1 sometimes Day 2-3.
---
Billy gets to team up with Todd and Tucker.
---
A few week is all we need to get all the devilsaur and black lotus we want.
---
In diagram 2, it states N=3k, N=2.5k &amp; N=2.5k: total players between 1 server, 3 layers =8K
---
In diagram 3, is states only one-time  N=3k: total players = 3k
---
So we shift from 8k to 3k players from diagram 2 to 3.
---
Are you saying that when diagram 3 happens (after 3-12 weeks), Server 1 will loose 5k players? Where do those players go? How is it decided?
---
I see it says "once the server is stabilized". What does that even mean? What if when diagram 3 launches there's still 7-8k players? do they just continue the layers forever? Surely they cant handle this many players, hence needing the layers originally.
---
Seems pretty awful to cut 5k players out from the server and probably put them on a new server via free-transfer. Is this actually what is happening, or am I misunderstanding the diagram or is this diagram inaccurate?
---
Because if this is true we have a MASSIVE problem.
---
 (i'm all for layering, but something has to be wrong with this if I am correct).
---
He just seemed tougher to get to, and kill.
---
YES!!! thats the name, thank you for reminding me.   Gonna go on a binge now lol
---
It's still correct if beta opens within the next 30 minutes.  The range was 10am-2pm PST.
---
Likely just the collectors edition pets
---
Same, I have two accounts from august 2005. Praying
---
Wetlands, Angwe style
---
Where Darkshore enters Ashenvale, it's what made me go RP server. One road in, too far away from a FP for higher levels to typically respond and 90% of people coming in are 19ish at most. That fucking Druid I still hate him.
---
Then sneak attack people who aren't leveling
---
I used to love to MC ppl down into 1000 Needles with my friend at the elevators as alli. That was amazing
---
This one. I love this song.
---
I'm in the same boat when it comes to race choice at this point. I prefer the aesthetics of Trolls, but Orcs are strictly the best Hunter race for PvP in my opinion. Resisting Intercept/Kidney Shot is pretty huge, though you eat both classes alive anyways - it makes the job a lot easier. 
---
Nightelf is really cool for wPvP and base/flag defense in BGs, you can Aimed Shot out of shadowmeld and it's just pretty cool to be stealthily sitting around with your cat. Dwarf is really good because it lets you remove rogue poisons and blind, but again, it's a bit of a "win harder" skill. Incredibly useful nonetheless. Tauren I'm not super amazed by, Warstomp lets you gain some distance assuming there are no slow effects on you. Could be used to disrupt casts assuming they are in melee range and you're off GCD, but that's a lot of ifs. 
---
I personally decided to just go with Troll after asking this question in this very thread today - one poster mentioned something that really resonated with me: You're going to be spending thousands of hours watching this character - you should like the way it looks. That's why I'm going with female Troll. So if you love your cows, go cow. Warstomp definitely has applications, it's just not AMAZING for a hunter the way it can be for, say, a shaman. A bit more health is also welcome. Do take in mind their deadzone works a bit different than that of other races.
---
Sorry for the wall of text, I get very excited talking about this stuff.
---
Yeah, that would make sense. Just making sure I understood it correctly and Collector's Edition pet wasn't just used as the example, because they maybe had forgotten about Gurky/Murky also being promo pets in Vanilla.
---
good point, you also get armor and dodge
---
spirit gives benefits quicker than str too, since you spend more time traveling between mobs, anda  large money sink is your food and water, spirit can save you maybe 5 seconds between each mob, and allow you to be fully healed just from a short travel, where as like you said 10 to 9 swings will only save you 2-3.5 seconds (weapon speed) for way more investment.
---
in contested zones like STV, people WILL abuse the layering system to vanish from fights
---
it kills the vanilla spirit where you had to fight or die or learn something new, because you couldn't vanish since there's one damn world.
---
I think it caps at level 30, right? In that case, enjoy Hunter, they're among the kings of low level PvP.
---
&gt; It doesn't fix the problem of overpopulation of zones. 3000 people divided by 3 newbie zones is exactly as unplayable as 10,000 people divided by three newbie zones.
---
That's why we're getting starter zone sharding AND the overall layering system. Listen to Brian Birmingham's interview on Staysafes channel very closely. It's hard because the audio is bad and he's being interviewed by morons, but I'm pretty sure that's what he's saying.
---
https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=252
---
which is how it was in vanilla.
---
ANY oxhorn video? RED SNAPPAH!
---
Horde = Redridge for sure. The way it's set up makes it very easy to rotate all around the zone as a rogue. It's a lot of fun. The zone is packed with mobs so if ally runs away they usually pull aggro. You can sabotage any groups taking on the elite gnoll or orc quests. It's the top tier camping spot, and you can succeed there pretty reliably from around lvl 20.
---
Horde runner up? Wetlands
---
Alliance = I'm partial to Stonetalon, 1k Needles,
---
Hillsbrad, Ashenvale, Arathi are good for both
---
You could always run to Mulgore and level. A bit out of the way, but you would save yourself time when moving into barrens quests since you’ll already have both flight paths. 
---
Unless of course you’ll be playing a clothie, in which quest rewards would not be as ideal.
---
Na I wanna kill leveling people
---
ahh i didnt know the range, i just know blizz is always late.
---
i see no problem with streamers starting the streams at the beginning of this range
---
If u have time to watch streamers it is time to rethink the way you are living your life seriously
---
Nothing better than spamming /LOL and /Spit while I safely teleport home....its not like we can kill things...or tank them...give us a break. Its all we got! :P
---
In all seriousness I hope pallys will be more viable since we know more about the game these days. I guess time will tell.
---
This community is slooowwwwly starting to realize this will be good for them...
---
Edit: good for us*
---
In what way?
---
so to game the system, create several characters that exist on different layers, and then invite your friends main to your alts layer/have them invite your main to their alts layer if you want more or less people depending on which layer has a higher pop at any given time.
---
Seems like an easy way to get onto a better layer for questing/loot if layers are assigned to characters and not accounts.
---
Yup exactly. Seems kinda weird to think that even for a warrior while leveling being covered in spirit and agi gear is best, but the math backs it up.
---
And that's why its an asshole move
---
Good job downvoting me too btw
---
"Oh there was a huge fight? On Emerald Dream? I'm on that server! Oh it was another layer? Fuck."
---
Yeah, I figured that out. But I decided I wanted to dink around in BFA yesterday and you can get BFA keys super cheap from resellers RN.
---
(BFA seems just as bad as everyone says =( sad)
---
LOLOMGWTGDAIRYQUEENLOLOMGBBTHEQ
---
This isnt ZalPalaPvP 3. The title is a lie.
---
&gt; It only improves the leveling experience in newbie zones. People who move past the pack are going to find ghost towns where pvp and groups are many times harder to find. Layering only makes sense in overpopulated zones. Unfortunately, they can't control layering by zone, only by continent.
---
They said they can dynamically scale the load of the Layer up or down. Meaning while _everyone_ is tunneled into 6 starting zones, Layer sizes will be tiny, maybe say 600 (random number). As more people progress through the zones, that number opens up, so instead of people being tunneled in 6 zones, now it's 14, so the Layer # is up to 2000 now, ensuring that the people ahead of the pack (who by definition...will encounter fewer players) will have others to play with.
---
Your last point doesn't make any sense. They can _choose to scale the cube size at will_ meaning they can _always_ ensure equal water in all the cubes AND determine how many cubes they need. It's not that they'll always need enough water to pour into a tray of 12 equal cubes, it's that they can dynamically change the number of cubes in the tray and the volume each cube in the tray holds.
---
Feel free not to read it weirdo
---
It will only be the panda/diablo pet
---
But the beta isn't until the 22nd......
---
Just mainly roll alliance you will be best off as a new player
---
I'd write off anyone in a first world country. Even on disability benefits in Canada I'm going to be able to afford a subscription.
---
For most players of today - the encounters themselves are not difficult.  Opposite faction, same faction fucking with you, overly camped - that’s the difficult part. 
---
I had people not know what I was doing and mistake me kiting for being and trouble and try to heal me etc. that made things very difficult.
---
Druids are just fine, dont listen to the hardcore min/maxing community especially for 5m tanking.
---
Check out [Baron on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc_A2fYotUM), he has a ton of streamed content where he tanks 5mans and also offtanks MC without an issue. Go back to his older videos of him gearing up so you can get a sense of what itll be like. Seems enjoyable
---
_Embrace the madness..._
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koSq-KecPm4
---
or this one.
---
Nope, same for PTR
---
Is it really worth it? Even if it went up $50 it wouldn't really be worth the effort.
---
Thanks for sharing man. Really moving and special. Terribly sorry for your loss.
---
Camping around Scarlet Monastery can be pretty exciting.
---
edit: Somebody's unhappy I gave away the prize.
---
Why does everyone consider Summer over in late August. There is still a full month left of Summer.
---
Lol you're all over this thread and so anti-layering you're just starting to come off like a hardcore fanboy
---
stop defending a system that fragments and destroys community and immersion
---
your overlord Blizzard couldve found a solution that doesn't ruin the player experience, but they decided to go with quick and easy profit instead.
---
Imagine being this salty
---
there are differences between ranks other than mana
---
mainly its cast time
---
for druid r4 ht has 3 seconds cast time , r5 is 3.5
---
with imp ht talent u lower cast time of ht by 0.5
---
so most ppl will use ht r4 because of the cast time - and also for mana
---
once u have decent amount of +healing u can try using r3 and 2 for heal sniping (r2 if u are trying to outsnipe palies)
---
this is also why +healing is king for druid - do not go for gimmicks from sets(3 piece t2 is all you need rly for the longer fights - after that focus on maximum +healing)
---
as druid u will be fine with just using ht r4 99% of the time
---
but it also good to have/know how to use :
---
max rank rejuv for swiftmending - max lvl ht+ns - 2 ranks of regrowth(max one+r3 or4) - remove curse - abolish poison - innervate - tranquility - motw - thorns - rebirth - barkskin(with it all your cast time is increased by 1 second - but it can be useful on fights like onyxia if u get whelp agro - unclick it once mages clear the whelps going for you)
---
"edit"
---
since u also looking for guidance on healing - there is something called 5 seconds rule in classic - your mana regeneration kicks in 5 seconds after your last cast have finished - this helps in lower lvl dungeons when your gear is just stats - u want to make a int/spirit set for dungeon healing  - u want to space out your healing  to have 5+ seconds between casts (of course that dsnt matter if your tank is getting smashed and u just need to keep him alive - at that point just spam heals until tank is fine) - rejuvs and regrowths should be avoided when low lvl healing since they will make you go oom much faster than just using ht's
---
make sure u have plenty of water going into dungeons - 2/3 stacks min(look for a mage in the area using/who or ask your group to see if someone is in town or close to it)
---
not sure if tank pulling mobs will interrupt drinking in retail vanilla - but u can speed up the run by not drinking after the pull and just running to next pull and drinking right before it, getting 2 ticks of regen and than starting to heal
---
r/theydidthemath

More of a "what should I play ON" type of post: does anyone have experience playing on an ultrawide monitor? I'm considering buying one. The alternative would be to get 2 24'' monitors - and I'm not super fond of the idea, an ultrawide sounds super fun to play on. Going to be PvPing quite a bit, if that matters at all.
---
Now it will be, layer first! so fun!    /s
---
Got mine ordered yesterday. $10 in shipping as well so pretty pricey.
---
Only one caster each team and thats a priest!
---
I cleared all that shit in vanilla it was cool in 2004, it is ridiculous to go thru it all again 15 years later.
---
Proud bitter vet lol.  Fucking Al Bundy reliving his glory days over here.
---
You would think they would try that.
---
This is how the shitty rogues play. Can't PvP on equal ground even with their kit so they need to feel better about themselves killing low levels.
---
Lol if you’re on the friends and family list shouldn’t you already have access?
---
A man should not deprive himself of other things solely for food. Life can be cruel to the impoverished. It's not merely survival. They just as anyone else should be allowed to spend money on their entertainment. Just surviving is not how a life should be spent.
---
Oh okay not saying it, just supporting and defending it. Totally different 👍 hard pwn dude
---
Edit: and I'll just assume you agree with the rest of what I said
---
I used to feel the same way. A big part of it is the chat. Twitch is basically a chat room in a lot of ways. Lots of people DO play games while also watching twitch and using the chat. Also, streamers are personalities , when you’re alone in your room sometimes it’s cool to listen to someone talking and interacting with a lot of others also watching. It’s really pretty normal if you think of it that way. It’s not like your just hovering over someone’s back while they play a game, neither of you saying a word
---
Also, why do people watch football with friends when they can go outside and play? It’s the exact same concept.
---
Me too, even gilded, this sub hit a new low ...
---
I know right? Like when my friends are watching basketball and I'm like, "Guys let's just go to the park and play ourselves." 
---
Go Druid is pvp, more viability.
---
I wish I was in that game, was a friend tho. This was one of the very first WSGs on a server with a 9:1 ally:horde ratio. They just held the game open and farmed an endless stream of people coming and going.
---
If u have time to post on reddit it is time to rethink the way you are living your life seriously
---
How quickly this flew up the top section on this sub really says something.
---
Havent seen this video in ages! Also what's up fellow arkansan! Fayetteville checking in!
---
Uber, uber leet?
---
&gt; Layering doesnt do anything to overpopulation of starting zones
---
We're getting layering AND sharding in starter zones at launch. Check out [Brian's answer here](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=252)
---
Ah yes &lt;DIE&gt; the biggest joke on Illidan.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-9cQ_bgHmg
---
Haha, took me a minute.
---
Haha it might, but Reddit is a source of info for me while I can’t see how watching a streamer can contribute to anything?
---
I told my boss I'd be taking time off for a vacation in the summer, probably some time in August, but didn't know the dates just yet. Then after the announcement I've requisitioned my week off from the 26th through to the weekend :)
---
Using my paid vacation hours as well, glorious.
---
&gt;In diagram 2, it states N=3k, N=2.5k &amp; N=2.5k: total players between 1 server, 3 layers =8K

---
&gt;(i'm all for layering, but something has to be wrong with this if I am correct).
---
Yeah, looking unlikely that they hit the range they gave the streamers.  Most of them were planning on playing all day, but it's frustrating for everyone (including Blizz) that they have thousands of people sitting around waiting impatiently.  Exact reason why you don't break big news like this the day before.....
---
RIP STVietnam
---
It was a good run
---
Yeah, it was the ivory raptor’s counterpart
---
Layering is per continent not per zone.
---
"Well, they said 'summer release' and now we find out it's closer to the end of summer than the beginning!"
---
*-actual argument I encountered*
---
It's extremely doable once you figured out the strategies. The hardest part is not to get interrupted by other players, honestly.
---
Wait at the boarder from the safe starting zone to the neighboring contested zone, and gank them when they cross the line.
---
No. Layering is fine. I just was happy with their original starting zones only proposal. Why change it to the whole game now? Voice your opinions now since they seem to be very responsive to feedback. Even 1-20 zones wouldn't be a big deal for a couple weeks tops.
---
Tempest keep was by far not the only thing that was made for maxlevel flying...

Day 1 is D-day. You have to be there so you can tell your story to future generations.

The homeless shouldn't have cellphones is the stupidest thing people uneducated abiut the issue say. Cellphones are cheap and usually have a resale value of 100 or less. 100 is not going to house anyone, and smartphones are incredibly useful for alarms, directions, job searching, keeping contact... you know being a functioning human able to try and get off the streets. It's essential for them to have.
---
if somebody wants to play with their friends, blizzard isn't going to tell them no they can't make a character on their friends realm pick a different one.  that's exactly why layers exist, because otherwise all the realms would be full at the beginning, so they need an unlimited amount of space to hold the tourists before they leave so that everybody can still play the realm they want to
---
Haha, what's sad is the sarcasm of this comment would fly over lots of people's heads and some would non-ironically endorse it.
---
that better be wrong
---
the best part of vanilla and current pservers is 100 person fights and they aint even that laggy
---
How come people don't like Tips? Just curious cuz I kinda like the guy.
---
Someone got baited and got mad PepeLaugh
---
The beautiful thing about classic is the server identity. Scammers get blacklisted quickly as well as ninja looters.
---
Asmongold, is that you?
---
I mean, with that system the person requesting an item to be made can just scam the crafter into buying their mats. There are mats in the game that are worth a decent amount of gold but hard to sell, you could trick someone into paying you full price for hard to sell mats.
---
Moving story bro ;(
---
Here you go my boy take your high five ✋
---
From what i can tell, hes click baity (like all content creators) , he did some random leak and he didn't play during vanilla (I think?).
---
There is also a small % of people who dislike him for not making youtube content on private servers prior to classic been announced. That been said any very popular streamer will also have people who just dislike their personality which is perfectly normal as well.
---
You can do 99% of TBC without flying. It wasn't needed at all.
---
Report him
---
5-10 servers filled to the brim would be healthy pop.
---
there are already supposed vanilla loyalists demanding for changes, class balancing, etc in this very subreddit. if retail people come to classic they will 100% start asking for dumb shit like transmog.
---
I also have zero interests in watching other people play games. Some of their meta content is interesting though, people sometimes upload good clips to youtube, and I've been watching some of that. On-stream discussions about meta-issues related to games that they play, mostly.

Goblin sappers are a must have for serious raiding, trinkets/speed boots/grenades are must haves for pvp
---
You'll be able to reserve names two weeks prior. Quite sure "reserving names"simply means creating characters, so the main client will be downloadable by then and require only some late patches.
---
Your name is a fucking joke mate.
---
What the actual fuck..
---
I would go with 2 x 24 instead of 21:9. I have a 21:9 wide monitor and I am thinking of reverting it to 2 x 16:9, was so much better that way.
---
except the layers shouldn't be the same size in middle diagram.
---
When a new layer appears, people will be all alone in it. Or more realistic, people from the current layer will be automatically shifted in to the new layer. So you'll sometimes be inadvertently teleported to a new layer, OR you'll be sometimes alone in a new layer.
---
Representing the 3 layer slices as equal sizes is simply misleading. You'll almost never have that be the case
---
You will be allowed to create characters up to 2 weeks before the game is released as long as you have an active sub so at least by that point in time the client will be available for download.
---
"CLASSIC WOW STREAM. I AM A SHIT PLAYER, PLEASE CLICK"
---
-&gt; Watching classic videos.
---
Im not crying, you're crying!
---
the way to deal with scammers is to trade with people you trust
---
Haha, yeah, I get excited with this stuff as well. I think you made a correct choice by following your heart and not min/max bs :) Props for that!
---
But as for me, I really like all three, male tauren, male dwarf and female NE. The last one has the sickest animations imo. So yeah, I'm still thinking about it...
---
Thanks for the replies :)
---
Over hypes everything
---
So layering is like voting republican because socialism is dumb. Got it. I’m in.
---
That's a good point. On the other hand, you would then have all the mats to make the thing that person wanted - you could just make it now and sell that yourself, and if someone was looking for someone to make it, it must be a lucrative item, not something for which the mats are more expensive than the item, right?
---
Towellie starter pack
---
i haven't opened the launcher since then so it hadn't updated haha
---
Responding to a 3 hour old comment after the fact, and no one ACTUALLY streaming classic.  Nice meme.
---
RIP Smog's computer. Forever left in a dead raid.
---
None of these streamers are going to get this "classic wow experience" they keep boasting about. All of us will, but not them.  
---
They will never have to ask general or trade chat for groups or have to buy anything with gold. Everything will be handed to them and they will inevitably be boring for them because of it.  
---
As for the rest of us normal gamers that play for the fun instead of the money, we just have to figure out how to stay away from the streamer servers and their toxic audience.
---
Goddamn, that last sentence. Hope you have a good time in WoW dude. I'll be playing Classic together with my brother as well, and we also have a similar story as yours. Would be a tough time playing if he wouldn't be around. Classic will be very special to me, because this'll be my last serious multiplayer (possibly even any multiplayer) I'll play before leaving the scene for good.
---
Cmon man. That was clearly a joke. The salt is real.
---
Dat quirky timer doe
---
Gotcha. Thats fair. I was thinking he kicked 2 babies and a squirrel or something.
---
But what if none of the people you trust trade in that item and this item is the difference between you progressing further now vs spending another couple of weeks grinding for an alternative?
---
Thanks for sharing.  I have the same memories and also lost my brother too.  It will be hard playing without him but like you some of the best memories of my life.  Thanks again for sharing.
---
I honestly dont understand why people are so upset. We're getting classic wow and they're doing their best to make sure it succeeds in the long term, so that includes a launch that isnt so frustrating most people just quit without getting past level 10. It's like people just  decide they want to be outraged, so they get on reddit and look for an excuse to whine and complain regardless of whether its sensible or not.
---
DAE LAYERING BAD?????
---
Agreed really enjoying it so far. It starts slow, but after a few episodes they all seem to get more comfortable on camera, fix a few audio issues, and really step up their performances. The current arc is awesome.
---
He's saying what if you can be selected to be a participant, then decide to sub so you can actually play in the beta. This would be a way for bliz to gain subs.
---
Lol. The extent to which some of you are overthinking this is funny, so I'll continue. Cross realm zones is another proper noun. Cross realm, again, is not. Crz and cross realm also have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Just like Crz and sharding have nothing to do with each other.
---
Again. Cross realm describes an aspect of sharding, because sharding is cross realm.
---
What specifically don't you get? I don't know how to explain this more clearly.
---
Nope. Evidently not. I'm not an employee so I wasn't a part of the internal Beta. And I'm not more important than big streamers so....
---
Just make friends with people early on who are leveling up professions. Then when you hit 60 hopefully you will have a few of them who you trust. When leveling up enchanting I always would give away a lot of free enchants in hopes that down the line the person would come back to me. In classic WoW finding a good honest profession person is like finding a good mechanic in real life.
---
Let me guess, With a screen name like Meowtar you are going to play a Tauren Druid.
---
Yup I thought it only last a single day but I can't even remember what happened yesterday.
---
In vanilla we chugged mana pots on all boss fights as soon as the cooldown was available. 
---
Folk had to have food buffs. Oils, elixirs, to boost mana regen.
---
Flooding the market? Sure, 3 layers means 3x as many resources, but also 3x as many consumers of those resources. I also think that the overall effect on the economy of having a few layers for a few weeks will be waaaay less than from dynamic spawning which a lot of people on reddit seem to be calling for.
---
We don’t know for certain but I’d assume that global chats like guild recruitment, world defense, trade, etc. will be server-wide not limited to layers.
---
And overall, layering is more to help prevent dead servers having to be merged than overcrowded zones.
---
feelsbadman. so were you lvl 58 day of announcement and aimed to get 60 before the shutdown? because that's determination bro. 
---
I was in an MC pug, the raid stopped and leader put Freeroll on. Sad times
---
What's that keyboard?
---
This made me think of when me and my brother played wow together for the first time in tbc. 
---
thanks for sharing this touching story, sorry for your loss!
---
Druid being mana inefficient is only kind of true. Rank 4 healing touch is generally the most mana efficient heal in the game (though a Druid can blanket reju and regrowth spam to oom themselves very quickly).
---
nothing againt you in particular but i see this mentality all over the place (and on this sub) and it blows my mind..
---
taking on extra projects? showing up early leaving late? working on further education (masters degrees, technical classes focused in your field?), networking and staying in touch with contacts so you can market yourself &amp; build your reputation, reading books so your just way smarter than everyone your competing against? 
---
\- your future isn't just about the economy (it's just one of MANY factors)
---
\- no one is entitled to success and/or a more prosperous future.  simply getting older does not guarantee a better standard of living (people think oh in x years i'll be promoted to x, in 10 years i'll make this much). nope you have to fucking earn it and push yourself forward.  
---
enjoy classic.  I'm fucking pumped and took 4 days off for it but I'll also be working hard &amp; studying at the same time.  don't let this game fk you up like it did to me in my teens.  I luckily was able to recover from all the time sunk into it and am doing well but so many of my friends who got sucked in are in very stagnant jobs with little/no future promise.
---
That was so fucking cool, I remember PoM poly mages dismounting people from their mounts but I can’t remember if it was nerfed in TBC or in Vanilla! Although IIRC some mages also used slow fall to kill AFKers?
---
There was a point in my life where I couldn't afford my wow sub. Was mainly just me not working at all. I think OP is largely trying to help people where 15 is not a trivial amount of money.
---
I've been meaning to ask - how does that work then? Say some guy named Shadyjim stole your mats and logged off. You then tell everyone in general/trade chat that this person is a scammer - maybe half the people take note of it, and half of those people actually put him on their personal list - how does that help someone who wasn't online at the time to hear what you said? They would trade with Shadyjim and get scammed because they didn't know.
---
Developers said it will only be the first few weeks. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8)
---
yeah the "download" is available right now.
---
they will update the download with the Classic stuff once it's August 27th.
---
&gt; no-lifers that are going to be 10-30 levels ahead of me.
---
People that level faster than you are "no lifers"?
---
This video and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ9KHCbBOn0) were some of my favorites from back then.
---
I read them when I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be doing.
---
Every time I make a new character I tell myself I will actually read every single bit of it but I stop fairly quick.
---
The thing with tagging is that this issue actually results in opportunities. People will look for alternative quest rather than the usual path taken. In addition, by layering you keep the problem alive up till 60, while if you do not the problem fixes itself slowly over the levels as low lvls will have the toughest competition and only a few at the time will escape this competition by being the first to tag mobs lvl up and leave the zone.
---
*WHOOOOSH*
---
The point of analogies isn't to create a perfect comparison, it's to be evocative.  In this case, the joke is that many of the people who've worked themselves into a rage and vowed not to play the game will, in fact, end up playing the game.  Whether MW2 should or shouldn't have changed their match hosting is completely irrelevant.
---
Na, I don't watch his twitch tbh but apparently he was a bit bad with fake leaks the last week. There is also a mentality on this sub reddit shared by a small percentage that if you weren't doing private server stuff before classic was announced you aren't really part of the community. They seem to be the most vocal but a small over all percentage.
---
Layering is NOT sharding.
---
Because exploitive practices in gaming are super popular and are becoming more popular and are ruining games that people love or want to love.
---
If people keep buying into the real money gambling that companies are putting into their games, it ruins it for everybody.
---
A WoW subscription should be paid to play the game, not a lottery ticket to maybe play the game you want.
---
I thought he was a beast and not a dragonkin? Wowpedia seems to agree, but it's entirely possible it changed at some point after vanilla.
---
Haha, good try, just a random old name. I’m actually rolling alli this time and it’ll either be Rogue or Priest probably.
---
This is awesome!
---
wow some classes gameplay changes drastically without these. hard to see how rogue is still so popular without cloak and step
---
The most annoying thing is all these streamers so fuckin confident they'll get an invite, just because they use Classic to make content every time a bluepost drops so they can read it out loud... Like they're glorious content creators, authorities in the matter, when they're mostly guys who played on private servers and call themselves experts for some reason... Rant over, move along !
---
thats the beauty of classic, you have to build those relationships and find new people. and i doubt anyone who gets an important enchant or something will be a scammer, because they know they can make a ton of gold by being one of the few people to have something like a crusader enchant and by scamming people theyd be losing a ton of money in the long run
---
Why should someone extremely poor be denied some reprieve and entertainment?
---
DAE RUNNING OUT OF STUFF TO BITCH ABOUT BLIZZARD FOR???
---
10k (over exaggerated obviously) people in Elwynn. Thats not even hard. 
---
Do you want a vanilla experience or not? Competing to tag mobs was a legitimate vanilla experience and it led to meeting people, exploring elsewhere, finding tricks to get first hit which led to you playing your character better. 
---
If the above sounds horrible then go play retail. They already destroyed the sense of community.
---
but on the other hand thousands of invites might go to people with no intention of re-subbing to try it
---
You wouldn't even know it was happening if they hadn't announced it.
---
I just took a week. Told my boss classic wow is coming out and I need this. He laughed and said sure.
---
I reduces the need for extra servers and the chance of your server not having a low pop after the initial rush is over.
---
Unless you have some sort of questing addon you often need to read the text just to figure out what to do.
---
Yes, but I would rather compete with 100 other characters than 500. Anything they can do to make the game more playable the first few weeks is a great idea to me. I don't want to be completely alone, I just don't want to spend more time looking for something to kill than actually killing.
---
It's an old Packard Bell keyboard. Packard Bell is now Hewlett Packard. I actually had this one as a kid and I found another one recently. Wanted a mechanical keyboard, but didn't want to bust the bank on some over expensive "gamer" keyboard. Back then all our keyboards were mechanical keyboards.
---
Yup, and if they are trying to get a certain amount of players for the beta but not too much, perhaps this won't be a good strategy then.
---
Trust me, word spreads fast. Ninja looters didnt even get invited to raids back in the day sometimes.
---
When you make a name for yourself it sticks. Watch some of frostradamus videos on the subject too it explains it well.
---
Yeah man, I was PISSED. BUT... I wasnt about to not hit my goal.
---
Nobody "expects you to have everything all the time" other than ridiculous tryhard guilds.
---
Those other things you listed have nothing to do with dynamic respawn.
---
Probably a good thing. I remember selling my hearthstone invite for $60.
---
You’re welcome 
---
J Allen Brack
---
Note: forgot my login PW for my main account so borrowing this one.
---
They could only receive their invite starting today, so really it might not mean shit. They might just be contacting people to start soon...
---
starting zones only was in reference to sharding, which theyre no longer using. and ion said it will last for only a few weeks at most and other classic devs said it will be gone by phase two at the latest, so it likely wont last more then 1-2 months
---
I can remember when wrath gave us shamans thunderstorm. In that first week I got so far behind on levelling because all I wanted to do was challenge people to duel and fling people off the zepplin/mulgore
---
Because layering isn't zone by zone.  Layering is the entire world, so you will see the same people in each zone while leveling.
---
Also, how do you know that it will only be needed for the first 20 levels?  You don't.  From blizzards standpoint it's much better to plan for needing this for a while and be able to collapse it when it isn't needed, which is what its designed to do.
---
I'm not seeing anyone mention this, but from how I understand layering, once the server population decreases below the threshold to need a layer, that layer would collapse back into the needed layer(s).  So once a servers population is down to only needing the base layer, then layering is effectively gone.  Seems like a really good solution to me.
---
Did someone say, Towelliee up in here? I guess that was just the wind. lol
---
&gt; queues, crashes, bugs...
---
I guess you never played Day 1 of Legion or BfA. Was perfectly fine.
---
There won't ever be both world bosses and layering in the game at the same time, according to Ion. Supposedly it's there to handle the temporary nature of the demand on launch only. When demand stabilizes, they'll reduce the number of layers gradually until there's only one layer left. Presumably they will then shut the layering off entirely, and implement a queue for the last remaining layer if necessary.
---
in your mom's basement ;)
---
For EU there is 1 hour left until May 16.
---
Shit yeah, I'm looking for one of them older ones that are mechanical, I used to have a really nice one and I threw it away when I got my dell keyboard from my first PC..
---
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.
---
Animation? I remember it just being a sound clip for the longest time.
---
I'm mainly responding to this line you wrote:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;If some of the things you would normally have to spend gold on are easier to obtain, then you need less gold.
---
&gt;Like, how can you not see this is dumb? You literally making some things easier to obtain.
---
If a playerbase of 1,000 was able to extract 600 Lotus per week in Vanilla, then the devs need some kind of scaling mechanism in place so that 10,000 people are able to extract 6,000 Lotus per week.
---
Dynamic respawns are part of this equation since most resources are only dropped from kills. If a playerbase of 1,000 was able to generate 50,000 Runecloth per week...then once again 10x that number of players needs to be able to generate 10x that amount. If I arrive at the WPL cauldrons to farm some cloth, then I'd hope they have some kind of dynamic spawn system in place to do a better job at preserving my Vanilla memories of it. If the mobs are constantly dead, it fucks up the scarcity model and the game experience.
---
&gt; Many better solutions to this option, which seems like a very heavy handed approach.
---
Apparently not. You also don't understand anything about it. I recommend any of the posts on the front page that explain it.
---
You also put it on the forum, and say it everytime he advertise on /2
---
Best way to avoid scamming however, is asking to a friend
---
I can’t believe some people still confuse CRZ and sharding after months of the same discussion over and over...
---
Hint hint. Its not today because if it was it would have been live by now.
---
Red ridge
---
You don’t think dynamic spawn rates have an impact on aoe grinding being a superior leveling strategy? Alright explain that logic? 
---
You don’t think increased spawn rates impact the amount of gold on the server?
---
You don’t think the number, frequency, and reliability of spawns for devilsaur makes the ROI spending 24 hours controlling a spot less worthwhile since more people will just accept not having BIS?
---
***This is a steam application and does not use the windows desktop to display your background correct?***
---
I have expired windows (legitimate copy, i've just had it for ever, and apparently it stopped working one day (yes i know you can rearm it, i've hit maximum rearms / edit the registry but neither have worked)  
---
If it's a program through steam, I'll likely buy it, assuming it will override my issues with invalid windows
---
Yes, having game time on your account counts as being active.
---
Stonetalons if you're alliance
---
So... if leveling enchanting, find blacksmithing friends? Because if I remember anything from vanilla, it's that those enchanting rods were crazy expensive, and blacksmiths knew that and jacked up the prices on them - you were basically at their mercy XD
---
A large portion of the quests are essentially just about running errands, but the ones which are great are good enough that it's worth reading as many quests as possible to find the standouts. I don't see the need to rush when Classic comes out, so while I already know practically all the Horde quests, I'll try and read every quest I do on Alliance side when I eventually roll one as an alt.
---
How many retail players do you think will ignore the invite because they have zero interest in classic wow?
---
As a Horde rogue-
---
Where Elwynn enters Redridge.  
---
"Oh Boy, a brand new zone full of challenging monsters and sweet quests!  I can't wait!" 
---
*stealth noise*   *Human death sound*
---
As alliance-
---
Some would say Stonetalon or other "super low level" places, but I think in terms of pure rage-generation I would go with the zeppelin towers.  Making people miss the Zepp is pure pain, and bonus points if you get the mind control engi helmet and make them jump off.   Best "Lowbie" places are the entrance into Ashenvale from the Barrens or the 1K needles elevator.
---
Hi, /u/jacktr9
---
Shouldn't be too hard to find one, they're all pretty good really, and people almost give them away for free these days. Picked up mine for next to nothing.
---
To not have 100 empty servers when initial rush of popularity dies down.
---
So, no proof?       
---
Why do you think they wouldn't tell them no?         
---
&gt; ["If a realm’s status is listed as full, a player can only log on that server if he or she already has a character."](https://www.alteredgamer.com/wow-basics/87411-what-does-the-realm-population-mean-in-world-of-warcraft/)
---
I just logged into [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) and it isn't available on my screen. Unless you are referring to the Retail client.
---
Having played day 1 of every expansion launch in this game, I can say unequivocally that the last 2 expac launches have been butter smooth. I didn't even have to log out of the game for Legion or BFA when it ticked over live. WoD was bad for some I heard, but mainly for issues of Queue times (which I dodged by never logging off), and Garrison lag (which I didn't even try to unlock until I was already level 97 because I skipped the entire first zone to get ahead of the zerg). I don't even remember there being any major issues with the MoP launch, it was a smidge laggy trying to start the first quest that took you to Jade Forest, sure, but I skipped the first zone and was having a great time thereafter.
---
I reckon Blizzard deserves more credit about day 1 stability nowadays. They learned a lot from their previous launch catastrophes. The only issues I forsee are competition for mob tags, not technical ones.
---
&gt;7 hours ago
---
If you're disciplined enough not to search the internet for help, you almost have to read the quest text. There were no highlighted regions on the minimap/map; no arrows; no mousing over items/creatures and it indicating to you that that was a quest obj. 
---
I'd say it definitely enhanced my experience in Vanilla because it added life to a world that was already complex and rich with interaction.
---
Jokes on you. I'll just have a friend invite me and "Layer" into his Stormwind where you don't exist.
---
Ur gonna drink a frickin lot
---
Googled "buy wow classic beta key"
---
Already found 1 site offering,  but "out of stock"
---
Are we sure you can even move from one layer to another? It seemed from the interview that you wouldn't be able to interact across layers until they were merged.
---
competing spots against 10 people is the same as competing against 1000s of people starting at the same time?
---
youll still compete for fcking tags since theres a big cap
---
Dont forget my zergling! :)
---
When they suggested that they should only shard for a few weeks in the starting zones, the community went fucking *apeshit* on them, screaming that it was retail poisoning, that it would ruin their immersion to see other characters blink in and out of existence, that it would cause new players to turn away, etc.
---
So they literally made a new, never-before-used proprietary system just for the Classic community with a better, more elegant solution that *still only lasts a few weeks*, creates session-long persistent populations, and facilitates the same goal as sharding (avoiding massive load queues). And surprise, people keep going fucking apeshit on them because misinformation and wild assumptions are the name of the game with internet rage. Layers will only be around for a small while. Even the most populous servers will likely only have 3 max. They're not going to crash economies. Most of the playerbase won't even notice them because they don't have obvious in-game visual effects like sharding did. They'll preserve server integrity, avoid merges, make queues nonexistent, and be good and gone before 99% of the population even *reaches* the endgame zones they keep shrieking about.
---
That could be true sometimes but you never know I guess. There are some recipes with expensive but hard to sell mats that no one really wants made because the stats just aren’t all that good. And you’d still have to spend the time trying to sell it and/or pay AH fees which is never any fun. The play is probably just to try to find people either you trust or that other people can vouch for or do a test trade and have them craft something cheap for you first before you ask for the expensive item to be made.
---
Ionos will snap his fingers and 50% of beta characters will be erased.
---
They specifically said in an interview released yesterday that despite layering there will be population caps. They may have a few layers per realm, but it may be 3k layer caps with a maximum of three layers as an example. They’re also going away in a couple months, so it will just be a road bump before it’s moved down to one layer (a normal server)
---
Shamelessly came here to say that I copied your desktop now. All be it I have the Vanilla launch screen in the middle of those two elementals. Thanks for sharing!
---
It doesn't use the Windows desktop at all I don't think, sometimes when I boot my PC I see the default background for brief moment before it loads up.
---
Obviously they will be erased, it's a beta
---
Ahah this is great fun but so damn inefficient farming honor
---
So sad...
---
I owned the game at launch but didnt have an account till 2007. When i think game time cards were made?
---
You wouldnt say that if you knew what you're talking about
---
Good luck everyone! Hope at least one of us gets in lmao.
---
It originated as a sound clip but I believe it was the animation that made it really popular
---
Got to give credits to Laintime though. When vurtne nearly beat that rank 14 warrior at lvl 57....
---
Thanks for the tips msg me if you find any canadian retailers if you find anything, if its not too much trouble
---
Yep, exactly
---
I just mean from a practical standpoint simply sharding the first 5 levels wouldn't solve anything when everyone would the the 5-20 zones at the sameish times. If their goal is to ease the playability at launch then that would be the only way to do it.
---
Then you are conflating sharding with layering.
---
Hi, /u/secret-tacos
---
Probably a pretty small amount considering you have to specifically go and opt into this beta.
---
Miles better than the sharding approach and short term so it's fine.
---
No prob, feel free to.
---
I have a brother 4 years older and we have almost no common interests. Sounds like you made some amazing memories. FOR THE ALLIANCE!!
---
Don't get why people are so eager to bend over for a company that has already provenly fucked us over more than once. 
---
People like this guy would rather make lines in the sand instead of realize that if they start doing shit to fuck us over again, literally the only thing we can do and say is "We aren't going to play" and then not play. Making a joke out of people who tried to leverage that is just a sad indicator of what will happen the next time Kotick rubs his hands together.
---
Yea it's 10 or 15 min min, I don't remember exactly
---
if you stay subscribed the entire time and purchase 1 game token every week i heard you get to keep your boosted beta character.
---
Everything will be erased.
---
Changed in cata
---
You will keep em, same as your subscribtion without getting beta.
---
But they woulnd't really care if they didn't say "ill be back when it chills out" right?
---
&gt;Also if I understood layering correctly, will not prevent the community from developing....A layer is basically a server on it's own.
---
A server where you might not run into the same person twice ever due to them logging onto another shard thats the problem.
---
Next up : someone changes the last panel to say 'WoW Classic Beta Invitation'
---
Honestly I’m pissed they aren’t running the new servers on dual one-core Xeons with 2GB of RAM.
---
You sound like a Maga brain dead
---
Okay well I literally watched Tips jebait WoW Classic load screen with flashing account name type bar STRAIGHT OFF OF YOUTUBE...they know exactly what they are doing. You can’t bundle all streamers together but your outlook on this so naive, these boys are baiting views, dont be too sheeple to realize how you got there yourself. The draw to Classic is strong but dont get jebaited this deep.
---
Edit: and im all for these guys putting super hype titles to their streams, but earlier today you could look for classic streams and if you never clicked on an actual stream I would challenge for you to prove that WoW Classic Beta WASNT out just based on the stream titles
---
You can’t read that?
---
Don't sign up and you won't have a chance at one. Not that hard to avoid it. Unless you signed up, in which case... Why?
---
It's also super easy to stream snipe and troll without sharding so I feel the streaming community isnt going to get too big.
---
Perfectly imbalanced - as all things should be in WoW.
---
It will be. Everybody on the internet loves to scream that the sky is falling. Nothing is changing for you. I was actually already subbed and have been gritting my teeth playing BFA waiting for classic.
---
Unsettling
---
Can't we just go back to the simpler times?
---
It’s happened before on Pservers . Never doubt the power of weaponized autism.
---
Good on you. Really, really nice thing to do.
---
Good luck to them. I think the server queue boss might have other plans.
---
So any thoughts on specs to go with at launch? I want to eventually go with a PI spec a)for PvP and b) because I just like the skill. But I'm thinking I may need to go a bit deeper into holy at least during phase 1. I'm thinking a 26/25 build should be sufficient?
---
I wont ill chat to people maybe get a level 1 hogger raid rolling group up and earn some money to make a guild maybe go fight the horde? Natural fun where im not told "this is fun so do it" by blizzard.
---
M15+ is pug tier atm as an fyi lol

---
I appreciate the advice, but I want to experience the game under my own direction. I'm just trying to learn about how to talent/gear my character, so I'm more effective doing whatever I decide to do.
---
&gt;	Yeah, which is a lot of the leveling process and it's the whole game.
---
It’s definitely not the whole game. Not even close. The leveling process is longer than retail, but you’re way off base with that statement.
---
And the Alliance is doing the same thing....
---
This is a big change since Vanilla wow. There are far more people that are interested in mix/maxing and doing things quickly rather than enjoy the ride. World firsts and leveling guides became big in the expansions, but people took their time with Vanilla WoW as they figured the game out.
---
Ironically rogue tier 0 is also good for feral druids pre-raid.
---
Have had Staysafe on in the background. He hasn't said anything like that. He keeps saying they must have delayed the release and he has no idea when it's coming on.
---
I know those feels my pc is also old so currently working towards the same so I can at least play the current game haha I miss it D: I believe you can do it !!
---
They will be equal just as often as they would be at any other percentage I made the circles though no?  This is just easier to look at.
---
Also, I explained this under the circle itself.
---
Fuck id beg for sharding the starting zones at this point, I dont want either but sharding starting zones is the lesser of 2 evils. 
---
Instead we sharding the whole world yo.
---
It’s perfectly viable for no lifers, you don’t really need much gear for MC once you hit 60.
---
It's like they're shitting directly on the chest of the Vanilla experience tbh
---
Hi, /u/mrplow3
---
Because 10 thousands players in one zone arent just going to disappear whenever they go over to the next zone
---
You can make macros and change their icons. For stuff like healing touch the lower ranks have completely different cast times and coefficients. They are basically different spells like the priest equivalent.
---
Aaaaaaand where's the problem exactly? 
---
Good for them, if they have so much free time. 
---
We knew that the content was going to be cleared fast. It is a game that it has been played before and, unless you are a new player, everyone knows what to do.
---
Personally, I will take my time. I don't want to rush things in classic.
---
The sky is falling in gaming.. Either you werent around in the golden age of gaming (98-2010) or you are just being willfully ignorant. The governments in many countries are actually intervening because it's getting so bad.
---
Anyone calling Perplexity awful has clearly not watched it. You simply hate it because it's a private server without paying any respect to the **massive** difference in gameplay quality.  
---
Perhaps you are more casual and just want to watch someone putting up big numbers in BGs. I prefer PvP videos that show me new tricks I haven't seen before that I can then apply in my own gameplay. Perplexity's gameplay is full of them.
---
&gt; Seems like overkill and will hurt wpvp, node farming, rare mobs, aoe farming. Just going to mess up the end game to much. It would be much less impactful and be equally helpful if it was just the early areas.
---
How?
---
&gt; How? If the layer IDs arent exposed externally, it wont be possible for an addon to reliably tell you which layer you or other players are on.
---
Side-channels, same as always. Addons would coordinate with other people using the same addon and determine through side-channels who is on what layer, assign them arbitrary values, and then you will quickly know who is on what layer.  
---
I'm aware this sounds like guesswork, but the fact is that shard-management-addons for cross-shard-hopping already exist. In the worst case scenario, you'd just have an addon which would allow you to quickly join the group of anyone with the same addon to swap to their layer and leave group. You would rapidly do this until a random player gets you onto another layer.  
---
Regardless of whether it's round-robin or just a modified RR-based load balancing, you could swap layers in most cases by just logging out and logging back in.
---
Most of these big streamers WILL get in. They were invited last week to Blizzard Headquarters. You're nuts if you think they won't. They were probably told they would.
---
Godddd.... That --- looks --- epic. I only wish WE would work on the lock &amp; welcome screens, when using Start Menu in fullscreen mode, and if it could be set as a background for Start Menu in desktop mode.
---
the fuck you need proof for they did it before on 1x

---
so many memories on that bridge man..
---
From what I've read most speed levelers cand do it in around 4 days played, it's not hard to put up with a week of only a few hours of sleep to make this possible, should try watching the Deadman tournament for osrs those guys do this shit every couple months
---
They got sharded into another server
---
Merge 'em. Way better solution:
---
Affects less people
---
Is a one time thing as opposed to a months long program
---
Not nearly as destructive
---
The July theory was retarded to begin with tbh
---
Private server players are so droll
---
&gt;1. World PvP is not going to ramp up significantly until honor rewards in Phase 2 (when layering is done).
---
Lol world pvp will ramp up literally days into launch when people start to flood into contested zones. World pvp is at its peak during the leveling process.

---
Accepting defeat is something you're all too familiar with, it sounds like.
---
hello realm transfers
---
That's the stress test.
---
What the fuck lol
---
Better to buy a dividend ETF and ride it.
---
You're wrong. Watch the dev interview with Ion, around 4:45 minutes in, he specifically says that Layers address the problem of having ~1k people in Elwynn Forest.  
---
That means if you want ~20 people on average per Elwynn, you'd need 50 diff layers. It'd be trivially easy to swap between them or log out/log in to change layers.  
---
Your guesswork is as pathetic as your insult of "sperging out." You don't even do compsci shit -- you have no idea of how this would likely be coded. Anyone who codes for a living can tell you that the way this is implemented is obvious and it's bad.
---
Thats ridicilous. "You only know what youre talking about if you agree with me" is not really a good ground to debate on.
---
But layering is sharding... Its just on a large scale.
---
Its not an asshole move its the essense of pvp servers
---
If you dont enjoy that dont play on a pvp server. 
---
I don't even go out of my way to gank lowbies. But having been ganked by higher levels in the past has created some of the best friends i've made in an online game.
---
This is pointless anyway.
---
Paid server transfers just destroy server communities regardless and they've already said they're coming because they were in Vanilla.

---
You’re telling me, and I typically like getting shit on my chest. This is absurd.
---
Yes, 26/25 is a very very good build for phase 1 to help out a ton with mana. I'll absolutely be going with that.
---
They are mana inefficient compared to the other healers, but there is a spec for healing touch that makes it a lot more competitive. 
---
Stuff like regrowth is just ridiculously bad for mana.
---
What about PVP ?
---
It’s not really as complicated as it sounds, you’re mostly just going to use 1 or 2 ranks of a spell in a single fight
---
Nah Bruh.... I win the noob award.
---
Here we are in fricken **BWL** on Ebonroc and look what I have on my #1 keybind. I was a Warlock... /facepalm
---
[https://imgur.com/rGevElG](https://imgur.com/rGevElG)
---
Wait why? Giving us a server exactly the same a copy paste of what they have but just remove the layer function. Let us choose to deal with it if we would like to deal with it.
---
Everyone got killed at the start of Cata and put in the nearest graveyard.
---
Can't decide between Priest and Warrior. Leaning Dwarf Priest. Love Dwarves and really enjoy healing. Also love tanking. Might just have to roll both lol
---
Ganking low levels at a FP isn't pvp,  its childish and pathetic
---
Why? They said summer lol, how were we supposed to know they meant the last day of summer?
---
esfand, tipsout, and staysafe have been circle jerking each other until this moment
---
That's essentially what layering is. Look at this quote:
---
"... We're going to continue that process over the first few weeks, until eventually we will collapse down - and we promise we will do this, a few weeks in - to a single world per realm, no sharding, none of that going forward. We know that needs to happen before we do something like turn on the world bosses for example..."
---
What's the difference between that and what you want, except for having 10 names for servers, to be reduced down to 1?
---
Imagine bashing technology that you don't understand nor can comprehend :)))
---
Take screenshots, post on Reddit and Blizzard Forums. Also say in Trade that XYZ is a scammer and you have screenshots (title of post, source of post). If they are in a guild, PM people in the guild until you get to the GM or an Officer and send them screenshots as well.
---
To avoid it from happening, use someone from your guild or from a reputable guild (one that is progressing pretty far). Typically pretty safe. Worst case, inspect someone who has the lionheart helm (as an example) and see who made that and then contact that person.
---
EDIT: If you get scammed from someone in a guild, spam Trade about that person (with the source of screenshots) and say they are in Guild XYZ as well. Decreasing the reputation of their guild as well and labeling them all as scammers. it's a bit extreme, but may be able to get all your mats/gold equivalent/item back.
---
Can I see players on shard; Whoops sorry *layer* 2 when im on layer 1? No? Then its sharding by another name. If you make it so I cant see every person in that world in that spot and that point its sharding not matter what you call it.
---
My first char in vanilla I moved my bow to the action bar and couldn't figure out why it wouldn't auto when I clicked it so I deleted him and made a Paladin lol.
---
ITS CRAZY NEW WoW CLASSIC NEWS AND...I’ll tell you why nobody likes him, but only if I get 50 upvotes first
---
Okay, sure they can just add a bunch of extra servers instead of layers.        
---
But what happens when a server dies? 
---
Does the server you chose get merged with another or the other way around?
---
What about player names? Who gets to keep theirs and who has to change theirs?
---
Take my upvote. We are in the same boat ;)
---
You realize summer ends in mid to late September, right?
---
Fake! It can‘t be from classic your hunter has focus it was not used in vanilla!!! Just kidding
---
Rogue is nice cause energy is a fast auto-generated resource so you don't need to worry about mana or generating rage. Just thinking about how you want to use the next couple ticks of energy.
---

---
The War campaign lore is actually really fun. Other than that yeah it's shit.
---
It's called entertainment.
---
Yes, exactly: a prince. So technically not a lord.
---
Ion did specifically say this in an interview:
---
He could be lying, of course. But at least he's put down a promise to be broken instead of "we'll see."
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;t=3m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;t=3m53s)
---
Unfortunately no, as that's not how sharding works either. There won't just be 1 devilsaur unique across all layers since there are unique mobs per layer. There won't just be 1 set of herbs across all layers.
---
i hate streamers exactly for this :-) glad they got rekt by blizzard delay with the beta :D
---
Pretty much ruins the game for me. I want to play with all the players not a very small select few.
---
&gt; From what I've gathered, the technological improvements won't help too much.
---
In Ion's interview, he literally said "we could support a 1k player Elwynn Forest. The technology is there, it just wouldn't be fun."
---
If him not mistaken there have been post here people asking how to get the white raptor as an UD before they got removed and people said you couldn't get exalted as an Undead before that.
---
I was wrong, i did not see the new interview, so i retract what i said earlier. This i am fine with.
---
Why can't layering be only starting zones and only for a couple weeks like the original proposal though? I see no downsides.
---
Dwarf priests are always in super high demand.  Fear ward is really good particularly in early raiding.
---
Yes. These were in vanilla. They also had a 6 month cooldown I believe. So you better act right on your destination server or prepare for 6 months of hell.
---
#goodbye
---
Please keep going. I need more screenshots for my friends to laugh at
---
If I get beta access, I want to be as beneficial as possible, but also don't want to burn myself out in the beta before Classic comes out, so... what would you guys recommend:
---
Should I play my main Vanilla class the same exact way so I can have an easier time spotting inconsistencies and reporting them to Blizzard or...
---
Should I play a class that would be my last choice so that come Classic, I won't have to "repeat" what I did in the beta?
---
With that said, I will not be too upset if I don't get into the beta - other people want it more than me, so I hope they get in. I will wait for them to test the game for me so that for Classic release I can enjoy it to the fullest :)
---
Ice cream and candy are not the same, but they are both sweet junk food.  
---
Addons allow you to swap shards and will definitely allow you to swap layers. You're naive.
---
Sure dude. I'm sure your group of 100 people will all be 60 with 300 profs in a few weeks with zero competition. Your attempt at creating fake outrage is comical though.
---
Dude I literally don’t know where to start with this actual gibberish.  If you shown some form of intelligence or at the very least looked like you grasped these concepts even remotely I would attempt to explain it to you.  But I honestly think there may be something wrong with you
---
F&amp;F doesn't get keys, it's added to the [battle.net](https://battle.net) associated with an email you give them. IDK which blizzard employee you asked, but it probably wasn't one.
---
layers are servers
---
in retail a realm has 1 server that connects to 1 database, in classic a realm has multiple servers that connect to 1 database
---
I got my original collector's edition on my shelf.
---
In 2004:  $70 on sale from GameStop.com.
---
Today:  Last I saw one, it was about $3000 unopened.
---
It's open, but all the contents are still wrapped and in pristine condition.  Value?  I have no idea, but...
---
Claiming my Mini Diablo on August 27?  Priceless.
---
360 is a bit low for a +7 now. They increased the scaling of M+ when the new season started.
---
casual vs hardcore is more an attitude than a playtime thing.
---
Do you think there is anything worth checking out other than that? I was considering leveling my 110 DH to cap since I haven't played since Legion. Or is it really not even worth the time?
---
I suspect this to be true as well
---
If this is actually how it works, I don't get why they wouldn't just limit servers to less players and have more servers?
---
&gt; The governments in many countries are actually intervening
---
Not in my country.
---
How does that work? I mean my understanding is the layers are only created if needed you aren’t permanently on a single layer, there is a merge at phase 1 so need a little more info on how that works if they are seperate as you say
---
According to my email history, I fell for an account stealing scam by some yahoo.com email acting like it was Blizzard. I legit gave them all my account info immediately. I got my character back but holy shit I can’t believe how naive and young I was to fall for that
---
It's almost like people have different opinions. Do you expect a community to agree on everything?
---
&gt; the decision to switch from dedicated servers to P2P was a travesty.
---
We talking about console or PC? COD 4 and 5 were both P2P on console. Not sure about COD 1-3 since I didn't play those
---
Awesome! I'll probably give it a go :)
---
Yeah, the list sucks. They take the people from it months in advance without telling anyone. They control the order so if they only invite, say, 5 people from the list they control the order, but they obviously have no idea how many will be invited.
---
Fair enough
---
Make 10 copies of Doomhammer. Doomhammer(1) through Doomhammer(10). Make me select which one I want to play, and then I can only interact with people on that server until the subservers are merged into the ultimate Doomhammer.  
---
It's like layering except you can't swap layers on demand to evade PvP, farm herbs, get quest mobs, get black lotuses, kill devilsaurs, etc. You can't abuse it. You're stuck on 10 unique servers as-big-as a Vanilla server and then they're merged down when their pop lowers.
---
I've reported the eye guy at least for misleading title
---
That’s a long winded way of saying you like to stare at booty while you play.
---
I'm definitely not sobbing while i'm at work. Definitely not.
---
Rest in peace to your brother &lt;3.
---
I'm totally with you on this. Sharding seemed like the worst idea ever came from Blizzard but layering just tops it.
---
Just let me summon an Ancient and I’ll be happy.
---
As someone with a deep understanding of graph theory, you don't need to worry about that. It's not a problem.
---
Damn, an Internet relic :/ F
---
Luckily I still got 28 days left this year. I'm still debating if it's worth to take two full weeks...
---
It's fairly easy to imagine them limiting who to those you can interact with, ie layer, just as they could chat. 
---
First half your assuming that there is a possibility, which I can't imagine any api calls that would even let it be a possibility to create such a mod
---
I don't really have time for streams anymore. Used to watch YouTube highlights of the hearthstone big shots. Kripp, etc. For wow classic, all about frostadamus and madseasonshow. Kargoz is ait but his 'tallboy drinking army dork' schtick gets a little old. I still like him though.
---
You're assuming every single person will have a shit ton of friends on different layers to teleport them to a different layer. A lot of people just might end up on the same layer. There also might be some kind of combat timer introduced so you can't just get invited and teleported. AND most people won't even reach STV in a couple of weeks. I really dont get this doomsday talk, as if layering for 2-3 weeks is the end all be all of Classic.
---
I do not and I haven't played retail since wotlk. I am pretty sure in vanilla Undead couldn't get exalted before the white raptor got removed. 
---
And stop with the personal attacks your argument doesn't get more credibility that way.
---
And here I'm thinking which class to play. No idea what to play since I've never played Vanilla haha
---
I don't need to find my friend. He invites me to his group and I instantly phase over, then I say "thanks" and leave group now that I'm in his layer. Easy peasy.  
---
Also I dunno why you think I'd get ganked. I expect to hit 60 in the first week. Even if I do get ganked, why should I care? I'm an ex-2x gladiator (s3/s8) playing Mage (s3)/Rogue (s8). I have literally zero fear of being ganked by someone around my level.  
---
Plus, due to layers, higher level zones will be completely barren. I'll leave the reasoning as an exercise to the reader.
---
My point, that you clearly missed, is that we don't have to simply accept anything as you said we should. We can push the devs to make this change and the more we talk about wanting the change the higher the chance it will happen.
---
If I plan on using one spec for warrior DPS in PvE/PvP, should I go fury or arms? Arms I would go 2H but is dual wielding better for fury or can I use 2H for either spec?
---
There's been nothing to indicate that's true.
---
It was added in 1.11, classic build is basically 1.12
---
Saying the technology isn't there is a memejoke? Okay.  
---
Go back to saying "&lt;.&lt;" dog. Only little kids like these modern memes. Do you actually subscribe to youtube celebrities, too?  
---
I can't imagine I'm younger than you. Did you even play actual classic, or did the M rating scare off your parents?
---
Dude, no one is saying Pat’s video was filled with pvp skill. Its one of the greatest pvp videos because its filled with vanilla time cliches. And everyone loves the nostalgia. There’s a million pserver videos like that you linked to watch some goober show off his uber skills in a 15 year old game.
---
Honestly, it really doesn't matter, with the streaming of assets the client supports it will take you 20 min to download to a playable state and you can download the rest as you play.
---
Was on Illidan back in the day. Moved to Emerald Dream.  Was in a guild called Resilience. Need a good way of looking up old guildies.
---
I reported the bug with looting that flask in Orgimmar for horde, it didn't get fixed :)
---
No he's right. People will literally get 1 quest done per hour. It's not a good thing.
---
Ion did say that, "as players spread out more we can increase the number of players in each layer, while reducing the number of layers needed to run that realm". That might not mean only 50ish players per starting zone, but then again maybe it could.
---
Thats not what Im saying, but what he said is just wrong if layering works as promised (and he obviously doesnt know how its supposed to work). There will still be competition for mob tags, you will still see the same names in westfall that you saw in northshire.
---
LOL. No, I’ve normally got my toons transmogged where you really can’t see a whole lot.
---
That would be cool, when I play OSRS I use runelite which lets me get toggle better graphics. 
---
A toggle or mod for better graphics would be cool, but a custom client or mod could be used for exploits so blizzard will probably need to make it themselves which probably won't happen.
---
Apparently there are lots of people on this sub that have access to someone inside Blizzard. :)
---
There's still a month left before summer ends. I'm as bummed as everyone else that it isn't earlier, but the July theory started from a character named July in a screenshot shown at Blizzcon to show their testing. People on this sub decided that "no, it isn't from the July testing build they were using earlier that year", but instead that Blizzard was teasing the release date for a game they were nowhere close to remotely finishing.. then some dipshit looked at the character level of a different screenshot from testing and decided level 16 means they were teasing a July 16th release date.. All of that, or a testing build from July earlier that year.. you tell me which sounds more likely.
---
I appreciate your positivity but RP really doesn’t work like that, the good type is the RP you stumble across randomly and consistently. RP guilds that play on non-RP servers have always sucked in every situation I’ve ever witnessed. You could liken RP guilds on non-RP servers to be the equivalent of someone being on a PvP server and only ever doing PvP when it’s ganking someone who comes into their capital city and then just sticking to dungeons the rest of the time
---
BFA Arathi Basin changes the whole map of the battleground thats not possible to simply turn on/off. Only graphics like shadows, water quality ect
---
Would that be classic like? Blizz is going for accuracy
---
I'm sorry but you're inherently wrong. A pvp realm is a WAR you're activly trying to stop the other side from leveling so you can slow down their side from being the dominate side once actual pvp kicks off
---
I suggest you don't roll pvp realm if you don't understand that
---
I misunderstood you.       
---
There's still no reason they wouldn't limit it though.      
---
Just because they CAN do it doesn't mean they will.
---
cause when you say summer everyone thinks of the astronomical summer ye.
---
Damn, luckily my impulse buy was a good thing.
---
Reminds me of [I am a BG PvPer](https://biggerthankologarn.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-am-bg-pvper.html).
---
What's the reach of the average person on this subreddit? Which one do you think will more likely lead to a more popular and successful game, you or asmongold?
---
There are 3 things that are very different about classic than the healing you are used to:
---
1. You have less mana at your disposal, so use the lowest cost heal that will do the job.  Renew is great for this, but casting a lower rank of a spell accomplishes the same thing.  The problem this causes is action bar space.  I generally run with 3 different ranks of flash heal and 3 different ranks of greater heal on my main action bar as a priest.
---
2. Mana regen works differently.  You want to cast as few spells as possible so you can get your full mana regen.  Every time you cast a spell, for 5 seconds after that your mana regens at a much lower rate.  This leads more experienced healers to cancel-cast using some type of interrupt macro (I put mine on mouse 4).  There are a lot of ways to handle this, but essentially you can queue up a Healing Touch, and if the tank does not take any damage before it is done casting, cancel it by clicking the /interrupt macro or taking a step forward.
---
3. You have to be ready for your tank to make a mistake and take a big spike of damage.  Warrior tanks for example have to have a spell called "Shield Block" up every time they take damage from a boss or they will get crit and might very well die.  This leads to some very chaotic and stressful healing, so you almost always have to have a heal queue'd up on a tank if they have boss aggro.
---
Hope you are ready for a thrill.  Healing in Classic and BC was the best time I ever had.  Cheers  :)
---
&gt; blizz is always late.
---
It's called 'Soon'.
---
I honestly don’t really believe in any timeline they give out right now. I don’t think it’ll ever be removed if it launches with it
---
PC - CoD4 had dedicated servers with promods and cool stuff, then MW2 comes and no mods, no server selection. forced matchmaking sucks ass.
---
I mean....yes?  When youre talking about a date for something it would make sense to use the dates that are listed on a calendar.
---
Why did you stop at 50 hrs/week? Are you going to post the hardcore chart later?
---
Kalimdor is pretty open between the zones in most respects, not as easy to setup choke points, with the exception being Stonetalon Mountains, and to a lesser extent Shimmering Flats to Tanaris
---
There's something to be said for the road between Tanaris and Un'goro, and more so from the one between Un'goro and Silithus, but it's kind of shaky since anyone with slow fall can just jump into the crater from about a mile stretch of the abutment between Tanaris and Un'goro.
---
Entrance to RFD, because of that cave. You can shut down the Alliance from ever even getting close to entering that dungeon. I did it back in the day until a GM asked me nicely if I would consider letting them through but ultimately couldn't force me to do so because I wasn't breaking any rules.
---
Eastern Kingdoms is the land of ganking Alliance. Chokepoints abound.
---
Elwynn-&gt;Redridge.
---
Duskwood-&gt;STV, nice choke point there.
---
Bridge between Wetlands-&gt;Arathi Highlands
---
The road leading from Hillsbrad-&gt;Hinterlands
---
Choke point between Redridge-&gt;Burning Steppes
---
Choke point between Badlands-&gt;Searing Gorge
---
Choke point between Tirisfal-&gt;WPL, the "Bulwark" is a good place to fight Ally gankers trying to ambush Horde. Also there's a chokepoint between Hillsbrad and WPL leading up to Andorhal which is more likely to be traveled by Alliance players getting to WPL than to expect for them to go through Tirisfal/Bulwark.
---
Bridge between WPL-&gt;EPL
---
The big door entrances on either side of Blackrock Mountain that connect from Searing Gorge to Burning Steppes
---
Entrance to BRD, small little stonework doorway there that leads into the cavern toward the portal.
---
Deadwind Pass is a pretty great spot since the whole zone is basically a big choke point between Duskwood and Swamp of Sorrows.
---
As well the choke point between Swamp of Sorrows to Blasted Lands.
---
meh, that's actually not bad.  thanks for the info.  but ya fuck battlegrounds
---
Do we live in some invite scarcity world where if Blizzard wastes one on someone that won't play, they're unable to offer another account access later? It's not like they're sending hard disk copies in limited quantities, incurring cost and delay when people fail  to use them. Seems the work of minutes to flag as many or as few accounts as they'd like, without too much risk or hassle.
---
Still get 6 days of stress test. Better then demo imo
---
There's some country where it's super difficult to pay blizzard, even if you have the money. For example, it's near impossible in Maghreb. They have to get sub cards in France
---
Orc female model is probably one of my favorite.  Probably made 5 female orcs in my wow time.
---
don't give me that sanctimonious bullshit, no other beta blizzard has done has required sub.
---
this is a cash grab.
---
im not bashing the technology and i understand it, i've played other games that work the same way
---
it just doesn't work for recreating the same experience we're trying to rebuild here
---
that's the calendar summer.  The  meteorological summer (which feels more like real summer, after all the longest day is in JUNE, not in July ) starts on June 1st and ends august 31st.   It's very much appropriate to call august 27 the VERY END of summer, even with traditional calendar 'summer.'
---
Don't forget working with blizzard to get ppl hyped for beta so they pay subs to not get a key xD
---
Agree with you 100%. Every one should be allowed to experience whatever pleasures and sofistication the world / technology provides us. Extreme poverty, famin, curable diseases should not plague the world as they do. Now think with me for a bit, if you had the power to help other people knowing you could not help everyone what would you do? I'd say ir would be fair to assume you would help the ones in a more difficult situation first and then go from there. Now, we both know there are people in need of food and medicine and that some of that people in need die on a daily basis on a count of lacking those items, correct? I'm going to assume you are also aware that any amount as low as 15$ could feed and thus allow people to live, at least for a little more, or provide remedy for an illness and cure a person. 
---
Knowing this how do you feel about giving those same 15$ to someone so that they can play a video game?
---
This is textbook "first world problems"...
---
They indeed will. Blizzard did not oficially said that, that is why we got all those layering infos from "interviews". But what had been said this is temporary solution not because of some time gating but because of population. So theoretically if the pop stays at 15k, realms stay layered. Have fun with this mirrored reality.
---
for about the past year.
---
Raiding or no raiding?
---
This had more views than weird Al's original video at some point it was great.
---
Classic Wow releasing on May 119th!
---
Im not desputing how things would work. Im disputing his "if you knew anything you wouldnt think that".. meaning the guy literally says you cant have a different preferance.
---
So are there any confirmed invites for certain groups of folks?  
---
Who got in so far?
---
this is such a shit post, do you seriously think that these large respected streamers are watching videos of vanilla do make them "look as if they are playing", no, its literally just filler to hold people over until it releases.
---
Lol many would do it
---
lol oops I made a lot of money, hilarious!
---
This will most likely be the case. It is going to mainly be why people watch the streamer that makes people stay or go. People like Asmongold and Soda probably won't see a drop since most people watch for the personality. Other smaller streamers probably will move away from it if the gameplay isn't interesting. The Method streamers as an example will probably only have a large view count when they are working on the raids.
---
I was an original beta tester for virgin Wow.
---
Never played an MMORG before IN MY LIFE.
---
Read about the game on some forums, kept reading, going back, learned that they, Blizzard, had hired some of the actual players as developers -- and applied.
---
Had the best time of my life, scared as hell, had no clue where to go for what quest / where or when.
---
Gave them good insight from a virginal point of view.  :)
---
Told them that as a virgin to gaming, I was completely addicted, enamored, and loved to explore.
---
I sound like most of the WoW players who simply love the game and it's options.
---
Streamers -- GO.  We'll find out way, in our own good time.
---
lmao are you being serious?  Grow up.
---
Most of his opponents were EXTREMELY bad.
---
Correct. I was just saying who it was. He’s the heir to Al’akir’s throne at the time.
---
Streamer shilling at it's finest.
---
I love that dude
---
&gt; Do we live in some invite scarcity world where if Blizzard wastes one on someone that won't play, they're unable to offer another account access later? 
---
Invites numbers for betas are typically finite. I work in an industry with software betas and early customer adoption. I'm not saying Blizzard couldn't create more if they needed to. I'm saying why would they put themselves through the extra work of figuring out roughly how many folks didn't take the beta invite vs how much can they oversaturate the servers with players if they end up with more than what they expected. 
---
&gt; Seems the work of minutes to flag as many or as few accounts as they'd like, without too much risk or hassle.
---
Corporations make easy couple of minute changes take weeks.
---
Leader vs Follower mentality.
---
What makes you assume that I wouldn't be the person replacing low performers?
---
2h fury is ok on Horde, at least till high level gear. It's poor-ok in alliance.   
---
There is no real way to compromise between pvp/pve dps spec for warrior. You simply chose one or the other. MS sucks for PvE, Bloodthirst sucks for PvP. If you are in a decent raiding guild typically you outgear everyone so much in normal BGs and PvP that being the wrong spec doesn't really matter.
---
If only you were smart enough to have sent your 50k to Nigerian Prince; he would've doubled your money so you could afford !TWO! keys.
---
Last day of summer?  Last day of summer for school kids a week later maybe.  Dumbass
---
I hope it all comes back. I used to play on RP PVP emerald dream what what! But I remember it always falling apart in global and trade. 
---
The real question is, do I take this as a sign to go back to school for my masters? I mean I want to really relive that experience ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Level slowly, check questing bottlenecks and object respawns. See someone looting a quest item? If you know how long it takes to respawn you can kill a few mobs inbetween the tries.
---
Check the first few levels if you want to play a weak early class, any  issues with harder mobs or quests? Does any mob have some overly deadly abilities?
---
If you want do level as a human in Auberdine or the other way around, do the death warps work? Would suck to die halfway through and get ported into the wrong direction.
---
Speed levelers are gonna go hard from the start and try to optimize their route, but maybe for normal players it's better to play very slowly as to not burn out.
---
I also wonder how exactly I should approach it should I get an invite.
---
This is so sad and bad :'(((
---
Let's say you play at 4:30 am, with crazy easy nodes, and never see anyone else.
---
That they will never do a Vanilla WoW server and that it was impossible to do.
---
Lol that was a joke
---
They have been pretty good when they actually give us information!
---
There's a million people streaming. This isn't the place to advertise personal streams.
---
No, but my contacts say he will get beta any minute now...
---
I don't see a problem here.....
---
I gave up on one of his video's where he listed X quests to do in X zone...  And there were like 7 or 8 missing -- quests that give good green / blue rewards.
---
Those who do -- play.  Those who can't play -- preach.
---
I'm a playa.
---
I can't wait to watch the "he stole me loot" threads.
---
Raiding for sure
---
Just wanted to mention that phase 1 will be filled with these raids because that is the only phase without DHKs. So layering will absolutely impact it in that time
---
Out of respect for a ton of patients, they beg to differ in that cancer is pretty easy to say. Not saying this to belittle your well wishes to original commenter, as I also wish him/her the best and experience genuine sympathy AND empathy for them. Just sticking up for other folks who have terminal issues without extravagant names. See you all in Azeroth.
---
There is a few things that at least in my opinion signals that you don't truely understand exactly what layering does / what purpose it serves.
---
The concept of layering itself is pretty easy to understand. You have a world, and once that world is filled up, you make a new one. The catch to this is the fact that by the exact wording of the developers, this is done on a WORLD scale, not map scale. This also means that you're realistically looking at anywhere between 1000-3000 players per layer, and given the cap is likely to be anywhere between 3000-6000, its easy to see that at worst you are looking at a temporary 2 - 6 layers which doesn't really take away from your immersion, especially given that for all you know, you're within a very living world.
---
I think it is extremely easy to let your mind go wild, but I think the truth is that there are limits to layers, and those are imposed by the population cap and the numbers set per layer. There won't be a hundred layers.  
---
Layers won't solve queues, layers are in place so that the cap on the servers can be high enough so that you won't sit in a 2 hour queue at launch, but so that you can also play... I would be very surprised if we see more than 3 layers in total.
---
They could always change their mind if enough people complain, they do seem to be listening.
---
"Muscle"brah said "classic was really shit" and did a full 180 randomly and wont stop talking about it
---
Ah okay, so if I choose PvE over PvP then I should probably just go dual wield fury? I plan on raiding every week
---
No, you were genuinely a moron, so Reddit downvotes you.
---
4pm PDT happens when this comment is 1 hour and 36 minutes old.

---
Current retail WoW is a completely different game.
---
Every single class has been rebuilt from the ground up. 
---
The only thing it has in common are the names of NPCs. 
---
Some things changed for the better, but a lot changed for the worse.
---
Alodar is the best WoW streamer imo, nice dude, mature dude, legit loves his community, and goes out of his way to just hang out and talk with them.
---
Well, there is that "Vanilla" warrior who clicks as he tanks.  /s  
---
And he still gets 30 views a night.
---
Just sayin'.
---
Or it's at the same hour than the release, 12am CEST.
---
Someone said the economies of each layer are seperate, made no sense. Blizzard can do w/e they want coding wise. They are smart lol
---
Yikes. I know it’s different but I never gave thought to how much. I quit before cata released so I’m in the dark
---
Good Bot.
---
You're not going to get a ton, or really any, benefit from ultra wide in WoW. With complete mouse control of the camera and zoom at all times peripheral vision is really never a problem. I think if I had ultra wide I'd probably run WoW in a normal aspect window and then chuck a browser in the extra space - essentially a 2 monitor setup with no bezel. That browser for discord/database/addons is going to be way more handy than more fov in game.
---
retail = Raid Log Friends
---
unless you have a daily group for BGs/Mythic+
---
&gt;but also 3x as many consumers of those resources. 
---
not always. The demand will be set based on the total player count which is true, but think of the supply difference. If a server can normally hold 100 people and produce 10 of item X and the whole server pop has the demand to purchase 40, you'd drive the price up. Layering likely won't increase the whole server population by the maximum available for each layer as they are generated to reduce clutter in zone by creating a whole new layer. So while zone 1 may have 10 layers generated to accommodate clutter in zone 1, its also creating 10 zone 7's where item X is farmed and thus opening the gates for people to layer hop and farm zone 7's resouces without actually increasing demand for those resources. This drives down prices and hurts the economy. You wouldn't need 100 people across all levels for a new layer, just 100 people trying to get into zone 1. Those people may never get to the point of wanting item X.
---
I know man, I've been on the internet for a while, I know the formula. Step 1) be wrong, step 2) go on incoherent tirade about how everyone else is a retard and don't even attempt to address any points the other person has made
---
I get it man, but save it for people who it's going to work on
---
Instead of digging yourself into an increasingly childish hole, you can simply not reply. Good luck with all that champ
---
When Duskwood launched, what became my main through the rest of Vanilla was Prophet, gotta pay that $7 to have a shot at that name.
---
Cheat death? It's huge but sure the others are prob better.
---
Good bot
---
Those are rookie numbers am I right? ;) imagine a casual who only plays 7 hours/day
---
Someone needs to go to Wow, create a subscription account for the "level 20" content, and link it to Esfrand as "LIVE BETA TESTING" and just let him freak.
---
The old comics and the loot tables!
---
There’s a TV show of people watching other people watching TV, so why not?
---
Wtf, summer ends at the 30th
---
did your contact tell you?
---
Merging is way more destructive lmao
---
You’re getting entirely new people in the server as opposed to people that have been there.
---
What do you do in the case of similar names? Have everyone name change? Way more intrusive and destructive.
---
Merging affects the same amount of people because it affects the population of every server merged.
---
It’s a one time thing, but you’re guaranteed to have server downtime.
---
It’s way way more destructive, especially from a technical aspect.
---
Part me thinks classic wowheads just like being uppity snobs. It makes them feel some sort of l33t power over us who are having fun on retail. The current dungeons and raids are the best they've ever been, even famous vanilla players have admitted to this.
---
I was going troll for berserking for raid healing. Does it not help?
---
The day is already over.
---
I always like to have my first character/main on top, then everyone else in both level and alphabetical order.
---
I was so happy when they implemented that. The only character who's position never changes is my nelf rogue.
---
People will be maxed by day 4
---
Farming devilsaur and black lotus before then
---
He specifically said he understood and he wouldn't mess that up. 
---
They will only end the instancing if the population goes down....They're not going to do that if it doesn't.
---
Just like they went back on their word from the original QA
---
WHOOOSH
---
And the ACT reading is literally just reading what's in front of you and answering some basic and easy to answer questions from that reading. People who could not manage that, you're the type of person who needs to be sourcing their arguments.
---
Most substantive thing he said that whole QA and some how you forgot that...Mind boggling. ALl came back to me as I watched that clip
---
And do nothing as they always have done
---
It might be that I had "recap" instead of "recount"? I think maybe that 164.1 in the upper left is the meter (hey, it's a paladin). But it was a long time ago...
---
Ah, I didn't know the dungeons got harder. That makes a bit more sense.
---
I suggest remove layering.
---
No, it def isnt. Its only 2:30pm at blizzard headquarters
---
&gt; If you want do level as a human in Auberdine or the other way around, do the death warps work? 
---
Wait - there's a deathwarp as a human to Auberdine? I only know of the other way around, and that's to die at specific points as a Nelf in Wetlands to then be ported to the IF graveyard. As a human, I thought you have no choice but to bite the bullet and take the tram to IF, walk from IF to Loch Modan, Loch Modan to Wetlands, and then take the boat to Aubderdine.
---
And August 27th is when summer is almost over 😋

Classic wont go live until 6pm New York time in the US. Which is midnight for the EU. It wouldn't be surprising to see the beta go live at a similar time worldwide.
---
Hi, /u/plauud
---
Yes if you care about raiding at all you need to go fury. You can still have fun in PvP, and will still crush a lot of people in bad gear. You just won't be the go to MS bot for your guild's pvp premades (and probably only one guild in 30 even bothers with premades, pvp is overwhelmingly just for shiggles in Vanilla).
---
I don't really remember exactly. It was the Rend event in UBRS. You can skip some mobs by dropping down from a balcony. But if you get too close to a mob and then drop down, it trains through a bunch of other groups and you wind up with a bunch of groups attacking you down there. I guess (from the chat) that one of the guys accidentally aggroed a group before dropping down.
---
Thanks for the videos! Comes at the perfect time! 
---
I've been pvp'ing as a heal priest since BC and was just just starting to look up some info/ videos regarding healing classic pvp as a priest so I know what to expect. 
---
Is the standard raid spec a solid option for healing bg's?
---
Wrath added a 20 minute timer. They've had it at 25 or 20 minutes since. Honestly I rejoiced when they did that lol
---
The warrior in OP video. Pat was iconic to all fledgling warriors.

Hoping it would be embedded or something. Linked video is all three parts of “Tales of the past” by Martin Falch. ☺️
---
Nothing that I can provide upfront, I'm afraid. In most cases stat weights has been looked over, but a lot of times the items has been weighed through discussions. 
---
I don't really have any of that info backed up. Sorry.
---
That's a nice example of something that could happen. I wonder what the actual # of classic streamers do this, or are we cherry picking an exception and calling it the rule?
---
There a way to give the bot a biscuit for being such a good bot?
---
Ion said they will not have layering in phase 2. The Lawyer Speaker himself said it on camera... No way he would have if they were not serious about it.
---
Yes, sub gives you classic and everything on retail except BFA. Eventually BFA will be rolled into the sub but only after the next expansion launches.
---
Or just play a private server and say it's the beta.
---
Write your thesis on your servers economy, BOOM more WoW time.
---
Set a remind me here when people complain of sharding/layering still happening in the later stages. Blizzard will justify it having to be used during AQ events due to the servers not being able to handle it - similar to launch day. It's never going away now and will be used at their discretion. This is why if you don't stand up to it now, you've forever lost the war.
---
Still don't believe? Set a remindme bot to this post and you'll see I won't be wrong a year from now.
---
my fear for high or no cap on layers probably comes from how blizz is acting like there will be so many tourists, they'll think they need many many layers to deal with all the tourists, but in the end they will be spread out over most realms while all the long-time players will coordinate to roll the same server and the game will just feed them more and more layers because they're expecting 90% of those players to stop playing in a week
---
From the interview by StaySafeTV, a question is asked about when Thorium Point quest hub should be included. For some, it feels like it should have been there from the beginning, while others may want it to appear more closely as it did in the original patch cycle.
---
One thing that I really appreciate is that they want to know from the community and it really shows with this interview that they'd like to give WoW Classic the best experience possible, if slightly out of order to round out the experience on the onset.
---
Thoughts?
---
Yeah exactly! If you can find those people along the way you guys can barter goods and help each other out.
---
Wait a month after release and your suggestion will have been done.
---
"signature" seems like a backward word to use... "signature" spells were the spells in vanilla - no other expansions.
---
I'm glad you are honest 🙌🏻
---
Hope gurky makes it in then!
---
I made a post about this already, current ETA is 4pm PST (1.5 hours from now)
---
That's the opposite of pvp, that's being a dick and likely bad at the game since you can't fight people your own level.
---
Lvl 40 vs lvl 35 would be pvp, lvl 40 vs lvl 10 is not
---
I'm sorry for your loss but I'm thankful for your positivity and that beautiful story.
---
I hate displaying my own name, it's so weird having that text be almost static in the middle of the screen, when everything else moves
---
Hahaha that was good
---
WoW is PST-oriented when it comes to these kinds of things due to Blizzard being based out of California.
---
It helps. It's not very significant though. The racials mostly matter for PvP.
---
Leveling to cap and doing the war campaign are worth your time. The raids and dungeons also are pretty fun the first few times. 
---
I wouldnt recommend going out of your way to grind for gear though. Island Expeditions/Azerite in general are also pointless if you dont plan on doing high end raiding. World Quests are super boring and I'd only recommend doing them if it's a gear upgrade or you need the rep. 
---
PvP is okay I guess.
---
So are they sending out invites then or hows that work?
---
I am nowhere near hyper rich elite. Not even rich elite. Not rich. Not elite either. I drive a car from 2002 and live on a rental house which is bloody far from work but is what I can afford.
---
Yet, somehow, a video game is nowhere near close the best excitement source I've had for 10 years... 
---
I guess YMMV but, and I mean no disrespect, how ungrateful a living person that has unlimited access to internet has to be to find no beauty in the world we have the chance to be in right now.
---
Try to put things into perspective here: were you born on the wrong place during WW2 what would you think of the world? What would you be excited about? What would be your objective for the week? Perhaps not starve or get shot?
---
Be grateful and appreciative of what you have. You may surprise yourself.
---
"We understand and I understand completely that sharding is antithetical to the concept of a cohesive classic community where you are competing over limited resources. When Lord Kazzak is up and guilds are racing to defeat him, there needs to only be one Lord Kazzak. If you are trying get, you know, if you're trying to lock down the thorium veins that spawn in limited sections of the world, you should be competing over limited resources. That said, the first few weeks, when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials and everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time-limited way to solve the initial launch-day-load problems, while making sure that in the long run as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population and a single world for everyone to live in."
---
As has been pointed out to you several times, Ion first lays out the general philosophy for classic. Then (and this is the part that starts with "That said") he goes on to explain under which circumstances they may find it necessary to use tech that goes against said philosophy. Note how he says "there *needs* to only be one Lord Kazzak", but takes a less categorical stance on thorium which "should" be scarce and competed over.
---
Yeah but not all of them are as big as that, so I'm pretty sure some of them are gonna realize they don't get a pass
---
It is. It works perfectly fine, but I much prefer PI spec (if in a premade or world pvp,) or a 22/29 disc/holy which is better once you have a better handle on mana and gear.
---
Soon.
---
TL;DR - Played classic, sharding during launch would be good because there will literally be 1,000 people in Elwynn on Day 1 and nobody will enjoy it. Take sharding out after the launch hype dies down and people spread out. 
---
I think some of these people who DON'T want some form of sharding didn't really play vanilla. 
---
I've played WoW on and off since 2005 and I am saying that some very mild form of splitting up realms would be a good thing on launch. 
---
Because there will likely be thousands--tens of thousands--of people in Durotar and Elwynn... all at the same time. 
---
It is going to be a shitshow, the servers **WILL** crash, you won't get any questing or leveling done, and then you'll turn around and blame Blizzard for it. 
---
I remember people just hanging out in Elwynn waiting for Hogger to pop, to the point where people would /General saying when he was up if they were just passing by. 
---
Sounds fine, right? 
---
Now imagine literally a thousand more people. I quit WoW because the social aspect was gone, but this is not a social aspect. This is a "5 PM traffic on the West Coast" aspect. Have fun feeding your kids when you've got to wait 2 hours to do a single quest. 
---
Real, true "classic" WoW is never coming back and we should be **ecstatic** that we're getting 99.9% of Classic WoW back.
---
Based on the fact that nobody has gotten one yet, I think today will likely be content creators only. Those people know who they are. They will start inviting more people later. This is just my opinion tho and may be wrong
---
Pretty much this.
---
I can’t remember much of wow vanilla early days but can’t you just run a bit further out from the first quest and find a less busy spot? Couldn’t you team up and and smash some level 4 mobs with 2 buddies instead? 
---
I know it’s going to be crazy busy the first few days anyway, but isn’t that kind of the fun and excitement of a launch?
---
Ive been told by people they will never roll an alliance rogue because orcs have 25% stun resistance.
---
Yeah that's why I made a point to say the areas where 15$ is a LOT for people, like a weekly paycheck. There aren't many of them, and even fewer can even afford computers. And your situation is exactly what I was referencing, no offense. Someone not working should probably get a job instead of taking advantage of this man's handouts. It's literally impossible to not find a job of some sort in today's market.
---
Soon^^TM
---
I enjoyed a lot of the leveling zones and stories in BFA. A lot of the end game stuff is what ruined it for me.
---
Every streamer is giving out different information for their personal inside source.
---
Hint: it's to keep you watching
---
Especially the ones that are hype chasing, they'll come in for a week or two then fuck off I'm sure.
---
theres things like new water graphics along with shadows and foliage, but the new AB and WSG were totally redone art wise so those sorts of things wont be in the game, neither will the new models
---
OOOOOH, gotcha.
---
It was refreshing to listen to people that posses the ability to critically analyze the potential repercussions of layering.
---
This subreddit has all to blindly accepted it and I felt your panel really brought my concerns to light.

That was my concern, i made a post about it and it was as well received as anything on here not dog/office related. I could see people trying to get invites early on to the underpopulated layer to farm the shit out of nodes mining/herb and to get easier access to green BOEs from chests and have a huge leg up over the rest of us but i could also see a lot of folks being on the underpopulated layer not seeing many people playing and wanting off of it but then being forced to join a group.               
---
              
---
Yes we all know it's fucking temporary but all the down voting people with legitimate concerns is really making me start to fucking hate this sub more than r/wow . I'm glad to see you also are looking at this issue objectively.
---
Well now the name purplestain makes sense lol. Fort Smith checking in here! That video gave me good laughs.
---
No...no!!! Back!!! No!!!
---
Forget told they would, people have been saying they already have it preloaded on their launcher. They are in, it's the rest of the plebs (Us) who have no chance. Instead the same morons who don't know basic stuff about vanilla will be playing.
---
the internet
---
To each their own, just know the version you'll end up paying for is not all that authentic to the original WoW
---
I don't think towelliee is pandering for more views man. I dont particularly like the guy but I feel pretty strongly he doesnt give a shit, lol
---
Try a thrift store....they are normally like 3$
---
Wouldn't be surprised if it was influencers only for a bit. Shitty, but it's the biggest exposure blizzard can get and have more people talking about the game
---
There's a very good rule of thumb to follow with regards to game releases: "Never play release day".
---
If you are okay with being a bit behind, play casually for the first week of release and then second week you can go full force when people have somewhat moved on from the first few zones as you are on holiday. :).
---
Sorry students, no, your papers are NOT graded yet. I was up all night raiding.
---
The big revamp I believe happened in Legion, which tbh was a great expansion. The social aspect never came back completely but Legion did a decent "meet you half-way" with it. 
---
To be honest some of the changes were good ones. 
---
Hunters getting dedicated melee spec back was good. Hunters doing more damage in exchange for losing your pet was also a good option. 
---
Some changes like Warlocks losing demon form, druids losing the Sabercat form, etc. were not good.
---
There is no way they would not add new content some years after launch if the player count is high. 
---
Blizzard chose some really questionable paths these past months but I refuse to believe that they would ignore it completely.
---
Shh, let this sub have their hate circle jerk against streamers/youtube :)
---
Honestly don't know. Just from buzz ive heard throughout my gaming communities here, it seems like its going to have  a good following.
---
&gt; Hint: it's to keep you watching
---
Nailed it.
---
If you plan on going hard that week you play you're gonna be running into "the zerg" very early on even if you delay it for a week.
---
If you go hard the first week you're gonna get ahead of the zerg and that'll allow you to stay ahead even after you stop going hard.
---
I would dare to say that the 2nd week would be a better use of your time but with launches these days, they have gotten pretty good so IDK, maybe a mix of both? Take time off starting 2 days after launch?
---
Sorry you're right, should have responded to the first guy. My bad.
---
Theoretically, but each mule speeds it up by such a tiny amount as to be negligible, unless you're part of a organized effort and everyone involved is willing to spend a ton of money on subs.
---
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but nobody cares about the EU.
---
I feel sorry for the kids that make their classic experience following them around and giving them gold all day long.
---
If that means I can skip getting in queue when I wake up and try to get into the game sometime after class, I am good with that.
---
I will also skip the 6 days of raiding this time too.
---
And replace it with?
---
As someone with a technical background is a similar line of work, layers would be automatically booted up as needed so there is no need to fear a specific set of layers being predefined.
---
Layers still have to abide by the rules of realm cap, as such there can only ever be an amount of players equal to that realm's cap either way, so that also means that there is a hard cap on layers, as I said in my previous comment, we're probably looking at 2 layers on average realms, 3 on very populated realms and potentially 4 on extreme stream viewer realms.  
---
I think you're worry is unnecessary, but you do have the right to feel the way you want to.
---
I agree. Now I really don’t have to rush to 60 and try to scrape enough gold together in hopes of buying one. Now I can take my time like I originally planned.
---
...i hope they do BC now. I want my Egbert back.
---
Most raid leaders don’t want arms warriors because the can’t do respectable dps without taking up multiple debuff slots. For example, a mortal strike debuff can knock off curse of elements and lower the entire raid’s dps drastically which is frowned upon.
---
That really only leaves fury as an option, which is not terrible at pvp (especially if you have a pocket paladin to freedom you), but you’ll miss the healing reduction and it will feel weak before you get some gear.
---
2h fury can work for pvp; I remember aq/naxx geared warriors deleting people with 2.5k+ bloodthirst crits, but in reality I would just wear the best weapons you have access to, whether that’s 1h or 2h.
---
What Dream?
---
Blizzard: ***GET READY FOR A CLASSIC SUMMER!***               
---
             
---
... Yeah, all fucking 4 days of it...
---
What happens with false accusations though?
---
I was younger than 10 years old when I played vanilla, so it wasn’t really something I dealt with often or at the very least, have memory of dealing with.
---
But I imagine it wouldn’t be difficult to make false claims against people just to troll?
---
[There will still be queues.](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=544)
---
&gt; I don't think towelliee is pandering for more views man. 
---
Then you don't understand what streaming is about.  He **ABSOLUTELY** gives a shit.  Streaming is his *only*  source of income.
---
I did play at launch and I simply don't trust blizzard to not mess up layering in some capacity, that there will be a massive hit to the economy because there will be potentially 4x or 5x the items due to layers.
---
If you want to, layer literally only the starting zones and that's it, let it run free after that.  But beyond that I think layering sounds fuckin' awful.
---
Also servers will still likely crash and have ridiculous queue times, layering will not fix that.  Everyone is still on the same server after all
---
I've played at launch and especially TBC was a fucking SHIT SHOW for blood elves and blue space goats who's names I forget, I remember my computer barely being able to handle it at the time it was very much the same experience.
---
I think this has more negatives then positives associated with it.  Is it better then sharding?  Sure.  Is it better then no sharding at all?  No.
---
This is a question that can also be extended to later added quests such as:
---
* Revantusk
---
* Cenarion
---
* Steamwheedle Cartel
---
I'm not sure what this has to do with the topic of the thread.
---
So you think he's straight up lying. That's interesting.
---
I personally lead a 233+ man raid on EK with my guild members alone, I plan on doing it again!
---
I think you replied to the wrong comment there, friend.
---
Except for Ion's quote that Layering CANNOT and WILL NOT exist in Phase 2 because it ruins the purpose of World bosses. So a server with an active pop that stays at 15k will have layering removed at phase 2, and then start having login queues most likely. There hope is to have layering gone in the first two-three weeks, but for a server like that they may have to push it until P2 launches.
---
Basically Tips Out anytime he streams. That dude is cancer.
---
Cant people be hype and chill on stream waiting for the beta to start? Why are people on this sub always so bitter?
---
So i have 1 hour and 20 minutes left to get my beta invite.
---
I don't think people realize how desperate people are and how willing they're going to be to do something dumb for even a chance at a closed beta invite. Some people might even resubscribe to retail WoW!
---
Way I read it is that they will invite people for the stress tests that don't have access outside of the defined test periods
---
No worries! I have my hatred aimed at raiderIO. The scaling changes were definitely big. I think a 10 became roughly a 13 or 14?
---
This is gonna be a sad post, right? I'm *not* going to cry.
---
&gt;Rest In Peace Big bro, looks like this time around you’ll be watching me play.
---
...Ok maybe one tear is fine. RIP to your brother, see you in Classic.
---
Cool story, bro.
---
Account/launcher shows the game no keys in emails. Its really small closed beta mostly for streamers, tubers, PR etc. They might invite more people later on or you can just test it in stress tests.
---
Re-subbing is like purchasing a loot box hoping to get a beta key
---
We are watching the videos for different reasons then. I want to see gameplay pushed to its absolute limit. I want to see something new that I can aspire to myself. It's the same reason I would watch PvP videos by players like Ming, Dahis, and Happyminti when they were current -- to see something new and try to apply it to my own gameplay. For me, that's where the nostalgia lies.
---
And by the way, this distinction always existed, before the existence of private servers. Even back in the day there were BiG yElLoW nUmBeRs videos as well as videos that could actually teach you something.  
---
Instead of sharing Perplexity 5, because it's very recent and very exciting to me, should I share some better examples of PvP videos that existed when vanilla was current? Because they are out there.
---
Says the people who dress up in clown costumes to own the libs. Go back to r/frenworld.
---
I still miss that jump....i always fucking forget about it 😂🤣
---
Ouch. Not much chokes me up, but that was strong. My brother and I got into WoW around 4-5Th grade and managed to convince my parents to get us the game. We even managed to convince them to let us use the office computer for an hour a day, so we could play together. Eventually we got to play on weekends together
---
Then it moved to EXACTLY like you said, getting hyped as fuck for Friday night raids. It was so weird, because we werent the kids you'd think would play WoW. We were into sports, eventually weight lifting, and I was a boxer for years. It was like a double life - I'd have a fight scheduled that day, played in basketball tournaments, heavy weight lifted in middle school, and I don't think ANYONE that trained with me thought that the second I went home, I got on WoW and explored anything I could with my brother for hours.
---
By far my favorite hobby was gaming. Absolutely loved it. I find myself gaming less now a days, but I really miss the old WoW times. I don't think classic will bring it back, but I'm going to try it anyways. Never know.
---
Beautiful ending, and I'm so happy you got to share this with your brother.
---
Because then you have 30 decent pop servers for a month that are then all dead
---
Well, the Classic Beta opt in is unchecked by default, so you had to knowingly opt in to receive an invite, they wouldn't just be throwing them around.
---
Towelliee already has his viewer base, they are going to watch him if he is streaming retail or classic. Yes, he cares about trying to grow that community but not enough to pander for views like you seem to think. This is all opinion and we can argue it until we are both blue in the face or we can agree to disagree and both fuck off, lol. I choose the later, you?
---
Good luck :)
---
People keep saying this but I don’t get it. There are like, what, 30 relevant content creators? - and I think that’s being generous.
---
You can’t fill up any server or layer with just them. They might all get invites this wave, but not all the wave’s invites will go to them.
---
I’m sure there will be an email. Otherwise how would you know? If you’ve ever done a PTR before you won’t ever notice lol.
---
Am I just old or who gives a shit, after your done with school the concept of "summer" becomes irrelevant other than its hotter than hell and I have to work.
---
I never played wow in classic before. I joined at the tail end of wrath when I leveled an arms Warrior to 65 ish. I have no strong pull to any particular class having not played them in classic however I am kinda drawn towards arms Warrior. Would this be something that would be viable? I've heard that only prot Warriors are wanted but I don't really want to tank.
---
It's amazingly fun in PvP, because everything you do is rolling the dice. Will you proc wf? Or will you stand there like an idiot slowly hitting them?
---
I love it.
---
Oh this'll be good.
---
I'm setting up a popcorn stand in this thread. Help yourselves:

And what is the reason to keep layering on?
---
What is their malicious intent? What is the upside for blizz?
---
are you people seriously triggered by this?? ofcourse streamers are hyped for beta, like WTF?!
---
Alright thank you! Fury it is 👍
---
On google
---
Oh, yeah it's not as good as the Nightelf one, but you can skip half of Wetlands when coming from Loch Modan if I'm not remembering it wrong.
---
Aged like a fine sandwich.
---
then you're a moron cuz the time beta goes up has be public since yesterday -.-
---
Layering doesn't fix _most_ of the issues I have with sharding. 
---
 Missing out in wPvP that I _should_ be able to participate in because it's one realm and should be cohesive, resource proliferation, exploitative behaviors gaming the system for personal gain or to get out of wPvP situations, ghost town layers (even worse for layers because layers do not actively re-allocate players to compensate for fluctuations in population as shards do), etc.
---
That said, it's too late now.  Classic _will_ have it.  It _will_ suck.  I'm just hoping the damage it does is less than I'm expecting.
---
Ah interesting, didn’t know about the curse of elements problem until now! Thank you! I’ll go fury 👍
---
My condolences for the loss, this has to be bittersweet. 
---
I wish you only the best.
---
That makes complete sense. I can also see how PvPers could have been upset with TBC gearing changes because in a sense they copped it twice, first in the pre-patch when the new honour rewards let people overtake PvP gear they'd sweated for under the old honour system, and then again when outland greens made even the new PvP gear obsolete.
---
I am at the point where I can't decide between male or female undead priest. I typically roll male characters in video games but god damn do I hate the hair styles and protruding spine of the male model.
---
If you’re looking for inspiration with Stormstrike, look up Unbreakable PvP on YouTube.
---
Absolutely none of them. They are all garbage.
---
Seems people are more mad that he claims to have played in vanilla, but only started claiming that recently. For a long time he had said that he started in cata. Might be a lie, might be a mistake but it seems shady.
---
Monkeynews
---
We will see
---
Drugs are also very entertaining. Your example makes no sense. You go see a movie once. Maybe twice if you like it. With wow...well, do I really need to spell it out for ANYONE in this sub?
---
If a person skips on an essencial good / habit in order to get pleasure or, as you mentioned, "mental escape" that person is in fact exibiting addiction behaviour.
---
I agree with wow not being as bad as some of the more heavy drugs. But I'm sure not for the dá-me reasons.
---
First week is typically influencers and friends/family invites. Don't get your hopes up.

Hi, /u/PurportedGamer
---
Never thought of that, moght split it.
---
Ugh I’ve missed every single one.
---
Whats wrong with watching old school vanilla videos that we all love to get hype for the beta thats supposed to come out today?
---
Kungen
---
man these posts are getting worse by the hour now that everyone isn't jonesing for a release date, christ people get a grip.
---
&gt;  I simply don't trust blizzard to not mess up layering in some capacity
---
This is a valid concern but it's something we can do nothing about. Blizzard has a habit of "you think you do, but you don't" mentality. Best to just enjoy what we have while we can. 
---
&gt; layer literally only the starting zones and that's it
---
This is a valid option that should be considered. 
---
&gt; servers will still likely crash and have ridiculous queue times
---
Queue times, yes, but Legion had a smooth launch specifically due to sharding. 
---
I agree, I think sharding will detract from the "vanilla" experience, but I understand their argument for it as well as people's arguments against it. 
---
But this is 2019 where every swinging dick has internet, and $15 to play WoW. Even the 14-year-olds of today will want to try it simply out of boredom. 
---
And think of the hordes of streamer followers. Launch is going to be a shitshow, and any precautions to mitigate that has my support.
---
Eh, first few days aren't important, just skip :P
---
link the time for todays beta then.
---
I agree with everything you've stated. Upvoted.
---
No more than spawning several other instances of the entire fucking game world.
---
That's what we're gonna call it.  
---
**I Got Worms.**
---
Awesome thanks, what I saw was a guy using a lot of totems while playing with it. Windfury sounds super awesome when it procs, but I would like to be less reliant on a proc.

Tribe is really good

In Blizzard's defence, technically they're well within the predicted release window, since summer officially ends on 23 September. Classic lands 4 weeks before that.

Why you gotta make me cry at work tho?
---
You got any buttered popcorn? Looks all salted to me.
---
Serendipitys sometimes goes on sodas stream, also esfand. The rest of them, not so much
---
The big difference between those is that most people don't have 20 friends available at the same time to field a full game, let alone the equipment or field.
---
I really hope you enjoy playing classic here in a few months! I’m sure Corey will be smiling down knowing you’re probably playing a little better than you were back in elementary school!
---
To me its about how childish the streamer is. Tipsout is the most childish and therefore is out for me. Staysafe and MrGM are next on that list for the same reason. Esfand is the only one left that I really trust. He seems like the most level headed and least childish.
---
Towelliee is admittedly a retail shill and therefore isnt someone I would go to for info.
---
Asmongold doesnt keep up with all the information anymore IMHO
---
&gt; Also, why do people watch football with friends when they can go outside and play? It’s the exact same concept.
---
Well thats understandable, do you really have 21 friends to flesh out a full 2 teams and know of an easy access full sized field to play on? Also professionals can play at levels most people cant which is a huge part of it and yes I know Esports is a thing but that said 99% of popular streamers arnt better than most people, in fact i'd say most of them are average at best.                 
---
                 
---
To each their own but video games are accessible to everyone, I guess the best comparison as both are forms of art I can make is Movie critics who stream the movies and comment through it, just watch the fucking movie?
---
There is no right answer. 
---
But some that I prefer are: Frostadamus because he is calm and detailed
---
Esfand has a great attitude and is passionate about Classic
---
The rest I take with a grain of salt.
---
Wow this is absolutely disgusting.
---
You’re getting kids to send you photos of their living situations, all their personal information just so you can deem if they are worthy of your money. 
---
What a power trip. I really hope you aren’t the kind of person I think you are knowing all that information about someone.
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
Np mate. Mistakes happen :)
---
Asmongold just got the download for the beta client, sooo...

Do you think that that guy speaks on behalf of the corporation? No, the stockholder's speak on their behalf and proclaim profits at all costs. If they see their servers struggling to maintain load under heavy capacity, shard that shit to all hell to allow the max amount of players. It will happen buddy. It's a slippery slope that is entirely their decision when they want to use it.
---
So you believe all those corporations when they tell you they won't do X and then they go and do it? You're about as gullible as it comes.
---
Nothing is written down and legally binding so they can do what they want when they want. They'll use it beyond the original scope, hopefully under the guise that you won't notice it as much.
---
Streaming yourself watching youtube videos has somehow become "content" these days and it's fucking stupid.
---
Most of streamers have said don't activate sub for the beta, its really small closed beta and they know it that its really really small chance to get in. Beta is online now for the streamers.

Hi, /u/aydsz
---
well if you like totems and shamans you could try Ele shaman, they're pretty strong in pvp and reasonably easy to get started on.
---
If you compare WoW as it was in 2004 to the MMOs it was competing with like Everquest and Ultima Online, it was *extremely* casual. Their goal was to make an accessible MMO.
---
Probably couldn't get much better than the #1 Tank in the world back during that time.
---
Frostadamus or Kargoz, I will throw Alexensual (controversial) for knowledge and passion but he's very extreme and toxic when things go south or he gets called out.
---
I would not recommend any of the classic cast or anyone associated with Blizzard in anyways as they have become corporate mouthpieces only interested in financial gain with nothing substantial to back it up.
---
do you know what ETA means? Its an ESTIMATE!
---
Retard.

You got invited? Or is that from a streamer?

Pretty sure they are inside an instance though

The boat between Theramore and Menethil.  Gank the people on the boat.  It will load the next zone and you can gank them again.  Mind Control them off the boat to die of fatigue.  Make sure to eat your deviate delights.
---
The easier things in life rarely satisfy and you and I both know it won't compare to the original experience and that much less given the layering addition.

lucky you

12/2/2005.  Wow that takes me back.  I was so young, I first played on my friends account, she was telling me how amazing this game was and how I needed to play.  She told me how I HAD to pick one of four races (human, elf, dwarf, or gnome), but I loved fuzzy cows so that is what I picked lol.  I don't think I even knew to pick the same server so it wouldn't have mattered anyway.
---
Last day was 4/3/2015.  Man I can't wait to come back!!!!!
---
Hmm.  In that case maybe these layers should lock you in upon logging into them the first time, and not put you in different layers every time you logout.  Until the populations go down and layers are merged, at least.
---
Any updates on his plans re: Classic?
---
nope not a streamer
---
Because people are going to these great lengths to countdown and stream things to appear more hardXcore or whatever. Maybe in the meantime they can play the game or do something more exciting with their time?
---
I dont think anyone besides streamers are in right now.
---
Is it separated from the BFA wow in the left side?
---
i am afraid only streamers ... and the boring one

&gt; I think people are overreacting over the fact that layering will be implemented. 
---
Intra-server decohesion in an MMORPG _warrants_ a strong reaction, especially if it's going to happen during the formative phase of the game.
---
mfw I didn't get an invite
---
How do you check if you got it lmao
---
Say what you will about Esfand, but he's an incredible resource on paladins. He spends hours play testing builds and has a deep love for the class
---
Hahahahah, Fuck i can't wait playa's
---
Hi, /u/DINODOGO
---
dwarf priests are also really good in pvp, that stoneform saves lives :D
---
Don't have an invite, RIP
---
you buy \[Felcloth\] ? Meet bank.
---
HAPPENING STATUS = MAXIMUM
---
The streamers can all jerk each other off ingame then I guess
---
Its really small closed beta test, i doubt many normal players get in this first wave just content makers.
---
So did anyone except for major streamers etc. actually get invited?
---
soda
---
Thats your opinion, obviously a lot of people enjoy it.
---
That’s why not a single person was able to provide proof of an invite?
---
MN is probably the one to follow.
---
Literally no different to merging 4 servers and getting those materials anyway but yep keep strawmanning
---
On a dps only comparision: it falls short and requires substantially more farming. Feral's strength is that they can tank when the 3rd tank is needed and can dps when it is not. It's not the worse but if all you want to do is dps, you are much better off going warrior, but you can probably find a semi-hardcore to roll with. Ally is more feral friendly than horde.
---
Mace/sword skill is the only racial I would put as a "substantial" bonus in PvE. If you go nelf you are gimping yourself dps wise.
---
it sells for $250-$300 sealed

---
Anyone but Towelliee
---
There are no invites the download will appear in the launcher
---
Oh, you are that stupid.
---
Hi, /u/SuggestedFruits4U
---
everyone who was invited already knew about it and was behind an NDA and couldn't talk about the release. it's a F&amp;F release only for first wave.
---
Can't be sure because the talent system will be different, not without rerunning the math.  With Naxx gear it might well be possible, but that would mean that the AQ40 would go unbeaten until some part of the way into Nax.
---
Fair enough, does taking WF make it that much better? 
---
/u/DeriumsCCGs said slowly hitting them standing like an idiot, Ill take the WF proc I don't mind  just something I need to adjust to.
---
Edit: thanks for the reply and info! Anywhere I can find a build?
---
&gt; I seen
---
If you say so, must be true
---
Excellent idea, people waiting for their turn, lets do that.
---
That would be almost totally pointless as a measure of load balancing.  You'll be in whatever layer the system decides is the least saturated when you log in.
---
Only for streamers, suck it hard blizz
---
I was mostly referring to John Hight interview. Okay, still very strange. Looks like the very idea behind layering is not just to expect but to count on people leaving to not to have to layer anymore.
---
But just imagine there will be next Nihilum, Forte, Method etc, those realms will stay layered. This puts me in a situation where i rather choose small community with rather smaller perspectives just to be sure there will be no layering on that realm. This may include rerolling and wasting time...
---
Congrats !, please take your time during leveling and report any bug you found, so we can enjoy when our time will come :D
---
Yeah, that's how it has been for me as well.
---
then why did they invite soda? LOL
---
No, dropdown from the Region selection. Same as PTR/Other Betas.
---
Sorry but your reply is not coherent at all. For one thing I believe you mean to say “precedent”. For another, I don’t understand what you are trying to say with your first sentence at all. A salesman sticking his foot in has nothing to do with a slippery slope.
---
And it is a fallacy. Per definition. Look up “slippery slope”.
---
nope, only streamers/friends&amp;family for first wave
---
Once again a proud member of the no beta club.
---
Rumors of a toggle? You must have not looked very hard when you searched this. This is something that has already been discussed extensively. It’s not a rumor there is an actual toggle to make it have vanilla like settings.
---
just give a vote up :) and will do and none so far popped up but
---
If that's your idea of a good launch, then you do you mate.
---
nope.     just fucking streamers and youtubers like usual.
---
At an internet cafe right now meeting up with a friend but my laptop shows the beta install. Not a streamer. Just resubbed but i did play day 1
---
WF is *the* core mechanic for classic Enhancement.

---
Have fun.
---
you still got best buy US
---
&gt; I don't think towelliee is pandering for more views 
---
LMAO, that fat mexican fuck will take any extra viewer he can get with the classic hype after shitting on it for months, imagine being this dumb. I mean, figures if you watch Towelliee I guess
---
open bnet, click wow, click box under region/account. if you have it then you'll see beta classic
---
Pretty sure nobody but content creators got in for now
---
Yeah the Astronomical calendar has Summer Solstice at June 19th- September 23rd but for most of us it's September/October/November = Fall.          
---
            
---
If someone said to me on December 20th "Man it's snowing, this fall weather sure is crazy" I might say "Bitch it's Christmas in 4 days, what the fuck are you smoking?"
---
I played a lot in Vanilla, and from my perspective, MadSeasonShow seems to have the best understanding of what classic was like, but his channel leans towards general overviews and not super deep dives on individual classes. 
---
As for deep dive stuff, your best bet is class discords and random people that focus specifically on that class. For example, shedothedruid for in-depth feral druid rotation optimization.    
---
It’s hard to strike a balance between authenticity and relevance:
---
-	The original vanilla raiders don’t remember much (it’s been a literal decade) and the game has also changed so drastically that it’s hard to remember when something changed (I think cheapshot is the only spell in the game that is unchanged since vanilla, excluding changes to its diminishing return?). 
---
-	The private server raiders know the latest tricks, tips, and best rotations but their experience is not 100% accurate due to private server quirks (sit macros, wand quivers, questionable proc rates, armor value inconsistencies, etc.).
---
All that said, expect much better information very shortly as the beta gets rolling.
---
I've been thinking about hunter as a serious contender as well. I wouldnt discount war stomp. Having that extra moment to escape can turn a fight real quick as a hunter or druid. 
---
But aesthetically I'm leaning orc. And cant complain because they have amazing racials. 
---
But trolls looks amazing in the gear as well. And at the end of the day, if you play better than your opponent you'll win, whether you have zerker rage or hardiness or war stomp. Skill in many instances trumps racials
---
I am not a streamer and I got an invite. I'm downloading now!!
---
Lmao true
---
Aw man I have this book too.  It's crazy to see how much the art direction has changed over time.
---
I think he's fun to watch but he doesn't have much OG vanilla experience and is heavily tainted by his time playing on emus.
---
Arms warriors take up debuff slots by using mortal strike so serious raid groups usually prefer their warriors go fury. 
---
If you’re in a more casual raid that doesn’t care about debuff slots you can do decent damage as arms (though it will usually be lower than fury once geared).
---
Horde player here but I love Westfall.
---
Are you for real? Did you report him?
---
Ugh... I hate you... Congratz.
---
Teeb, do you have an active sub?
---
mana regend very fast for low characters
---
Pay subs to not get a key?
---
As in if you sub less chance of a key or what?
---
Just google 1.12.1 Hunter guide. They've been written so many times over the course of all the private servers out there.
---
confirmed no ones getting in unless you know someone.   have 2 accounts one was 2004 and other is 2005.  both have been subbed since creation.   no inv.   yet again streamers, and youtubers get shit that kill the hype by bitching and then everyone goes back to fortnite.  nice the first logon in beta was next to a character named fvkboi.   they choice their testers well   &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt; I'm ok with it as long as people aren't able to exploit it to farm named mobs, quest faster, farm nodes/chests, etc. 
---
Then you're not okay with it lol. It will 100% be able to be abused
---
AsmonGOD
---
I call it separate servers that instead of dying and going through the logistic pain in the ass of merging, it's already predone/premerged.
---
Anyways what's your alternative? Hour long server queues and everyone competing for the same starter mobs? Hard pass bud.
---
Yes. Actively play BFA. Played wow since vanilla beta.
---
the little payo ofc 
---
Hilarity, WPVP, dueling, rich thorium veins, and classic knowledge - especially for rogues.
---
twitch.tv/payo
---
Defcamp and Melderon. Brothers, they know Vanilla well and they are genuinely nice guys. 
---
You can rest assured they are not about to go on a perverse rant about politics, religion, race, gender, etc. Genuine dudes...defcamp is too pure for this world.
---
https://youtu.be/rnXSH2Y2dTk
---
Out of combat regen is pretty fast sub level 10.
---
Depends. If your leveling solo sure. If your a warrior with healer it's a waste, your going to be chain pulling which means you'll never drop combat long enough to benefit from spirit. Your healer buddy can stack spirit though so he can regen while using a wand between heals.
---
One of the things Ion said that they were to solve in his interview was the problem of having a 1k player Elwynn Forest.  
---
Let's pretend they want no more than a 20 player Elwynn Forest.   
---
The first 20 people get into Layer1. The next 20 are in Layer2, and so on. This continues until we get the final 20 people into Layer50.  
---
If you logged in as Layer17, you will eternally be in Layer17 regardless of how many others are in that layer. The only three ways to exit Layer17 are:  
---
1. You log out. When you log back in, you may be in a new layer.  
---
2. You are invited to a friend's group/guild on another layer. 
---
3. Enough other players from your Layer log out or swap layers without being replaced, causing your layer to get "flattened" (merged) into another layer.  
---
This Layer17 will span the entire game. Both continents. Ion specifically said: "you take a zeppelin, whatever, same layer." He included swapping continents as an example.  
---
There are two problems with this system:  
---
1. Your layer will have all of its own unique herbs, monsters, etc. This means you have no competition for Black Lotuses, no competition for Devilsaurs, etc.  
---
2. Your layer cannot flatten into other layers if the main zone is overcrowded. For example -- if your layer maintains 49/50 people in Elwynn and all other layers also have 50 people in Elwynn, two layers cannot be merged. This means that you can be the SOLE player in Winterspring on your layer, but you will not merged into another Winterspring with other players because your layer's Elwynn cannot be merged into another layer's Elwynn without overcrowding Elwynn.  
---
As a result, the fastest people in the game will find a VERY barren game. If there are 50 layers, and all 50 have packed Elwynn's and 1 person in Winterspring each, those 50 players will all have their own unique Winterspring because they cannot flatten into each other due to what would be Elwynn overcrowding.  
---
Sharding would put those 50 Winterspring players into a single Winterspring with 50 people. This is a key difference between layering and sharding, but both solutions are bad for different reasons.  
---
When you have a zone to yourself, all the herbs and monsters you see are effectively your own. Even if 49 other copies of Winterspring exists, they have their own copies of herbs and monsters. This is by design -- the *purpose* of the system is to ensure that your zone is not sharing monsters or herbs with another zone so that players can play the game.  
---
The result, however, is that in theory one could sit in their layer, loot 2 black lotuses, have a friend invite them to their layer, loot 2 more black lotuses, and do this 50 times to have 100 black lotuses. 100 black lotuses which, by the way, are typically timegated to ~4 per day. This would lead to a massive influx of the herb into the economy.  
---
Some might argue "the herb influx into the economy is offset by the fact that the economy is bigger -- there are more participants." And that is true, but ONE exploiter has 100 black lotuses now instead of them being equally distributed BECAUSE of exploiting layering. Even worse, the "tourists" who quit at level 15 are creating a huge influx of end-game Black Lotus (because their presence is causing an influx of layers to be created), but said tourists will never be **participants** in the economy that interact with those Black Lotuses (i.e., end game flasks). The end result is that the end game flask market would crash due to an influx of black lotuses, and a small number of people who successfully exploited the layering system will get rich off of that crash while the rest of us end up with shitty cheap herbs.  
---
Does this make more sense now?
---
Nice! Ima be rockin that Druid.
---
Didnt get invited either this is bullshit, I bought that stupid Blizzcon demo thingy and have a subscription this is BS
---
But who wants to be in a layer with Karen...
---
They also said you could change layers by a group invite, sooooooo all your bs just went out the window. It will 100% be abused and you're in denial if you think it won't be
---
You realize if they only let 3k people in, you would still be fighting against the same amount of people as layering. The only difference is you would be waiting hours to get in to do so?
---
did you get an email?
---
 Time waits for no man. Unless that man is Chuck Norris.
---
&gt; They will be equal just as often as they would be at any other percentage I made the circles though no? This is just easier to look at.
---
&gt; Also, I explained this under the circle itself.
---
You are right thank you!
---
Same, first time in a while being on F&amp;F and didn't get a early invite, oh well.
---
All it takes to change layers is a group invite, that is what the devs said. Do you really think it won't be possible? Use your brain bro
---
I don't know why, but this fucking kicks up my rage meter like WHOA
---
Bro. Lol ok
---
They will be equal just as often as they would be at any other percentage I made the circles though no? This is just easier to look at.
---
Layering is sharding with a few irrelevant tweaks.  Yeah, it's great that  I'll still see the same players going from zone to zone.  Doesn't fix wPvP.  It doesn't fix the exploits people _will_ use for personal gain, or to avoid being ganked, or whatever else they come up with.  It introduces 1N the amount of resources floating around than there should be, where N is the number of world instances running.  Layering doesn't have active load balancing so if you get placed into an under-populated layer, then you're out of luck because unlike sharding, layering doesn't re-allocate based on population fluctuations.
---
In essence, _layering does not address the fact that intra-server decoherence is completely antithetical to an MMO._
---
* Temporary
---
Lol - Keep telling yourself that.
---
100% chance they use it at their discretion from here on out.
---
Enjoy that sharded AQ event a year from now buddy.
---
No it just appeared on the launcher
---
Arent dwarf rogues effected by 25% stun resist. From orcs?
---
Enhancement Shaman is a completely viable leveling spec.  
---
Max level PvP is good, you may have problems with being kited by higher skill players.  You’ll have times where you accidentally destroy a target, along with other times where you accidentally don’t kill anything.  
---
5-10 man instances are completely viable for enhancement dps at level 60. People will want to pigeonhole you into healing, but you can dps if you want.  
---
Raiding is another story.  Restoration is the expected spec for shamans due to the fact that stormstrike takes up a debuff slot that could be better used by another class.  You might be able to convince someone to let you swing nightfall if you’re lucky. (Nightfall is a crafted axe that increases raid magic damage)
---
&gt;Do you think that that guy speaks on behalf of the corporation? 
---
Yes, I do in fact think that the game director of world of warcraft speaks on behalf of the corporation in the matter of world of Warcraft when giving official interviews. He will say nothing that has not been officially cleared by the company, because he's giving interviews in his capacity as a representative for the company.
---
Obviously video game companies are shitty. But it's blatantly fucking obvious when they're being shitty. You can tell. Like that "No microtransactions loljk I mean it's just cosmetic" guy, what they do is always always always leaving themselves wiggle room in their statements, or at  least they try to. That's because they don't want to be caught lying. So when they do make a statement with no wiggleroom, such as, oh I don't know, literally promising to merge the layers into a single world within the span of the first few weeks, that you can trust.
---
Official spokespeople for major corporations don't blatantly lie in prepared inhouse interviews. They speak half-truths, leave themselves wiggle room and misrepresent the facts, but they never blatantly lie. That's just not a thing, and I think you'd have to be pretty stupid not to understand such a basic fact about marketing.
---
This is so true. Small things escalate quickly. Maybe someone will be able to check on this guy, but most likely he will be able to operate in complete anonymity while getting just enough personal information to make him potentially dangerous if he chooses to be that way.
---
Unfortunately targeting kids like this is all to easy. Now, we all HOPE he’s not like that, but the difficult thing is, we have no way to know.
---
...unless someone creates a fake person to bait him in and see if he tries anything suspicious. And of course later on it would be appropriate to re-gift and/or pay it forward if he IS legit.
---
i missed this completly, is this a full beta to level 60 or a level 19 demo again?
---
Lock in names in the beta lul
---
Just go to your account on the battle.net website and opt in for the wow classic beta. You might be to late for tonights invite wave, but ready for the next one!
---
&gt; Ion Hazzikostas said in an interview that they didn't want layering past the first few weeks.
---
Weird... they also said they wouldn't have it at all. Now it's "just a few weeks"... do you not see how you're getting played?
---
betas out F
---
The opt-in page is gone?
---
I heard erarlier that very few will get a key and that you will need a subscription to play beta. That means ppl will pay for beta. Wich is insane. I also heard that you can "name your character" on the 13 of august wich means that they will charge you ahead of time to make a character and name. Was a bit shocked.
---
&gt;Vanilla raids actually look at healer overheal statistics and name and shame the healers who have high amount of overhealing. You would start up a heal and cancel it if the tank didn't need heals and start casting a heal again, rince and repeat.
---
Ya the canceling heals part sucks for druids. Their healing touch rank 3 isn't very good and upranks from there are too slow. 
---
There's supposed to be a penalty on coefficients for the level on the heal and cast time but honestly from what I saw on that demo it could be overlooked. Healing meters from private servers are a terrible gauge because of how broken that specific issue is on many of them.
---
There isn't keys for the beta. They just assigned them to accounts automatically. Hit your region/account drop down to see if you ha e an option for the beta.
---
blizzcon demo has nothing to do with the beta
---
the first wave went out but you could get in later waves still
---
From my understanding, the whole idea of Layering is to keep you in the same "shard" as much as possible.
---
No its not a perfect solution, they don't have that. It's called a compromise. They are not gonna release a game that's a complete shitfest at launch (even with this tech, it might still be challenging), so yeah.
---
I was tearing up even before the last line. Reminded me of my little brother and I back then
---
I dont even see the region/account dropdown box
---
While I appreciate some of the information and hype that guys like Tips bring to the community, I have no motivation to watch them play the game whatsoever.
---
Thanks for your reply! Going through your previous posts and I think there's some really great and extensive info for my further reading. Just seeing all that knowledge reminds me about my TBC days playing an unhealthy amount of Rogue/Disc, RMP and spending the rest of my time on priest theorycrafting.
---
99% of us feel the same way, lol
---
Do you know what is worse? Seeing the Wow Classic tab and seeing Demo written above it from the Blizzcon Demo
---
WOLTK was the end of a huge storyline, that involved multiple games. So when the story is over, people leave the theater. They didn't really set their next story up with nearly as much enthusiasm. Plus right about that time, some other games came out, and people wanted a break from a game they had been playing for years. WOLTK was their highest sub numbers ever, and it's been downhill since that peak.
---
Dwarf hunter
---
Oof, how does it feel being so wrong?
---
Yeah but if you spend 60 dollars on a demo and a virtual ticket and even have an active subscription to the game plus buying the collectors edition of BFA and every expansion before that.
---
he proved that layering was just sharding with a new name so he had to be left out for OPs propaganda to work
---
Proud member of the Beta club.  Stuck at work until 8 pm though.   Luckily I was able to remote into my computer and get everything downloaded ahead of time!
---
True. Whether Blizzard were looking at it that way though, is an unknown. Personally I'm fine with them spending the time they need to produce a quality product :)
---
i feel, i never get invited for this stuff and ive been playing since like the 3rd or 4th week of the game being out.
---
Dont worry, kids got in who just follow around streamers and trade them shit
---
Interesting! I was rushing to get a paladin up to raiding level to my guild's prot paladin. I levelled prot on purpose and was so impressed with how fast I was killing hoards of enemies. I just had to pick zones where there were lots of melee - and specifically dual wielders - to farm on. Great times.
---
No. That's what layering is, separating people
---
I dont even have the WoW region select dropdown menu
---
You asked how the system worked, so I explained it to you. What kind of shitty GVL answer is this?
---
It sucks, but as a rogue you can pick your fights, so you rarely are forced to gamble on hardiness. 
---
And horde rogues have to deal with human perception and plate healers which sucks too, though admittedly not as much as hardiness.
---
In BWL gear compared to Naxx gear, how do hunters do in comparison to warlocks in BGs and World PvP?
---
Honestly dont expect it. Gonna be a very small beta.
---
Not with that attitude you can't.
---
Iv just read conflicting things so not sure what to believe
---
I don't even have a drop down at all. Do you need to own BFA?
---
"Generally"
---
AKA no.
---
Yea dude I remember always loving the NPC ones as a kid because they were slightly orange, and that was my favorite color. 
---
When I saw somebody riding one I freaked out because I thought I owned all of the horses and there was just no rideable versions of that one. 
---
All I'm saying is when that when they rereleased OSRS they hosted all of the party hat, santa hat, etc, events again, and people had a blast. Kind of just feels like a waste to just flush these mounts down the toilet.
---
We already know that. It was stated by devs in the interview. He claimed it would change when you log in. Something that WAS NOT stated by devs. Learn to read.
---
Go watch Wyatt Cheng get obliterated in Blizzcon last year. He was the face of the Diablo franchise told to go out and debut a mobile game in front of a PC franchise audience. You think he wanted to do that or was forced?
---
Remember that interview when they said Vanilla was never going to happen? Were they lying then? Times changes buddy and people say one thing and can do whatever they want as a corporation.
---
That guy is a pawn in the grand scheme of things. Don't be so naive.
---
Were you subbed?
---
I completely understand. But this also means you don’t play with only a “small select few” on a dead server 6 months from now, too
---
aka easy to abuse
---
I can't believe i get to flex my panda again... can't wait :D
---
Can you explain it like I'm 5.  I've opened bnet, looking at wow launch screen, haven't been prompted to download anything
---
Did you get an email as well?
---
Would also like to know.
---
One faction attacking another faction to halt their progress in one way or another
---
Be it killing a world boss, gathering resources, or leveling is the essence of a pvp server. Youre not supposed to feel safe on a pvp server. You're supposed to be afraid of being ganked you're supposed to have faction pride and kill on sight
---
Not set up two riflemen, have them take two paces away from each other then turn and shoot. Pvp is almost never even in vanilla. Thats just how pvp realms are
---
How many waves are there? And when will the next occur? Sorry I know im being lazy not looking on google.
---
Incel is just a synonym for asshole unless it's being used in its literal context. You're reading into it too much, my dude.
---
IM IN!
---
No email, just downloaded client and logged in. Dropped down from the menu selected classic. First beta (closed) and im super excited.
---
Edit: Anything you guys want me to test first?
---
* When did you opt in?
---
Yesterday 8am PST
---
* Are you a content creator?
---
No (plan on being though but they didn't know that)
---
* How long has your sub been active?
---
About a year? Couple of lapses most a year long since TBC
---
* Are/were you actively playing BFA?
---
* Location(EU/US/etc)
---
Central US
---
* When was your account created?
---
Day 1 Vanilla (Beta if that counts for anything?)
---
* Did you play vanilla?
---
"eventually"
---
It went from "not at all", to "just a few weeks", now it's "eventually"
---
Sorry I'm in class and needed to get to my laptop:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/BMH3K8AEyZ1DwwA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/BMH3K8AEyZ1DwwA)This is the spec I was running in the longer video, and it is the spec I'll be rolling for pvp in phase one of classic. Coordinate with your other guild priests to figure out who is going to get divine spirit. If they are PVE players first, they usually won't mind taking it. For contrast reference, this is the traditional raid spec: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/BMPXM0AE-jDMDAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/BMPXM0AE-jDMDAA)I would never use this spec though, lacks all pvp utility and no holy nova which is huge for aoe farming in DM. I feel my spec is perfectly close enough to a standard raid spec to still give great PvE utility.
---
Yup, retarded twitch kids. Been playing since 06.
---
&gt;Turns out I was wearing all the wrong gear with the opposite stats of what I needed - wasn’t even using cat form. for nearly 2 months of leveling
---
Haha everybody was wearing wonky gear in vanilla. I'm pretty sure I was healing on a paladin in tier 1 but I look at the stats on it and just can't understand why. 
---
Sorry to hear about your brother.
---
What does the Classic option look like?
---
&gt; People who move ahead of the pack, are by definition, ahead of the pack. That means they will not find that many people
---
and with layering, they will now see EVEN LESS. Use your brain.
---
That is just evil.
---
i don't know either but hoping multiple waves
---
[I feel you.](https://i.imgur.com/e2ifLsc.png)
---
yeah i cant even figure out how to get it
---
ur all scrubs man, i bought a pre-lvld 120 Dark Iron dwarf for only 100K and can already run around in the full game.
---
Beta will be capped at 30. Maybe higher later on but for now it will be 30.
---
Yeah I was also just making sure.
---
because streamers have much more publicity then we do, theyre going to be showing it to hundreds of thousands of people while we would show it to only a handful, if that
---
Neither did i but its still sad when you see you didn't get it.
---
None of what you say changes the fact it's 100% possible to abuse the system
---
I WILL NOT MOVE WHEN FLAME WREATH IS CAST OR THE RAAAAAAAID BLOOOOOWS UUUUUUUP.
---
Yes I know that's Kara
---
Yes, outside of ganking low levels and CAMPING them, that's just a dick move. I get you are going about your day, see a low level and kill it sure, but not to wait around and not let them even respawn and move before you murder them, thats not pvp
---
This isn't the bug reporting forum for the beta.
---
I think it means that ranged will be better on some bosses and melee will be better on others. It will all balance back out to be about the same I would imagine.
---
Isn't OP positing that both buttons are the same? This meme doesn't even make sense.
---
YEAH BUT. YEAH BUT. 
---
weellll seeing some streamers log in, and only having 2 servers to choose from (pve/PVP) i doubt ANY of us normy's will get in at any time other then the stress tests.
---
Esfand is definitely a hype man as well, personally i don’t care for him (ambivalent) but he at least seems to be genuine with a good attitude
---
Maybe it's his job title?
---
thanks bro!
---
burn them all
---
I hope no takes my names:(
---
i understand the fake marketing behind it.   he was stating the REASON for beta invites were small was to actually beta test.   which is why i said "then why invite soda"  how fucking dumb are you to not understand the reply given?
---
just created a PTR account through account management and it spawned. didnt get a beta invite though =(
---
Subscribed since 10/05...no invite :(
---
&gt; I dont see them putting out 100 layers of the whole continent just to get more starting zones.
---
"i don't see blizzard ruining the game they ruined"
---
Yeah this happened to me, big letdown :(
---
nope
---
Yep, Tipsout was doing it today
---
but the other zones are, which IS part of the problem
---
There's a little dropdown box above the big blue "PLAY" button (or "INSTALL" if you don't have BFA installed), that selection box lets you pick between your WoW licenses and PTR/Beta. In that list, if you don't see: "Beta: WoW Classic" in that list, then you don't have Beta invite.
---
[Picture Example](https://i.redd.it/f4qpcuke4gy21.png)
---
It was a question, less of a report.
---
Of course Blizz is giving keys to streamers. They are advertising their game for free. Is that so hard to understand?
---
is it its own game or is it under world of warcraft drop down?
---
cheap marketing
---
I will pray for the both of us :)
---
No thanks
---
This is tipsout to a tee, the dude is the biggest shill I’ve ever seen
---
I was about to make a post about the same thing.
---
tell me if you see any EU beta player.
---
rip dreams
---
just look out for it and when it does just post it here
---
A grand total of 5 minutes.
---
Never been a part of a WoW beta despite playing for 12 years, not quite continuously but the most was like a 4 months lapse in sub. Im used to it at this point
---
Well don't be too excited when it turns out there's 300 layers in your continent
---
Under the dropdown above the 'play' button - screenshot is linked in my post
---
Not sure, but is this guy maybe EU. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/zerator??
---
Just found his channel...
---
Well he is a bit of an idiot. So depending on how much that matters to you it might not be optimal. I did watch his stream occasionally during WoD though.
---
You didn't
---
Who isnt a hype man tho, you know. I dont care for that childish stupid hype stuff. I dont love Esfand but I think hes the most level headed and relaxed of the three
---
If you go into ur account settings and make a ptr account for that wow profile it will give you a drop down
---
That is precisely what I said.
---
Why does it matter if it's dynamic? The point is if there's more than 1 layer, it can be abused, and there will always be more than 1 layer
---
I've had an active account since 2004, but didn't get an invite. Ripperino
---
If you got in you should see an option in the region selector for "Beta: WoW Classic".
---
yeah no shit,   but it's running the legion graphical animation for it and not the classic one which was the point.  
---
but hey  bwj's be bjw's
---
Seid ihr bereit?  Seid ihr soweit?  Willkommen, in die Warcraftzeit!
---
You can play it whenever it goes live on PTR you don't even need an active wow sub to play on test realm as long as you've played on it before.
---
Don’t disagree at all, just saying he does do that as well - only real blemish imo
---
Not likely, They said they wanted a small beta.
---
Sellout blizzard. I couldn't give a fuck to watch the game. I want to play it myself.
---
Are you a popular Twitch or Youtube personality?
---
If you left Billy in the chart, it showed that layering is just another term for sharding that isn't cross-realm, so OP deleted Billy to help spread his propaganda
---
Ahhh thanks mate. Guess I didn't get invited. I never do though :(
---
Are there emails going out, is there an addition to 'games and subscriptions' on the website? Or is it communicated solely via the launcher?
---
Yeah he is a french streamer, he must be on EU servers
---
Yes, how dare Blizzard give access to people who will market their game for free. What a crazy thing for them to do.
---
Was anyone under the illusion that this wasn’t going to happen? Also, why is it supposed to be a bad thing? Streamers getting access gives people the opportunity to keep up with what’s going on with the beta.
---
Like /u/chickaladee said, enhancement shamans don't have many active melee abilities besides stormstrike. It's mainly waiting for WF procs while your flame shock ticks and searing totem hits all while being buffed by strength of earth (+str) and grace of air (+agi) and lightning shield (which I neglected to use post 30 because I found it very mana intensive between mobs). Even worse in raids because flame shock/stormstrike doesn't have debuff priority and over long fights, you just run out of mana. You could play a enhance/resto mix where you mainly heal but also hit stuff but I'm not sure how well that would work out.
---
As for similar play-style, I am unsure as I haven't really played rogue or warrior enough in vanilla to know the big differences.
---
EU player, only had this account since Wrath and I somehow managed to get in.
---
Player counts for each server, please.
---
I cant believe how many posts I'm seeing about this. It's not a difficult concept. Why are so many people confused?
---
There must be a mistake.  I didn't get in. 
---
Interesting. Can I test with starter account given I have quit some time ago.
---
Had to say the same... feels bad man  
---

You don't need to avoid the wow section of twitch if you never go on twitch in the first place. 
---
*taps forehead
---
\#NoChanges means #NoStreamers
---
I'll spend some time and look into it. Im torn because I like melee :)
---
Be sure to check my youtube comments I've had a lot of long discussions on there as well. And heck yeah dude I was the same way as a resto shaman, still do arena on him on live today. Although I'm gonna work on speed runs now as every priest race on the beta.
---
than they should? based on what?
---
Played in Vanilla Beta, and every expac Beta (plus most Alphas) that there's ever been for WoW. I didn't get an invite either RIP.
---
When did you first sub to WoW, in retail vanilla?
---
exactly. OP left that out, making this propaganda because he's purposely hiding truth to make his point
---
Honestly, they don't want to crowd the starting zones, so I bet they are going to wait ~5-12 hours until people separate and then invite more to the Beta.
---
Either way, you'll be able to play Classic Beta May 22nd, next Wednesday!
---
Mana regen is high.
---
Mob damage is low.
---
Classic.
---
Damn that other rogue did 2x ur dmg feelslikeabatman
---
There's already a thread for 'Beta is live' so your thread has been removed. 
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp4f0l/-/).
---
He could be in Canada, i cant really see his location or twitter somewhere. But if you know he is located in France, then yeah he got in EU.
---
I'm sure my name just got lost in the mail.
---
Haha nice one!
---
It was a feature in the original beta but removed before release, as was Invisibility for mages. It makes logical sense, as undead used to be humans, but Blizz wanted 0 cross-faction talk.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp4f0l/-/) has been removed for Rule 7.
---
As long as none of the quests reward pre-bis gear they should be in. More quests leveling the better.
---
I didn’t assume anything, I was pointing out that with a higher pop you can do that more easily.
---
I think you’re projecting something.
---
Regen is definitely completely off at least, people are doing chain pulls and staying alive
---
I know, I'm actually really disappointed in this community. 
---
Just last week you were called a hater for saying the game's population would die after a month.
---
Now it's like, "no layering is good because the pop will die out in a month!"
---
All the changes that ruined WoW were done "for convenience", and now these people are okay with blizzard changing classic "for convenience"
---
actually its my #1 concern too
---
You might want to learn some math for point #2. If there's 4x the resources there's also 4x the people using those resources.
---
OP willingly left that out, which makes this post propaganda.
---
BFA arathi is a redone map.  
---
  The toggle is for engine side of things, shadows, water, lightning, foliage, etc.  
---
  What you're asking is basically having a pre cata and after cata button.
---
Is it BFA or classic? I don't really care about the rankings of your concerns just curious.
---
Pretty much everything is "viable" depending on what your guilds goals are. Ret, feral, boomkin, elemental, enhancement, shadow being looked at as less than optimal but you can still hit things and do damage so meh
---
it's supposed to be a super small beta. We'll all be starting equal on release date.
---
They are amazing until a second target appears.
---
Yeah nice job slapping down the most extreme response, good work
---
Lol as much as I like those guys.... yes very true.
---
Mrgm is EU and he's in
---
No, I guess they class me as a 'content creator' for having built barrens.chat?
---
1. I mean you will still have random other players in your layer? Not sure why you wouldnt be able to create friendships, guilds etc.
---
2. More resources will be avaiable but the demand increases accordingly aswell so that should balance things out.
---
3. We will need to wait until the game actually comes out to see how abusable the system actually is.
---
Warriors will still be top dogs once geared and locks will still scale well because that was true in vanilla. The  private servers weren’t perfect but they were a good estimate. And even so, you don’t need private server data to determine that, just ask anyone who raided in vanilla. 
---
The only major differences I can think of, between vanilla and classic are:
---
-	good feral druids might be viable given widespread knowledge of crowd-pummeler and power shifting 
---
-	one or two ret paladins per raid might be viable/desirable if they’re willing to swing nightfall to buff raid spell dmg
---
-	Fewer shadow priests in serious guilds since the math favors a dedicated healer priest doing the shadow weaving.
---
Also on Youtube if you don't use Spotify.

---
why are you asking the wowclassic reddit to do this? How tf are we going to do it lol. Go message twitch or something.
---
Got an invite, no email yet. 
---
Account was created launch day back in '04 and I also played the blizzcon demo for what it's worth.
---
Alliance warlocks are great since they can group with pallies.
---
we pay we gay
---
Thats one more player on the enemy faction that won't be a threat in pvp as soon
---
Camping happens. I don't do it. But i recognize its a necessary evil. You get camped for a bit. You call some friends or maybe even just some randoms in chat. They call some friends. A war starts 
---
Or alternatively you get the satisfaction of camping them back. Some of my most fun experiences in vanilla were from coming to rescue of one of my friends being camping and just dicking around for an hour or two having more guys show on and waiting for each other to respawn for war. I get your point. But you can toggle pvp on a pve server. If that isnt the experience you want a pve server is probably a better pick
---
Time is money, friend. But seriously, yes, a few hours is a very negative impact. A lot of people couldn't be bothered to log into a private server, anyone with a sub can play classic right off the bat. How many people stopped playing on a private server soon after the first zone? Whose to say it stops there as well? After finally getting through the first zone, you might hit the same queue of people in the next one. 
---
How does layering negatively impact server community? If you can spam chat in one layer, and respond to it in another, then group into the same layer, what is the downside? The economy on a subdivided layer is the same as if everyone is on the same one. If you're looking for immersion today, there's VR and surround sound headphones. Go crazy. A lot of us want to be able to play wow, not queue simulator.
---
How do you know it's the legion animation from this still image? All you see is the trail from classic charge and the classic berserker stance change..?
---
pretty sure its influencers only right now
---
Are you friends and family of any blizzard employee, or are you a streamer/media person? Or are you really just an average Joe that got lucky?
---
This could severely impact raid progression for realm firsts. If that's the case.
---
Yeah, listening to people talk about stuff never had any positive results, that's why there's no TV news. It's also why no one sits down to watch people play games, that's definitely not the most popular American pastime. Wait, duh, yes it is! If you really can't see the relationship, I hate to break it to you but you're not too bright
---
From the looks of it he is a classic influencer so was probably manually flagged like all the other main streamers
---
Unlikely because retail wow would get buried.
---
Beta: WoW Classic
---
Ah, see I was told it was later, because we didn't get it in the demo and I was defintely asking lol. Thanks!
---
the thing is, i dont want to buy one just for the chance to get in. Id feel so stupid to buy it and then not get in anyway
---
Yes! My friend got in and he thinks it’s due to making lots of demo bug reports.
---
It is definitely faster than all the private servers. I really hope it levels out later.
---
It'll say "Beta: WoW Classic" in the launcher
---
You need to be actively subscribed to retail and it would show up in your launcher.
---
Email for one, and look at the drop down menu above the blue Play button as another method.
---
You can't get backstabbed if your FoV is 360 degrees.
---
Smart.
---
Its a petition. Every upvote is a signature. More upvotes equals more likely for Twitch Staff to see.
---
Stoneform in pvp is amazing
---
Some people will take it to an extreme, sure. The majority will just act like its normal par for the course and continue on their way
---
Well, Thorium Brotherhood vendor gives the Dark Iron Armor Recipes which are arguably the best Fire-Resistance you can get for certain MC Fights. Thorium Brotherhood was added in ~~Patch 1.5~~ Patch 1.6 while Molten Core was available much earlier before.
---
Edit: I had to double check this, but recipes were available in 1.6 - the same as Blackwing Lair.
---
I agree.... Although im sure im not the only one that lost that account info ages ago and made a newer one like 10 years ago...
---
Yeah, you had to pay them $15 for the chance to get into beta. 
---
After you did, if you got accepted, the Bnet launcher will give you the option.
---
I played vanilla and tbc casually for like 10 hours a day, never raided, just leveled, alts, grinding random reps and gold.
---
Since when? 
---
Even then my point still stands with asshole being used as the context.
---
rogue, mage and warrior.
---
For alliance Mage and Warlock are more playable because of paladin salvation buffs, while on horde melee classes are better.
---
Either way, 40 man raids are basically flex raids, where you need a solid core of good players and then just fill it with whatever garbage remains, at least up to AQ/Nax
---
There is no drop down menu above play for me ( I think because I have no active subscription )
---
You're forgetting the part where each "Layer" is the size of a vanilla realm. The actual realms can hold much more people because server tech has gotten way better in 15 years (go figure). Yes there will be more nodes for resources and mobs but there will be more players too. As for the cliques, guilds, rivalries, etc, how would this be any different than other "solutions" concerning server merges? This is a necessary evil, and one that's pretty miniscule, all things considered.
---
Hunter: Marksman and/or Survival depending on gear and raid setup
---
Mage: Frost and/or Fire depending on progression
---
Rogue Combat, SF late game.
---
Priest: Shadow once 16 slots are added, but you're there to buff warlocks, not to dps.
---
Warlock: Destro
---
Warrior: Fury
---
The difference between player skill is greater than the difference between classes with all the variety of gear they can have equipped at any time. All classes are viable and you will only be snubbed by tryhards and you wouldn't even be asking this question if you where in the group of players where this information even matters. What matters is if they need melee or ranged dps at the time you are free to raid and they are trying to fill the group.
---
Pick the class you enjoy playing from 1-60.
---
God I hate this question.
---
Depends, would it be characteristic of you to keep going? That's for ~~You~~ D&amp;D to decide
---
You don't have to be actively subbed. i know someone who got in and is not subbed at all.
---
I know what server I want that has nothing to do with the fact that a lvl 60 killing and camping a lvl 10 is not pvp, it's just being an asshole
---
I wouldn't know I don't watch him, just know the name and reputation. I also don't really watch Classic (or really any) streamers with any seriousness.
---
Yeah this is what I thought and didn't want to pay 15 for a lottery ticket. Just wanted to know if there is a way to check
---
it was a fcking joke.. he was not meaning it!
---
I mean.. All of those streamers that attended Blizzard's Content Creator summit have been pretty open about knowing that they were guaranteed a spot. 
---
It's people they were listening to for feedback just a few weeks ago and had already played the beta.
---
I have like 2 million gold so I bought a token.
---
It'll just show up on the Bnet launcher if you got in. First wave preference given to influencers and people who have old account creation dates and active sub / time subbed.
---
I don't remember them ever flat out  saying they wouldn't have sharding (hence all the drama and discussion about it). I think layering is a better alternative that doesn't break immersion as badly as sharding does... but maybe I'm just getting played. : /
---
If you don't want to play wow the way it was then why are you even here? There is another sub for live.
---
He is an influencer so probably has special treatment like streamers
---
Exactly, if an mmo released today and had a 30min queue time, it'd get low marks. If you couldn't even compete an initial quest once you finally got in, it would be torn apart.
---
((( YOU ARE NOT PREPARED )))
---
The meme is that both buttons are supposed to contradict each other. In this picture there's no contradiction.
---
It would be there if you got in. you dont need an active sub to get it
---
Towelliee literally referred to Reddit as "the virtual equivalent of Ebola" 
---
Whatever that's supposed to mean?
---
Exactly, low effort nonsense meme. The options are the same. If no changes, then there would be mass number of players in starting zones. If changes/sharding then less.
---
What the fuck
---
You are comparing a video game steamer  to a news channel ? I’d honestly compare it to reality tv. Perhaps I’m too old for the internet nowadays but I can’t see the fun in watching vlogs or streams. Nor can I enjoy an episode of keeping up with the kardashians or Jerry springer. Same level garbage to me but all things I just summed up seemed to be major hits
---
On a PvP realm, green was 'safe'(no pvp toggle), yellow was contested (forced pvp toggle for both factions) and red was enemy safe zone.  
---
There was no such distinction on a PvE realm. They were all the same type.
---
Who hurt you :(
---
Only content creators got Beta invites I assume?
---
So.. are we sure?
---
Yeah, it’s been a while since I actually waited for a game. The last one was Diablo 3, hope this doesn’t turn out like it, lol
---
&gt; less than optimal 
---
Sure, the same way rotting carcass is looked at as a less than optimal meal, but you can still eat it and feel full, so meh.
---
People in the beta are literally just going to follow their streamers around spamming Kappa and MonkaS while trying to trade them shit. 
---
Fuck I hate twitch and yes I'm salty I didnt get in.
---
I just dont even know
---
Mages and rogues are the master race classes
---
I wonder if blizzard will do the race to 50 event again lol.
---
Probably not.
---
If streamers are going to be showing their Classic beta playthroughs, I predict **a lot** of time watching Twitch in my future.

WoW Classic is still a Movement... I remember 10 Years ago, when i talked about "Classic" Servers and everyone was laughing at me and telling "Nobody want's to play that Old Shit"

Look how far we have come in 2019...

Yeah I KNOW that and I'm telling you it is not there and never has been. That's why I was asking about it in the first place lol.

&gt; All of those streamers that attended Blizzard's Content Creator summit have been pretty open about knowing that they were guaranteed a spot.
---
I heard a Blizz dev on one of the interview videos say that they were guaranteed.
---
Wouldn't they want to give beta to some people that aren't actively playing?  To get new blood interested = $$$
---
Would you like a screen shot or something?
---
Hi, /u/LockingHorns
---
&gt; Multiple copies of resources existing is my issue.
---
Which will be an issue. A big one. And that's one of the things the pro-layering people continue to pretend doesn't exist
---
The fact of the matter though, is that they're changing the game. This isn't WoW Vanilla with layers
---
Fury war, combat rogue, frost/fire mage, destruction warlock. Hunters are there to dispel enrage and everything else is just meme specs. 
---
J/k play whatever. There are very few DPS race bosses in vanilla. As long as you bring consumables, do the mechanics correctly, and show up you should be fine.
---
It said "participants need to have a sub"
---
Also on the F&amp;F list, have tested from late alpha and closed betas for the last 3 expacks (and I submitted probably a dozen bug reports), subbed since summer 2005, actively subscribed to BFA, play at 2-4 days weekly.... aaaand no beta.
---
You're not understanding that a lvl 60 killing a lvl 10 isn't pvp, there is a reason they implemented dishonor points, and hopefully they are in classic
---
About 30 minutes ago.
---
Kappa
---
Wait, she was a Rogue, you were a warrior, and you couldn't beat her?  Damn, she must've been good.
---
I mean, the longer they take to roll things out the more money they'll make. It probably didn't take much arm twisting to make that decision.
---
&gt; Since we all had to pay $15 for a chance at the beta 
---
Wait. Let me fix that.
---
&gt; Since I had to pay $15 for a chance at the beta
---
huh?
---
I mean I haven't played retail in a very long time, the last time i played having around 20k gold was considered super rich. lol
---
I do remember getting BFA access a few hours after the initial wave. Fingers crossed it happens again.
---
Isnt an exact date something that would help to know when you are having trouble recovering your account? If I were you I wouldnt give out the exact date of account creation. A skilled social engineer might be able to grab your account
---
It actually makes more sense on this beta to show preference to players who actually played during WoW Classic so they can help make it a more "classic" experience for everyone.
---
Absolutely not. So far out of the 173 DMs I’ve gone through. I’ve marked out 173 to be gifted. I’m in no way able to judge who is worthy and who isn’t. 
---
I just want to hear their stories as I feel it’s beautiful that everyone has their own life story to share.. no matter their age. 
---
And don’t worry. The information is basic at most. Just name and age so I know whom I’m addressing and the age so that I know what tone to set the message to and if I require parental consent.
---
you think they'd put classic wow on PTR?
---
did you need to restart the bnet client before it showed up?
---
&gt; The biggest damage sharding did to WoW was the destruction of server communities
---
which layering still has. That guy you were just questing with 10 minutes ago? Well he's in the same area, but he joined someone 5 minutes ago to kill something real quick - and now he's on layer 7 and you can't see him
---
&gt;Considering we already know layering won't last into end-game.
---
We don't know this. We don't know this at all. First they said they weren't going to have it at all. Now it's "just phase 1". So it will become "just a little longer into phase 2" and then before you know it we will just have it permanently. Or are you saying that people are just super nostalgic and that's going to wear off a couple weeks after release? Is that what you're saying?
---
Right, but that doesn't mean they payed in cash lmao. Remember they can spend gold to get a sub. They never specified that you couldn't do that.
---
Is he some kind of streamer or youtube content creator? Or by any chance someone gotten himself on the F&amp;F invites lists? Asking just to be sure
---
Only streamers and people classified as “influencer” or “content creators” got in without sub i heard
---
Forgot I downloaded it for my mom. Saw classic wow, was like NO WAY. “Demo” welp, I’m a dumbass. Checked all 3 of my family’s accounts
---
I never got an email either.
---
How big is the client? Guessing the 2 gb is only a patch
---
I love this meme
---
"There are somethings, but your something is not one of the somethings."
---
Just logged in and I can see the PvE and PvP servers, and make a character. Looks like it's real access!
---
Has this been confirmed? How would you know you’ve been chosen if they’re not sending out invites? You would see it on launcher then go to play and it says pay us first?
---
~4 GB
---
I think they forgot to invite F&amp;F......
---
Ah, my edit where I said I misunderstood wasn't enough, got it.
---
Gratz Have fun... i am not so lucky sadly... Maybe in the next Wave :)
---
Racial imbalance is way overblown on this sub. It's a slight advantage for the orc player, but not insurmountable at all. Play human rogue, play alliance warlock, it's really not going to make that huge of a difference.
---
What kind of gameplay do you like watching in BFA streams?
---
Lucky! So far every normal person who has gotten in seems to have started their account from beta or day 1. Have fun man.
---
Back to private servers for another 3 months and 11 days.
---
Yes! I had to fully exit the launcher by right-clicking the system tray icon then restart my launcher. Then the beta appeared in my dropdown.
---
You're gonna cut right before we get the credits and the dancing?
---
"it's just a joke, bro" is the shittiest excuse for behavior.
---
I don't see why not, they put every xpac on PTR and classic is basically just another xpac they're rolling out in my mind.
---
yea, maybe - He not once after declared it a joke and even got a couple subs on it. So, seem like the "joke" was profitable?
---
lolno
---
I would if streamers weren't so cringe.
---
Why would I even want transmog when a lot of the original tier sets are so god damn sexy?
---
Wow that's a tiny one, thanks for the info man
---
Which isn't the case - because Emerald Dream and other servers which have been listed by numerous players are still pretty strong considering.
---
Given the likely expected growth chart for classic being a downward trend. It is critical to have them at the start to allow them an actual chance to establish a community.
---
The worst thing blizzard can do is drive a subset of the community to realm's that don't fit what they want as it drives divides between the other server types community and the players that are trying to attain something else.
---
For example, it can lead to a toxic attitude on RP servers due to the higher preference of PvP and depending on the group more openness to freeform PvP. Whereas in some RP groups that is heavily looked down on which causes confrontation between the two groups.
---
PvE/PvP servers that can be toxic towards players that are roleplaying in an RPG. Which can further divide the community making people shy aware from it just because of bullying. It's like that guy in school that was quite macho but really liked dance and peeps took the piss until the gave up etc.
---
So what? It’s a separate game. OSRS got its own page, Classic will as well.
---
And now our salt begins
---
Hi, /u/sarumbi
---
WoW Classic is a new popular thing and many are racing to become one of the "staple streamers" for it. Opinions change swiftly when there's money on the line.
---
My point was that I'd never pay the sub fee to play the beta.
---
Yea you can! You can heal fine as enhancement as long as you have a int/spi offset of gear and that's up to Sunken Temple and Blackrock Depths...even then I've ran a 0/24/27 spec, so you could probably heal right up to 60 with that and I personally find stormstrike too mana intensive to use even between mobs and I like to hop into the resto tree at 33 because it makes healing so much easier (the 0.5secs off healing wave and the 25% totem cost is huge).
---
At 60, points into ele to do a 30/0/21 build is great for PvP, not the greatest for farming mobs (but it holds up, you can farm DM:E Lashers alright...and you can always just use your professions for gold anyways) and will still get you invites to raids because you can heal fine with 21 points in resto. Early on people may get mad that they don't have mana-tide but you'll be in a melee group anyways dropping windfury totemz and those healers (you included) gotta learn to downrank those spells!
---
Through WoD and Legion gold inflated something ridiculous. I had a small fortune 35k in TBC  because of clefthoof leather and just played the AH and cornered markets when expansions hit dark moon cards especially.
---
One of the biggest things about Vanilla WoW was community. Layering separates that community.
---
it's really that simple. Obviously IT WILL NEVER BE EXACTLY THE SAME. But they can make it close - and this goes against a FUNDAMENTAL reason WoW Vanilla was better than what WoW is today
---
Well the top post about this is literally all wrong so that could be why lol
---
Is there any way to tell other than the bnet launcher?
---
The alternative is day long queues or dead servers that you have to pay to leave.
---
jelly
---
I understand that but the person was not subbed so unless they got put on a list somehow from someone that's the only thing i can think of.
---
I mean he may have gotten on a list some how but i just know he was not subbed.
---
Doesn't help when there are 20+ groups around. Also grouping doesn't help for quite many types of quest items you have to loot because still only one gets the credit.
---
This is one of the most infamous WoW videos so yeah it was posted here b4.
---
Meh, $15 for a chance is a great deal. I'd pay hundreds to be able to log in. 
---
 I am still wondering how many idiots like myself are out there that read that line differently. 
---
They still had to have mad bank, haha.
---
Played since 6 days after launch, I've only taken a few months of break (I still enjoy the game, sue me) and I've never been in beta. 
---
It happens.
---
He may have gotten onto a list from someone then otherwise idk.
---
&gt; The difference between player skill is greater than the difference between classes
---
This is such a silly argument, if you are a good player you'd perform better in a playable spec, if you're a worse player playing a bad spec will make you even worse.
---
Heart, always. You'll regret it later if you don't.
---
Yep. It would be pretty weird to bring in content creators to give feedback directly on upcomming stuff, and not give them beta access.
---
They 100% didn't listen to us, and the fact OP turned this into a "they listened to us!!!" is masterfully deceptive.
---
And the worst part is people bought into it immediately.
---
Last week it was "\#NOCHANGES" now it's "no it's totally okay to change this guys!!! it makes it more convenient!!!" Even though making things more convenient is what made WoW the flop it is today
---
"I NEED TO FEED MYSELF"
---
OK, get out of your room and get a job that contributes to society, nerd.
---
There’s a lot of non streamers who got in.
---
Even as a joke it shows how much of a sell out he is lol.
---
It will be bannable.
---
Apparently this is true if you are Blizzard friends and family or if you are a content creator. For the masses, they have said you need an active sub.
---
Play what you want, if you want to play something "off-meta", you can do so by joining a less hardcore guild. But to answer your question...  
---
Top Tier:
---
Combat Rogue (swords or daggers)
---
Fury Warrior
---
Good Tier (still needed):
---
Meh Tier (not sought after, but fine to bring if they're good and have consumes):
---
Shadow Priest (max 1, needs 16 debuff slots)
---
Feral Druid
---
Enhancement Shaman (with Nightfall axe)
---
Ret Paladin (with tons of consumes and complex rotation)
---
"Non-Viable":
---
Boomkin / Balance Druid  (lower DPS and OOMs quick)
---
Elemental Shaman  (OOMs very quick)  
---
Again, most people here agree it's best to play what you think is fun, not what's "meta", but here's the info for you.
---
WoW is truly a phenomenon. 15-year-old game that can pull insane twitch numbers from in-game events, not some multi milion esport. I think that classic will legit be the biggest thing on twitch for months when it launches. So many popular streamers are super classic fans: Soda, Asmon, Timthetatman etc. Others just have some history with WoW, so they will play it for sure, like Shroud. The snowball effect can be huge and honestly slow-paced MMO like classic are perfect for streamers to interact with viewers both on stream and in-game. Also the launch will be absolutely crazy in terms of Twitch numbers.
---
For this night and 102 nights to come.
---
shouldn't be dissapointed anyway, people who get invited will just ruin the nostalgia for themselves be patient the first time is the best don't ruin it for yourself.
---
\--&gt; *TRANAFERS* &lt;--
---
Being listed for a certain price doesn't mean people actually buy it at that price.
---
Did you get an email ever? Or did you just sign in and have the option!?
---
You should really never show yourself typing your password.
---
I'm honestly happy for you, but also really salty at the same time, lmfao.
---
I can’t tell if it’s the exact same as classic but it’s damn close. The font is bigger and the numbers stay longer compared to bfa. Also the crit animation sometimes jump around like it used to. So to me it looks like the old combat text
---
I love how instead of just not watching streamers or youtubers you dont like, a bunch of this sub has to take every opportunity to say how much these people are cancer for the community. Hate to break it to you, but you guys who whine about Tipsout are more cancer than he is.
---
OP isn't that far off on the point about resources because if it were just a single server, then those resources have a finite availability regardless of how many people there are, higher population would mean higher scarcity, more competition for the same fixed amount of nodes/spawns. In the case of 4 Layers, then that's 4 copies of resources to gain in parallel all filtering into a single auction house that spans the entire server population. So, same amount of people sharing those resources, but 4x more resources to collect due to the parallel nature of the layer copies.
---
Unless the assumption that the AH on a server are connected between the layers is wrong, but I can't really see how that would be the case, especially if one migrates between layers via party invites.
---
I love how anyone who is mentioning that this happened is getting downvoted to bury the scoop. If Tips actually did this, someone should clip it from his stream and post it because that kind of shit is not okay.
---
You and me both, brother. I’m happy to live this part of the journey vicariously through streamers, though - we look onwards. Maybe the stress tests will be more kind.
---
Automating a better spread is easy.
---
Lets say L1 currently sits at 2500 and it's peak hours (so 18:00/6PM) for the server's timezone.  
---
L1 can technically go to 3000 but the server starts filling L2 instead because it expects some ~1500 players to log in the coming hour based on previous statistics.
---
As weeks progress this system can do an increasingly better job. If Saturdays consistently sees 8000 online for three weeks straight the server can put up three layers right away and door people into them as they come online.
---
Anyway a simple fact remains.   
---
Without layering those 21 people would just not be playing. They would be stuck in a queue.
---
Which means if you want to criticise layering, you really should have an alternative ready.
---
Unless of course your assertion is queues are a good thing.
---
You’re probably right, there would be a market that would like to voyueristically watch people watching porn. 
---
The question is how many people want to be filmed watching porn? 
---
I totally understand watching streamers, I really don’t understand donating to them. No one donates to me while I play, the only difference is I don’t have a camera on and my language can be even saltier than a streamers.
---
But I definitely understand watching them, especially for games I can’t play yet.
---
Holy crap people are crying for even a beta announcement, crying for a release date, and now that we have BOTH people are crying about it not being “fair.” I must be new to the internet or something...
---
The problem is it's not exactly clear what a "participant" is. That could easily be interpreted as it's possible to receive an invite but a sub is required to actually access the beta (i.e., actively participate). Just like I can go buy BfA right now if I want to but I can't participate in the game until I buy a sub.
---
I mean, it's probably not the case because why wouldn't they prioritize their active subs, but I can see where the confusion is coming from.
---
Any RP servers?
---
yeah, but some people forget :p
---
Some of his youtube content leading up to this has been fantastic.  Especially stuff like his prot warrior deep dive.  Calling him cancer is pretty much lowest common denominator behavior.  But hey, I get it, this is Reddit.  I'll get down voted to hell and you'll farm that sweet karma for calling a content provider cancer.
---
There is a stress test in like 7 days, just wait for that one
---
Not that I can see. I'm logged in and playing now and still no e-mail or anything. Make sure to full exit your launcher and restarting, that's what I did and it showed up.
---
Gotta be real for a second... the private server community is absolute cancer.
---
That's a great way to look at it, I feel less salty now
---
Because they haven't removed everything yet and it's a beta. Report it via the tool
---
Please rock me carefully, rock me slowly.
---
This happens for every game, this isn’t a conspiracy or surprising at all.

---
Aww is entitled baby upset? Here’s a juice box, time for a nap little one.
---
i think they said this isnt going to be a thing in an interview. this is just a beta so its not a finished product, not everything is complete yet lol. just report it in the bugs or feedback if youre in the beta
---
Is it in your account management page as well?
---
recently started again on a fresh bnet acc during legion, got into the bfa beta somehow still.
---
World of Warcraft ranking highly on the Twitch page is good for Blizzard and both games. I don't think Blizz would want to potentially lower this by splitting it into two different games.
---
I like these guys and their passion shows through, but some of their content is questionable in the accuracy department.
---
I remember they had a ranking video where they just assigned random numbers to classes, ordered classes by their arbitrary chosen numbers, then used that as evidence of class rankings and overall balance. It was basically a textbook example of how to incorrectly generate metrics and perform a trade study. So close, but so far. I do still enjoy their content though; I don’t want to be too critical since their content is mostly free and often entertaining or informative.
---
Children are born every single day.
---
Yours just happens to be on the most important day in history.
---
This rogue was a trade between someone. I gave him my fury warrior and he gave me this rogue. We played them 1 day and swithed ba[c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m8yDGL_wpQ)k. Good memories. Haven't played after lvl 85.

1) Layering doesn't stop long queues
---
2) I'm not willing to make the sacrifice, so don't hold me accountable for your carelessness
---
3) You have no proof they will get rid of layering. "They said it" doesn't mean shit, because they said they wouldn't do layering, yet here we are
---
Inviting streamers, youtubers and "content creators" first has been standard practise in games ever since twitch got big. They are not setting a precedent in any way, they are simply following the trend.
---
Beastlore worked on Maexxena
---
I hear the easy way to get past this shit is to just not watch Tipsout. But the people who hate him have to let everyone on the sub know they don't like him. Its ridiculous.
---
"remember when Trade made groups and raids" RIP
---
Thanks for the password kid
---
It's smart, yes. But if they don't allow a lot more people into the beta, will the Twitch hype last 3 months? 
---
 People see something and then they want that thing. Instant gratification is real. 
---
 I mean, the hype will still be around for Classic, of course, I just mean the extra hype from the streamers and its staying power. 
---
Also, i'm just salty right now, lol. I watched one streamer a bit ago talking about how he doesn't play wow and he has no idea what he's doing to an audience of like 40 people. Yet those of us that played vanilla and waited 15 years are here on reddit. 
---
/rant 
---
omg, I need to get a life.
---
I got my invite boys. Weirdly enough, I didn't even get a notification sent to my email or anything. 
---
* When did you opt in? May 14 \~8am (PST)
---
* Are you a content creator? No.
---
* How long has your sub been active? 1 Day as of yesterday
---
* Are/were you actively playing BFA? No
---
* Location(EU/US/etc) US-West
---
* When was your account created? 2006
---
* Did you play vanilla? Yes
---
Probably. That's what they did with Old School Runescape.
---
Very smart move on Blizz's behalf. This is why I think the invites are going to come in waves though, even though it hasn't been confirmed - most of the big streamers aren't "hardcore" vanilla players and won't be as efficient at finding bugs or inconsistencies and whatnot. It'd probably look a bit silly if every streamer had their viewers following them about spamming "Trihard 7" in-game as well, especially right now when traffic is peaking. The hype right now is real though, Classic currently has ~200k viewers on Twitch and it's *_great_* PR for Blizz.
---
&gt; I just want to level with my buddies and do classic dungeons. Which is all layered already. Then maybe do some BGS, which again..is layered.
---
Well I'm glad you're happy but that doesn't mean I should be. Also, you'll still be waiting in que with your friends so I don't think you understand the situation very well
---
So no email? you just gotta check the launcher??
---
Definitely sounds like the proper text, since they originally removed it from Legion client entirely. They likely ported the code from the old client.
---
You just gonna scroll by without sayin' howdy?
---
I’d compare it to old/new models. If they forced new models in, would it actually change anything about the game
---
itself? No, but it wouldn’t fit the old aesthetic. Plus, a lot of people hate the retail combat text. I think every spec had so many numbers and so many crits, that they had to redesign it. But with the slower paced flow of numbers in Classic, the numbers need to have that “pop” again. It’s that extra hit of dopamine when you get a crit, for example. Not number one concern, but it should be a concern, *if it’s wrong*.
---
Yeah same here, also in my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) account it showed a 2nd PTR account.   No email, no notification.
---
&gt;"Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."
---
While I would agree it's more likely, it doesn't actually say outright that you need an active subscription for a chance to be **invited**, so unless it has been clarified somewhere else already you can quit your condescending bullshit, you don't know anything more than everybody else.
---
I know a guy who used to work for blizzard 3 years ago but give me no information at all. Does that count?
---
female orc is my favourite race in classic WoW, period. The way she moves and swings a 2hand and says her /silly is just great. Plus armor just looks amazing (as you can see I may be a little biased lol).
---
I am also torn between playing a female orc shaman or a troll priest. Two amazing healers but two totally different healing kits for pve and pvp. hrrrmmmm.
---
&gt; The easier things in life rarely satisfy
---
EXACTLY. Blizzard making WoW "more accessible" and "easy" is what turned the game into what everyone hates today. These people are just asking for blizzard to fuck things again at this point
---
And have a best looking 1st level character as a competition.
---
Not if you can't log in. Which was his point.
---
Bug: There's no Classic beta option on my launcher
---
Fix: Tried everything, nothing worked
---
Workaround: Crying on Reddit currently
---
Actually one of my big concerns because I wish it was an option in BfA. I've hated the new damage text since it was introduced in Legion. It was an option via cvars before, but they removed that too.
---
Sorry, I don't know AV that well, but won't it mean that if the objectives are ignored and there's no time limit, then the game will last longer until the objectives are complete?
---
Aggro radius is really low from what I’ve seen.
---
Dude... He doesn't HAVE to do this. He's doing it because he wants to.
---
Scamming is a bannable offense. Professions are hard to level. People won’t risk scamming and losing their account.
---
There are not 50 different macros and healing spells. Big heal, little heal, shield ... keep the tank up. EZ
---
Oh yeah, I almost forgot that. I noticed a new WoW account appeared on my battle.net account page called "WoW Legion 5" or something. That's what gave me the idea to hard-reset my launcher and find it.
---
Watching streams right now and ya it seems like a very small opening wave, eying the  starting areas. Probably still friends, family, streamers and a lucky few players according to these comments.
---
Yes. he's lying, because it's not gone yet. As of today, layering is here.
---
You can't trust what they say when they said they wouldn't fucking have it in the first place, and now it's here
---
I assume it's also created automatically if you get into the beta
---
Does the Classic Demo install just turn into the Classic beta?
---
Yeah they are entirely different games that draw different types of viewers and streamers for the most part. It really should have its own section.
---
Also, it would be really good to see how its viewership and notoriety stacks up next to Retail, thats the kind of clear proof less informed people, or Blizz would need to acknowledge that there is a serious following for the Vanilla/early expansions!
---
yeah but classic wow isn't an expansion, if they did put it on ptr that'd be cool with me..but if they did it'd prolly be sometime in august or near it.
---
I'm in and not a streamer or f&amp;f
---
You’re a year late. NO BETA FOR YOU!
---
Only plebs, scrubs n casuals won't see endgame before phase 2, gg your lack of vanilla knowledge
---
Same here mang. But who knows, maybe they'll open the beta up over time.
---
The stress test will be the major invites. I too, feel crummy but our time will come.
---
I promise if I get in I will post about it here
---
When is classic wow is coming out?
---
I’m so glad I’m in my thirties and have no clue wtf this streaming stuff is all about.
---
If 4 layers are needed and populated, it's because there's enough population for 4 layers.  If there is only enough population for 1 layer, they only have access to 1 layer/server's worth of resources, because it's not like they can just jump into the empty layers on a whim. So yes, 4 times the resources, but also *4 times the population.* I don't understand why this is so hard for people to grasp.
---
Kept it under a minute
---
My work schedule is ideal for easy nodes... I work 4:30PM EST until 0300 four days a week.  Can't wait for those easy nodes at 3:20.
---
why thats not mine account so... xd i just made it for this
---
The walking animation looks faster because it isn't FPS locked. It's the exact same animation and speed though :) 
---
Huge optical illusion huh
---
&gt; but are not going to stick around if they can't play for two weeks after launch.
---
layering does absolutely nothing to fix that
---
I wish barrens chat would still get spammed with Chuck Norris jokes instead of MAGA/Nazi shit that plagues pservers.
---
Hopefully classic will have better moderation
---
Seems to be a bug with the invites, as I haven't received one quite yet
---
One of us got in!!!!
---
I don't see anything on my Bnet launcher, nor did I receive any emails. I suppose that means no invite then :(
---
Not yet...
---
What? All I'm seeing is that you're missing the part where I said that 4x the resources would be used, as well. I don't see what you're getting at otherwise.
---
Imp pet attack and LOS issues
---
You didn’t word it poorly.  This guy is reaffirming what you said argumentatively lol
---
It’s a goddamn beta, people need to relax and stop acting like children. Blizzard wants to start with streamers and help advertise the game for free?! How dare they slight us meek lowly peasants, we can’t simply wait 3 months, that’s madness.
---
Lol yup been the norm for like 3 years at least now...
---
Haven't heard of any F&amp;F getting in. Quite a few of us posting in various threads not about not getting in. Seems to be streamers and then randomly selected.
---
Played  day 1 and just resubbed yesterday. Played a few of the xpacs after but from vanilla - wotlk no lifed it. Not a streamer
---
Definitely, it's going to take some time to get used to haha
---
Regeneration is completely off, people are steamrolling the starting zone with full HP, and mana constantly, which is not suppose to be a thing.
---
Yes, regen is suppose to be higher before lvl 5, but not this high. You should still be eating and certainly drinking
---
In the Character Creation Screen, when you change any of the visuals, the character keeps jumping around. I don't recall it was like that before. Was it?
---
That's how I read that sentence, that in order to participate in the beta at all, I'd have to be subbed in order to be on the list of possible players. 
---
Otherwise if they give out a beta to someone not subbed and that person doesn't play, it wastes a beta slot.
---
&gt; From my understanding, the whole idea of Layering is to keep you in the same "shard" as much as possible.
---
Vanilla is a game where you are grouping up with randoms often
---
Guess what grouping up does? Moves you from a layer.
---
Your understanding is completely wrong
---
Well if it helps someone out somewhere. Then yes I’m more than happy. 
---
Well I’m a Software Architect for a few years now. And I’ve made enough so I feel like it’s time to give back now. 
---
And what better community than the one that’s given me so much during my childhood days.
---
If that's the case, I'd rather them stream without their faces and commentary. They add nothing of value to the gameplay, and in reality are just actually ruining the overall footage.
---
Yeah, I was rolling my eyes at this today, especially at the streamers who largely aren't considered WoW streamers. To be fair though, Classic is very hype worthy and is going to pull back a lot of players. Guess it falls under 'don't hate the player, hate the game' as far as twitch and view farming goes.
---
Damn Blizzard though for saying shits coming out today and not delivering so far. Thought we were passed this kind of thing.
---
Edit: Nevermind, it's out. Took long enough!
---
Make that same statement when comparing if there was no layer/sharding system at all, but the same overall server population as a realm with 4 Layers. That's the point OP is trying to make.
---
Oh yeah? What changed again?
---
True. Even if a streamer is not actively looking for bugs, thousands of eyes are!
---
Good thing it's easy to just type whatever country you want!
---
It's pretty late in the day for betas to still be going out. I for one appreciate the consistency of summer and may 15th. For future we know when they say anything they really mean less than 25% of whatever was said.
---
No moonwalking
---
There's literally an option to report bugs and issues ingame
---
&gt; Agreed! I'm also noticing that move speed is quite fast 
---
People were saying this in the blizzcon demo and some guy tested it, it was the exact same, it just looks faster because the animation has more frames than it did in 1.12.
---
Yep, I’m guessing after each stress test a new wave will get into the game. I’m guessing the beta is going all the way to launch so
---
Just a big heads up, they generally (in past betas) space invite windows out between 5-7 weeks.  So don't get your hopes up before the first stress test.
---
I think they gave beta to people who've played since Vanilla.   Everyone I've talked to whose gotten a code has played since launch.   I could be dead wrong here but it would make sense.   You want someone to beta your game, have people who've played it already so they know what it should be like.
---
APEX made it even better as the game came from nowhere
---
Thanks! If you want to be pro, go with a smaller monitor though haha. Always suggest gsync or freesync with frame rates above 144.
---
Hopefully this is something that gets removed.
---
And yes Regen seems off for sure the difficulty for low level
---
&gt;BCCCC
---
it'd be better if they didnt force me to sub to retail to try and get access, but instead see how many years my account was active before their game went down the drain.
---
I was thinking after each stress test a new group would be added but nothing is for sure right now.
---
Mana regen is fine but health regen seems sooo off
---
My account was created November 2004 and no access :( with the CE. Sad day
---
It wouldn't have 4 layers populated (and therefore accessible) unless it had 4 times the population of a server with a single layer.
---
Kargoz is pretty genuine. He admits he’s not an expert on Classic, and doesn’t pretend to be, but he still knows a fair bit about the game, and is really passionate about it. He helped open up a Classic WoW conglomeration of info website with Defcamp/Melderon/a bunch of other people, who *are* actually experts.
---
Wait I thought we were haters for saying the population would drop off after a month?
---
Now you guys are using it to justify layering?
---
Some didn’t have a active sub and still got beta access, and they said they were choosing at random in a thread I saw about the beta.

Disc priests attacks don’t heal in vanilla

IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO
---
WTB beta access 150$
---
People have reported getting invited without being subbed. So it doesn't seem to be the case.
---
Not gone forever. They said they would be turning off layering as soon as the crowding logically allows. So everyone will be on the same layer forever, once it's turned off.
---
Looking at your posts it seems like the world might not have been kind to you because you lack basic reading comprehension and are being such a drama queen; it wouldn't surprise me if no one tolerated you. You know what would actually impact your ability to play the game? Multiple hour long queue times. You know what won't? Sharing a game world with a subset of your server's population for a month.
---
One of the biggest annoyances I have is people telling me the tourists will leave in sixth months. Bull shit Retail will be a grave yard in 6 months. Not because classic wow is better which it is but, because retail is legitimately a pile of shit. Even in a vacuum removed from it's comparison to classic. It's still complete shit almost no one wants to play.
---
While I know it's very unlikely that they'll send out a second wave tonight, I'm going to refresh the shit out of the launcher because I have zero self control.
---
PTR is the test realm they use for upcoming patches. I activated an account and it spawned the dropdown box to change accounts where the beta download and server can be accessed.
---
You're on a subreddit for a video game that is probably THE definition of "waste of time", and you're talking shit about people enjoying a stream?
---
Yea, welcome to reddit - are you new here?
---
"/s" isn't a thing people just type for fun
---
even at lvl 40 footages from the in house beta the health regen was still retardly fast
---
its called marketing
---
Why should Twitch care about that?
---
I used to be like you but from my extensive research (asking people "but why‽") I've discovered that most people do it for a combination of 3 reasons: 
---
1) because they love playing and want to get better so it's like live tips and tricks
---
2) because they love the game and they suck and know they suck and want to watch someone wreck kids cause they can't really do it themselves
---
3) because they love video games and are bored and sometimes the human interaction is nice
---
People used to trade WoW gold for runescape golds all of the time back in the day. I don’t recall it ever being s problem
---
I wish I got in man I sat there for at least 10 minutes refreshing and I’m not getting my hopes up until after the first stress test.
---
oh really? could you link the thread? In their announcement it said they were only selecting players with active sub or game time cards
---
mana regen formula is `15 + spirit / class factor`
---
So if you think about it, at low levels when you only have 100 mana, those 15 base regen are *really* significant.
---
I always pretended I was Austin Powers jumping into the time machine.
---
^ not confirmed by Blizz in the slightest. Speculation. FYI
---
Do you get to keep your character from beta?
---
3. You are low level.
---
That's my biggest quarrel with current wow. It isn't the content or the queuing for everything. It's just how few people I ever see anywhere. Like, I know hundreds of people are running WQs, but only ever see like 1 or 2?
---
I like running into the same names, getting used to who the Tarren Mill campers are, etc.
---
Its just really random, account from 2005 and active sub but no beta.
---
Enhance shamans are legit the worst Nightfall users in the game. Your guild prolly still wont want you even if you use them. Keep in mind by this patch you can't proc nightfall off windfury hits. So the only thing you have to keep it going is white hits and storm strike.
---
Really?? Lmao that guy is cancer. Is there a clip ?

---
&gt;With a population of over 327 million people, the U.S. is the...
---
sounds like way more people care about the EU than the US
---
at least 185.6 million people anyways
---
that's good news then if they're not lying to you...but I'm not gonna get my hopes up.
---
Conflicted between warlock and shaman.  Mained mage back in the day, and raided all the way to Cthun/4horsemen. I ended up switching to Shaman in WOTLK (where I also mained paladin and DK throughout that expac), and remained Shaman main ever since. 
---
Love the idea of maining lock, it would be a brand new experience but still the caster archetype I'm used to.  I love the nuance of all the pets, debuff management, and the RP value of being a dark-caster, selfish mage, etc.  
---
Also very tempted by shaman, another class full of nuance.  Friend group has a Druid, Hunter, Mage, Warlock, Warrior already (plus some others, there's bound to be class overlap, but no shaman as of yet).  Never got to main shaman back in vanilla, and have rarely healed end-game.  I'm intrigued by elemental burst, having fun with windfury, and the smart-heals of chainheal.  
---
It's looking like I'll be GMing our guild, so I could end up with priority on Hand of Rag, which could be pretty sweet on a shaman.  However, warlock just feels more right to me.  It just feels like you have more answers to things, and the different specs all feel like different flavors of the same class, versus shaman where each spec is sort of its own class (at least enh vs the others).  Low key considering just going Mage again for all the QOL and bursty AoE goodness.
---
No, it was amazing.  So many epic wpvp battles.  Met so many great people out in the world doing random stuff.
---
That would make no sense, especially since leveling takes so long.
---
Asmon never missed 1 hit or ability pretty bad from blizzard lol
---
Honestly if he likes the hybrid style of Shaman and wants to melee he should go feral druid. I mained feral in Vanilla and TBC and they are great fun. Plus you can be rogue or warrior lite.
---
You really aren't getting it are you.
---
Hypothetical situation where Blizzard didn't have Layers on a server at all, we'll call that Server A, with 10k population.
---
Server B, with 10k population split amongst 4 Layers.
---
Server B is going to have 4x the resources of Server A because Server B's layers would only be like ~2500 players per layer competing for resources in their respective layers vs Server A's 10k players competing for the same amount of resources as a single layer.
---
Ergo, Layers will affect the economy as it compares to Vanilla WoW, hence OP's point #2
---
I watched a tips out you tube and the levels of in accuracy was astounding
---
&gt; You should still be eating and certainly drinking
---
I don't ever remember buying food or drink at low levels.  Ever.
---
No it isn't. Vanilla was in closed alpha/beta for over a year. The first people in were employees, then F&amp;F, then super secret batch invites. My guild from another game got 40 vanilla closed beta invites in July 2004. After that some of the plebs who registered normally got in. The open beta stress test was only like a week or two before release.
---
I highly doubt that.
---
Also got in, haven't subbed since 2010.  But was a day 1 player and played in vanilla open beta.  Also resubbed yesterday.
---
The secret is to scroll down. Never watch the ones at the top. Find people where you can actually interact with the chat, that are chill &amp; just having a good time.
---
You can add games to Giantbox, they supply Twitch with the Games list.

---
lol truth.
---
I think people on this subreddit actually dislike Tipsout, seems like this subreddit is divided in their opinion of him.
---
The beta session is Classic WoW. What are you trying to ask?
---
I can agree with you, but at the same time, as long as it ends by phase two the high end resources shouldn't really be affected by layering.
---
I, unlike the recent generations of internet users apparently, can actually detect the painfully obvious sarcasm in that comment without needing the internet version of a laugh track to know that I'm supposed to find the comment funny.
---
even lirik got invited after he dropped legion and bfa after 1 week playing lol
---
In BWL gear, this is when Warlocks are starting to "take off" in the sense of hitting their monstrous state. Hunters are always going to be a powerful BG / W-pvp class, but in terms of their advantage with additional gear, they are past their heyday. 
---
In Naxx gear, for sure I'd prefer Lock, because locks are disgusting at this point. There is also the important question of who is better at dealing with the similarly geared omnipresent warrior threat. 
---
If you think Naxx Hunter vs Naxx Warrior, versus Naxx Lock vs Naxx Warrior, I like the Lock's matchup better. The ability to keep the warrior pretty much feared and grenaded and succubus sapped, and deal huge damage through armor skipping dots. 
---
In a vaccuum, yes the hunter can kite the warrior, but I find that with the limitations of real world settings / bgs, it's not always possible, and at this point, the warrior generally fucks your shit up through 1 crit. 
---
Basically, I'd say at the BWL level, I'd tier the two similarly -- both hunter and lock are solid, tier B+ type classes for pvp. 
---
At the Naxx level, the hunter has moved down to a B- for me, and Lock has joined the A tier.
---
That would require it to be entertaining.
---
Don't worry... our Time will come .)
---
Por que no los dos?
---
That’s great.
---
It’s not vanilla wow.
---
Do you think they're manually writing names with a pen on a piece of paper or something? How hard or how much work do you think it would take to add another 100 invites or find out how many of the accounts flagged elligible for the beta test haven't logged in?
---
I'll give you a hint, close to nothing
---
Really?
---
The original game concept was to just keep creating new servers that frustrated players would voluntarily go play on, until the population balanced out a bit. But that leaves low pop servers lingering until they get around to merging. And then we get name collision problems, unless they tag everyone with characterName-ServerName, which is definitely not classic.
---
that makes me 12 butthurt
---
wrong I got in.
---
No, in fact equal sliver size would be quite rare
---
The layers fill up like cups of water, when one fills another one starts, and a few people from the original are transferred over, possibly against their will.
---
So there will always be an incomplete layer thats smaller than the others.
---
This and this and all of this
---
This is true, that’s why I said he might get lucky with a casual guild.
---
Please show us on the doll where the Blizzard touched you.
---
Then why was WotLK the peak of WoW?

Can we stop this VANILLA IS BEST circle jerk and just admit that it's different, but not better?

He’s basically a tool. Most of those people who milk the content are. There are tons of people doing research for games (old and new) that deserve credit who never receive any. All tips does (which I will argue is a good deal of work and isn’t really bad itself) is research other people’s research and hard work and present it in a format that’s easier to consume than reading a lot of materiel and analyzing spread sheets of data’s.
---
Is this for real? Are you gonna stream? I'd come hangout
---
The difference btw private servers and classic wow, it is quite clear
---
&gt;It doesn't fix the problem of overpopulation of zones. 3000 people divided by 3 newbie zones is exactly as unplayable as 10,000 people divided by three newbie zones.
---
Doesn't This arugment assume the players are distributed equally among the races, and that within that distribution, they're all distributed equally between layers? 
---
If 10,000 = 5,000 orcs / 3,000 undead / 2,000 trolls, dividing them as such:
---
2,000 orcs / 1,000 undead / 500 trolls
---
1,750 orcs / 500 undead / 750 trolls
---
1,250 orcs / 1,500 undead / 750 trolls
---
So your argument is basically "2,000 orcs is just as unplayable as 5,000 orcs"? That's valid, though I definitely disagree. It also assumes these players all play at the same times. 
---
What I'm driving at is if they layer intelligently, it's possible to stagger players cleverly by race and likely start time (or just by time zone.) This provides some modularity that "literally do nothing" does not provide.
---
&gt;I am not here to argue that sharding is a better solution than layering. It absolutely is not. [..]They created a tourist problem. They created a system where they couldn't accurately judge interest in the game. Instead of fixing *these* problems, they're trying to treat the symptoms.
---
How do you propose they fix the problem of "a system where they can't accurately judge interest in the game"?
---
You'll get it if you have multiple WoW accounts on your bnet and/or a PTR account.  I assume if you have beta access, it would show up.
---
Yeah would make it unbalanced. Just wondering
---
I feel you. I'm pretty butthurt about it 😠
---
Ofcourse not, that if anything would cause a huge shitstorm.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HviG0miDzaE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=109

For reference here's some footage of the starting zone from TBC.  It's waaaay far off in the beta.
---
Why is that bad, again?
---
At least I know you're an honest man.
---
Hey, if they're willing to communicate their displeasure with more than a single sentence, then they're apparently putting in enough effort to have the loudest voice.

I like to think of Jesus with like giant eagles wings and singin' lead vocals for Lynyrd Skynyrd with like an angel band, and I'm in the front row, and I'm hammered drunk...

Apparently some ppl had that legion ptr wow 5 show up and it ended up being a beta for them, unsure how true this is.
---
&gt; Towelliee

ew
---
Not at 5 AM on my server :P
---
If you are the first group to enter the blasted lands, or among the first groups, you'll be seeing an extremely small # of people. If that small # shrinks, it's not very noticeable. Seeing 5 other people in blasted lands or seeing 15 is immaterial. 20-&gt;30, same thing. Point is, it's a low # of affected users. They're not worth planning around. 
---
"use your brain" is rich from someone leaving this comment. "Lol, surely this guy hasn't thought of this obvious thing???" Spoiler alert: he did. Because it's obvious. Use your brain.
---
Right... but to compare that to how it used to be in Vanilla, it will mean that the servers that have layers will overall be more abundant with resources, unless they do not have a server-wide auction house that all of the players from each layer share in combination. How you don't understand that is beyond me, but.. keep on truckin' with your delusion I guess.
---
Thanks captain obvious.  Doesn’t make it any less unfortunate for the rest of us
---
looks like mobs are dying way faster than they should be
---
Neither do I. I think health started to be a problem around level 7.
---
Go play ur beloved retail lol
---
We'll have a higher chance on the stress tests I'm sure but don't make it sound guaranteed :P
---
Makes sense, they want to get a broad spectrum of players on those, including new players. For this they don't need the new player angle because they can't really contribute any meaningful feedback, they need people who are going to be able to pick it apart and more importantly tell them if there are any inconsistencies with their version and OG classic.
---
You kidding me?  Some people pay to go watch the WNBA and you’re here complaining about people watching WoW streamers in a WoW subreddit.

---
 &gt; Personally I'm fine with them spending the time they need to produce a quality product :)              
---
On that we 100% agree.
---
Sounds like you should lol
---
In one of Tips' videos yesterday he claimed he had some beta invites to send out - is this just semantics or is he full of shit?
---
thats not the beta fyi
---
It's a little concerning that the dev says that these are just leveling quests.
---
The Thorium Brotherhood stuff makes tanking Rag easier.
---
Rune of the Guard Captain is a raid quality trinket for Horde melee. 1% Hit when hit is hard to find.
---
Then there's the whole question of how to handle ST class quests.
---
I'm not necessarily against allowing these quests at launch, but they are a bit more than just leveling quests. Some had powerful rewards that will make the end game just a bit easier.
---
As someone stuck at work...you're telling me there's a chance?
---
You guys are so obsessed with streamers. Dont watch and stop complaining jeez u all sound like old retards complaining about younger generations. Hurr durr back in my days...

Well, then it's a good thing that's not the topic of this thread:
---
&gt; I am not here to argue that sharding is a better solution than layering. It absolutely is not. My argument is that layering, while admittedly less bad than sharding, is still bad. It is an immersion breaking and non-vanilla solution to a problem that Blizzard has manufactured themselves through sloth and greed. They created a tourist problem. They created a system where they couldn't accurately judge interest in the game. Instead of fixing *these* problems, they're trying to treat the symptoms.
---
Wait, aren't you the "use your brain" guy? That's classic.
---
I don't really know answer to your question but if you look my video from back in the day, you  could see somewhat how it is. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kptkEE\_brE0&amp;t=355s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kptkEE_brE0&amp;t=355s)
---
I know it's boring as f, but you get some picture. At least the the last boss fight.
---
That is research.
---
I noticed the aggro range for sure
---
They need to go back on that bullshit "this will be a small beta" and just let people play, holy hell
---
Everyone who went to the Irvine event were told that they would get access. And not just them, many non-streamers have gotten an invite.
---
Blizz is a company, they can and will advertise and test at the same time.
---
The 4Chan edgelords won't be able to keep that shit up on classic.
---
It's called money.
---
We didn't do crap all - Blizzard has realized it's more profitable to "release" older games with a newer coat of paint, than it is to develop something new.
---
Starcraft - Remastered
---
Warcraft 3 - Reforged
---
World of Warcraft - Classic
---
$$$
---
Yeah you were wrong.
---
This brings a tear to my eye. When was the last time wow was at the top of twitch? (I don’t watch streams don’t roast me if it’s normally up there)
---
Alright, bob-. I guess you, being a Blizzard employee, would know better than me. A guy on the internet. Thanks for your input, bob-.
---
If you have a friend at Blizz, can you still get added to F&amp;F and be in quick or do you get have to wait for the next wave even if a friend adds you to the F&amp;F list?
---
Private server experiences and trends are about the only information we can use to extrapolate any expectations from.
---
I'd rather base a conclusion on some data than no data.
---
Also, I don't really care about sacrificing the quality of Classic to appeal to some retail players who may or may not stick with the game. But that's just my philosophy.
---
People forget Classic is the game that spawned the series - no way it dies.
---
It's legitimately good.
---
Retail is legitimately bad.

Yeah to me I dont think there is an easy solution and this does seem like the best idea so far but it just kills me the fanboys down voting everyone for even trying to discuss it.
---
Most likely.. you could probably sell your layer to someone.
---
Do not give your information to people on the internet.
---
I couldn't say.  The last time I made a character, everything in the starting zones had been made neutral...
---
How so, the fastest way to grind honor is to Get objectives==win game and requeue, in av its really important for maximising honor gain that you have one grp per bunker and only end after all bunkers are burned down
---
If you like something you go to the dedicated subreddit and discuss about it yes, that's kind of the point of the site. Do you have more questions?
---
&gt; Guess what grouping up does? Moves you from a layer.
---
Not if the people you group up with are also on that layer.... Yeah I get it it's not perfect. Literally the definition of a compromise. What do you suggest as an alternative? Nothing? Let it crash and burn?
---
Alexensual is useless for any facts or knowledge, he's a troll and way too toxic to take serious.
---
I’m wondering that aswell, just got to work and i can’t check here lol. Chances of getting is probably insanely low, but i got bfa beta so i’m kinda hopeful
---
I'm sure we likely came across each other at one point or another. It's just hard for me to remember a lot of names, especially if they weren't the same class as me (hunter). Also, I also dug this gem up, almost all the websites on there are expired, but some like AEnigma and Defiant is still up. Also from the list, a guild name I had forgotten all about until now, Very Hair Man Guild LOL

No one was worried they would shard different servers together. Nothing has changed but the name they call it by. You people are so stupid.

I completely agree. He's just a straight up, no bullshit type of guy and I respect that. Really knows his warrior as well, so great info if anyone wishes to play that class.
---
Me because I according to my wife I cant shut the fuck up about it and he only talks in 10 minute 1 second intervals.
---
Any time there's going to be a copy of the world via a Layer, then that copy of the world will be additional resources to be gained in parallel. In Vanilla, no matter the realm size, there was only a finite amount of resources that could be gained due to spawn times of nodes/mobs. So the additional copies via layers means additional copies of those nodes/mobs, ergo a multiplication of the available resources to a single realm. This will affect the economy of Classic as is compared to Vanilla WoW due to increased availability depending on the number of available layers in parallel on a given realm.
---
It's really, really simple stuff here...
---
Gold making method? I plan on taking my time playing the game, not treating it as a bloody job, and once the nostalgia wears off after 2-3 months I'll be ready to move on or come back if they ever expand on Classic  with TBC or Wrath servers.
---
They are having full stress tests over the next few months so.
---
I like how you used a proper date format haha :)
---
Soda is playing Horde Druid
---
They’ve never done this for other WoW betas as far as I’m aware.
---
I’ve been in each of them since WoD and I never got anything.
---
I honestly do not understand why people even give a shit about classic beta. Oh look, the content that we've all been playing on private servers already, BETTER WATCH THIS LIVESTREAM
---
There's 2 servers.  Pvp and pve......................
---
Under "In Development" I see a PTR only. I'm assuming that's not the Beta?
---
funny watching asmongold get pissy about people stealing mobs when they have 3 slots left in group.  i thought classic was about muh community and not streamer cliques?
---
No one was worried they would shard different servers together. All that has changed is the name they call it by. You people are so stupid.

that's just PTR.  If you had beta, right above PTR you'd see "Beta: WoW Classic"
---
Gotta take into account their porn watching, and I have a feeling of you're playing Paladin you're also really into edging, so they're probably still at it.
---
I’m in.

I opted in within an hour of the announcement.
---
I am not a content creator.
---
I’m a day 1 sub, played in open beta.  I have about 40 days played in BFA, actively playing today.
---
I’ve been in multiple previous betas (d3, mists, hots, legion, bfa).
---
I know it sucks for everyone who didn’t get in, but I’m a diehard day 1 vanilla guy who isn’t a streamer.  Feel free to pm questions/test requests, I’ll get to them when I can.
---
Right?

I don't know. How many of those are gingers? They have no soul so they don't get a vote.

I think I’m gonna make a warlock any advice on race? I’m not super hardcore with a need to min max but I still want to be effective while not sacrificing enjoyment or looks. Unsure if I want to play alliance or horde yet, any advice would be appreciated
---
Hehe it’s the ONLY date format I know how to write in 😬
---
I may have been wrong, watch the new stream with Ian. it will be done by the time the world bosses release and they will be winding down the tech in weeks when the sight seing players stop.
---
Fucker, I wanted to watch someone do NE druid leveling
---
yes he has...
---
Man I didn't much like my human female warlock's casting animations.  I always stocked up on Noggenfogger elixir to change my looks to male undead (which have the best casting animation IMO).
---
It's called common sense, also [Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), me guy on the internet has heard of it, have you mr. guy-that-works-in-the-industry?
---
Always some dumb imbecile says some utterly stupid shit but prefaces it with 'I work in shit maybe related to whatever I claim to be an expert in'
---
You should hook up with Alex Jones.
---
You might have the longest sub if you’ve been subbed from day one. Everyone has canceled their beta at some point.
---
Passing over non-elite filler mobs that have no benefit to you is not "immersion-breaking."
---
You no flying crowd are such babies. Can't wait to leave you behind in TBC Classic while you wallow in Vanilla forever.
---
So... a server/layer with a 10k cap but a single world's worth of resources will have a different economy than one with a 2.5k cap, and the same world's worth of resources? Like, yeah, no fucking shit?
---
But that's not the situation at hand. A layered server with 10k people would be split into 4 layers. Each layer has access to 1 Azeroth's worth of resources. 1 Azeroth's worth of resources split between 2.5k players is the same amount of resources per capita as 4 Azeroth's worth of resources split between 10k players, regardless of whether they share an auction house or not. As I have said several times already, you won't have access to 4 Azeroth's worth of resources unless you have around 4 layers/servers worth of people.
---
Everything you just said is wrong. The world pvp set up for paladin was the meme reckoning build. Roleplayers don't need ret spec to hold a sword. Enhancement shamans oneshot cloth and leather, anything above mail can't get meme furied to death. That's why you see clothies and rogues in their videos and not arms warriors or holy paladins.
---
Check your account management to see if a new WoW license was added it.
---
yeah, it's not like we've had multiple expansion launch where we could see the impact of overcrowdness on gameplay VS sharding technology in legion / BFA...
---
we have absolutely no data for such thing... if you spent all your time on private classic server, that is.
---
Another bad meme brought to you by Alexensual?
---
They could avoid this by copying the spawn times from the previous layer the moment a new layer opens. Not perfect but better than a fresh world full of juicy materials. Also considering this is only for one phase, the potential economic impact isn’t as insane. Assuming a mafia isn’t already controlling the fuck out of the real rare money spawns
---
probably because he hasnt been subbed in years and thats all blizz cares about.
---
Looks fine to me. What's the issue?
---
maybe. I was playing a druid the other day on a server not to be spoken about and I was fucking up some 4-5 mobs in hits like that too.  Blizzard did have a client to go off of so their values have to have some weight behind them I imagine.
---
Some of the people need to be slapped upside the head. It’s insane how anyone enjoys working for a community this obnoxious lol
---
Regen is about 70% higher than it should be for starters
---
Thank you for the 2k res version
---
Welp, back the the pservers until wave 2  invites boys!
---
Wow I would have expected him to get a streamer pass, his twitch is pretty popular (and he actually played in vanilla lol). That's a bummer.
---
Reeeeeeeeeee
---
mine came in at 8.95gb
---
Sharding lol...I just sharded guys
---
Soda just died to a rare mob though
---
No. You're being a dramatic. There's no significant abuse that is going to be occuring in the first month the game is out, and it means everyone gets the play the fucking game.
---
Gnome overall best for min max, orc for horde pvp and undead is slightly better in pve horde but id go orc still.
---
Well, according to this /u/Kayoh44 genius, if even a few dont play classic Blizzard is screwed!
---
If that's the case then shame on Blizzard. Some people deserve an exception I think I could easily make the case for Joana.
---
shamans just have some really good early lvl damage.
---
As you can see from the clip there is still a lot of work to be done, please use the bug tracker.  
---
Let these things be known.
---
Yeah I feel like the best time is for sure either around memorial day (everyone's getting out of school / college, whole summer to play) and thanksgiving - holiday season. I don't know what metrics tells them august is optimal
---
That's a rare, not rare-elite.
---
reading the first line:  "wtf who cries over classic wow?"  
---
reading the last line:  "FUUUUUUUUUCK WHO'S CUTTING ONIONS?"  
---
RIP to your brother, he's just waiting at the spirit healer for you &lt;3
---
It's not about whether a few hours of congestion is bad or not. Obviously almost all players would classify that as a negative experience.
---
However, it's about weighing it against the negative impacts of sharding or layering. And when you weigh the consequences of both experiences, sharding/layering is the clear loser.
---
I've answered the question of "what's so bad about layering" about 5 times today so I apologize if I don't type it all out again. But I'll ask you this - if you haven't spent any time thinking about the negatives of the system, or read any other dissenting opinions of the system, how exactly can you have an impartial opinion?
---
It's as simple as simulating the economy of  a layered server in your mind - you should easily realize the impacts to the game that the system will cause.
---
That's a rare. Not a rare-elite.
---
Yes but 75% of orcs are rogue / warrior so you can remove  their bleeds / poisons when your shit misses and vanish / run away =D
---
Having 3 monitors is much nicer for me as then you don't get the window bars on the main wow window. You can run it in borderless fullscreen and do whatever you want on the other monitors.
---
Bonus for me is only my main monitor needs to be a nice expensive 144hz, the side monitors are just displaying webpages or whatever so they are random ones I got for $50 on craigslist
---
"i SeEnT oNE Strimmer" it was a fucking joke
---
Updates are still made every day but they are very minimal. Changes were made to early parts of the guide recently like letting players choose between auberdine and westfall. Those still need more testing.
---
Why watch other people play sports?
---
fuck man i don't have a brother, only 2 older sisters who i have nothing in common with at all... and my closest friends are two sets of brothers who grew up playing games just like this together.
---
i'm so jealous
---
A rare mob that would have put them both to 30% without a healer.
---
After dipping in and out of some streams, I think this is going to be huge on release.
---
So apparently if you are on the F&amp;F list it doesn't count, there is another "list" that blizzard employees have to put you on to get an invite and it's like 5 per person.
---
Exactly. I'd love to see a split in categories so that BFA gets buried deep so that Towellie can stream for his dying audience in solitude.
---
Yup, to get to the last lord and the big elemental.
---
And regen is much higher than it ought to be
---
Agree, he'd be worth having the input for them. Could really help.
---
probably not since its a closed beta and you have to be selected. thats my guess
---
Fuck retail let it get buried
---
https://i.imgur.com/PLoezAd.png
---
Fuck yeah!
---
This sub is full of this nonsense.
---
If you actually look at it, the mob did around 70% damage to Esfand and 30% damage to Asmongold (before the priest healed him up). And that's with three people doing damage to it.
---
Hunters are kings of world pvp and stoneform is very good on dwarf.  Mages are great but no escape artist on human so its ranked lower.
---
Yeah, seen that as well. Tbh, guy creeps me out as hell (i still check his stuff occasionaly though, no idea why)
---
The point still stands, it's a level 10.
---
Ofc - F&amp;F are always the first to be invited to Blizzard alpha tests
---
I hope they dont lol
---
Ah okay that clarifies what you meant a lot more. I was quite sure when blizzard meant starting zones and sharding, they meant only starting zones, not early zones.
---
Looks like a no go.
---
Play however you like.  Just go have fun doing whatever it is that strikes your fancy.
---
Don't take my name
---
I mean why waste my time with someone like you?  If someone said the numbers 2 and 3 are actually the same thing I’m not going to waste my time proving them wrong.  If you want to learn about what you’re talking about, that’s something you should do on your own instead of having other people explain it to you.  That’s called growing up.
---
I thought the just being a mage would make it better then hunter no matter the race. Im going to need more opinions on this.
---
Found the gatekeeper
---
Man sounds like it's gonna hurt when you get ganked as you try to cheat the very system you're trying to hate on so hard.
---
Also, not enough bs achievements. World first Rag or you're nothing.
---
Mirror Mirror is the shit but, I don't know anything else they play lol.
---
shits way off from vanilla lol
---
Talk to people while I’m trying to get something done? Unspeakable!
---
Guilds are shared across layers... That's really, really, really potentially misinforming people with this graphic.
---
Who did you have to kill?
---
I just feel like twitch is catered to my demographic but still somehow the idea of watching other people play video games (or watch YouTube videos) is the stupidest shit ever. Whatever bakes bread I guess
---
While Soda were fighting some mobs, 2 at one point, he managed to regen mana for up to 5 Healing touches while in combat. The regen is certainly not correct
---
You do realize it put esfand to 30% and asmon to 50% before he got healed. They 4 man'd it dude since the mage was attacking aswell
---
Yes, and 4 players can take an orange mob no problem. Where is the bug?
---
Hi, /u/Krissam
---
Nimm mein Hochwähl.
---
I don't know who said it wasn't going to drop off but they are wrong.  And I'm not justifying anything.  That's the REASON they are using layering.  Like it or not
---
Not a streamer but have a day 1 account and also played the blizzcon demo
---
Inaccuracy*
---
PvP mostly for me.
---
Yeh but this vid was made ages ago.
---
&gt; 1 Azeroth's worth of resources split between 2.5k players is the same amount of resources per capita as 4 Azeroth's worth of resources split between 10k player
---
Wrong, because 10k sharing 1 Azeroth's worth of resources would run into higher competition and lack of availability due to spawn times.
---
Analogy time: 10 people sharing a bucket of water. One can drink at a time, each person drinks the same amount. Those 10 people will face more competition to drink the water, because they have to wait for the other 9, and have less overall water to drink before the bucket is empty. Layering (with 4 layers, for example) is like if those same 10 people were sharing 4 buckets of water. There's overall more water, and they can drink more often.
---
&gt; you won't have access to 4 Azeroth's worth of resources unless you have around 4 layers/servers worth of people.
---
So you ARE understanding my point then.
---
Great, now that we've established a baseline of common understanding.
---
If a server that has 4 Azeroth's worth of resources has a shared economy via a single auction house, then that server's economy is going to have inflated resource availability, which would mean that Layering has a measurable effect on WoW's economy that is multiplicative with the size of the realm (implying larger realms have more layers and therefore a more drastic impact on the economy).
---
The fact that it has an impact on the economy at all means that layers will change the economic meta of the game that deviates from Vanilla. For people whom are purist about an authentic vanilla experience, this is a detrimental aspect of the system that is more "tangible" than simply a social concern.
---
So point #2 for OP stands, and the original comment that I replied to claiming OP needs to learn math is still wrong.
---
I signed up for Beta yesterday so I'm happily awaiting my invite. :D
---
Not a streamer but have a day 1 account, played all expansions and also played the blizzcon demo.
---
Are BGs even going to be in at release?  They were added a good while after release originally.
---
they're not going to ban anyone trading gold, people have been trading gold on d2jsp for like 15 years...lol
---
Thank your friend for their hard work!
---
Can't believe I'm missing out on the hype of watching Joana rerun his WR live :(
---
I'm not in the beta or watching streamers. Sorry for asking I guess?......................
---
Hunters are lower dps in raids but can kill cloth wearers in seconds with crits.
---
So where did N=2.5K and N=2.5k go from the 2nd to 3rd chart? lmao...
---
No one offered a valid answer to this problem thus far. Because if population doesn't die down after phase 1 ends, you will either have an over populated server with long queue times, or layering will persist even after phase 1.
---
Plus you don't address the potential exploitation of having your friend invite you to his layer, which is the main concern here.
---
I don't even have an active sub and got the classic. I guess they only invited the true elites.
---
thats pretty much the beta for every game these days until stress testing phase :/
---
isn't that just for low levels? which was also in vanilla?
---
Kargoz is hands down the king of milking classic content. His videos are always like 2 hours long with him drinking shitty beer while asking his viewers what to talk about...
---
K. Then explain this to me, because it's the part I have doubts on. 
---
If Blizzard sends out 10000 closed beta invites they might expect around 75% participation (easy number for maths sake). So 7500 people participating in the closed beta. 
---
This is a pretty even split of one server running 3 layers. Each layer hosting 2500 players. Again, I'm pulling these numbers out of my ass but for maths sake let's say this is how it pans out. 
---
So Blizzard builds server capacity and layers based on these expected metrics and then the invites go out to all players. Those currently subscribed and those not. Fastforward a couple of weeks.
---
Blizzard is only seeing around 50% participation. A good number of invites went out to players that were interested in the Classic wow beta but ultimatley don't fork over the 15 bucks to play. Now Blizzard needs to involve more players, so they send out another 5000 invites hoping 50% of those people will respond and play. 
---
There are now 15000 beta invites that went out for an expected capacity of 7500 players. Now let's say that those new beta invites have 90% response rates because they were only sent out to players that had active subscriptions. And now players that previously weren't interested are signing up. Your target number of 7500 players is now more like 13000 because the game was hyped up. Servers start crashing, layers stop working properly, all being live streamed. 
---
You call it common sense. I call it capacity planning. You don't just throw a switch and go from one server to many when they're beta testing. Maybe once all this shit goes live and infrastructure automation is sorted out. But use your noggin'. It isn't like flicking a light switch. All this to say that a company doesn't give a fuck about the people not giving it money. If you want a chance to get into the beta. Be subbed. Or don't, Idgaf.
---
Share price went up 3.5% today.
---
Considering the animation wasnt made until Dec 8 2007, almost a full year after BC came out.... the animation wasn't a vanilla WoW thing at all.
---
But the sound clip was absolutely distributed everywhere!
---
Both regen and damage numbers are way off, that's the point.
---
It would also be quite rare for me to make the sliver let's say equal to 1000 people because once it hits 1000 it will change within seconds.  If you want to get technical then I can get technical.
---
Is it really needed though? Make more servers and add queues
---
I'm a little worried I'll just hate it and not be able to get over my QoL boosts I've grown accustomed to. It's not the game, it's me, I just don't really know if I'm the same gamer anymore. Just don't know if I have it in me to spend a whole Saturday trying to run Uldaman or spend 3 hours grinding mobs because I ran out of quests. 
---
I'm just trying to approach this with an open mind and see how far I get. Vanilla had some pretty big problems and I want to say that I'll ignore them in the spirit of nostalgia and the superior aspects of vanilla... but I worry I just can't and I'll hit a wall. I mean, whatever reasons led a 16 year old to quit WoW after TBC... they are still going to be there for a 29 year old, probably doubley so. 
---
I hope I still have the patience in me, but I just think I might be too far gone by decades of games getting more and more streamlined. I could barely devote 40 hrs to RDR2 because I just couldn't deal with the slow animations and slow, plodding pace of the narrative and gameplay. 
---
Ah well. If all I get out of this is the ability to go to Lakeshire and see it full of people running around killing gnolls and orcs and shit like it's 2004, then I'll be happy.
---
strafing animations are completely different and change the way youre facing
---
I have a "PTR: World of Warcraft" under my Region/Account dropdown box.
---
Is that just the regular retail PTR?
---
Edit: in bnet account I have a Legion (WoW2) PTR listed as Active
---
Deserved for sure!
---
Rhok'delar and corrupted Ashbringer etc.
---
Will be going to very commited and high ranking guild members.
---
If you don't fully commit you're unlikely to get them unless you reserve them in your own group.
---
Getting the gear to manage these challenges will take a long time aswell.
---
you're better off commiting to 1 or 2 chars unless you're planning on playing 10-15 hrs a day in a high competitive setting.
---
Every beta does.
---
I mean they are very similar but did you even look at the graph lol.  They *are* different.
---
Yea but i was under the impression that mages were much stronger in pvp then hunters overall. Literally havent seen someone say hunter is better then mage in any form of pvp.
---
Man I forgot about this one. I love it.
---
&lt;salt&gt;
---
I dont want no stinking beta invite! 
---
&lt;/salt&gt;
---
I thought it was guaranteed?
---
Yeah I wasn’t suggesting it for min/maxing I just think fear ward is more useful as a priest overall than shadowmeld (PvP included).  But ok, you do you!
---
you have to be a twitch streamer to play. real high quality "beta testing". fucking retarded
---
They seem to expect a large majority to leave early.
---
Lol it's day 1 calm down.
---
One of you will have to make the trek but it is possible.
---
I only said it was needed so i didnt get downvoted or bitched at
---
Getting from Tirisfal to Mulgore at level 1 is maybe a bit iffy, but it's not impossible. At level 10, it shouldn't be a problem.  
---
Catching the zeppelin is no problem, but the lower part of the barrens has some beefy mobs.
---
Yes, although it's probably better to get to level 6 or so first. You'll level discovering new places running there anyway
---
Hopefully twitch split it like Rune Scape and Old School Rune Scape
---
I dislike Tipsout because of the litany of reasons others have posted in this thread. My point is that it seems anyone with a negative impression of Tipsout or who is even contributing to those comment threads is getting downvoted when in reality if Tips really did bait a fake beta key for subs/donations he should absolutely be punished by Blizzard in some way.. that's not the kind of thing someone Blizzard is inviting out to Irvine to get the first peak at Classic should EVER be doing.
---
Yep it's blizzlike as fuck and people always complained about it when playing on the private server that starts with a K because they didn't realize it was blizzlike and they were used to playing the non-blizzlike server that starts with an N that everyone loves to circle jerk about. It tapers off to "normal" levels of regen at around level 10
---
I haven’t seen anything that says it is, but they’re gonna do a lot more invites for those. There’s gonna be three stress tests so hopefully we’ll get in on one of them.
---
What's the resolution like on it?
---
Damage and regen rates seem to be off, use the bug tracker and let it be known to improve the game.
---
[*] Citation required
---
Yes, that’s just the regular PTR
---
Nope, the regen continues at least till lvl 40 from the footage I saw, as well as I've seen footage from back then which showed extremely less regen at lvl 4.
---
Animations don't have more "frames" - from what I am watching all KEYframes are the same, it's people playing the game live again instead of the myriad of glitchy, stuttery messes that was the Pserver scene the last decade+ that's throwing everyone off. While that info is stored client side many are triggered from the server, hence the animation clipping, stuttering, timing issues, etc.
---
Comparing it to some vanilla videos I took back in the day they look the same except now I can play at 144hz instead of 60.
---
Not sure what mechanic you are referring to. But if your blizzard does 45 damage per tick to a single boar, it's going to do 45 damage per tick to each boar if you pull several of them.
---
Huh, I don't have one either. I have one for every other game in the bnet launcher, but not WoW...
---
Gonna comment this again. It put esfand to 30% hp and asmon to 50% before he got healed. And the mage helped them aswell.
---
They 4 man'd a lvl 10 rare, there's no problem there
---
Chuck Norris got Barrens pregnant.
---
Do you have a sub?
---
new account made in MOP, no demo but do have an active sub
---
Had a Blizzard account since 2007 and have been subbed to WoW for most of that time. Also own D3, OW, SC2 on the account and have never received a beta invite. Sucks, especially now that beta invites are mostly for influencers these days and us plebs don't get in until stress tests come around.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
You tab out of the porn? I just set the porn as my wallpaper.
---
back in the day i played an orc warlock and loved it, i think ill do the same again but i also kinda want to play a tauren shaman but i played one for 3-4 months on a ps and got yelled at al ot in dungeons etc for not knowing my class and what gear i can roll on etc :(
---
Iirc you're not going to have a Druid trainer around Tirisfal / Rogue trainer around Mulgore so keep that in mind.
---
Yes like every other beta Blizzard has done for the past decade. This is not new information.
---
Please use the What Should I Play Wednesday sticky.
---
You must be playing an average hardware setup. Unique, rare setups have higher chances for test privilege.
---
which pserver?
---
I remember nostalrius supposedly had slower regen time than some other server.
---
Reeeeeeeee (new and revised)
---
&gt; use the bug tracker and let it be known to improve the game.
---
big streamers stop and actually participate in the purpose of beta?
---
Fuck out of here.
---
interesting, can i see that footage? not doubting you btw, just want to know if it's true
---
So why is everyone assuming the server population will die from 9k to 3k from 2nd to 3rd chart? lmao...
---
Plus the potential exploitation of having your friend invite you to his layer is not being addressed neither, which is the main concern here.
---
I actually think that yes, they'd split. Ion said that the layer is consistent not just in the zone, and not just in the continent, but in the entirety of WoW. Like, if you go on a zeppelin from Kalimdor to Eastern Kingdoms, you're still in the same 'layer'.
---
Basically, it seems to me that when entering a server, you're actually randomly distributed into what is effectively a sub-server. As the population dwindles, the sub-servers merge together.
---
It seems fairly clear to me that, if phase 2 arrives (they said that that's when they'll have no choice but to end layers due to not wanting multiple world bosses up) and a server's population is still way too big, then one or more layer would be splintered into a new server. This would not be disruptive in any way shape or form it seems to me--the people you've been playing with since you started playing would all be in your new server.
---
My question would be, under what circumstances do you change layers? For example, you want to play with a friend, you both roll on the same realm. How do you make sure both of you are in the same layer? How is this consistent with the idea that you're always in the same layer, if you are capable of changing layers? You join a group, do you join their layer, or they join you? Are you henceforth always in their layer from them on, even after leaving the group? Do you go back to your 'home layer' when leaving the group? What happens if a splinter does happen and now you and your friend are no longer in the same server?
---
Yeah, part of why im coming back to the game. I want the epic LotR size battles and city raids. I'm definitely gonna do my research and see which server will bring the pvp this time.
---
Asmongold is playing on the pvp server on beta and it isn’t like that. I think it’s wrong
---
Hell yeah! I was looking for this on there the other night!
---
Wrong. I'm in and I haven't played consistently since Cata's first heroic nerf. I resubbed last week on a whim and never logged in.
---
Are these words on the internet freaking you out? Don't spill your Soylent while you're shaking.
---
See you in August! :D
---
"no"
---
Classes aren't technically better then others they just excel at different things.  Hunters are capable of 1v1 vs any class as are mages some fights are just harder for each class.  A hunter can aim multi crit a mage for 3k in pre raid gear and kill it fast.  On the other hand a mage can deadzone the hunter and kill him as well.
---
&gt; The fight is literally endless, and you people make it extremely hard to get the correct viewpoints into the forefront of the discussions.
---
You answered your own points:
---
&gt; you need to realize, not everyone in the game sees things the same way.
---
This stuff is great to hear.  I’m so glad you guys made those memories...my brother’s my best friend too.  See you in azeroth!
---
You get downvoted because you posted a bad example, so you just delete and post again? nice job fella. 
---
Let me reiterate:
---
cringe reaction
---
Excuse me, I'm gonna be a man cow.
---
This whole situation feels kinda crummy.
---
Data point: I'm on the friends and family list for Blizzard games and I got into the Overwatch closed beta as a result. When I heard about the wow classic beta yesterday, I opted in to the beta and reactivated my inactive WoW sub (inactive for about 6 months). However I did not get an invite today.
---
No need to make a post. Just be a good little beta player and report bug.
---
It's been clearly known for over 6 months now exactly what Classic will be. It's 1.12 mechanics/itemisation with gated content and loot tables in a modern client.  
---
If you have a problem with that, which it looks like you do, feel free to start a petition for WoW:Legacy or whatever which has progressive itemisation and 48 hours AVs and any other random bits you want to pick out of vanilla that you think should be in. Maybe Blizzard will make a special version just for you, who knows?  
---
This really has nothing to do with Classic though.
---
This is what pisses me off the most. I am going through the war campaign stuff now and it's pretty cool with all the saurfang stuff but God damn the rest of the content couldn't be less interesting. Island expeditions feel like such a colossal waste of time.
---
That’s true but Blizzard could use the feedback in comparison to current WoW. Feedback could create change in the current game. People who observe from a distance but don’t currently play don’t always have the most constructive feedback. 
---
If they played back in Classic, that doesn’t do Blizzard any good at all. People who played then already know how that game should function, as well as does Blizzard. What benefit would Blizzard possibly get from inviting someone who hasn’t played in a long time to the beta of a game they already know?
---
fitting for the post
---
Warlock pet summoning already proved that Blizzard's working copy of 1.12 is better than memory and Pservers.
---
so mad lmao
---
Jesse Cox was against it, but claims he "gets it now". He just posted a video about how he's on board following his trip to Irvine and getting hands on time with classic.
---
Oh god u are right. What do you suggest us to do?
---
What would be the difference between 1 server with 3 layers and 3 servers with 1 layer? Why not just open more servers?
---
Disgrace that moron Towelliee got in and not Joana
---
Eh, the majority of people take out their paid vacation months in the summer. But if you're planning on using them to play video games anyway, then it doesn't matter when you take them out.
---
All I want are the improved assets and skins where possible.
---
I think regardless of whether or not the mob damage is correct the regeneration is not even close to correct, which makes these fights a lot easier than they should be, and people are just steamrolling through everything without stopping as a result of it.
---
I hate YouTube and Twitch culture in general. I'm too old for that shit.
---
I thought I remembered the guy made the animation and uploaded it to other flash websites during vanilla. The animation was made in April 2006 according to the video description, it just wasn't uploaded to YouTube until 2007. Either way it's gold and I can't wait to see what new memorable moments Classic brings!
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Area\_damage\_caps](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Area_damage_caps)
---
Auto Chess got its own category, as did Old School Runescape.  Don't see why they wouldn't make one for Classic WoW.
---
cross realm bgs existed in vanilla.
---
layering is a reality of modern gaming and will be long forgotten after youre 60 and progressing. it will be gone longer than it will be a factor.
---
loot trading in raids is fine imo. fixes the GM necessity in a lot of ways and cant blame blizzard for it.
---
battle.net sucks but oh well, discord would've replaced it anyways. 
---
Right click reporting is a bit shitty but it's not going to destroy the game.
---
Original mounts not being in is mostly fine.
---
Progressive itemization would have been cool and is a bigger thing to complain about sure, but it's not going to ruin it for most people.
---
I can’t decide whether to play rogue or warrior. I like playing with others and I’m planning to grind late game content heavily but I’m leveling by my self so I don’t think warrior would be the best pick. But also I feel like if I play a rogue I won’t be able to make it into raids and dungeons because of all of the other people playing rogue as well. Any thoughts?
---
Same here. It just appeared out of nowhere. No email or anything.
---
Hm we might level till 10 alone then. I hope it might not be a problem.
---
Rendezvous in the Barrens.
---
Psst, don’t take the bait, let’s be handsome pretty above ground people together. Leave the caves and pits to these urchins
---
Looks like it's hitting them pretty hard. The mob switches targets a few times, they're buffed, and Asmon gets healed. They also put it down quickly because there's three players DPSing. It still drops Asmon to 60% and Esfand to about 30% and would have easily killed either of them 1v1.
---
Esfand's mana regen does look wonky though. I don't know Paladins well enough to know if that's an ability of some sort or if it's just broken.
---
Blizzard is referencing everything to their 1.12 working client. If it wasn't behaving that way in 1.12, then it won't behave that way in Classic.
---
Assuming 4 weeks to a month, that's 20 weekdays, so 6.75 EUR per day. A sub costs 12.99 EUR per month, so technically 1 weekend a month would be enough. But all of that assumes the person has the option to work an extra weekend and that the money wouldn't be better spent some way else if they do.
---
Private server shill?
---
You got him
---
i'm in FF and still waiting
---
Sorry bro it's just so hard you know, a small time streamer missed out on a day one guest pass for a 3 month long beta, and it's all just so upsetting!!
---
Afaik they said that if an issue comes up they will check their old reference client (1.12.1 client) and try to eliminate the differences. I dont think they will implement a different CD than the reference client shows
---
Looks like mob damage is too low generally?
---
No, I see a bunch of hyperbole from cynical kids who doesn't understand fucking shit. They were asked question about phasing. They answered what they thought would work. I think I trust a server engineer more than Reddit fanatics. Do you know the entirety of Blizzard is just evil people all doing their best to fuck you over? Get a grip jesus christ.
---
You don't have active subscription, they have stated it's an requirement as well afaik.
---
Lirik got beta after he quit legion and bfa after 1 week lol ok, literally all the people who bash blizzard in public got invited and we get nothing
---
Regen is about 3-4x higher than normal right now I think
---
&gt; I'm aware this sounds like guesswork, but the fact is that shard-management-addons for cross-shard-hopping already exist.
---
Fair enough. I don't know the specifics of how sharding is implemented on retail, so I don't know how much information about them is exposed. 
---
I'm still skeptical about how easy it is going to be to abuse, however, because I still a lot of questions (some of which may be answered already that I haven't seen) about how exactly it's going to work. Are there going to be a fixed number of layers? Are the number of layers going to be directly exposed? Are resources going to be shared among the layers in a server, or does each layer get it's own set? If the latter, are the spawn times/locations going to be the same, or at least consistent between the layers? Do you log into a random layer every time you log in, or do you have a "home" layer that you are placed in by default. When you leave a group on a different layer than your guild, do you automatically go back to your guild's layer?
---
Again, some of those may be answered already but afaik most of them are not. Depending on the answers to a lot of these questions, it could be more or less difficult to abuse. 
---
&gt; you could swap layers in most cases by just logging out and logging back in.
---
Is this confirmed to be how it works or just speculation?
---
Can you explain what you think is different, as I'm not watching any streams?
---
Dude obviously doesn't have the brain power to understand it doesn't magically create gold on the server. Just leave him be. Lul
---
Yeah, im gonna have to agree. Both asmon and esfand are wearing mail, still get hit for 19-20 which is about 1/6 of their life pool.  Seems pretty close to accurate
---
He's talking about things like Blizzard, and has explained it well.
---
Say blizzard does 100 points of damage per second to everything in a circle.  If there are 10 mobs, they all take 100 points of damage.  If there are 1000 mobs, they all take 100 points of damage.
---
With damage caps, if the cap was 10 targets, and there were 10 or less in the circle, they would each take 100 points of damage.  If there were 100 things in the circle with the same damage cap, each thing would only take 10 points of damage.
---
This was introduced at some point in time to nerf AOE grinding.
---
Oh yeah.
---
No that's not a thing in classic.
---
You mean def stance triggers a gcd? So u cant switch and instant bloodrage or intercept? Dunno what internal cooldown is. Or a gcd just for stance switch? Which I guess makes it a cooldown for stance switch off the gcd? That being internal cooldown?
---
I sort of remember not being able to instant bloodrage to avoid dragon fears. I definitely wasnt instant intercepting people.
---
I kind of like tips. But he obviously doesnt know everything. You van watch his videos interviewing people for deep dives and his reactions seem pretty genuine about some pretty basic stuff. I think he just gets a boner for warriors getting everything they want. Just like this mindset of tried tested and true best class for everything and I am a king with this OP class that needs more shit and stuff and we need more ownage fuck yeH boi
---
At level 5/6 or run there at 1?
---
...they talked about starting zone sharding in the very BlizzCon Classic WoW was announced. At what point did they ever promise us 'no sharding at any point'? They *always* said there'll probably be *some* kind of **temporary** sharding for **just** the starting zones. The Classic team has, so far, never broken their word. You have no grounds to doubt them beyond unsubstantiated pessimism.
---
Fair enough. Just giving you crap, thanks for the memories
---
Yeah, that would be pretty epic 😊, and I feel you on the pet part... But thank the stars you landed a place to get back into our dream world 🙂
---
Oh is it through launcher not email?
---
Because having them directly in the reporting system helps ease communication with the dev team? The beta gives players direct reporting tools juxtaposed with the target of the reports. Joana is an individual who could make greater use of these tools to efficiently inform Blizzard of any discrepancies than most other people. If anyone should have priority access to this closed beta it should be experienced players like him. This is a sentiment that Blizzard has already expressed by stating that they will be prioritising accounts which are older in order to pick who is more eligible for this closed beta.
---
&gt; It's really, really simple stuff here...
---
It really is, but not in support of your arguement. It's relative. If layers are indeed identical in size to retail vanilla server cap (3k~) then since there's no dynamic spawn rates, the amount of resources is still correct relative to their availability in vanilla. 
---
A multiplication of resources to roughly match the multiplication of players. The only problem is if we get a layer of 3k with another layer of say, 400.
---
That's one of the problems layering -fixes-. Not causes.
---
Ah so you're just a loser then. Gotcha. Edgelord.
---
Lmao dude calm down. This is a bad look. Yikes.
---
Really depends on what you want to do. I rolled lock back in the day and should I do it now I would go undead. I personally went alli, so I think now I am going horde, because the horde questing is just so good.
---
I’m hoping they broke up today’s invites to monitor initial streamers/players and send another small wave out before they leave the office.
---
yeah i'm just figuring this out the hard way. I know for sure i'm on the friends and family list because I got into overwatch closed beta after my gf's aunt added me. too anxious to ask her again though, oh well lol
---
Not because there was down votes, reason being the title was incorrect, hence the (New and revised) part of the title.  
---
Believe it or not, not everyone out here is trying to get virtual points for their opinion.
---
Then merge servers. Of course, marketing won’t like that because then your game is more visibly losing players so we have to engineer all these curtains in instead
---
If you open asmon stream right? He’s in elwyn and from what I remember it should be green colour, but it’s not it’s yellow and when he goes from place to place the text when entering the new area is white and not green
---
Yeah Tips has done shady stuff in the past without any consequences.
---
It is live though?
---
They essentially 4 manned the mob. Esfand and Asmon got low, and the priest and mage were attacking it almost the entire time.
---
Jesus christ this community.
---
who cares. Just enjoy what you get. It’s not 2004 any more.
---
'a small time streamer' who had the speed leveling record in vanilla...
---
No mousepad masterrace
---
Did take Twitch years to get around to doing that to be fair.
---
Got an invite the same way, not a streamer but have a day 1 account and also played the blizzcon demo.
---
if you didnt expect battle net to be in classic you had unrealistic expectations to begin with. and if you think sharding and layering are the same thing then you have no idea how either of them work, because they dont work like eachother at all and both accomplish different goals. they explained their reasoning on why they didnt do progressive itemization and why they did it is perfectly reasonable. and cross realm bg's were a thing in vanilla. also loot trading has restrictions to it, it doesnt function the same way it does on retail.
---
I'm not advocating for acceptance of everyones opinions. I'm saying people need to realize that anyone who came before you, KNOWS BETTER.
---
Prior to WoW 1.4 the epic mounts didn't have armor on their models.  In 1.4 they added a new model and stopped making that model available.  They also allowed you to trade in your old model by way of a vendor, to get the new model.  As of 1.4 the old model was no longer able to be obtained in the game.
---
They aren't going to put in something in that they effectively removed.
---
I don't think the Chronicles really spoil the story for classic . Think the Chronicles more of a textbook to gives you a generalized story of what's going on. For classic story isn't as grand and expansive, quest where only added in to help guide player's around the zones. Each zone kind of feels like a self-contained D&amp;D campaign.  At least that's my opinion
---
Yes, this. I'm glad I'm not the only one noticing. Thought I was going crazy. I even checked footage from 1.12, and yeah, zone text is colored just like I remember—which it is not in the Classic beta at the moment.
---
Conflicted between a priest and something like a rogue. Rogue would be a lot of fun leveling and if I wanted to do any pvp (planning on being on a pvp server). But I have always wanted to roll a shadow priest both during leveling and in raids. I am open to healing as well, but that would probably be an offspec. I rolled warlock back in vanilla, and was alli too so I am thinking I am gonna go horde. But that also depends on what my friends want to do as well lol.
---
&gt;and be gone forever
---
He'll be gone until his and your layers end up merged, which would be days, or worst case, a few weeks from then.
---
This system seems to basically be 'We're launching with 50 servers, but you can only choose one of five servers and get randomly assigned to one of the 10 servers under the server you chose, and after a few weeks all 10 of those servers will get merged.'
---
Back in early Vanilla, there were unarmored 100% speed mounts. These were replaced with the armored 100% mounts.
---
The 60% unarmored mounts will be ingame.
---
The whole point of the beta (per the interview with Ion) is not to get gameplay feedback, but to make sure they have recreated vanilla faithfully and there aren't any discrepancies between og vanilla and classic client. People who played extensively in vanilla are going to be the best testers for that.
---
The color only happens when you enter the zone (not an area within the zone) (it's the text that pops up), the text on the compass doesn't change color in vanilla either.
---
It's not going to be authentic vanilla no matter what. People already have gold farming guides etc which did not exist at vanilla launch, better knowledge of desirable drops, etc, so I'm pretty sure the meta will be different from vanilla no matter what; that applies to all aspects of the game, PvE, PvP, and the economy.
---
Also, I once again restate my contention that supply (of resources) will not increase (or increase as significantly as OP implies) until demand (from population) has also increased, due to how layers work. Yes, a fresh layer will have plenty of unexploited resources and a smaller population at first, but that also means there will be less people farming those resources until the population (and thus demand) goes up. I would guess that you *may* see a slight spike in some resources shortly after a new layer opens up, but nothing as earth-shattering or market-flooding as OP implies.
---
It is this aspect of demand *keeping up* with supply that I believe the comment referring to OP needing to "learn math" is referring to.
---
can someone explain those terms please
---
No it god damn isn't. jesus christ. This whole community is aids.
---
The regen is perfectly fine. Multiple streamers even said that mana regen is way slower at higher levels than pservers.
---
These people are level fucking 6, get a life.
---
Level in your own starter zones until you get 10 and then you can go to barrens, you’re going to be able to do nothing until atleast 10 and still might have to kill mobs as I can’t remember exactly when barrens quests start (maybe 12?)
---
And even if not you end up with addons that provide a cross-layer LfG function or coordinate layer swapping just like when phasing came out
---
It’s just the armorless epic mounts. Your rare kodo will still br armorless.
---
You mean as a beta tester you're supposed to report bugs directly to the developers? Outrageous.
---
The queues will be way shorter with layering than without.
---
Several people have said they didn't get an email even though it was available in their launcher.
---
Thanks very much, I get it finally.
---
he will drop this too probably since he plays aloooot of games for his subs :D love he's streams
---
What does speed running have to do with actual beta testing? It's the first day, give it some time, I'm sure he'll get an invite.
---
Got an invite. It showed up when the servers went live in my bnet launcher. I DID NOT RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM BLIZZ ALERTING ME OF MY ACCESS. 
---
To answer your questions:
---
Opted in yesterday within 30 min of the announcement.
---
I am not a content creator, blogger, influencer, or reporter. I have no online presence. 
---
My sub has been active since BFA launch. Prior to that it was inactive for ~1 year, and I was active for ~18 months of legion. I was not active for ~6years prior to legion. 
---
See above. 
---
US East. US account. 
---
My account was created for the original vanilla beta back in 2004. 
---
Played Vanilla through the first month of Cata.
---
I think him being a complete fake like 99% of streamers is what turns me away the most.  
---
Anyone who gets popularity always changes into this super strange impression of a personality. It reminds me of The Truman Show's paid actors.
---
Interesting thanks m8
---
Day one player, no lifed vanilla - wotlk, casual raiding in cata up to bfa, subbed yesterday, no invite.
---
Although I'm bummed I haven't gotten one, it's cool to see regular vanilla OGs getting invites and not just streamers.  Throw a Chuck Norris joke in Barrens chat for me bois.
---
This is the correct answer and one that the devs actually make clear in one of the interviews, there will still be a balance between layers and queues.
---
The queues will be way shorter with layering than without. 
---
you are welcome to play private servers that have the rules just the way you like them.
---
and if they dont get rid of them, its for a reason and I am still good with it.
---
If it was *just* watching them play a video game then yes I can see that being boring, but if you're watching a comedian/talk show type personality then there is some entertainment value to be had there. Also watching someone who is extremely good at something can be entertaining as well.
---
what do you mean “original mounts” ?
---
Ya he's not exactly a fountain of reliable information. I hope people are watching him for entertainment only.
---
Running speed isn't faster. It is just higher fps. It is the exact same as it was.
---
Regen is fast because you are level 5.
---
Played/subbed since 2005, hoping to see an invite when I get home
---
yeah how are you supposed to earn meaningless internet points then? :(
---
&gt; DAZE?
---
The fact you would add that to your list shows you have literally 0 idea about what you're talking about and we can safely ignore your opinion.
---
Was just going to say this. +1
---
Yeah, wrong. From the beat footage I've seen, even at level 40 the regeneration was significantly higher than it ought to be.
---
Maybe it's an intended change, not sure.
---
Cry more
---
just start streaming 4Head
---
Ah, gotcha. Oh well, looks like I didn't get in. I wonder if they are doing "rolling invites" and I might receive one in the future... one can hope :P.
---
I'm happy for you man, enjoy it!
---
is it free to play per month?
---
Newsflash, the classic community has been a toxic cesspool for a while
---
All I know is that Old AV was in fact better.
---
I don't understand why someone would wanna watch their virtual avatar kill a pig with a sword, just go into the woods with your *own* sword and kill a pig for real, dumb kids.
---
CMON BRO IT WAS A JOKE. "Me and my wife are getting a divorce" DUDE IT WAS A JOKE. DIDNT EVEN ENJOY.
---
That was what was said.  Phased invites over weeks.  Good luck to ya!
---
Hi, /u/RazzerX
---
Weird, I was always under the assumption that the text on the mini map also changed colours alongside when entering a new area within the zone. Maybe I’m wrong
---
There are no AoE damage caps in classic, you do the displayed amount to however many mobs you want.
---
This. I played since vanilla and got beta invites for Wrath and cata but never again. I was playing on a terrible laptop then and upgraded pc during cata.
---
They can get around the ID very easily. I would consider taking the specific date off.
---
Down voting for the scam factor.
---
Person A supports me for 12 years but has had problems for the last 4. Regardless, support continues. 
---
Person B supported me once, but has since left as of 4 years ago. 
---
In what world would I bring Person B back into the equation? There are hundreds of thousands of people who started in Classic’s original beta still subscribed today. Don’t you think they’d be the best candidates? What about people who never played? Isn’t that a good test for Blizzard to estimate the success of Classic before launch?
---
Your argument doesn’t make sense because you’re trying to single out a person who did matter, but does not anymore. 
---
You should also remember that invites are not done going out and there’s a high chance that an invite will be sent to Joana.
---
I’m not a big fan of Jesse Cox anymore but people can be persuaded. Just because he had one opinion then doesn’t mean he couldn’t have changed his mind since
---
Just tell people to keep killing Raptors, "It'll drop eventually."  Kekeke
---
Proof that not all content creators get in :(
---
There clearly are some problems. I noticed on Sodapoppin's stream that he sometimes regenerated way too fast between fights, there's something off but that's the reason for the beta. If you're in the beta then report everything that feels weird to you and they will look it up.
---
Can we get from mulgore/brill to durotar? Haven't played in a while.
---
Im vaguely remembering a zeppelin in brill and i think i can only walk from mulgore. Am i right?
---
there are a few posts/comments on here about people saying they got beta, seems really rare for a non content creator to have been selected though
---
I was against sharding and argued for server merging. 
---
I am very satisfied with the layering system, it’s very pragmatic.
---
I'm sure it's gonna start small and maybe get bigger as each one happens. 
---
My thought is that it's gonna be only select people getting in this one, maybe a little more people in the second one, and then the last one letting in at least enough people for a stress test and to test to make sure their layering is working correctly.
---
I mean, look at the clip and tell me how many times he was struck from behind.
---
So, this beta is done for two primary purposes. One, to find bugs and squash them, obviously. Two, to find any discrepancies between this new version and vanilla wow. Given that a lot of changes have been made to the code a lot of differences could have crept in during development. The people who are best equipped outside of Blizzard to identify these differences are those who had the most experience in vanilla wow.
---
An individual who earned the speed leveling record would have paid careful attention to numerous game systems in order to attain that record. Now their memory might not be perfect, but it is far better than loading the beta full of people who never experienced vanilla wow in the first place. Joana is among the few people who are best equipped to provide Blizzard the reporting needed to give us an authentic vanilla wow experience again.
---
No, what do **you** mean... Keep up with the news. Know what youre talking about. Or dont worry about it.
---
Mob damage low?
---
On a server with multiple layers, means multiple copies of the world to gain resources on without the additional competition if the population wasn't split.
---
The gain rate of resources is fixed via spawn times. Having multiple copies of the world means that this bottleneck for resources is removed as the population increases and more layers are added. As opposed to if they had higher population caps (due to servers being able to handle more people at once and the desire from Blizzard not to have too many servers so that fewer realms are dead population later on as the hype dies down).
---
The impact Layers will have on the economy is the equivalent of them doing cross-realm auction house.
---
See my water bucket analogy elsewhere in this thread.
---
Note: I'm not against Layers, it's a necessary thing for the stability and health of the game on a technical aspect at launch, as well as the longevity of the game going forward as the initial wave of players subsides without leaving dead/underpopulated realms in its wake. Just trying to set the record straight after you calling out OP incorrectly for their valid concerns.
---
but mom im a content creator BabyRage
---
You're definitely wrong. Even on a PvE server, entering an enemy main city where you're forced into pvp (and the red text pops up when you enter), the minimap text stays yellow.
---
Big fat negative.  My PC is in the top 1% of Firemark.
---
Most likely, yes. I see no reason to play a game which was already done better on private that I already spent hundreds of days of /played on in private servers.
---
Mulgore to Durotar there’s a zeppelin or you can run it, brill is a zeppelin also to duro
---
high hp regen is blizzlike, nost was wrong
---
I need name!
---
BFA number one game confirmed
---
Hi, /u/lmao1337hax
---
Niceee. See you in azeroth mate. Not as an enemy, i hope. For you
---
Dude you can clearly see even the difference in regen from people who are level 5 compared to 7.
---
I am almost positive it is fine. This isn't a private server.
---
dang, server capacity is a lot lower than we thought
---
Yeah you probably right... seems kinda messed up though
---
hes a modern gamer he likes to buy lootboxes
---
Ion Hazzikostas came before you so I guess that settles it.
---
&gt; Or a gcd just for stance switch? Which I guess makes it a cooldown for stance switch off the gcd?
---
yes that
---
you're probably watching mail wearers streams, on clothies the damages are big
---
Pretty sure Christmas is on the 25th..
---
Humans and orcs have the most flushed out questing experience again IMO
---
 night elves had a a thing called the wetlands  run where at lvl 10 you ran from your starting area to human quest area
---
Its really rare i think, maybe more people later on but i think most of the players just have stress test days.
---
"Yikes". Keep yourself safe, fellow millennial. Edit: You downvoted that fast lol.
---
the secret is to make this your 1 vacation
---
How do you know that they didn't just log on then? Not much context from just this clip.
---
Why are you overlooking the fact it's literally day one of beta and round one of invites? He is valuable to a beta test for sure, but him holding a speed run record alone obviously wasn't enough for him to be included on first round of invites. Also, you're saying "the people who had the most experience in vanilla", he simply held a record for leveling speed, that isn't necessarily number 1 merit for experience.
---
You mean corpse running in action?  This sub dude...
---
Yes of course, looks identical to me.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=111&amp;v=HviG0miDzaE
---
Glad this is a beta then :)
---
To this day, there's an ore node in the Plaguelands that despawns when I get too close.
---
You have a social responsibility to not be a garbage person.
---
&gt; you’re trying to single out a person who did matter, but does not anymore. 
---
Their experience with vanilla wow (remember this is what this project is about: recreating an authentic vanilla wow experience) has in no way been invalidated. In fact it's better than 99% of the people who want this game. Just because he hasn't played modern WoW does not mean his experience with the original version is invalidated. I'm not claiming for Blizzard to open the flood gates. I'm just saying that this particular individual should be allowed to have primary access to the reporting system in this beta to provide the public with a better (read: more authentic) product.
---
Spreading disinformation are we? That character was in Towellies group, died and ressed.
---
Launch year I had just upgraded to a 6800 Ultra.  This year I have a 2080ti FTW Ultra.
---
PC specs have never been a gate keeping me from getting into beta.
---
everything seems off like crazy hp regen with warrior.
---
lol wut
---
multiple
---
Yeah Chuck!
---
There arent even different layers yet jesus
---
Hey, can we all just stop to appreciate how cool MadSeasonShow is?
---
Increased server population cap. 9k is the cap with the sharding solution, so just bump server population cap up to that. Most people from private would prefer that anyway. This would essentially solve all the problems sharding would without any of the downsides, unless you're a casual who can't handle waiting for mobs other people have on farm.
---
F5 Gang
---
Yeah I just read some people posting In a classic discussion group , and the non streamers that got access used to work for blizzard...
---
It's usually decently high up and was top for a while during the BFA launch
---
Lol where do you get this from? Maybe it is maybe it isn't. Regen was pretty high naturally &lt; 10 in vanilla.  
---
Don't just make shit up. Go find a vanilla video and compare and find some actual evidence instead of just spewing random crap 1 hour into the first beta footage.
---
Well, there will be a rogue trainer in Orgrimmar, so if she runs to you and picks up the flight points on the way, she can just fly to org to train her rogue abilities.
---
If you go to her starting area, you'll have to take the zepplin every time you wanna train.
---
Get to level 10 first so you aren't travelling back and forth every 2 minutes.
---
Because I would've thought that out of all the people who did get invited already he would be among them. It strikes me as a noticeably odd absence. I have not stated that he will not get invited in the future, I'm just stating that at this point he has not been invited and I personally wish that was not the case.
---
&gt; Also, you're saying "the people who had the most experience in vanilla", he simply held a record for leveling speed, that isn't necessarily number 1 merit for experience.
---
I also did not once say he was the most experienced player. I said he was among the most.
---
No the only time they posted was the one for the launch on Aug. 26.
---
ya its pretty widespread. people not taking any damage.
---
Every hunter who raids will get rhok'delar eventually. It's a 50% drop chance from a boss in the very first raid. Comparing it to ashbringer is pretty funny, and does not paint an accurate picture at all.
---
Typically when you say something. People think of it in relevance to its meaning. If someone told me they’d have a project done before the end of Fall but they submitted it mid December, that just doesn’t seem right...
---
A BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY CAN AFFORD THE SERVERS TO SUPPORT LAUNCH WITHOUT SHARDING/LAYERING! Waiting 3-12 WEEKS BEFORE LAYERING IS REMOVED IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD, IT SHOULD BE LIKE 0 WEEKS OR MAYBE 1-2 AT MOST BECAUSE IT IS LITERALLY JUST FOR LAUNCH!!!
---
Yes, they said you need an active sub to be eligible to get into the beta.
---
The classic team clearly believe that a lot of would be tourists will continue playing. 
---
They also believe that having the ‘stable’ community from the start is important. 
---
They also want people to be able to play the game, they want competition for resources but only to the degree that the game intended.
---
They also are thinking about long term server populations.
---
That’s why they are implementing layering.
---
Literally once, your side is not the back, what you're looking at is someone who actually knows how to play the game and move while getting hit (I can't believe I'm actually saying this about asmongold).
---
You can see mn do the exact same thing when he's playing warrior on pservers
---
Because Blizzard buys ads , and they’d probably do it on their request
---
Nobody cares what classicast has to say anymore, especially Tipsout
---
There is no zepplin from mulgore to durotar if that'a what you're saying.
---
Seriously, I'm friggin relieved. I might actually get to participate in launch with everyone else! My desk time in summer is nearly nonexistent due to it being the busy season for my work and prime time for activities.
---
We weren’t saying gate keeping. Just better chances for special hardware circumstances.
---

Was this on Lightbringer the other day? I rolled a Nelf hunter and was trying to hand a quest into Staghelm.
---
Something like a rogue... There is a class kind of like that. They have stealth and daggers and shit. It's called a rogue.
---
Regardless of the rate of arrival, it will be constant due to the sheer amount of people. Also I don’t know why you are assuming I’m some retail scrub I haven’t played retail in years and instead play private servers. The mass amount of players without layering would actually make things easier for me due to the practically unlimited grouping potential since I play warrior which is difficult solo. But standing there in a mob of thousands is counter productive full group or not. Has nothing to do with difficulty so that just doesn’t apply here.
---
Blizzard is sacrificing server communities for a better first experience so people are able to play a perfectly working game. When in reality, the people who wanted classic in the first place, know that server issues are to be expected or you'll have to wait for the quest npc to respawn or wait before quest mobs respawn.
---
It just makes me super freaking nervous. Waiting all this time just to hear blizzard mention the single most destructive technology to be greeting us soon as we connect to CLASSIC REALMS.
---
Why so hostile?
---
GUYS MY TURN NEXT WEEK I CALL DIBS ON IT

No. if it wasnt for people complaining and taking matters into there own hands we wouldnt have classic at all. why stop short, stop pursuing what we want now? just so we can let them dissapoint us again. absolutely not.  just play bfa.
---
That's not "tier gear", it's just dungeon drops. It's also shit for druids since there's no +healing or anything like that on it.
---
I wouldn’t worry too much since classic PVP server will all be dead.
---
&gt;Seems pretty close to accurate
---
It is accurate.
---
I wonder if this subreddit can approach the greatness that is the osrs subreddit, I hope to see some quality memes.
---
Seems like a lot of jealousy in this post. If you don’t like a person, don’t watch them. Simple.
---
it's blizzlike, pservers are made extra difficult
---
I understand peoples mind change. That could very well be the case for him and others. Although it makes one wonder if some really are full of it and just want the views lol.
---
Man... You got me. First at all, for sure ur brother is pride there, watching you moving on with his memory alive.. I just showed it to one of my sisters and she realize the importance of sibiling ties, im some aspects. So as much its a sad thing, be sure that you guys storie served some purpose of inspiration for many other families, brothers, sisters.. Thnx for sharing it, RIP your awesome brother. &lt;3
---
Fuck me. I wish I had kept mine.
---
im not agreeing with you in that regard but i can feel where youre coming from. im having big problems to explain classic/vanilla to friends which only started WoW back in legion.
---
How is it messed up? They don't want a million spergs running around making 100,000 false/repeat reports. They want 100-500 people committed to the community that will give real, good quality feedback and they won't have to wade through 100's of 1000's of reports
---
So, a question for you. By what point do you think an individual in Joana's position should be extended an invite?
---
someones salty lol
---
&gt;Wrong, because 10k sharing 1 Azeroth's  worth of resources would run into higher competition and lack of  availability due to spawn times.  
---
&gt;Analogy  time: 10 people sharing a bucket of water. One can drink at a time,  each person drinks the same amount. Those 10 people will face more  competition to drink the water, because they have to wait for the other  9, and have less overall water to drink before the bucket is empty.  Layering (with 4 layers, for example) is like if those same 10 people  were sharing 4 buckets of water. There's overall more water, and they  can drink more often.
---
Okay? Like I get your analogy and all but the 10k people I was using as an example were... on a hypothetical layered server. My example was "10 people with 4 buckets." I didn't even say anything about a server with 10k people and 1 Azeroth's resources ("10 people and 1 bucket") beyond that it "will have a different economy."
---
At this point it seems obvious that you're more interested in quote-mining and goalpost-moving than I care to engage with.
---
Sure but it is still bad.... It breaks the one cohesive server concept for up to a whole phase
---
wow
---
Cool, not really what I'm talking about tho, but great input.
---
Slightly before the general public, slightly after big streamers.
---
Not to mention the linkin's chain quest! I loved that Easter egg when I was young.
---
It looks fine
---
It’s so beautiful... should have sent a poet
---
It's something that you look at every second that you are in combat. It's a huge deal.
---
That’s so offensive, i like it.
---
Well yeah. Regrowth is the Flash Heal equivalent, meant to cost a lot.
---
I said a gate, keeping.  I didn't say you were gate keeping.
---
Welp no Beta for me then :) Don't want to sub and have a less then 1% chance for Beta but 100% access to a shitty 8.1.5
---
It probably will. OSRS has its own and so does Dota autochess
---
No source? Cut before the credits? Hm..
---
Fuck man, that last sentence. I hope the release gives you a lot of really deep nostalgic feels and lets you feel that magic all over again.
---
Some of my fondest memories when I was a little girl was watching my dad play EverQuest, and then World of Warcraft when it came out. I played both as well, but we shared an account so he always got to play more. I would just sit there watching him for hours and even though I wasn't participating, it was just so damn exciting to me. And weekends were a marathon!
---
I miss being 10 and so deeply entertained by next to nothing.
---
Whoa was it realllly? Hahah. Thank you holy shit it was. 5 years.
---
Even if they released the game as it was in 2005, it won't be the same as it was then.  
---
So lets make it as painless as possible.
---
Asmongold
---
LOL that's a joke, you mean asmongold complaining the entire time, or sodapoppin who I've never seen play wow....  apparently they only gave access to " Influencers for the first wave.  Your saying that streamers are better  at quality feedback than the rest the population why?

I think the N=3K on the last chart is wrong and would be more equal to N="whatever is left from the layers" but It's possible I'm wrong too
---
I didn't sub either, I'm just gonna watch a little game play and wait for release.
---
man this comment did not age well.
---
theres to many differences to explain tbh, it would take a book to explain what every difference is. but definitely start with classic, youll find it much more enjoyable i think
---
It's entirely speculative if the possibile exploitive effect of the additional copies of resources will crash the economy or not. The fact of the matter is that availability will be increased regardless, and thus will impact the economy in a significant, measurable way. Players who run the AH not being able to charge as much due to increased availability. Players who consume from the AH and won't have to spend as much, affecting inflation rates.
---
Just think, multiple simultaneous Devilsaur mafias on the same server. That would most assuredly have a significant impact on availability/price of Devilsaur gear pieces.
---
Or someone being able to exploit the layers by hopping between them to hoover up herbs/ore. Farming rare spawns. It will happen, and already happens on Modern WoW due to Sharding.
---
Chuck Norris is ready for Classic WoW
---
Classic WoW isn’t ready for Chuck Norris
---
I don't think you speak English very well.
---
What sword is that on the left?
---
Joana is one of the few ppl who got a recorded run 1-60 from an actual vanilla server, so getting feedback and bug reporting from him would be far superior to the feedback from fortnite streamerswho just want to promote themselves.
---
WoW Classic is the best MMO ever created.
---
(The beta is live now, so you can watch streamers playing it on twitch.)
---
There's barely any miss, dodge and parry.

You replied to me. lol
---
Or they could just use the old system and have a queue. This opens the door to them using it down the road and they've already expanded upon what they said they were going to do at Blizzcon. People who are casually interested in checking it out may have to wait a couple weeks to get a short queue. Not a big deal. 
---
We bitched and moaned for classic with all its warts. Queues are one of them.
---
Alright bud. You’re fun huh?
---
Feels like BFA leveling in a classic setting
---
Thread number #X for DMG values...   
---
just log into your 1.12.1 working reference client and compare :3
---
People are so used to betas being "early access" or a paid tier in a kickstarter that they forget what an actual beta is.
---
A beta shouldnt be something that you give to people just because they play another one of your games. It should be a select few people that have extensive knowledge of the game that can give meaningful feedback for them to make the game better.
---
In Classic WoW's case, they just need to make it as faithful to the original game as possible. If someone played for a few months in vanilla and barely made it to 60 but continued to play all the way til current, they are not going to be able to give good feedback on the faithfulness of the game. Someone who played all of the content in original vanilla and spent a lot of time there, even if they quit the day that TBC came out.
---
TL;DR: The beta is not a "treat" for supporters as many companies use it for nowadays. It is meant to make Classic the best recreation of Vanilla that it can be.
---
When did you opt in? May 14th. Can't remember what time, except that it was sometime in the early afternoon.
---
Are you a content creator? Nope
---
How long has your sub been active? My current active period began last June
---
Are/were you actively playing BFA? Yes
---
Location(EU/US/etc) US
---
When was your account created? November 22, 2004. Pretty much as soon as the servers came up since my copy was shipped a few days early.
---
Did you play vanilla? Yes
---
would people actually watch me if i got the beta?
---
Best we have to go from is joanas videos, go look at them and approximate the armor values/damage values, then do the same for beta and see if they line up.
---
I get what your saying, but if we didn't have ge most the trades would be through afk autochat or full on trade bots. I am a bit nostalgic for it though but the game is still plenty social, although a better clan system would be nice.
---
Yeah the most important part of this post is just the visual the numbers obviously aren't exact.
---
orange rare elite mob, against gray items. death for sure. shits borked. blizz cocksucks to white knight to say they could ever get something wrong.
---
the 23 damage non crit was because he used blood fury and has rockbiter weapon, that wont happen without cd's
---
I'm the same way aside from the core i played with it's tough remembering it all. haha! this is amazing, man seeing some of these names brings it all back.
---
&gt;Why are we complaining?
---
"WE" aren't doing anything. "We" aren't some monolith. There are people complaining, there are people raising concerns, there are people praising stuff, there are people asking questions. Closing down one part of the discussion by painting it as "**we** are complaining" isn't helpful to the discourse.
---
Yeah I agree. Towelliee was definitely very salty about classic not long ago.
---
Strange how much that's suddenly changed now..
---
Whatever floats your goat in PvP. You're only responsible for yourself, not 39 other people.
---
Where do you enter your hardware setup, i cant seem to find it in my account?
---
I got in... played since vanilla stress test. I've played every ex-pac at least for a while... didnt play bfa long at all.. stopped before end of first raid.
---
I also re subbed last night after reading the blue post...
---
I do stream, but I'm not big by any means... avg like 7 viewers, and only been streaming for like 5 months.
---
Classic wow has a better sense of world and community that modern wow. Lfg and lfr took away all of that, instead of talking to people and gathering a group and meting up at the instance, you just queue up for 10 minutes and get a group of silent people who you'll never see ever again, then faceroll the dungeon or raid and get free epics.
---
There's no flying mounts, so if you want to travel somewhere you either shell out the cash for a flight path or portal, or you run there on your own.
---
So that's the main part of it, the world is larger, and theres a bigger sense of community, rather than just sitting around in a city all day teleporting directly to dungeons and raids and getting free gear. There's SO much more that classic wow does better than modern wow though, too much to mention.
---
Unfortunately past exploring the zones, doing the quest lines, leveling up, and doing the war campaign the only other thing worthwhile in BFA is M+ and mythic level raiding.  I know that's not for everyone but there it is.  The [raider.io](https://raider.io) site has made M+ so much better for the people who take it seriously, but it can make the experience extremely frustrating for someone with a more casual approach.
---
Watch the video i linked above.  This is not correct.
---
Streamers can't even notice how fucked hp/mana regen is, literally useless for feedback.
---
I've never seen a game company transform community feedback into excellent features at quite this level before.  
---
I want to buy that team a cake.
---
Kings honor, friend.
---
Same here for legion and bfa emails, but I didn't get into the first wave. :(
---
Ye they are way off. Even TBC had slower mana reg/hp and mobs did more DMG.
---
Been cross checking mob damage vs bestiary and it seems fine so far.
---
26th for us on the other side of the globe :p
---
Yes, it has been active since Nov 2004, save for maybe 12-18ish months during that time frame total, I've played every xpac.
---
It is kinda lame that he gets in after he talked shit on classic and the classic community forever, yet someone who is a WR holder in vanilla and loves vanilla didn't.  Towellie only changed his tune once classic was announced.  I won't go as far as to call Towellie a moron nor do I hold what he said in the past about classic against him.  People are allowed to have opinions about things, including classic.  I do feel that if Blizz could make room for Towellie, they could've made room for Joana, but I guess Joana just doesn't have enough viewers for Blizz to care.
---
I got in and am very similar to this... most hours pre cata. I do stream.. but am essentially a "nobody" streamer..  I highly doubt it had any impact.
---
Geez,how muxh of a loser you need to be in order to worry about stuff like this,when there is so much available to do and get in life,outside of game where you will gain exactly 0
---
It's hardly about creating gold. Its about preventing monetary value being attached to it. Gold selling was banned in vanilla for good purpose. It increases inflation and causes items to become more obtainable by those that haven't earned them.
---
For a good reason, towelliee absolutely shit on vanilla wow for the longest time, and now suddenly he's supporting it because blizzard told him to LMAO.
---
No email but I DO have the beta client.
---
Some background that helps.. I off and on sub to WoW. My account that i currently use wasnt my vanilla account it was around late TBC but i did play vanilla.
---
I was invited to the last 2 beta testes where i tested and reported bugs heavily.
---
ill just play classic for free else where :)
---
Scroll down in the wow category on twitch. Lots of noobie streamers, some with no one even watching, playing beta.
---
people will just buy gold on the black market on classic just like they do on any mmo, no one pay to wins with bonds on osrs as its crazy expensive and the gold by itself won't do much if you don't grind.
---
+1
---
Been in every beta since Cataclysm. This isn't early access it's testing. But by the way this sub is acting when they don't get their invites you'd think it was early access.
---
