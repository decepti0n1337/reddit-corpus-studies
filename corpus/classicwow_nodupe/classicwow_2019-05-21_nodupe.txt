The 2.3 revamp was released [November 2007](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/2.x). If I remember correctly, this means you would have gotten the slower leveling without the revamped quests and so on, but with the TBC talents and UI changes. From a game world perspective, it should be pretty similar to what you remember.

You haven't seen the Blizzcon demo  lol

---
People were restricted at lvl 19 in one zone and they still were playing for all time it was available(like 2 weeks), they just kept doing tournements and raid events
---
I was subbed from 2004-2009 with a 3 month lapse towards the end. Guess I'm never getting in, lol.
---
We have to remember that players *now* are just generally more skilled, more aware, and more informed about this content and proper raiding in general. There's more info on optimal gear, builds, rotations, mechanics, etc.
---
12 year old me still wants an explanation as to why a member of the red dragonflight is in STV/ZG.
---
&gt;There would be more Asians if it wasn't for institutionalized racism.
---
What does that mean?  Have you been to the west coast ever?  There are tons of Asians everywhere.  They make more than every other single ethnic group in the United States.
---
How could there be institutionalized racism if they literally make, on average, the most out of every other race... It's not even a little more.  Whites make on average $61,349 where Asians make $80,720.  That's an additional 31.5% of income.
---
You say that dungeon finder and LFR are terrible additions to wow but blizzard said that they’re we’re having issues rationalizing spending so much time creating raids if only 2% of the player base saw them. Reduce the rewards maybe or up the difficulty a bit, but without it, raids may have become far less in-depth due to the lack of the people ever witnessing all the hard work put into them. Moreover, you could always take the mythic dungeon approach; have a way to have groups displayed, but still have to walk to the physical dungeon entrance to do anything. 
---
Realistically, if the community is anything like OSRS, you guys will ask for changes just like they did, despite the current backpedaling for anything that might enhance an experience.
---
Sorry friend never even implied that I was upset that I didn't get into the beta. I was disappointed that theres a subscription requirement to beta test a game that didn't have a prior precedent for such a decision.
---
I spent 2 years with pre level 60 vanilla.  They won’t run out of content my dude.  Pvp alone is fun enough to last years
---
Soundtrack on point
---
Imagine, if you will, your level 59 for the 5th consecutive day and suddenly your rattle out of your comatose grinding of the 61 Elite Crusaders by the ear shattering and joy inducing crescendo and are now level 60!
---
Would love an answer to this. Imo it's clearly superior to Questie
---
you can make old reddit the default view by going to "preferences" and unchecking "Use the redesign as my default experience"
---
No problem! Now I love the *idea* of TBC. What if TBC had been created, not as a “slapped on” 10-level addition to Vanilla, but as its own 1-60 MMO experience? I mean, flying is okay in an MMO that was designed from the ground up with that in mind, right?
---
Sure, you're basically replacing Vanilla with an entirely new game, losing all the previous content... but... *isn't that what already happens?* The only difference between that and what we have now, is that right now all pre-110 content just hangs off the game, like this barren, deprecated tumor.
---
This is cool!
---
clues that his post was sarcastic:

Potato community triggered because they don't get to spam global chat.
---
Since I already answered this indirectly I'll copy paste. Same basic response
---
Yea there is this thing called "opportunity cost"
---
Turning a profit isn't enough when you made and maintain hearthstone with 25 million and it's printed a billion dollars for you. edit - not real numbers but you get the idea
---
Trust me I called the subs being combined. I understand how American capitalists work. They're not gonna bet on their ability to maintain not just the most popular MMO in the world. But now two of them?
---
They woudl have to believe at least they could maintain margins. Which is hard to imagine when they'd have to double production costs while not having a guarantee subs will stay doubled.
---
I'm not saying there isn't a possible scenario that could kill retail. Just the bar is* so much higher than people seem to think it is.
---
No one else prints money with their MMO's like WoW does over the long term. You'd have to be very bold to think you could replicate that. Especially since they haven't released a good game since sc2
---
warlock mage means both of you are going to play long range most of the time.  Paladins need to melee if they pvp.   In alteric valley scenarios (20+ vs 20+), you play together.  The same if you are pve running through quests and stuff.
---
Yes, and that part is actually kind of ruining the game.
---
thats not gonna b happening
---
No, it made making friends/contacts and joining a guild more important so you could avoid doing stuff like that for hours on end. That's how difficult content with no LFG automation interact with each other, it makes a social atmosphere that encourages grouping, acquaintances, friendship, etc.  
---
If you don't understand this then I don't know what to tell you. LFG automation is bad and ruins the social atmosphere of classic.
---
How does LFR, an addition that allowed FAR more people see a raid, ruin a game?

Different server different rules maybe? That's how it was for my server.
---
Honestly, I just don’t see the fun in horde anymore. 
---
I mained Tauren Sham all throughout and the faction pride circlejerk and toxicity is just too cringey. I’ll be going Alliance this time around cuz I know horde players can be pretty petty and dramatic.
---
Take the L on this one, holmes.
---
I feel if they do all the in azeroth zones they have a lot of content. They can rework stories to make sense and others can just be released 
---
Some might argue that karazan can just be retuned as a level 60 raid
---
Ask your regular viewers.
---

---
now that you've brought it up im wondering if this is where ESO took its inspiration from when they've done their expansions + the One Tameriel update.     
---
every zone scales to your level (or whoever aggros the mobs).  and for the expansions, every new character you make starts in the latest expansion you own instead of the original starting cinematic/zone.   
---
its not the same thing as what your saying, but now im kind of wondering if thats the reason they went that route was to avoid the problems WoW has had.
---
I'm not really sure what you'd like them to do about that though. Scale all the numbers up? That violates the "integrity" of Classic because that's not how things were.
---
Those same people are the reason why 1080p became standard video game resolution.  
---
  
---
I played games at 1600x1200 since before 2000.
---
Is there anyone out there who hasn't been in the Beta but can currently see the "Stress Test" install?
---
and for fucks sake, be generous in donating to your guild bank. a guild with a lot of mats and money behind it will do better when it comes to the grind of AQ and Naxx. Save mats early, stockpile.

---
Eh, Vanilla already does Dungeon.Io, it was just based more on what what the community thinks about you, no?
---
&gt;but nothing can convince me to betray who I am and what I stand for.
---
What is that, precisely? Because from my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
---
Wanna raid Gamon?
---
That feels like a solution to the problem. I'm glad there are other MMOs trying unique ways to overcome the content bloat and design fracture of simply piling on expansions one after the other...
---
They will. There is no way to block specific addons.
---
Just do what you enjoy most and feel most comfortable with. Your viewers are most likey there to watch you enjoy games and you should do just that however you want to.
---
God people should vote this up man.  
---
Well said.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QB49s4hlHVc
---
Your all welcome.
---
I did look through a bit of it. Which part did you think was troll?
---
it doesn't matter what u believe, it's not up for debate, addons are an unfair advantage
---
like imagine playing chess where the board tells your opponent the optimal move to make, and it's speed chess but their turn button is right infront of them, also if you want snacks or to use the bathroom you gotta get up but they got delivery and a bucket
---
I'm very confused about your last sentence.
---
Every class farms consumables, not having MCP on your Druid DPS is like not flasking your tank or eating sagefish delight on your healers.  I literally don't see any difference whether the consumable came from fishing and cooking, herbalism and alchemy, a low level dungeon, sitting on the ground in felwood, a vender in the hinterlands, whatever.  Farming root tubers, demonic runes and world buffs for a raid is a gimmick. 
---
MCP is just a consumable that goes in a weapon slot, Warlocks and Engineers can literally craft these so it's not a foreign concept and we know at least some were intended.  Though I think it's still great game design.
---
Is your thought that it's bad game design because it's performing too well?  Like, it's only bad because it's a really good gimmick?  If Druids started knocking non hybrids off the DPS chart then I'd agree with you.  And, I don't know what you mean at all by no argument that it was intended?  Nothing is happening that isn't directly stated on the tooltip.
---
Then saying MCP wasn't intended to be used in raids so it's broken is like saying Skull of Impending Doom wasn't meant to be used in PvP so it's broken.  I'm certainly not thinking skull is getting fixed.
---
As someone who played vanilla, please don't lol. Things like Titanpanel for coords, questhelper for alts, KTM for raids, and recount for dick comparing, were expendable. But, so help me God if you stop the possibility of Peggle from making a comeback.
---
really too many things on both sides to list them all lol
---
Oh awesome thanks for that
---
Love it! Most of my interactions are running up to someone who is about to die, throwing them a heal and chatting a smiley face and running my separate way. Or someone doing the same for me. Even just the small things like that make the game way more fun.
---
There will be a global channel, / join world will happen.
---
Unless Channel numbers gets capped, eventually people will trickle into it
---
Oh cool thats good to know. Ive been watching his stuff recently mixed in with a bunch of other content creators. Just google "EsfandTV discord server"?
---
Does this include the guards in booty bay?
---
As in if I'm on a level 60 caster (horde) and positioned on the net across from the alliance flight path, I can attack people who just landed without pulling aggro from the guards. And this is working as intended bc a low level in the same spot WILL pull aggro on the guards?
---
I was reported on a pserver for "safespotting" even though it was literally just using the aggro radius of the guards. They didn't care that there are multiple spots in booty bay that the guards won't be in radius of.
---
Or you know, maybe the entire population SHOULDN'T experience everything? Four difficulties for a raid is a straight up joke.
---
If there's no addon in game people will just make something like GW2LFG, which is literally the same thing as LFG but in browser. There's no stopping it. And spamming a macro in a global chat is far more cancer.
---
And neither grouping (outside of dungeon finder which is only used by casuals or people farming like timewalking) or vetting party members are automatic through retail LFG. People will look at level, class, gear, etc and then kick in Classic. Get over it.
---

Shit, he's long gone by now.
---
This, anything that you think might increase your streams quality but might feel awkward or not as enjoyable for you will end up ruining your reactions and body language. You gota remember to stay relaxed and have fun and be your self. People like genuine reactions and emotions.
---
TBF when any expansion launches it's the exact same thing.
---
&gt; I feel if they do all the in azeroth zones they have a lot of content
---
and a lot of the area's on the map that arent used or weren't used until expansions, such as the Worgan can be voted upon to create a whole new dungeon/raid or content area instead of what they did originally.   
---
i think it'd be a great idea to make it into a new level 35 - 45 zone possibly.  could throw out the whole worgan race and just give it to the undead or something new and different instead of just letting it stay like it is (dead and unused)
---
through the fire and flames
---
This thread was about the polymorph change no? It seems weird to go on a “people are idiots, Private =/= Vanilla” tirade in a thread about an *actual change* Blizz is making.
---
I feel like such a monster now, Peggle is pure and wonderful.

All we ask is to be Mature/Respect/Loyal to everyone and just stay as team and help others aswell we can we still have requirements. If you have previous experience with vanilla or retail its even a plus, Though we wanna do Raid or Dungeons at high tiers and PVP weather that is arena or world PVP 
---
**Raid Schedule**

This comparison is so fucking stupid it doesn't even warrant a real response.
---
ITT: people who played private server vanilla and act like they played real vanilla and remember everything
---
Was it ever possible to get that green scale armor in a full set?  I don't think I ever found it all.
---
Spamming general chat is boring and I don't think it adds anything to the game. If I can find players that want to join my dungeon group with a 3rd party addon, then I'm all fine with that. I don't know exactly how this addon will work, but as long as it involves talking to people and inviting them, then it's fine. There's addons on pservers that basically just scans world chat and remembers it, and I'm completely fine with those addons and sometimes use them.
---
Lol
---
&gt;Which is what we all want.
---
No, that's what you want. I want classic WoW to stay like vanilla WoW. I have no faith in anything Blizzard does anymore.
---
Then perhaps we should advocate for a better default client.
---
The amazing thing is that all of this stuff that you are exploring "because you are capped at level 30" still exists there when there is no level cap. People just choose to skip half the game as they race to 60.
---
You need help dude. You were wrong. Simple as that.
---
You just linked a video of private servers from at least 2017 to try and prove internet and computer response time from 2005? 
---
Typical pserver shitlord
---
On top of that, why did we ever wipe in vanilla if we could tank 8 elites without heals.. Doesn't make sense.
---
I dont mind them adding the races and classes that they did.  Beside monk and panderen
---
Great, now I have to make another one about how toxic this community is brb
---
There are no global channels in the original WoW.  All of the channels are controlled by players and once an online player leaves it gets handed off to another random player in the channel.  Private servers have global or world chat, but Classic doesn't.
---
Idk when it happened, the post this was in claimed it was 4.3 it was changed but apparently that's false. I don't know when it was, but I know it was possible to sheep others mobs in vanilla and TBC.
---
You mean YouTube comment sections are not accurate?
---
I guess I do hope blizzard would reconsider this and tune the mobs dmg up a tad. I don't want EZ mode. I really enjoyed the Pserv difficulty if that is the case.
---
"Is this undercity" lol
---
I want to play a troll mage
---
it's a copy paste of a modern bfa addon. the guy who wrote it hangs around in the /r/classicwow discord talking about baiting people on the subreddit all the time
---
 Vanilla warrior is one of the slowest classes I've ever played in any MMO over 20 years. It's VERY slow. Retail enh is very fast, tons of procs.
---
I would start off as reading the quest texts. Then based on what your viewers seem to like, go from there ? I wouldn’t mind seeing something like that.
---
Can i just say, that loading screen Paladin convinced me to play Paladin...and it totally disappointing :( No librams, no plate armor..
---
I got my beta invite last week.  Not a streamer or youtuber
---
Level 5 lmaoooo
---
Just curious, you have to have a subscription for wow to get an invite for beta?
---
I dont want to waste $15 just to get a beta invite
---
Have you found any streams where the streamer just plays and maybe narrates a little bit? Some streamers are constantly interacting with random chat comments which I find makes it very difficult to enjoy watching.
---
KIDNEY SHOT HNNNGGGG
---
&gt; People need to stop acting like their opinion is special and totally different than the hundreds of other post saying the same thing.
---
Yeah, because going around posting "stop circle jerking" like every other fuckwit around here is totally the antithesis of that.
---
Hypocrisy, thy name is AdministrativeZebra8.
---
THEN YOU ARE LOST!
---
The lesson here is fuck classic and just have a bbq and gets wasted instead? Fuck this meme is dead before it started... When you thought you were clever ^ and just portrayed everyone playing classic as losers...
---
You're a fucking idiot if you think that every person who watches Asmongold is a young child. Gaming demographic for a game like WoW is much older than that. You'd have half of a point if you were talking about Fortnite.
---
Yes, they have confirmed that a subscription is required.
---
Yeah, it's not a perfect match. What viable spec do you think matches the retail Enh. playstyle?
---
Considering you don't even want to take part in an active test session to see the servers and layering capabilities, what makes believe you'll be a good beta tester.
---
You just want to play early and not do shit, you have no reason to be in the beta.
---
In 2019 with incredible testers, there are no hidden OP specs. These specs would be found within a month or two. Not to mention we know exactly what we're getting anyways.
---
you have no idea how much trouble you just saved me.  Cheers :D.
---
Yeah you weren’t upset in the slightest, just wrote an essay to express your backstory emotional underpinnings to build your case. Just fork over the $15 to get a raffle ticket like everybody else dude
---
And don’t lie when it’s blatantly obvious
---
pserver shitlord
---
Doesn’t look like it, but maybe it will increase your chance to get in the real beta, since you’ve shown interest and helped them out
---
When WoW first launched, I very clearly remember rogues could keep you sapped indefinitely.  That "feature" didnt last long, but it was there at launch.
---
Don't need one.  
---
Priest is the only class that should need a healing addon due to the too many spell choices.
---
Nothing to be honest. I play enh retail as well. Nothing is the same. He's going to have to go to the drawing board and start fresh
---
Are you telling me to stop? Keep the hypocrisy going
---
A couple hours?  You get access for 2 days, they're only actively monitoring for 2 hours.
---
yeah i played on dark iron but i dont really remember anything "streamer like" just the big PAA but as far as i remember there wasnt any real celebrityish figures in it
---
I agree, but to play devils advocate, the whole first half of the game’s content wasn’t tuned to 1.12. If was all doable and done with much Jenkier patches, and 1.12 will make a bit of the game easier than it was.
---
RIP to me as well

Brother I am relaxed. The post was about how I have loved Blizzard games most of my whole life. Lost heart that the company and games I loved will never be made again. Was given hope that Classic is going to be actually great. That hasn't changed as I stated in the post. I'm super excited for the release, I was just pointing out that I believe subscription only requirement for a beta isn't the best option for the game. Maybe I'm too old for this community, but betas used to be a place for people who care about products to help polish the game. It seems like people are prescribing that because I didn't get in I'm mad, but that's not the case. I wouldn't even have much time to play or test the game if I did get in. What I care about is making sure the game is as great as it can become.
---
Watched it live with the bois. Everyone loved it.
---
It might violate the integrity of the original game as is, but not doing anything about the content being too easy violates the integrity of the *idea* they had when they made it, which is making something a minority of players would get to experience.
---
It's certainly stressing me out.
---
I hate my job, but I could never give up my 3 12hr shifts a week.. leaving me with 4 random days off every week. 
---
I hope you can find time to play, even just a little bit my friend.
---
Fuuuck, you get kicked out after the super short stress test? Blue Ballsin Blizzard
---
Yeah that entire description is dripping in satire.
---
Lowest population in vanilla, weren't they?  I rolled one for TBC.  I can't decide if I want to go shaman or warrior.  I feel like I'll be missing out on the chadness of warriors.
---
&gt; But what does everyone else feel?
---
I don’t know. I’m not petty enough to watch streamers then get hurt by them enough to rant about it on a subreddit.
---
A true stereotype of what gamers look like. Ew
---
There's more to life than Twitch streamers. If they don't behave they way you like, then don't watch.
---
seems like you have never actually watched an esfand stream then
---
Dont get into discussion with this guy. He is beyond reach.
---
Lol yes, of course it is
---
I remember doing this too... didn’t even know /resetinstance was a thing
---
Who in the fuck are either of these clueless fucks and why should I give a fuck about soccer or this Corporate fuck? Oh sorry, I am supposed to suck the second guys dick because someone found an old build 1.12 on a USB driver somewhere and he helped work on the foundation of Classic. Man, you guys are quick to jump on dick sucking for no reason.
---
Choose yourself.
---
I find this type of comments cringey, not the omegaluls spam
---
Viewers are like women. They have no idea what they want and lack the brain to comprehend. They are in the meme-iest of terms, NPCs. They respond to drama, conflict, and toxic personality traits. They love trainwrecks. 
---
The only consistent strategy I have seen to work for big streamers is just doing what THEY personally enjoy. This reaps in the big boy views IF you already have a big streamer base. If you are small, you have to be a toxic shitlord to catch people's short attention span as the entitlement and ego in this community towards people with less than 1k views is that they are subhuman pieces of shit on the bottom of your shoe.

So you tell me, do you want raids, or do you want blizzard to not focus on raids because their metrics show that they aren’t worth working on because less than 1% can enter them? 
---
Four difficulties enhances replay ability does it not? Moreover, it allows people push for a a greater challenge if they want to. LFR could even be made into a scenery mode where no gear drops, and it would still be incredible for a game that has a massive art team devoted to creating such areas. 
---
When you say things like that it seems like you’re more focused on trying to make sure others don’t have fun than you are focused on enjoying the game I dunno
---
To answer your first question, "Has anyone re-subbed since after the beta release, and then subsequently got invited to the beta?" I re-subbed after the beta release and got in.   
---
Second question, " I'm wondering if i re-sub, will that increase my chances of getting a beta invite? or will it not make any difference? " You won't get an invite without being subbed.
---
You sure seem to have a bone to pick despite saying you’re not mad. Sincerely, a 32 year old who thinks you’re mad but is now trying to claim emotional stoicism to save face. 
---
Just get hyped for classic, that’s what we all want. No point in bitching about beta access rules. Want to join beta? You need a sub. There are the rules. If you just want to play classic in the meantime there are other options btw.
---
Oh is this what we’re doing now?
---
Flexing the fact that we played in Vanilla to get an invite to beta?
---
interested in this
---
Wtf even were warfronts. I expected them to not be some phased bs.
---
I can’t believe it’s been that long already. I love with an actual lady, have a profession IRL, two doggos and have a social life. 2005 about to go into high school with zero social skills and zero cares whatsoever, my friends were all in WoW so why bother.
---
I love what I have now but wish I could play classic carefree like I once did. Even though I was a loner WoW nerd I still enjoyed myself.
---
Drakova unironicaly was one of the best paladins ever.
---
War, finds a way
---
I will use something to make my raid frames look nicer but not a healing-specific addon.  I've always found mouseover macros to be much less cumbersome.  If you prefer to click everything whack-a-mole style I'm sure healbot or something similar will have a classic version.
---
\*\*&lt;Willingly Suboptimal&gt; NA - Alliance - RP-PvE\*\*
---
\*\*INTRODUCTION:\*\*
---
Willingly Suboptimal is a fresh guild that is preparing for official Classic launch. Our goal is to enjoy Classic and everything it has to offer. We will be rolling on an RP realm for its higher sense of community and atmosphere. 
---
\*\*RECRUITMENT:\*\* 
---
We are recruiting all dedicated and focused raiders for our hardcore main raid team, those who want to push content at a fast and consistent pace. We are actively searching Rogues, Druids, and Priests for the main team. Our current leadership contains individuals who have had a long and successful resume when it comes to hardcore raiding on both Retail, and Classic private servers. 
---
We are also recruiting for two more casual minded raid teams, one weekend team, and one late night team. We're RP friendly, but RP is not required. However, we will have some casually organized RP. Our guild is not just about raiding, and we are also looking for casuals, friends, and family who wish to integrate themselves into our community. 
---
\*\*EXPECTATIONS:\*\* 
---
As per our guild name, we do not worry about being 100% optimal. We are open to any class, and any spec. We believe it is the player that truly matters. Currently, our raiding rosters have room for any dedicated player of any class. We expect main team raiders to put in the required effort during progress. We will be using \*\*Loot Council.\*\*
---
Main raid goals go from hitting the ground running into Stage One of progress, clear content at a fast pace, and end with killing Kel’thusad at least 30 times.  We intend to have the casual raid teams begin in the 4th month, and clear content at a relaxed pace.
---
\*\*RAID TIMES:\*\* 
---
Hardcore Raid Team - Tuesday/Thursday/Friday/Monday 8pmEST - 11pmEST
---
Casual Weekend Raid Team - Saturday/Sunday 8pmEST - 11pmEST
---
Late Night Raid Team - Tuesday/Friday 12amEST - 3amEST

What kind of job do you have?
---
You can play rust a few ways though. Just today i ran into a beef between geared guys with a rock and killed one.
---
Began to loot l96, satchels aks, roadsign armor and got shot.
---
Cool, thanks for the clarification
---
They are both very similar in how easy it is to level and make gold.
---
The big differences I would say (other than ofc their pvp mechanics are different), is that warlocks buy a lot of their raiding gear on AH and just make gold, where as hunters have a very hard time getting dungeon gear, because they have to compete with fury warriors and rogues. And for getting raidspots, hunters are usually in less demand and held to higher standards.
---
I swear, learn and understand what a beta/stress test is before you complain.
---
Hunter should level a bit faster than Warlock. 
---
However, Warlock possess more support and utility abilities.  
---
Hunter has more mobility.  
---
Warlock is tankier.  
---
Hunter uses Arrow/Amunition. 
---
Warlock has Souls Shards.
---
You get 26hrs, the stress test is the first two
---
Gl finishing an av in 20-40 minutes with a pug in 1.12 AV. With pugs they still last 6 hrs, 12hrs, days etc.
---
It's gotta be kidney shot from rogue, its so good
---
Leveling a warlock, my Voidwalker's voice lines when you order him to attack, and the Health Funnel Spell.
---
You don't have to worry about it. An addon like this has existed for private servers, but nobody uses it because there is really no advantage to it rather than just using world chat. There's even already an automated grouping function in Classic from the Innkeepers or meeting Stones but nobody uses those either because they suck.
---
Kind of, but it also helps with the huge amount of downtime in vanilla
---
Not a real clear answer. For example, if I get invited today, how will I know if I’m invited to Beta or the Stress test?
---
oh, yet another "i played in vanilla btw guys" post
---
You understand that without the automated functions available in-game or through addons, it encourages people to keep contacts, make friends, join guilds, etc. right? When people constantly talk about "The community aspect of classic" that's what they are talking about.
---
Mods - why are posts like this allowed but my post about EsfandTV's stream was removed? 
---
Seems like the mods are paid off/bought by streamers. Subreddit is turning out to be trash.
---
I can see that.  Do keep in mind that vanilla did still have large gaming communities doing the same stuff on the original servers.  I don't think it would be that big of a problem for the average player.
---
Do I need to have an active sub on WoW to get an invite (NA)?

What's wrong with explaining where I am coming from to better explain the point I'm trying to make? That's how you structure anything compelling. The point was to show that I felt, as many have the Blizzard the fell in love with has lost their way, or has completely vanished. That feeling was put aside with the news from Classic. That hasn't changed, I'm still super excited, and happy with almost everything Classic related. It feels like the Blizzard of old, at least the Classic Team has returned. That being said, there are still things that can always improve. For me that is the fact subscriptions are required for Beta. In my mind Betas are an opportunity for the developers to get help polishing their game. Not used for a hype tool. 'Selling' beta keys by restricting it behind a paywall with this in mind hurts your game more than helps it, for what seems like a quite cash grab. Knowing the hype for classic is huge, much larger than they seem to have thought, they implemented subscription for beta. This goes against their own precedent. I appreciate you actually reading the post even if you disagree, cheers mate!
---
I feel like I remember most people skipping BFD on the servers I played in vanilla.
---
Only time will tell.  It depends which addons will be written to work on Classic
---
Haven't seen anyone test it but I can nearly guarantee that /target "insert name" works so, totem stompers would too in some capacity.
---
I think OSRS does a poor job with their polling system and would be disappointed if they did that here.
---
Still super short
---
I must admit I know nothing about how retail enhancement work, but honestly if you just like good burst and world pvp, you could honestly go enhancement and just heal in raids. It's not that bad of a spec. Try watch some vods or something of people playing the classes.
---
The only classic streamer I really watch is Nixxiom, maybe Jesse Cox if I feel like is since him and crendor can be amusing.
---
My money is on (and this includes adding 1-2 servers of each type in the first month) a total of 15-16, so within your ballpark, though I feel like you're underestimating the number of RP servers.
---
7 PvP, 6 PvE, 2-3 RP (they ramped up the number of RP servers pretty quickly near launch, so I'm expecting at least 2. Two of the highest pop servers on retail are RP and a number of the smaller ones still routinely hit medium pop)
---
I don't think any higher than that will be healthy long term. They really, really don't want to have to do server merges I think.
---
What happens when someone makes an app lol?
---
I honestly don't know if I can live without pfQuest.
---
Might have to pay a dev to copy his work for classic or something.
---
&gt;If you’ve been selected to participate in the stress test, you’ll see this option appear in the Region/Account drop down menu so you can download and install the WoW Classic client in advance, but you’ll only be able to see the stress test realm when it becomes available. For the stress

How do you know a wave is coming out in 30 minutes? Last weeks wave's werent 9pm EST AFAIK?
---
 [https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H](https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H)  
---
Discord link for the OCE Classic community if you'd like to join bro. Around 1500 members in here.
---
https://i.gyazo.com/d7f9c9c25de7a71b418095b89633d391.png
---
Yea but if everyone start joining, there will always be someone online. And you can see the channel anywhere in the world? , like class groups, healer groups that where made by players.
---
Please correct me if I wrong but I think that is how it would work?
---
Is it really that bad?   
---
The problem with LFG was that it it put you in to a group that you couldn't ever group up again with. And it eliminated you in actually going to the dungeon.
---
If there is an LFG that was just realm exclusive, and didn't just pop you into to the dungeon. It wouldn't be much different than spending ages in Looking for group channel spamming what you want to run and /w every Priest in Ironforge. Your still going to be waiting for a tank or heals ever logs in and you can still rack up a ton of role members on your friends list.
---
... it's just a little bit of automation of grouping.
---
Leaks. People predicted EU wave today, and subsequent wave, just wait in thirty minutes.
---
It's literally a bug patched a handful of patches before 1.12.
---
It's on the "not a bug" list that blizz is updating.
---
Reminding you elitists that private servers weren't true vanilla is worth the down votes.
---
Lok Narash!
---
Good ol' TBC SL/SL locks.
---
So if I can't install the client, then I'm not in the stress test?
---
r/iamverybadass
---
What are you going to main in Classic?
---
No
---
I see me tanking RFK! That 1k Needles shield quest is fucking pog!
---
&gt;full "no mod support for classic"
---
Speaking as a healer, please let this idea die in a fire.
---
at level 5
---
You're wrong. I would play the beta up until the day it closes, reporting all bugs/glitches I find along the way, thats exactly what blizzard is looking for in a BETA tester. a STRESS tester however is very different. You're essentially a lab rat at that point, dealing with all the frustrating overcrowding, lag, and anything else that may happen, which would be completely fine with me, IF they gave the stress testers some sort of compensation for their time afterwards. If you're are cool with paying $15 to be a stress test lab rat, and get nothing in return for your time, by all means go for it.
---
It's going to be much slower than your 1-60 during the Wrath days.  I'm sure there were some spell/talent changes and such but as far as the overall feeling of the game - it'll feel slower
---
This isn't necessarily a bad thing though! Enjoy the ride
---
fuck me I just resubbed around Friday to get in as well and I looked tonight and my beta opt in box wasn't checked :( I checked that box the day they announced it existed!
---
Or someone random can get it and ban everyone in the channel.
---
As long as it isn't automated through the in-game UI and there's still need a talk to people then it's fine imo. People can use what they want but addons (especially automated ones) change the social atmosphere of a game like an MMO pretty drastically when they're adopted by a large part of the community. (eg. GearScore in WotLK.)
---
The core idea of LFG isn't what destroyed the community in modern WoW it was just the implementation.
---
If they had simply implemented a way to streamline group creation for players on a SINGLE realm and no teleportation it would have been fine.
---
Isn't it funny how the forced faction rivalry in WoD or BFA doesn't really capture what the players created themselves during the Vanilla days?
---
Fuck the alliance
---
Imagine playing with nightelves and paladins LMAO idiots
---
Subscribe.
---
I was subbed from 1999-2023. guess I'm never getting in :/
---
Goodluck dude!
---
There's only two hours though.
---
I completely disagree that the OSRS community has been keeping it in line. There are arguments constantly because people always vote in their interests and not for the health of the game
---
I prefer my panda cub!
---
So I just wandered over there to see what they're talking about. It looks like mob spawns hordes are running around cause a huge number of people are suddenly  watching/playing classic beta instead. Do I have that right?
---
I honestly wouldn’t know what’s going on in BfA atm. I just know I hate lions and anything that is blue
---
&gt; I think OSRS does a poor job with their polling system
---
any particular reason you feel that way?
---
Much lower questexp / exp required to ding. You will have to complete basically every single quest you see/know to keep up. That means changing zones a lot too. 
---
Dungeons especially early ones drop shit gear.
---
No xp from BG's.
---
A lot of specs/class differences that change level speed. Tanks are just stupid in wrath and they are useless in vanilla. 
---
Typically for good (but not speed running) players is 6days /played. That's I'm guessing about 2x longer than when you leveled.
---
Well yea, but cross that bridge when you get there
---
you didn't join the dark side, you bent over and spread your butt cheeks wide open like a bitch. 
---
they are probably slapping the floor laughing at all the suckers who did the same, lol
---
Its slower, rotations are simpler, gold is harder to come by and you have to spend more of it.
---
No achievements, no flying, no dailies, and no LFG are probably the biggest differences.
---
Because when you log in it will only allow you to join the stress test realm which wont be active until Wed.
---
Like it says in the post
---
Absolutely! I love helping players in trouble, even if they are opposite faction!
---
Imagine gnomes being on your team.
---
subbed since '99 and still no invite :/
---
Does "what the community thinks about you" can be expressed in numbers, be visible to everyone you haven't even met and updated for everyone in an instant?
---
We as a community should make an effort to get Defcamp into the top 18 some how. He makes great content and is a very engaging streamer.
---
Yeah rpvp is what I want.
---
&gt;Filthy Alliance skulls.
---
Atleast the alliance bathe.
---
&gt; There are arguments constantly because people always vote in their interests and not for the health of the game
---
i hadn't heard of any particular bad additions/fixed being done due to the voting system, but that dosent mean it hasnt happened.
---
do you know of a particular instance of it happening i can look up?
---
yeah, turns out sense of community and belonging in a RPG is somehow important, blizzard sadly forgot that a few years into WoW...
---
There were leveling nerfs in BC and I believe early Wrath. By that point, leveling was a much quicker process than classic. 
---
Playing almost all day everyday for a week in Vanilla if you're efficient would get you pretty close (although maybe an unrealistic expectation). The key will be to get ahead of the initial "rush" of people (normally around 15-20 you'll see people starting to make alts, work on professions, spend time in instances, take a break, etc.). 
---
I believe an "average" /played to 60 is anywhere from 8-10 days played. If it's your first time I would expect it to be higher - that's alright too. 
---
Just take your time, enjoy the process, and go at your own pace.
---
I just disagree that we can't make change. Classic exists because enough people commented about how they didn't like the current version of WoW, that they wanted Classic. They first wanted four phases, people complained now we have six. There was going to be sharding, now we have layering. There was going to be loot sharing, now it's implemented how we wanted. To claim that if we don't like something that's how it will always be goes against everything this community has worked for. If you don't like something they're doing why not express yourself? What's the harm?
---
For the Horde!
---
Can't use it infight.
---
Didn't know that about their gearing, that's good to know! thanks a bunch!
---
ok
---
Imagine dying to a gnome
---
You're right, it just wouldn't be a loop. The totem would probably have an event handler that fires when someone is in range. Built into handler would be a pulse that checked for updated conditions. Just my guess. 
---
That's probably what you mean it's just that loops are a specific thing and if everything in wow ran on that it would be expensive.
---
Too bad you can’t wash away the smell of being a bitch
---
Cannot up vote this enough, Didnt know you had to select to be opt'ed in to classic beta
---
You aren't a hypocrite for saying stop.  You're a hypocrite for thinking it was novel to do so.
---
That said, when someone goes full Dunning-Kruger, I usually bow out.  Muted.
---
I mean, it truly is a "nuke it from orbit" solution and not one I think anyone in Blizzard would entertain unless something like this satire actually did happen.
---
Eh zergling is better, sleeping just isn't as cool
---
whelp, youtube... i can talk from 8 year pserver experience and i have never even been in trouble when facing a holy paladin. there is literally nothing dangerous about a pala. sure they live quite long, but they never pose a threat!
---
Now now, I did it so I can see the story too. I havent played in years so why not
---
Wrath vanilla was not vanilla. Mount at level 30, cheap everything , and insane exp gain. You couldn’t finish a zone without out leveling it. I leveled a bunch of toons to Outland during wrath and vanilla content was so trivialized and empty it felt like a chore .
---
You should expect a much much different experience tbh . Night and day.
---
Lol “when someone disagrees with them, I mute them before they reply”
---
Yea you sure did get me.
---
From what I can remember from 29 rogue. I was running dual zealots with crusader and tigerstrike mantle. The rest I think was mostly greens with a lot of agi.
---
Would not be surprised if gearscore came back as bis checkers.
---
People will always find ways to be elitist.
---
I'm not ashamed I'm rolling Alliance this time around simply because I want to roll a Druid and being a big cow girl doesn't thrill me. Thats literally the only reason.
---
Been Horde my whole way through the game. Gonna be weird.
---
One look at your comment history was all the answer I needed
---
sorry im late, but do you have any link to where he showcases his keybindings?
---
It would be a huge change.
---
Runescape is a game that is ever evolving and changing.
---
We all know what I'm gonna say next.. No changes for classic. 
---
So no, I honestly don't see what we would be voting for, and thus no need for a vote box.
---
Were wrong about... what?

Every server is going to be a streamer server for a bit.  Your problem is that you're only looking at WoW streamers, when in reality most of the big name streamers are going to be playing.  
---
The variety streamers will leave after a few weeks, and then not every server will be a streamer server.
---
Maybe?  
---
Still, if there is no LFG or automation, people have to spam chat channels. Do you not think this encourages people to keep contacts, join guilds, make friends, etc? Imo, after playing years of vanilla pservers, this is the "community" aspect people always talk about. There's numerous times I've been doing quests in a certain area and group with someone for a quest or two and end up doing a dungeon with them later, then I add them to my friends list. A week later we're similar level again and I invite them to a dungeon and they come along because we've done stuff together previously and it's always a good time. Imo that's the heart of classic.
---
I'm excited for this! I remember going into STV for the first time and fighting the opposite faction. What a rush. Can't wait to have this but with a lot more people and everyone at the same level

Lmao. This made me laugh. But seriously. I'm going to try this real quick just to make sure
---
It's sad there is no open beta :(
---
GearScore as a concept doesn't work in classic as there is a lot of horizontal gear progression.
---
I mean you seem to have a good understanding of the benefits of each. I personally value Shadowguard more if you're interested in PvP at all.
---
Good heads up info for those unaware!!
---
gnomes are the only reason my warlock won't be orc.
---
i must consume them.
---
But what's wrong with a variety of different streamers to accommodate all viewers. I haven't followed Wow recently and don't know the twitch personalities that well but I used to watch a lot of Overwatch streams and it seems to be the same there. XQC was a big streamer, a lot of loud reactions and drama etc which I found entertaining but then I would switch to Space's stream if I wanted a more chilled stream. Not everyone likes the same content and clearly Asmon/Esfand/whoever else are popular. 
---
I am aware and kind of understand some of the backlash against streamers bashing classic and then jumping on the bandwagon as soon as it became convenient for them, but most of the bashing I see against streamers is about their personalities and I don't really understand why people care and why they are the main talking point of this subreddit?
---
I had planned on this being my primary way of deciding. I was just curious what the overall opinion seemed to be from people that normally bounce around streams. Most of my viewers I think hang around, because they enjoy talking to me, etc and watching me do stupid things sometimes (not intentionally, haha). So, just trying to get opinions for when the time comes.

Yeah, it's a fairly low mana cost, right? Also, would you typically use the highest rank of Shadowguard, or a lower one?

Hey, I just responded to someone with the same answer, so I'll kinda repeat what I said to them. That will be my first priority. However, I'm pretty sure that most of my regular viewers are there just because they enjoy my company, talking to me, and seeing me screw up so they can laugh at me, haha.

Horde bathe.

In the blood of our enemies.
---
LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
Guys chill, even if it's real, it cannot work like retail LFG or LFR.
---
1 - WoW Vanilla has no cross dung/raid;
---
2 - There's no teleport to the instance;
---
If this is for real, the only thing it'll do is assemble groups automatically from people from your server. I gotta say the code looks pretty real, not a   
---
LUA programmer thou.
---
Now, about BG premade... Totally different picture.
---
I personally think all the posts about how layering destroying the classic experience, is killing the classic experience.
---
I get you have your own feelings on the subject, but we don’t need all these posts every damn day.  
---
Wanna know what people feel about layering?  Use the search bar and go through the hundred or two other posts that have been made about it the last few days.
---
You had me in the first half not gonna lie.
---
Alliance is still the stronger PVP faction because of Paladins and Blessing of Freedom. Horde don't have anything as impactful in their racials as Paladins.
---
It's the same install, they renamed it to "beta and stress test". So yes
---
I cuss a lot always. When I drink after work I cuss a lot more, especially on Reddit. Look I'm sorry if the words I used offended you but the messages stays the same.
---
Are you eu?
---
I didnt get any mail yet. Beta was just available through client.
---
Hey there,
---
I normally get opinions from my viewers. To be honest, though I think they hang around just because they enjoy talking to me, etc. I'll most likely start off reading quest text, I just wanted to get opinions from a variety of classic wow viewers, so I don't scare off anyone new :)
---
holy shit i remember reading this like 14 years ago
---
NP man, but if your viewers are also going to play classic with you, grouping with them and having fun with them will be good as well, being interactive and it could increase your popularity as well specially if you get into a guild and you get known as your guilds streamer.
---
Worth noting that just because the estimates made on lower level mobs slanted harder on pservers, that doesn't mean it won't be closer to the same or even slightly the opposite way with raids.  Also will probably be lots of little things at end game that aren't the same that make things easier/harder.
---
Hi, /u/Mazoki
---
So do we need a sub for the stress test??
---
&lt;Zz&gt; Hardcore Raiding Guild
---
North American Horde
---
West Coast / PVP Realm
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Zz&gt; is comprised of a core of 15 veteran World of Warcraft players, our leadership has cleared through Naxxramas on Private servers and has raided in top retail guilds such as &lt;Gentleman's Club&gt; and &lt;Midwinter&gt;. We are eager to find players that want to bring a hardcore mindset to Classic.
---
**Goals on launch:** Our first goal will be to achieve a **World Top 5 Ragnaros** and as such we are looking for people interested in leveling quickly and diving straight into the end-game content. We are confident that we can kill Ragnaros by day 9 if not faster.
---
**Goals beyond launch:**" Once we have killed Ragnaros we are going to be forming a second raid and doing split runs and once Phase 2 is released we will be pushing to have as many players reach Rank 14 as possible.
---
**Raid Times:** Scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday 6pm-10pm PST, Early on you can expect the weekly raid commitment to be only about 2 hours per week since it will just be Molten Core and Onyxia. Your schedule should be flexible and agreeable with raiding Sunday and Monday as extra raid days for new content releases and split raids.
---
**Requirements:** Raiders will be expected to show up to raids fully consumed and with an attitude that lends itself to working in a team environment. We're looking for players with competitive mindsets who will push each other to improve and overall better the guild. Members will also be required to have a level 20 Warlock/summoning alt for world bosses. 
---
**How to Apply:** It's as easy as sending in an application! &lt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link&gt;
---
Feel free to  DM on discord at Krug#5246. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
Shadowguard triggering Blackout is OP in PvP.
---
Furthermore, at least on p-servers, Alliance Locks were disincentivized from PvP because of WotF, which gives you the freedom to choose Troll instead.
---
Thanks to all the mods, admins and any other poor buggers moderating the content here and on the Discord. This sub and the Discord, I think, are key parts to the success of Classic - they're hubs for new and returning players to get information, get hyped, and see some truly sickening shoops of the Sonic trailer.
---
Yes, as it says in the post
---
that's very bfa of you
---
I would say in mostly terms of additions to skills. Like for example skills having been getting significantly easier since people keep voting in more and more afk ways to train them with things like Zeah rc or Motherlode Mine.
---
That's really helpful, thanks w_v. :)

There is an addon called vQue on Pservers. What it does when you open the addon screen, it reads /1 /2 /world and anything there is a keyword like “brd” or “Ubrs” it takes the string that the person typed and puts it in the UI screen and there is a button that allows you to whisper. The person who typed it. How do you feel about that?
---
Clearly a fake, the dates go M/D/Y in OP's.
---
Hell, depending on what you want to do it wouldnt hurt. I just started watching Asmongold and he's not good at tanking as of right now. Dude keeps talking about doing dps as a tank in a dungeon run. His rotation is dreadful too
---
Playing on private servers for a while and the best shaman healer I’ve seen, going by efficient healing, was an orc. And not by a little, like this player was a lightyear ahead. Skill &gt; race differential
---
LOL. How? 
---
You can do a quest marginally faster than finding a spot to grind. You save yourself, what, 5-15mins?
---
Nah, a ***huge*** change is what they're doing to endgame gear. 
---
You see, some of the endgame gear went through a bunch of stat changes. So by the time Naxx was released, some of that gear changed 2-3 times with each patch. 
---
So instead of doing that, they're just going to make it start with the stat changes that they put in Naxx. 
---
Only problem? All of that content will be released in gradual phases. So getting that gear will fundamentally change your character. It'll absolutely be 100% different than what it was in Vanilla. 
---
None of you have any idea what you want, or even a good idea of what you "think" should be in the game.
---
Your only argument is "no changes" which is unimaginative and ***lazy.***
---
I was doubting about how busy but yep, this checks out, and aside from working you are studying. You’ve been in school for quite awhile - finish strong.
---
OP, buddy, the invite shows up on the launcher, not the transactions page.
---
^
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Vanilla quest texts aren't always all that explicit about the stuff you're gonna do. Here's an [example](https://i.imgur.com/OFcnVyx.png) (fair warning though: DO NOT google this up unless you want to spoil all the fun). 
---
So yeah, you'll probably need to read those. 
---
Also, some quests will provide notes that explain a lot of background stuff and/or player's motivation on that particular quest chain. Those are essential to be read as well.
---
You don't need to worry that much though, plenty of time to check on all this while on flightpaths and whatnot.
---
By the way, vanilla had a feature -- quest texts writing themselves in real time, at rough reading pace. Not sure if it was available in the beta, but I can imagine it will be out there when the game is live.
---
Which has the least? Shaman is probably near the most, I feel like they have 4000 totems.
---
I do as well. To this day I don't fully understand why we use them. Whole world should just run on a 24-hour clock.
---
That's not LFG automation. That's parsing chat and reading it for you. There is no anonymity there.
---
Top paragraph was in response to you. Bottom sentence to everyone in the sub. Boo hoo!
---
It's still fine early on but not as good as dagger spec.
---
I don't see any mention of a subscription in the post
---
Still not worth a pre-release sub to Activiblizzard.
---
&gt; Like for example skills having been getting significantly easier since people keep voting in more and more afk ways to train them with things like Zeah rc or Motherlode Mine.
---
ah okay, thats a fair point.  i haven't played in a good bit so i was unaware of this happening.  wondering if there would be a way to fix that, but since its already done id suppose not.  
---
that is indeed a problem.
---
Id love to get into vanilla, but as someone who only ever got to lvl 49 in retail, with no knowledge of the game with no friends that ik play plus the fact play time keeps ticking when offline i prob wont get into it, if i could buy play time and have it stop when i go offline, id feel more inclined to play, but im not the type to spend money on play time jus to feel like i have to rush and do as much as i can in the amount of play time, plus with the feeling of wasted money when offline doing irl stuff. When i play an mmo i wanna have fun and not feel like its a chore or a rushed process.
---
that's okay that's as high as I got in vanilla anyway lol
---
I don't know where you got the idea that Devouring Plague has a cooldown. It doesn't. It does, however, cost a lot of mana, so you're correct there.
---
Now, it seems you're talking about PvP mostly. In that regard, I would agree that Troll Priests have a slight advantage over Undead Priests in Shadow Spec, because while DP is *exceptionally* powerful for a Shadowpriest, Touch of Weakness isn't as good a stunlocking tool as Shadowguard. Hex of Weakness has marginal utility when you've got a Warrior on your team, but it can be useful, yes. Personally I'm going with Undead SPriest because I view WotF as far more useful than you do, and Undead unquestionably has the better PvP racial there for Shadow.
---
For Holy with 5 points in Blackout, Troll is better. Holy Priests have no use for Devouring Plague, and Berserking is actually useful for healing (while it's almost entirely irrelevant for Shadowpriests due to the fact that Haste does not affect Mind Flay or DoT ticks in Vanilla). WotF is still nice, but Berserking can really get a lot of pinch heals for you, and the lack of Devouring Plague's utility in Holy spec makes Troll Priest spells unrivaled.
---
So basically, if Holy, then Troll. If Shadow, then you *can* pick Troll, and it has its advantages (especially against, as you noted, Rogues), but Undead also has its own advantages, and Devouring Plague is far more potent than you're giving it credit for, provided you aren't fighting against a dispeller.
---
Dont level prot unless you really do intend to live in dungeons to 60 which isnt a terrible idea but will make leveling slow
---
I raised hell in 2016 and literally unsubbed and wrote to Blizzard after Nostalrius shut down, so obviously I'm in favor of the community making a fuss and demanding what we all want: classic. We got it. Mark your calendars. This is a super small beta so far.
---
Have no idea. Just googled and came up with Second Skin. Is it this [https://youtu.be/V\_2FycHamfA](https://youtu.be/V_2FycHamfA)
---
Thanks you've convinced me, having a lvl 29 blue consumable weapon as your ultimate end game item is gr8 design, dunno what the problem is. Nothing gimmicky at all.
---
[classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com)
---
Oh right forgot about all the boar killing.
---
No matter where they spawn in I can assure you they'll start to swarm towards where the other faction is eventually.
---
If becoming a doctor means enough for you to sacrifice an immense amount of time, personal life and such, then more power to you.   
---
    
---
Personally, no vocation  or calling feels worth giving up the things I want to do outside of my professional life though, nothing could stop me from my passions in life which include classic.
---
If you play 80 hours a week you play over 10 hours a day.
---
Retail is free to lvl 20, no obligations, leveling is easy, and you can still do dungeons and pvp. Play at your own casual pace, you never know, maybe you'll decide to waste your money with the rest of us. &lt;3
---
r/stophavingfun
---
The classic experience of not being able to rejoin your raid because you're in queue !
---
thanks!
---
Kind of off topic, but can anyone that played mage in vanilla confirm the other update re: polymorphing tagged targets?  I'm sure they wouldn't state that it's working correctly but it's yet another thing my memory is clearly failing me on.
---
even that function didn't work, they are actually useless
---
Not yet. Apparently the NA invites usually go out around 6 PM PST. So maybe still more to come today? Maybe tomorrow considering Blizzard seem to be trickling people through starting zones?
---
Im not even mad fam, just voicing my opinion that the stress testers should be compensated for their time. Im not going to participate in the stress test even if I get an invite, im just looking out for those who actually will be. All love from this side, me and the rest are just waiting until the 27th. Btw, how can you tell me to cry harder when you're on this sub crying about streamers getting invites lmaooo
---
NP, sorry for the delay, I remember a blue post about it but I got lazy and didnt wana search so I just put in a ticket for the response and SSd :D
---
&gt;Do you not think this encourages people to keep contacts, join guilds, make friends, etc? Imo, after playing years of vanilla pservers, this is the "community" aspect people always talk about.
---
LFG never really impacted guilds, most people would prefer to run with a decent group from their guild. The task of spamming chat channels isn't what created community, grouping with others on your realm did. 
---
You added people to contacts and made friends during/after the run. This didn't happen in modern WoW because for a long time you'd usually never see those people again and couldn't do manual cross realm groups.
---
Grouping up to do quests in the world has little to do with LFG.
---
Who gives a fuck, existence is pointless, might as well escape into something more fun during the vacation.
---
Tyvm is this on their website or nm I can google this lol. TYVM
---
I love the idea of each region scaling up with your level as you quest, rather than building a zone for each level/range. I think ESO did something like that? I could be remembering it wrong.
---
Ahh okay I thought it was earlier.   Thanks
---
/fingerscrossed
---
There will be thousands of people that already have friends/contacts/guild that will still have the need to spam global chat in order to get a group and the addon is virtually the same as spamming global chat. The game isn't gonna break because of a global chat spam macro.
---
I know reading might be hard, but that's nothing like what I said.
---
In PvP hell naw. PvP is a game of burst and CC in vanilla.
---
And reducing your casting speed for 10 seconds is usually a pretty good idea to increase your burst damage kek
---
If you're ever low enough to get 20-30% haste, youre just dead.
---
The breakpoint for the full effect of 30% haste is 58% health. Idk about u, but as a shaman playing 30/0/21 I'm not even worried about dying at 58%
---
Devouring plague has a 3 minute cooldown in vanilla.
---
How a plane crashing into where the servers are held COULD destroy the classic experience
---
A tiny portion of the community wants the original AV, Mostly the crybaby purists.  Most of the community Does not want NPC heavy PVP. I played a ton of AV all the way through Wrath.  The matches weren’t a Zerg fest every time. There were just as many matches that Ended up being an 80 man mosh pit in the Field Of Strife There are a lot of people like me, that had a lot  more fun fighting other players not elite NPC Mobs
---
I mean that's the thing, the game had communities, groups of people. With the streamers, the large ones at least, it's based entirely around them, 1 person. And that's the part that's bumming me out. They basically dont have to earn anything, and will be kings of there servers just for being there. all there followers will carry them, funnel gear, etc.
---
I just hope there's enough servers so I dont have to deal with any of them.
---
Kek mothafucka
---
That's not what OP asked. They want to know if anyone NOT in the beta had this option appear, i.e. have stress test invites been distributed.
---
A CM just answered in that thread. Everything works as it is working in vanilla 1.12
---
I can really appreciate the time and effort put Into this post. Obviously you're very passionate and I understand the feeling of a nagging worry eating away at you.
---
But I am going to jump out ahead of this and say I think we need to be more willing to adapt and overcome our fears and make the best of what is given to us. I think a lot of people might be too critical and judgmental about a system we technically do not fully understand yet. 
---
And I know if I mention anything about trusting Blizzard or mentioning how we are in good hands I'll get slaughtered so I'm not going to mention or even bring it up at all whatsoever. Period.
---
Were you a pre-2006 account? It seems like that's the primary phase they're at of invitations. Other years get in, but it seems more likely the older your account.
---
I edited it well before you responded. I was definitely misremembering.
---
It's all on GOG and emulated through DOSBOX. 1 and 2 are up for $15!
---
I mean he basically just said, "I've done this already so it doesn't really appeal to me" which tbh is my opinion of Classic as well. There are aspects of the game I find cool like world PvP, but I already participated in a progress guild doing raids, so am I gonna do that? No. Its not a place where Live is lacking, Blizzard is still consistently pumping out the best progression oriented PvE content they've ever made, its just the surrounding systems that have fallen behind. So when it comes to raiding I'd prefer doing the new stuff.
---
&gt; You can do a quest marginally faster than finding a spot to grind. You save yourself, what, 5-15mins?
---
No need to group with others to do anything anymore because the game is catering to the 1% antisocial losers who have anxiety/ADD/depression/whatever your excuse is for being suicidal.  
---
Kills the social aspect, just like LFD/LFR/etc.  
---
Go back to BFA, retail baby.
---
This addon isn't a macro. It's automated LFG that scans level, class, etc. and automatically puts people into groups based on content they've selected.
---
I don't remember them hitting level cap but I do remember Blizzard giving them the Sword of a Thousand Truths after noticing how many boars they were killing. I gotta find that episode and watch it again.
---
The only thing that runs counter to that is Dungeon Finder though...
---
&gt; it encourages people to keep contacts, make friends, join guilds, etc
---
Shouting in an LFG channel doesn't particularly encourage that more than joining a group... Honestly pretty much all long-term contacts I've had on retail outside of guilds (which I specifically went out of my way to look up and apply to and has nothing to do with LFG, you need a guild with or without LFG) were made through LFG.
---
Haha and what did you find out? Probably not much since all I post is gaming stuff on Reddit.
---
I just verified my account started on 7/7/05 (when I was 13!) And it made me feel a bit better but at the same time I dont want to fren entitled or expect anything so I'm just chilling!
---
Yes, I see that.  I'm just asking if anyone else remembers that being the case.  Even if they don't, it doesn't mean blizzard is wrong.  I'm just fucking curious how accurate everyone's memory is.
---
Have you recorded home and server side ping for all instances? And which servers are you playing on in reference to you're home? As well as, is it possible for you to recorded GPU and CPU usage at times of pet ability cast? 
---
I ask these; A. To cover all possible variables and; B. I wonder if at least one of these measurements will bring to light any form of correlation.
---
There's no spell that scales like shadow bolt for warlock so you might as well spec for it. It's extremely unlikely you'll get away with some affliction meme spec eating up debuff slots. You can do some weird specs with demons or some shit because that only hurts your dps, but dots will never scale enough to warrant eating up more slots than necessary.
---
I hope these two get updated to the new client:
---
\- ShaguQuest
---
\- ShaguUI
---
Refresh a few hundred more times, is my plan. Incase time is not working as intended today.
---
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about the introduction of players to WoW, where they aren't really taught anything about the game as they play and by the time they hit the endgame it's daunting because they don't know their class or other things like standing outside of fire or what have you.  Which is why the game continues to bring some percentage of players back, but not attract new players.
---
That makes it even more fun when he doesn't get what he wants
---
I feel I've found the biggest bug in the Beta. I don't have access. I feel this bug is causing dramatic consequences on the effects of the Beta as a whole.
---
Haha I see I see
---
Thank you! I thought I was slightly crazy, been hearing this sound effect for years on various TV shows and such!
---
So like having a database that is linked to several inventory accounts? Has this been made before? I could see that not only being extremely difficult to develop but also possibly against blizzard's rules for addons, but hey I'm not sure.
---
You are the hero we don't deserve.
---
Isn't there a radio-quiet zone out there?
---
That's sort of what we were thinking of doing.
---
yes there is, they can easily disable certain api functions like theyve done in retail.
---
Imo this is one of the BEST things
---
Because OP has his computer set to the Metric system.
---
Why is everyone on this subreddit gobbling on his dick, sure he helped make the worst version of Classic possible, but to claim it would not happen without this convoluted stretching Vanilla over retail and limiting what the engine does is the smartest solution is laughable? It also turns what should be a rock solid system into a buggy one every time they update the underlying engine, which they will because Activision-Blizzard.
---
Anecdotally, 90% of the people I've queued dungeons and raids with on pservers over the last 4 years and have been people I've met while levelling or were in a guild with. Yes, you do sometimes talk in a channel looking for more people but the good majority of the time, most of the group has already been formed by people I know and have played with before. No one likes spamming chat channels hence people are naturally encouraged to add the people they enjoyed playing with to their friends list, that's just how it is/was. I didn't choose to play that way, it just happened that way.
---
How can you verify that far back?  My transaction history only goes back to 2015, despite starting in 2005
---
How can you verify? I'm pretty sure I'm June 05 but I cannot find anywhere on the site that tells me this. I remember on the old bnet site I could see my transaction history but I'm not seeing it on the new(ish) site... am I just blind? :| Google search isn't giving me any good responses either.
---
Whichever one of you Alliance scum to downvote this, see me in Arathi Highlands you wussy
---
I gotta confess I am going to be sad that I won't be able to be a dwarf hunter again like I was on my very first character. 
---
That being said, though, I think the Horde is more suited for my type of high-IQ type of playstyle. If you are in a PVP server then killing you is very legal and very cool.
---
&gt;We all know that its sometimes hard to find a group, thats why blizzard has one of the best ideas during Wrath of the Lich King. 
---
like 95% of the reason why people want vanilla is to not have LFG/LFR
---
a few are.
---
Undead have a few undead only ones. Tauren have a few tauren only ones.
---
And your newbie Learn how FP's work quest is only for your race's first level 10 zone.
---
But that's all I can remember off the top of my head in terms of "significant" quests (not counting minor breadcrumbs).
---
Someone posted an EU link I used to login on my phone. I'll see if I can find it and I'll post it here!
---
Based on private servers raids should have 1 person running quickheal, and the remainder using healers assist, but this will likely change in vanilla as not all addon behavior is going to be allowed.
---
At the very least every healer should have addons that show incoming heals from other healers (eg Luna frames, PFUI), and that behavior will likely end up in classic.
---
Give me a sec and I'll post it here if I can find it again!
---
I don't know if this works differently in other games, but as far as I can recall guilds in classic focused on themselves because it doesn't matter if another guild has say a thunderfury.
---
I played albion online for a time where huge zerg guilds were a big problem because open pvp was a huge part of the normal progression of the game so the vast majority of the time the larger groups would win, and take all the gear of the opposing group.
---
In classic wow there is much less of a problem with that sort of stuff.  Streamers will get a bunch of free stuff, and experience all the content, but that doesn't lock anyone out of anything.
---
Interesting they replaced Overpower with Heroic Strike as beginner ability it seems like?
---
They may fire even more dev staff from the main WoW team though.
---
I opened a ticket with customer support and they verified it for me. Nov 2005 haha.
---
 [https://us.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html](https://us.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html)
---
And every PvP server experience I've had was horrible, filled with roaming 60s that kill me on sight, enemies that only ever attack me when I'm fighting mobs, and assholes that gank in groups. All of this doing nothing but adding a frustrating, unavoidable delay to whatever I was doing.
---
/shrug
---
Actually no, quantity is the only way bugs get noticed.
---
The original gun sounds. They replaced it and it literally sounds like a paintball gun.
---
I love it when they update!
---
Pretty bad analogy, all you're doing is tracking info with a mod, which is available to every player.
---
Shadowguard scales well with spellpower so you can use which ever rank you want, either low rank for the utility or higher for some actually okay damage and the utility. It also procs on ranged hits meaning you can stun those hunters. Hex is useless against druid other than to get them to burn through mana by spamming rank1, they have decurse.
---
Spoilers: it isn’t accurate.
---
Vanish, Dread/Felsteed summon, Druid's Challenging Roar sound (so primal and powerful), Blast Wave, Disarm/Riposte, sound of a Shadow Bolt whooshing past (watch the Kazzak invades Stormwind video), Shield Block, Cheap/Kidney Shot "crack", Hunter's gun shot sound, all alliance death screams, male Undead /train and /laugh, Stealth sound. And probably more that I've forgotten :D
---
wasn't when I was typing it, but that was because I hadn't refreshed the page.
---
https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html
---
This one made me laugh pretty hard
---
Nochanges! 
---
We have to install Classic from discs!
---
So you definitely need to have active game time to get even an invite, is that right? (the alternative I'm hoping for is that anyone can get an invite but need a subscription to play)
---
I don’t think people “play (x) game because of (x) streamer.” I have a hard time believing someone will quit because a streamer stops playing. It’s fun to some however, to follow them around every once in a while. Perhaps your notion is exaggerated a little, but you never know lol. It’s definitely something to consider at least.
---
Yes.
---
Boom!
---
I'm paying 13€ to also play BFA so I don't really care but no you say you would test but your behaviour/mentality on the comments say otherwise.
---
&gt;IF they gave the stress testers some sort of compensation for their time afterwards. 
---
You volunteer to test something and you think you are entitled for a reward ? You understand the concept of volunteering right ? You wade through the lag/crashes so that it doesn't happen on launch, you're giving time now on test version so that the final product succeeds, what more do you want ?
---
A fucking medal saying : "HELPED TEST SERVERS : GOODEST BOI AWARD"
---
You just can't wait to play the game admit it, nobody will judge you and you'll appear to be less of an ass that way for admitting your faults.
---
Was 2009 early enough to hope for an invite?
---
I don’t watch streams lol. I’d rather play, but I can see why people would and wouldn’t wanna play on the same server as them.
---
Now that you mention it, I can't actually find anything that says that DP has  a cooldown. Not sure how I got that impression. Weird. 
---
If DP has no cooldown, it changes things a little bit. Perhaps I was misguided from what I read about having to use Inner Focus to negate the mana cost and got confused. I think that I'm still much more interested in having a passive defensive ability that can stun the most dangerous threats when they open on me. At this point I think that my choice will just depend on what my friends decide to play, so that I don't have to level up on my own.
---
As a side note: How do healer priests perform in PVP? With no resilience, I would imagine that you get popped before you can actually heal anyone, so is it more effective to just play a shadow priest at end game, once I have the gear that I want?
---
Bro I actually forgot about that line
---
They all work for like 6 weeks and get fat as shit and pimpled out and they finally hit Max and are like uhh
---
Lmao ty for reminding me I laughed good
---
I definitely won't be rerolling but this will surely be annoying to put up with
---
&gt; I believe an "average" /played to 60 is anywhere from 8-10 days played. 
---
I think this is correct for the average 1-60 level grind with no distractions.  I think the average player will run dungeons (inefficiently), grind professions, shop on the AH, help a friend out with a quest, etc.  I would imagine these players make up the majority of the playerbase and would probably take close to 15 days /played to get to 60.
---
Just being a little pedantic, but I agree with the sentiment - the 1-60 journey is, in fact, a JOURNEY.  Enjoy it!
---
I loved pfui. used it for 5 years. Was quite polished with only minor issues. as long as there’s a suitable alternative though I’m good. It will be missed though.
---
I'm unsure if this in only in vanilla or normal wow (or if that matters), but memorable because annoying, chain mail armor sounds when you move.
---
All good. It happens.
---
I was about to say we need certain add-ons but honestly some of them go too far.
---
We're going to see stuff like 'focus target' add-ons that track by player name and create a pretty close approximation of focus targets for vanilla. It's going to have a pretty big impact on PvP.
---
There's mods that show a list of enemy players in BGs and show who has the flag. People use them to mind vision and chase EFCs.
---
But if they are in feral form, they have to switch out, decurse, then switch back in. How many times can they shapeshift before they run out of mana? It seems like it would be more efficient for me.
---
Hold on to her!
---
Not true in vanilla and not really true in any expansion if you were EU (up to WoD). Only NA has the sperg alliance.
---
lol wait 11 more weeks kid....calm down
---
my 3 12 hr shifts are the only reason I won't quit this job, even though I know I could go overseas and make double. then again this is my 2nd career (Retired Military) So I could honestly quit and play full time. but I dont think anyone is gonna watch a 44yo streamer LMAO
---
I mean there's already an addon that does this called vQueue.
---
....nobody uses it. Mostly because literally all it does is scan world chat for LFG messages and allow you to whisper that person. Kinda pointless.
---
I just value Warstomp and Hardiness more than 10 seconds of spell haste kek lol LULW KAPPAPRIDE OMEGALUL

---
I feel so young compared to you all haha. I started in TBC 2008 when I was 6, but I'm still checking every day for a classic invite. I never played Classic and it looks incredible, can't wait to try it.
---
Ok thanks but... how would that work for Vanilla? Everyones dungeon score would be 0 no?
---
Personally I wouldn't know what to do with this information, if someone never done SFK before for example, still going to invite them.
---
There are not Heroic, Mythic etc difficulty levels in classic... doesn't seem to add value. Artificial gatekeeping?
---
I’m grateful for this part.
---
Broooo. I have the best memories from this time. I remember living with my best friend at the time, both of us having our budget set ups in his room. Running through azeroth questing, and fighting every enemy player we seen. Chugging down the game fuel as we did it. Godddd so many memories lol.
---
This, and, specifically, the following:
---
Have fun.
---
...why would they have to nuke addons from orbit? You do realize that they can control *exactly* what addons are / are not allowed to do, yes?
---
He's first though.
---
If you participate in this stress test, you will likely be marked as a second class player and not be chosen for the real beta.
---
Boycott. Do not give them your testing unless it's the full thing.
---
Lol wonder what that would even taste like
---
Just ACCEPT it. You were WRONG. Can’t you see me writing in ALL CAPS for EMPHASIS
---
When are the invites going out for this? Or have the participants already been chosen?
---
I'm not saying this isnt a bug , obviously it is, but people on alliance have run into the issue as well and they don't have shamans...
---
On esfands  stream today they discussed it and said it could be devotion aura sticking around but you would be able to see that displayed in game on the character stats sheet.
---
Seems like there may be some deeper issues, or the game just wasn't as hard as people remember/private servers have made it . Or blizz changed it, but idk I think that's unlikely . PS server dmg values being warped or even misremembered is far more likely imo.
---
&gt; it simplified grouping and made gearing much more fair and expedient. Even the travel time was cut out because you got ported in and out to were you were before, truly genius. 
---
*doubt*
---
For stress test perhaps
---
Neat, yeah June 05 thanks!
---
Your next better be a video of the first 5 minutes of you playing! I’m so excited!
---
AAAAAH UUUUHH  oooh
---
Are you stupid man? It's a meme addon copied straight from BfA.
---
Nice. We won't have people griefing others by polymorph spamming tagged mobs.
---
The stress test is for everyone
---
Because people like you get butt hurt over getting rocked in bgs and world PvP. Do or die Horde players enjoy the camaraderie, role playing the lust for blood and thunder, victory or death.
---
Lok'tar bitch.
---
&gt; No one likes spamming chat channels hence people are naturally encouraged to add the people they enjoyed playing with to their friends list
---
Yeah except that assumes you have a pool of people to play with already.
---
Also how does a LFG tool prevent you from meeting people while leveling or being in a guild? There's a huge gap in logic here.
---
Yes, 2004 launch. Just stating all day everyday waiting to go home
---
r/AllianceFuckingSuck
---
Focus the pally so he bubble hearths.
---
Cheap Shot
---
no its not
---
&gt;However, as of the most recent news from the Team, the time they want Layering in has further increased to weeks, potentially months (as stated in the press interview) depending on at what point during Phase 1 (the very launch period of Classic) they feel comfortable taking it out
---
People always mischaracterize this timing issue. There were never any promises of 1 day or 1 week, etc. It has always been dependent on when the launch rush dies down because obviously it is, that's the entire point of it. They'll remove it when they're comfortable that populations have fallen to normal levels and they've never promised anything different than that.
---
From the devs the expectation is still a "few weeks" and they likely won't get any more specific than that because there is no way to perfectly predict how launch will go.
---
No, I was wrong, and I edited it in. You need to refresh your page. It does have a 3-minute CD in Vanilla.
---
But yes, you typically use IF for it. IF isn't a long cooldown.
---
It's true that in Vanilla resilience didn't exist, but that doesn't mean healers were super squishy. They could still be focused down, but there are far more strategic geographical positions for healers in BGs/world PvP than there ever were in Arenas. A well-geared Holy Priest will simply casually heal through pretty much any 1v1 encounter, and they can hold on long enough in 1vX for teammates to arrive (and besides, why would a healer be caught 1v1 anyway?).
---
My pleasure dude!
---
LET ME INNNNN
---
Wrong. Stress test is also invite only.
---
Thats a very virgin thing to say
---
Hi, /u/Fractales
---
I think layering is a good solution. Those against it clearly don’t remember how truly awful a few things are that we would have without layering
---
1. 1000+ person queues that take 8hrs to enter
---
2. A massive list of servers which eventually have tiny low pop and massive high pop disparity (server merges or free server transfers are not a great solution)
---
3. High pop servers that are closed to new players
---
4. Starting zones where you cannot quest because there are too many people trying to talk to the quest giver/killing mobs
---
While it would be nice not to have it, I simply do not see the game being fun in the first few weeks. Given I’m taking time off work to play - I’d prefer to have the layering system in place to ensure stability.
---
As for the phasing due to joining groups - yes this will be sub-optimal. However, you’re not constantly joining a group so I believe it’ll be tolerable. 
---
Provided the system works as described, I’ll be very happy with what we get. 
---
I will reserve any negative views until after the first stress testing of the system.
---
Transmog is the reason I came back to WoW after years of not playing it.
---
Same with Dota 2 and Dota Auto Chess.
---
Paladins will HATE you because of this one simple trick!
---
That's what I mean.
---
Virtual zero chance with a 2009 account.
---
I can only say one thing.... zug zug, man. Zug zug.
---
link to where he says they will ban addons that have specific functionalities?
---
Perma-Totems!  
---
Make Pally buffs last 24h and persist thru death and we call it even ;p
---
Calling someone a virgin on the internet, now ive seen everything
---
100% an allaince cuck
---
Yeah no idea why that quote was in my message, weird. It wasn't meant to be.
---
If they realize it's just a rank1 they won't bother decursing it, if their gullible they'll burn up mana fast, especially if they keep shifting back.
---
Tristan, if you see this, why did you delete your comment!?
---
Keep your head up dude you might just get in regardless of account age. Best of luck o. Your classic experience dude!
---
This was actually more interesting to look at than I though.
---
Obviously I'm rolling Priest now, having only 30 buttons clearly they are the simplest class to play :)
---
Not afaik, holding out hope as I just resubbed yesterday for 30 days (perfect timing I guess)
---
Dude same. That bad boy would do like 100hz too. Even more if you went lower. Amazing for playing Quake.
---
Actually it was steadily declining before they made new content.
---
Good input. People seem to believe that 100% of their followers will up and quit if the streamer does.
---
Appalachia is pretty big, it spans the mountain range. That part is only around border of Virginia / West Virgina
---
Speaking of fun tricks: run into the enemy portal at the starting area of the BG so when they run in after you they get ported out.
---
Yikes, getting my day 1 account banned keeps biting me in the ass
---
Dude those are crazy cool to see, impressed you kept them all these years.
---
I am gonna play lots of alt specs, love to look at and make odd builds on the wow talent app.
---
- Pure Fire Lock (with both improved imp talents)
---
- Mace Rogue (Blade Flurry, Mace Spec, Hemo &amp; Prep)
---
- Melee Hunter (21/0/30) with Wind Serpent pet
---
- Elemental Mage (Blast Wave/Ice Block)
---
- 2h Fury Warrior, 2h Arms/Prot spec (MS and Imp. Revenge)
---
- Regrowth Druid (21/0/30) Nature's Grace and Improved Regrowth
---
- Disc/Shadow Priest "disruptor", Divine Spirit/Silence
---
I will play some "regular" specs too, gonna play so many different characters :D
---
I don’t believe this is true. At all
---
No it's not, there's invited for stress
---
This is amazing and very useful in so many ways.
---
Except hunter level 50 black arrow. Huh?
---
Ok sorry didn't see that post
---
[United States National Radio Quiet Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Radio_Quiet_Zone) TIL, or maybe relearned- goodness knows what Wikipedia bottomless pits have passed by that page.  Stumble into one of those and you're really just Ozzie Smith.
---
I mean, you’re getting so defensive, insecure and butthurt by some teasing on a fictional video game. :0 chill out dude, its only a game.
---
I think this is honestly because you downrank a few different heals on Priest so their bars end up getting cluttered with just many of the same spells at different ranks :)
---
Sorry....I skipped ahead because I didn't recognize the intro.  You're right....this is the wrong vid.  Can't find the original I was thinking of but it's similar....I'll see if I can't find it when I've got more time.
---
you'll be quivering before our resplendent armor you moron. Go pick at your undead friends meth sores ;)
---
You understand I volunteered to be a beta tester correct? not a stress tester. Everything you just said is irrelevant. That’s why my profile is checked off for early BETA access. Beta testing and stress testing are very different. It seems to me that you are very mistaken.
---
I’m not the other guy but it’s cool
---
Do you need the retail client installed for WoW classic? I have an active sub and beta checked on.
---
So, you can essentially make a channel and anyone can join it. But I believe in Vanilla each channel had a member limit, so you couldn’t have everyone on the same one.
---
Not that I think this will happen here, but OSRS very visibly took a large majority of the devs away from RS3 over a few years. Obviously a company should allocate its devs where they'll be most useful, but for all the players that still enjoyed RS3, it sucked having most devs pulled off the project. An already stagnating game getting a few more nails in the coffin.
---
I think a similar fear can grip Modern WoW players; that if Classic gets too popular, the version of the game they want to play (BfA) will suffer even more than it already does. Assuming Classic stays hashtagnochanges, I personally can't see the game requiring very many devs, especially if their only project is preparing Classic TBC for a few years down the line. Assuming Classic ever does continue to borrow more devs from Modern, I can see where the fear of both games running in parallel comes from.
---
You’ll be my undead friend soon enough
---
Your entire point is "most subs = best expansion"
---
Any word on OCE servers? Us Aussies like classic to!
---
Mn is a god
---
Sounds like a good ability then, thanks for the help. :)
---
It does show up back in Jan 1st with the requires untapped target flag but that flag is also identical to what's on live so it's hard to say.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20190101204351/https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=118/polymorph
---
Can also see banish on Jan 3rd where it doesn't have the untapped flag(it does have this on live though).
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20190103003335/https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=710/banish
---
It's unlikely(although not impossible) that wowhead would've had access to whatever version of classic blizz was working with. I've tried looking for old patchnotes, like on gamepedia, but I couldn't find any mention of a change to crowd controlling tapped mobs.
---
Do people not realize getting into the stress test doesn't mean you gain access to the beta? You ONLY get access to the stress test server. lmao
---
No, separate client
---
That's what it was marked on wowhead. I'll double check it and update :) Thanks!
---
Seriously, thank the gods for this
---
Game is already easy enough.  Now they're going to add in a bunch of OP add-ons as they have for modern wow.  I was secretly hoping there wouldn't be any addons and everybody would be on a level playing field but I knew it wasn't likely.
---
The problem is that BfA came after Legion. Legion was seen as a high point for many people, with classes re-designed, Artifact Weapons that added new active abilities to your character and lots of interesting passives, a very engaging lore with each class having a completely different story and the resurgence of classic lore characters (some of them missing since freaking Warcraft 2).  
---
BfA feels like a step down, with abilities pruned, a boring substitute for artifacts in the form of azerite gear, world quests feel way more boring than in Legion, there's no single player high-difficult challenge like the mage tower was and the lore is ridiculous and predictable at this point. Not to mention, there's a single campaign for every class,  and that makes leveling alts less interesting.
---
he will roll pve because hes a lil bich

weeeeeeell from your comments in this thread it seems you might as well be lol
---
I have to disagree.  Not going to bother finding them but I saw posts about 2010 and 2011 cata’s getting in. Only can hope for the best!
---
I'm sorry. You're totally right. Please forgive me.
---
tracking, processing, and reinterpreting info on the cpu's time instead of your brain.
---
u can make an addon to do almost anything.
---
cast curse of agony on an enemy.  they're getting away!  oh no nvm, addon says it'll probably kill them on the last tick so i don't have to worry about chase.
---
...you do realize Vanilla is a 15 year old game, right? We have over a decade of experience playing it. 90% of raid bosses before Naxx are not hard.
---
Hi, /u/TK-42775
---
Adding another good hunter [PVP video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNfh6jUIPqA) if it helps anyone
---
Saw the edit just now.
---
You've given me a lot to think about, I appreciate your time Sock.
---
These horde cucks are cucking all the cuck, you ugly irl you ugly in game.
---
You are seeing the game through the eyes of streamers who are actually good at the game, and who have a massive pool of equally good players to pull from for forming their party.
---
Just wait until you have to pug UBRS with complete randoms. You will want to die.
---
I tried to get back into Legion and was just lost....
---
The game is completely different and it’s like learning a completely new game that I just couldn’t do.
---
These two classes are similar in many ways. Instead of typing out the similarities and differences, let me ask you an rpg question:
---
Do you prefer weapons or spells?
---
Warlock so far, affliction specifically. I was a rogue when I actually played then but I don't want to play rogue again.
---
Just unequip half your gear if you want to make the game harder for yourself.
---
Yes, I do. I’m just saying it might be kind of a problem when people start steamrolling content BfA style and going “I thought classic was hard”
---
So Alliance is 80% hot girls?
---
**Epoch of Thought [H] **| NA-PvP | Wed/Thu/Sun | 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore 
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla WoW’s release &amp; became a top guild there. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content while providing a second family for our members. For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. 
---
Our core is experienced through Naxx &amp; most of us have raided for years. We’re ready to devour classic content. We run a unique point-guided loot council that awards gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance. Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence, dedication, communication, &amp; reliability &amp; not nepotism. 
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with proper gear, consumes, &amp; knowledge. We’re team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the **entire** raid team &amp; the overly self-interested are not tolerated. 
---
We’re a diverse group of dedicated raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Constructive criticism in proper channels is expectedand valued, but because we focus on winning and not whining, drama stirring  not tolerated.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
`Wed/Thu/Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. We’ve always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. are ran on non-core days.`
---
**Looking for**: 
---
`Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; 
---
specifically seeking: top tier Resto Shamans &amp; Mages.`
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message for a voice interview, but the less social can also fill out an application on our Website &lt;http://epochofthought.com&gt;. You can also jump on our discord: &lt;https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT&gt;
---
**We’re practicing on a guild test realm with weekly 40-man raiding while we wait till Aug 27.  Join us and hit the ground running!**
---
In fact you only need the comment prior to this to piece it together
---
I fixed it. I have no idea why that's on classic.wowhead. lol
---
In addition to the raids, it also had the best quality of life upgrades. I think come September/October, people are going to remember just how awful things like flasks were. TBC had an alc lab in a city, no more scholomance. And the lotus were super common as opposed to about 30 well guarded spawn nodes on 2 hour resets we'll see soon. Elixirs were also only 1 offense and 1 defense, so you didn't need to have boatloads of buffs every single attempt, only 1 or 2 pending your role. World buffs were also not a requirement. You didn't have to run around Silithus for a buff, or save Onyxia turn ins. 
---
The expansion took out a ton of the grindier elements without taking the life away...except flying mounts, those sucked. 
---
TBC also gave us arena. Say what you will, but it was fun at the start... Until they started shifting the balance and changing the meta 5 times in the middle of each season in LK.
---
I do wonder if their ranks will be impacted as some of their players go over to Classic. I know I’d switch in a heartbeat.
---
kek you'll see me with "Release Spirit" in the middle of your screen most of the time
---
I started in 2007 does anyone know if anyone got in the beta with accounts made back then?
---
Lol who are you referring to as good at the game?
---
How do you kill he who has no life?
---
Wow surprisingly I did see this hi hey.
---
I deleted my other comment because I know some people on here are gatekeepers and I really didn't want to deal with their annoying replies if I received any. As a lot of people have issues with others wanting to play classic that didn't actually play classic before.
---
But yeah basically my original comment stated that I felt young compared to everyone here since I started in TBC when I was 6, and most people here started classic when they were 12+ it seems, but I still am hoping to receive an invite to beta.
---
I've wanted to play Classic for many years and I don't have a big understanding of it and that's what I'm excited about. I'm trying to not learn anything because it'd be like playing from the start again. No pre-existing mounts, there aren't heirlooms *at all*. Leveling will take forever and I don't remember much from pre-cata because I was so young.
---
I remember there was no quest markers on the map, stuff hit pretty hard even at low levels and health/mana regen was slow. But I liked having to stock up on food/drinks, take my time and play slowly. It kinda ruins the adventure feel of leveling going in and one-shotting everything. Leveling in current WoW to me feels like a speedrun rather than an experience.
---
You need to se incoming heals you need something like deadly boss mod and you need decursiv. For pvp enemy cast bar is really nice.
---
&gt; The main utility of Shadowguard is in 1v1 v. Rogues.
---
&gt; and it's essentially meaningless against most other engagements.
---
Shadowguard procs on any attack against the caster.
---
https://youtu.be/djzrjTyJsPI
---
Here.  As far as I can tell this is original retail 1.12. If I'm wrong I'm wrong.
---
So you don’t need the retail installed at all? Thank you
---
What's the problem? Other people having opinions?
---
People have gotten in with bfa only accounts
---
It's going to be used much the same way gearscore was before and raider.io is now. If you have a choice of a few dps, you'll naturally want to pick the person who's done the dungeon over someone who hasn't because it's going to get done a lot more smoothly. You specifically might not do this but anyone else who uses this addon likely will.
---
&gt;They haven't said that at all. They said they might remove something that clearly breakd Classic
---
"It will be a different one, but I don't know if I would categorize it as completely different. We are starting with our modern codebase, and that includes the modern API, but there are addon APIs that don't make sense for Classic, and in those cases, we're trying to roll things back to reflect how the game behaved back then."
---
Take that as you will.
---
The game being too easy.
---
So how would Blizzard prevent the functionality of this addon? Blizzard can't block addons meant for specific purposes, they can only disable parts of the API. The only critical API functions for this addon are SendChatMessage and event handling for chat messages. I am certain that Blizzard will not remove either of these, since they are very important pieces of the API and have been around since 1.1.
---
To begin with, there isn't anything inherently wrong with matchmaking tools. Spamming "LFM DM" and getting the eventual "inv" is not what I'd call an essential part of the experience. Friendships are formed by getting through the dungeon and seeing how good others are at the game, not by waiting 2 hours in SW for a tank to pop up.
---
I was looking at my old classic screenshots and wondering why I had [my MH/OH and a staff on my bars as a mage](https://imgur.com/YVg6Zhl). Then I remembered evocation scaled on spirit, and that I would equip a green pure +SPI staff before the first tick of evoc got off for the extra ~5% more mana, ha.
---
This is fucking stupid
---
Haven't heard of that and didn't find anything on google. I assume it's a raider.io classic port?
---
yeah, or just go on his twitch and his discord is in the bio or type !discord in his chat
---
Because I dug through them myself and realized it was a shit source, and then deleted my comment 3 minutes after posting it. Which begs me to my next question;
---
Are you using and app to browse Reddit? Since you're still seeing my comment
---
Wasn't rogue Stealth available at level 10, not 1?
---
I do not believe we can. I won’t say it looks straight up stupid but it’s a bit too ridiculous looking for me.
---
Your salt sustains me
---
Maxing world buffs was definitely a thing on retail as well. OP definitely doesn't have any, though. Maybe it was just a later kill (ie not the first) for the guild and they were confident without them.
---
Sounds similar to the meeting stone or the automated grouping from innkeepers.
---
Definitely was not possible in TBC, I'd bet my WoW account on it. MC and poly were tap locked but banish wasn't.
---
What is best in slot for a level 5 Hunter and how do we get to South shore
---
Please explain it.
---
Same here, really hoping for it lol
---
Warlock would have even more with all the different pets abilities that are pretty useful and require micro management, unlike hunter
---
 **&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance** 
---
**Introduction:** 
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built from a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.  
---
**Looking For:** 
---
Damage:
---
\-  Hunter
---
\-  Warlock
---
\-  Warrior
---
\-  Rogue
---
Healing:
---
\-  Priest
---
\-  Paladin
---
\-  Druid
---
Tanking:
---
\-  Warrior 
---
 We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be. 
---
 **Raid Schedule:**
---
    Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
    Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.  
---
If you are interested in joining, or learning more about the guild, use the following two links to view our website or join our discord. Please feel free to speak with myself through PM's if you have any questions. When you are ready to commit to the guild, please submit an application on our website.

Second class player? And how do you figure this is a likelihood?
---
Level 4, IIRC, you learned along with Backstab
---
Hi Trystan!  I hope you get in the Beta (I'm currently impatiently waiting as well, praying that I see it pop up on my launcher...)
---
I'm wondering how you would progress after reaching level 10, when you have no silver to learn spells/abilities?
---
Red is dead baby
---
there's stuff to do in BFA, even if the naysayer says otherwise.
---
lvl 30 people on the beta are getting REALLY bored.
---
Thanks for the link! I got my thick keys ready.
---
You can also this command instead, the addon only sets the distance to max and allows for faster zooming in/out
---
    /console cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor 3.4
---
What is your native language? There might be an addon to help.
---
The original Gouge sound effect. That *slice* sound is so satisfying.
---
I was so sad when they changed it to the current retail sound. Can't wait to hear the original sound.
---
Fantastic!  What's my prize and when can I expect it?
---
Awesome
---
dont tell me what to do
---
Troll Shadow Priest is absolutely, undeniably better than UD. People immediately jump to the gun about WoTF being the best and Dev plag being the best damaging racial, but let's think logically about it.
---
In Classic strictly because there's no Arenas, WoTF loses value, additionally, think of how many less fear-casted classes are played on Alliance compared to Horde, Horde have more Warlocks hands down. Dev Plag is countered by Priest/Paladin also.
---
Shadowguard scales with spell power, proc's SW and Blackout, that's insane. Low mana cost, no cooldown.
---
Hex of Weakness is a 20% MS with no cooldown and next to near no mana cost using rank 1 against a lot of classes. 2 classes are able to dispel it. 
---
Berserking lined up with Inner Focus is a huge burst potential, yes IF+DV is good - but IMO it's a lot worse than against a faction more melee-heavy compared to Shadowguards uptime.
---
Troll also get 5% damage against druid FCs, which is minor.
---
The things that sealed the deal was that it would try to group you with a warlock that will summon you.
---
Yes
---
My friend has EU wow account from vanilla launch but has a fresh NA wow account subscribed. Same battle.net account. He got an invite today.
---
Does /console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 5 no longer work?
---
Hail Champion Joodaprey for giving Blizzard $50!
---
Haha I'm glad I got a chance to see it! Alright first of all coming from someone who did play in Vanilla let me take this opportunity to assure you it is totally acceptable to say fuck those kinds of ignorant and toxic people. It really sucks that you and others are subjected to that kind of crap when you're actually excited about something and hesitant to share that excitement because of the potential negativity. I'm excited for you dude. And I will do my part to make your experience, now and then, as positive as possible. 
---
That's actually pretty badass you started so young. My only warning is prepare to spend a lot of time playing the game because it's just so damn fun. 
---
Thanks for sharing your experience man. And for real, dont let the negativity that seems to be rising on this sub deter you from sharing or reaching out because this kinda shit makes my day!
---
Best of luck dude.
---
There are addons and macros that will determine the HP missing of your target and choose the correct spell rank to cast. No need for more than one of the spell on your hotbar.
---
Just my thoughts as I'm sitting here playing Diablo's new season because no invite &lt;.&lt;  There were 2 days of NA invites, then the weekend, and thinking they'll do 2 days of EU invites for their closed server...then mass on Wed.  I have no info to back this, but it makes sense if they're keeping the pops on the betas small. It makes sense that they'll stagger the EU over a few days like they did here in the US
---
But then I'd have to watch semi-popular streamer
---
french
---
Why did I read this in survival guide voice?
---
I forgot about the Peggle app. Fucking great for long flights.
---
You... you bastard.
---
You're probably right.
---
Play shaman in 30/0/21 spec you are a monster in pvp you can group as a dps or healer. You can raid as a healer in that spec. It is alsow one of the highest skill sealing in the game pvp wise.

It would be an add-on that scans your guild bank and saves the items in it to a guild site. It would function the same as an auction house add-on
---
I think you get the quest at level 2, but you end up having to kill a level 4 mob (at least as human). Updating it now to (2)(Q)
---
Doesn't affect banish, that was changed in 2.3.0.

Haha thanks, hope you get in as well! Surprised how nice you all are, I've seen some pretty elitist comments on here lol. I'd love to get in, but I fully understand why they'd prefer older accounts considering they actually played during Classic time and will be of much more value for testing.
---
And then you got Tipsout and Quin69 who get in because they stream and bug report false things that even I know aren't bugs. But again, I get why they're in too. Good advertising.
---
Anyone know if they've done the wave of invites yet today? Haven't seen too much on it. I remember someone saying at around 6 PM PST they'd do it.
---
lol no
---
Still on standby to be told what I was wrong about. Any time you're ready, Doobiemoto!
---
Yeah, but it's not particularly "necessary" against much else, since Rogues are the only 1v1 engagement that will leave you stunned at the beginning of the fight without SW:P on them. Against other classes you can move away, cast yourself, fear immediately if in melee range, start Mind Flaying, etc. Shadowguard gives you that edge against Rogues because they're attacking multiple times when you've been ambushed and are stunned. The stun is useful against other classes, no doubt (and Shadowguard does have good damage scaling with +damage stats), but you're already going to be stunning other classes with your other spells.
---
No, it was renamed to cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor in 7.1.0
---
What an odd time to find this thread, I've been thinking about this alot lately.
---
I had hoped to get into Beta so I could try out Troll Priest instead of my usual Dwarf/Undead. I also feel that Shadowguard offers more against classes that are going to stick to you in PvP, and Hex is going to frustrate enemy Paladin/Priest healers. :)
---
So you want them to change the game just because you dont like the idea that it wasnt really as difficult as you remembered?
---
You sure it wasn't because of this said bug and it being always on?
---
I really feel all add-ons should be banned may be a in build tool by Blizzard to measure DPS of party members. All third party add-ons should be banned.
---
I said they wouldn't do something like that unless it is something catastrophic. They can totally determine what things mods can and can't do, and have been doing that forever. 
---
In my first post I was very much being hyperbolic as all get out, but this whole subbreddit is constantly taking polarizing positions.
---
If the positions were "group finder mods are allowed" or "no mods are allowed" I was saying I would pick the second; even though I know it will never come to that decision.
---
welllll questhelper was a thing in vanilla. and people wanting to find out who gets fastest diremaul north runs is just weird lol.
---
Yes they did. They have the repository of many patches
---
I think I’ll go with shaman. How fun is it to play overall?
---
Way to go streamers!!  Here’s to many more hours of quality content!!!
---
what is BiS?
---
Not sure how you and the guy you're responding to missed the point. It is that the damage they are doing is not what was in vanilla.
---
Ah that explains it! I couldn't get it to work and was quite sad, but this makes so much sense. Thank you!
---
Here I am just giving a legit response it's been with hurr durr virgin, TRIGGERED, you mad bro???
---
Who's the triggered one again lol
---
It's such a stupid comparison you could destroy it in just a few words, according to you, but instead you decide to post an empty snarkument instead. 
---
Lmao.
---
Warriors, Priests and Warlocks could fear, right? But Shadowguard would prompt a 10% chance at stun against anyone attacking me. I can't get over that. Massive. 
---
Thanks for your run down on this stuff, it helps a lot.
---
Best in slot gear.  For min/maxing stats
---
Citation, please.
---
That's not Wintergrasp hun.
---
That's Winterspring.
---
I'm fine with this type of thing. Some of these addons won't impact people who don't want to use them. If its helping with quests and not having a great impact on how a person plays I don't see a problem with it.
---
Unpopular opinion I know, as much as I loved classic, I'd prefer classic with good addons/QOL changes. Its not 2004, I lived and breathed WoW in 2004 and I loved every second. Now I can relive that, hopefully without all the silly stuff that went along with the great game.
---
Hahaha, well I'm sure that either one would be fun. The tribal paints that they get are so cool too!
---
Questie is whatever. dungeon.io will ruin the pugging scene among dungeons and raids at endgame and make it a toxic mess just like m+ is in retail.
---
Any update?
---
Undead priest is better. For everything. End thread.
---
I think the raider.io is more for the gear score which was a pretty common thing for pug raids and such. Except it was a "poke me on top of org bank for gear inspection" this just seems like a lazier way to do that for retail players. Which is unfortunate. 
---
The quest addons I'm actually okay with to an extent and I know there were some shoddy ones during Vanilla
---
As I said two had their damage reduced, and they were not at the start of my testing / play session.
---
All of my friends have custom UI's and I'm over here using X and Z perl for 10 years. If it ain't broke don't fix it!
---
Feel free to elaborate. :)
---
A casual guild that plans to raid 3 or more nights a week? Ridiculous. Hardcore guilds are planning to raid two nights a week... It’s classic wow, there is no need for that much time unless you’re wiping all night.
---
The TB lifts were killers. Every damn day.
---
"This item has no stats. Bug."
---
It’s a rogue repellant. Quite effective too
---
oo thanks
---
As far as I can tell, the only invites that went out today was the wave this morning for EU players.  No word about any NA invites tonight...was hoping there would be. 
---
And yeah, I totally agree with you on the toxicity that's been running rampant since the Beta's release.  We all want to play, and we shouldn't take it too personally that Blizzard gave access to some of the more well known Classic Streamers (Blizzard is still a company after all and it makes sense marketing wise).  At least with those Streamers, we can see the gameplay and maybe find bugs ourselves!
---
I see them having this on max 1 month. Day 1 will be the worst day to log on. Week 1 will see a HUGE divide between levels as there will be plenty of people who can only level a few hours while others sit for half a day. This will widen the gap. By week 2 end the divide will be even greater. Plenty of new players but not nearly as packed in the starter zones as the first 3 days. I'd honestly suspect this will go a few weeks, 2 or 3 then merge.
---
As far as impact, not much. It's clearly better than the other two possible outcomes without it:
---
A) Dead server when all the tourists leave.
---
B) Server merges.
---
Winter-WHO?
---
Not having BG would make leveling so much harder because everyone would be force to pvp in the open world.  
---
However, the amount of fun gathering players into raid size groups, and just raiding the other faction would be insanely fun.
---
Dude. These are absolutely awesome. Thanks for sharing man!!
---
Yes, they should add BGs. Large scale world PvP is fun in small doses. BGs in Vanilla were where people learned who the best players were, and were a big source of faction pride.
---
Ofc they should.
---
This guy is pretty cringey. I got about 12 minutes in.
---
German here, switched to English clients pretty much everywhere after being put off by localization back in Vanilla. 
---
The way your post sounds you're already literate in the language, so why not take the opportunity to get a bit more proficient by using the English client? 
---
If it doesn't actively hamper your experience heavily you could have fun and learn a bit at the same time.
---
Lmao well done
---
Yup. It's an average thing. On average a higher io player will be decent, so they hunt for that. Also, on average I find high io players to be more annoying. Trade off I suppose.
---
https://youtu.be/v5sjX0tdHHY
---
What part / how is it cringe?
---
Mmhmm. And please don't take my word as gospel in any event. In the end, you're not really going to regret either choice. They're both good.
---
I do want to comment on something from earlier; if you're running Shadow, you should be using the max rank Shadowguard, because Shadowguard has a good spell coefficient and will thus its damage will scale to respectable levels with good gear. The extra mana is definitely worth it.
---
EZ Clap
---
I was not able to find anything directly specific to polymorph, but the 1.2.0 patch cites that Mind control and banish can no longer be used on tapped mobs. So it is probably safe to say the same for polymorph.
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.2.0](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.2.0)
---
I don't see why they shouldn't.  They were part of classic and a ton of people enjoyed them.  Mass world PvP will still occur with BGs.  Ultimately it doesn't really matter whether they should be there or not though, because they will be there lol.  Blizz isn't going to remove them on a whim and risk pissing off all the people that enjoy BGs.
---
Why?
---
If you're expecting a 15 year old game to be "hard", you're going to be sorely disappointed.
---
ALT+TAB was around when Vanilla was, so I don't see how this would possibly matter to anyone.
---
Hi, /u/cooplooper
---
Grief, uh, finds a way
---
Did anyone else play Classic like I did? People argue that you needed to be more social back then. All my groups were literally as follows:
---
/2 LFG Strat
---
/p Heya
---
*no communication whatsoever until after dungeon*
---
/p Thx for group
---
There is nothing "catastrophic" enough that would make them completely disable all addons.
---
If they don't like what an addon is doing, they can simply break the functionality for that addon in the API. They did this multiple times in retail, one notable example being that addon in late WOTLK that would draw circles all over the environment.
---
hmmmm... 
---
You.
---
[raider.io](https://raider.io) will ruin the PVE scene in my opinion.
---
Not OP but opening up your video with "I have really bad heartburn and I refuse to edit this" is pretty inconsiderate.
---
Yeah, I don't get negativity. People in the Classic community wonder why others hate the idea of Classic, but then anytime someone not from Classic is interested, there's people that hiss at them and shuns them for not playing Classic. It's a minority, but it's a loud one.
---
&gt;That's actually pretty badass you started so young.
---
Yep, was the youngest in the house and my entire family played. I have tons of great memories from it. I took forever to level because my brothers and I would spend a lot of time climbing mountains instead of questing. I remember seeing my dad get a dark whelpling from a drop while farming (he leveled like 3 levels only killing whelplings. He farmed a lot of them haha) my Mom getting the Hyacinth Macaw and us having no clue about the value of it, **thinking the "6 minutes until release spirit" thing meant they'd delete your character if you didn't resurrect after 6 minutes.** Still have my first character and was just playing him today. Glad I never deleted him or anything stupid over the years. I mean, our WoW characters are practically family members at this point, we could never delete them.
---
Damn, once I really think about it. This game had such a massive impact on my, and my family's life. A lot of my childhood memories are World of Warcraft related in some way.
---
Despite me never putting as much time into the game as my brother or parents did, I'll always love the game so much, and I can't wait to experience it all again with my family just like the old times. Except this time, in Classic.
---
Let’s not forget all the streamers who got us here!!
---
Doesn't look like Banish was changed until 2.3.0.7561.

I'm just a guy who used to play around the WotLK era until early Cataclysm. I was about 9 or 10 at the time so I didn'tknnow what I was doing but I had the time of my life and have played mmo's ever since. I am extremely excited to experience Vanilla. I'm not looking for a serious guild. I just want a group of chill people to play with. For the Alliance!
---
Seconding this but for 2008... :(
---
I beta tested wrath!

Not him but here's a 1 year chart. OSRS was on a huge decline before they implemented the GE and started doing personal content updates, it was actually going to die.

I started near the end of BC on a PvP server. I had a personal rule that I would never gank an alli who was way lower level than me. No honour in that.

Except for gnomes. Fuck them. The moment they chose that race their lives here forfeit
---
From what people have posted, most of the accounts that have been granted access are from 2004/2005 or were well-known streamers.  I think I saw maybe one EU account that said it was created in 2010 and got access but that is the ONLY one I've seen, if they were even telling the truth.
---
None for NA today from what I'm seeing
---
The guy probably copied literally the code from the old addon (no idea which one), renamed files, and uploaded it.           
---
Things like:     
---
   `-- bfa assaults [51982] = true, -- Storm's Rage      `    
---
give it away. There's a bunch of them but yeah, he didn't put any development time in apart from the like &lt;2 mins he'd need to click rename files
---
Nice. It made me chuckle. Anyways good work and thank you!
---
why the hell would they remove BGs lol
---
You aren’t going to be able to use your existing characters so it wouldn’t matter.
---
I never played ESO myself so I can't say.
---
In Runescape's PvP scene a lot of a players stop leveling to fight in certain brackets, essentially twinks. I always wish I could temporarily have my level be lowered so I could participate in these brackets without having to make entire other character. 
---
FF14 has a system where you can level synced for certain content, like dungeons, raids, and world bosses. However with the exception of world bosses, it's entirely optional and you can get the same rewards for doing raids unsynced and overleveled. I get no sense of achievement when I do it even sync'd because there's no way to prove it.
---
You're very welcome!
---
Awesome thank you for giving me some hope.
---
So far no word for NA invites today.
---
not balanced
---
allow us to give 2 blessings then its even
---
That's comforting to hear. 
---
Okay, but obviously if I was a healer at the time, I'd just use a weaker rank. I have been told to level as shadow, at least until level 50 or so, because I guess you have enough healing to get the job done, and it makes the leveling much easier. Does that resonate with what you've heard?
---
THEN FUCKING GO WATCH THE CRINGE JEWTUBERS WHO ONLY MAKE CONTENT FOR THE FACT OF GAMING A FUCKING ALGORITHM LIKE THE NPC CUCKS THEY FUCKING ARE. 
---
FUCK OFF AND GO WATCH TIPS OUT AND OTHER FAKE CHANNELS WHO ARE JUST IN IT FOR THE MONEY.
---
Hot garbage, classic wow was wasn't all about gear but also skill. I watched (and personally did) wreck people wearing  MC Gear vs me in full Blues.
---
Oh you dont have 10k IO score, Were not taking you to LBRS. Yeah, If the High end instances (LBRS, UBRS, Strathome) are true the originals I hope you got 4 or 5 hours to burn for a full clear. and how else am I supposed to get better gear. 
---
Better yet drop a few target dummys in org and I'll show you the DPS.
---
same here.
---
WotF is good, but its not as good on Priests as its primary benefactor, Rogues. Priests vs Priests, its very awkward to use since you have to run to melee. Warriors will often only use it as an interrupt, since they usually hit you out of fear pretty fast. It can certainly be helpful against Warlock, but the point is racials benefit different classes differently and WotF isnt nearly as useful for Priests as it is for other classes.
---
Probably wants the old account for a better shot at a beta invite.
---
What/who is the source of this chart?
---
Looks like my comment got deleted for saying the name of the pserver, but...
---
Yo just hop on [the server is named North, and the second word is Dale] . Extreme influx of new players since beta a announcement last week. Starter and leveling zones are full! Plenty of friends to be made, and plenty of glorious low level dungeons and Wpvp!!
---
Hunters will be top gold makers early on due to ability to solo farm maraudon. With dm release warlocks will be able to aoe farm lashers and sell the herbs on ah, which will also be decent gold depending on prices. Warlocks are much more useful in raids due to their summons, healthstones, curses and decent damage, hunters are not in as high demand but you still want a couple of them. In pvp warlocks are extremely good with the right build.
---
All of these features in the game instead of having to use a 3rd party addon
---
Isn't rag fire resistant? Can't remember honestly. 
---
If so that spec is even better lol
---
Jesus sperging out much?
---
That is a great name.
---
&gt; Warlocks, on the other hand
---
I found I could kill them without too much trouble in the midfield if I could kite them from outside fear range. They get discouraged pretty quickly if you aren't silly enough to stand on the spot and let them run up to you.
---
Obviously not so much when things get crowded in a building.

Hahaha damn dude I wish I could retain my vanilla memories as well as you can. I just remember being a 58 hunter and getting into my guilds ZG run. They were doing trivia in Ventrilo and because my families PC was in my kitchen I was asking my mom the questions trying to get one right. When I finally got an answer from her on one no one had answered k queued my DESK MICROPHONE and caused some absolutely horrific echo since it was the first time I tried speaking in Ventrilo hahahaahaha. Ahhh shit now it's coming back to me.. no wonder I forgot it all!
---
Let me get that Not Grid
---
his interviews with actual knowledgable players are great, rest is ehhh or obvious shit.
---
I have a strong memory of leveling through the plaguelands listening to dragon force and I can’t wait to relive it.
---
24/7 sperg confirmed.

Doesn’t look like any invites, from what I’ve seen. Maybe they’re holding off for just a big stress test wave

I doubt he had 50.000 DPS in vanilla.

You can clearly set its set to damage done.

Personal DPS is shown as title.
---
Oh, definitely you use the low ranks as a Holy Priest.
---
My main in Vanilla was an Undead Priest (which is why it's a bit shameful that I forgot that DP used to have a cooldown). And yes, you can still heal in Shadow spec at lower levels, and Shadow definitely levels faster in a solo environment.
---
To get to the crux of the matter, which spec are you planning on playing at 60, and are you only PvPing, or are you also PvEing? Those two answers help to determine which race is going to be better.

I think they’re changing AV to a capture the flag battle ground based in Ashenvale
---
What do you mean? There’s no warrior in any of those screenshots.
---
u/Kaivax get this man in the beta!!
---
Okay, but it would destroy the random scene, which is/was a big part of the original too.
---
&gt; What are you talking about? 
---
The worthiness of the OP and whether it's legitimate or not.
---
&gt; I know it was done on purpose in Classic because it's been that way since Vanilla.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; They have no armor in Classic because their ancient code gave them none in Vanilla.   
---
&gt;No, they literally didn't. The boots you spawn with in starting zones in Vanilla have never given armor, they've always been cosmetic. 
---
Are you sure about that? The [plate version of these boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=43/squires-boots) on Wowhead states that they were added in patch \~1.11.1, which was released in 2006.
---
I'm not going to address the rest of your comment as it just gets even more condescending.
---
I mean they aren't the only one
---
https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warrior/leveling-1-60/
---
Not to worry, there will still be plenty of world PvP in classic wow.
---
There is actual value to being in the world, plus no flying mounts. BGs will not take away too much from this, it will still be far better than retail.
---
I looked at the code and it isn’t an actual addon, it’s torn straight from existing files and is a satire repository, which honestly gave me a chuckle. 
---
So fear not, just a troll being a troll.
---
#LET ME INNNNN
---
Ah memories of landing in Felwood and being MC'd off the cliff instantly, fun times!
---
One huge factor people need to remember is the player IQ is higher now (although this can be argued). Because of this I don't think we will ever see the exact type of AV that we did in Vanilla
---
Tbh I’d pay 30 dollars for both subs a month if I had to.  It’s cheap as fuck.
---
There's quite a few functions that directly reference the "addon name" like ClassicLFR.function. Maybe he just find/replaced certain functions that already existed in old addon or something.   
---
Which file do you find that in btw?

---
Yeah Im sitting here on New waiting for posts to come in with people saying they got in. Give Beta.
---
WSG AB and vanilla AV were the bomb.
---
They can wear anything but generally wear cloth or leather as it is more abundant for heal/magic damage modifiers.
---
This.
---
In an ideal world they would fix the “bfa” version of the game to bring it inline with classic style mmo, while still preserving the og version of the game.
---
Sadly I don’t think this is possible.  Even when they added Outland and Northrend (arguably the only 2 decent expansions) the world already became too big and spread out for the finite population of the server to meaningfully interact with each other.
---
Blocking the "request invite to group" and "invite player to group" calls.
---
Except that an add-on like a quest tracker is massive an includes a lot, the CLassic API is going to be very limited compared to retail, as per devs current logic on Classic. So it is not as simple as adding a few lines at the end of the add-on. It requires almost reverse engineering a lot of the code. We would have been better off with a Vanilla engine because we had rock solid add-ons that already worked.
---
And I’d still buy it.
---
So your sources are...two Reddit posts???
---
Where, and how did they collect this data?
---
Does it even take bot accounts into consideration?

What is the margin of error?
---
Private servers did a pretty good job. Why the fuck can't classic
---
It's Anduin, but since he's a child, Bolvar basically runs shit while he learns how to be a person.
---
I agree. I use a shit load of addons on private servers and I know a lot of high end players use even more. I didn’t realize there was hate towards them since they were in Vanilla

Posting screen shots of the WSG scoreboard on the forums, good times.

Nah bro it's sickening that youtube turned into a bunch of souless non-gamers who make "content" all copying eachother because it's the only way to survive by being clickbaity little cucks that make a 10 minute video telling you to farm jaguars in swamp of sorrows when it's one of the worst farms for that level. It's evil, deceptive, cancerous, and is filling the internet with garbage that shouldn't be.
---
Countless "Classic" content creators are just mimicking eachother in terms of presentation and content and a lot of their content is straight up wrong. (Tips "deep dive" on rogues for starters.)
---
Go waybackmachine some old WoW content. A WoW tutorial video immediately went straight to the point and didn't bullshit you. 
---
If some souless incel cuckold gets triggered that someone talked about heartburn for a couple seconds they can go digest the souless, robotic content that's filled to the brim. There's ZERO human element to their creations. Yeah I could understand if I was presenting this video as a television show or a paid broadcast or some shit, but it's a fukken personal video as if we were in a fucking room together talking. Oh wait millennial smart phone using scum fucks who grew up in white picket fenced neighborhood gated community houses with a full supportive family making 250k a year wouldn't know what that's like.

AV before the multiple shrinks was by far my favorite BG.  It just doesn't feel the same since they made it tiny in comparison to what it used to be.

The guy isn't ''just playing'', maybe he's top tier PVP/PVE, maybe he's really funny, maybe he creates events or is very informative, sometimes the person creates lots of Drama, there is a shit ton of ways to provide content and thats why people watch them.
---
Green is beautiful.
---
To be fair, they could have done more to reward alternatives to raiding, like crafting, questing at 60 (not for XP, but for items; dungeon set 2 was epic but the rewards were meh), world PVP, etc. The only real alternative is ranking in BGs 24/7.
---
Chill

Well, I would love to do both. But, once I have all of the gear that I need from PvE, probably move over to PvP almost exclusively. The issue is that if my friends and I were playing Alliance, I would just pick Dwarf and go full heals. Not even a question. But, they want to play Horde, so I am trying to make due. 
---
Apparently Shadow Priests don't really get in to raids because they go OOM so quickly, so I would just be healing.
---
If healing in PvP is fun, I would have no issue doing that instead of shadow. It would simplify things a lot. I know that I'd have to work hard to get enough shadow gear, and that none of the tier sets contribute to shadow dps.
---
This 1000 times. I already have a ton of respect for bilingual individuals and it looks like you already have a strong grasp of the basics. 
---
There will always be those ignorant people however that feel the need to try and be assholes so I just hope you can brush those type of experiences off. 
---
Also, not going to lie. I giggled at the 'dongeons' (it's spelled dungeons, but again man we all know what you mean and that's all that matters!)
---
I want Beta too ... 3 months are too much time to wait :(
---
World is a lot more active than it was in Wrath, cant say how well Classic will age, bit back in Vanilla, youd always run into other people leveling. A fair number of group elite quests youll notice. No dungeon finder, need to travel to the dungeon to do it, from filling a group to pulling, it could be 30 mins. Since the world is more active, PvPnis much more active. Youll have a lot less gold, mounts were more expensive and quests gave less gold. A good proportion of players struggle to get their 40 mounts. Depending how well you farm, itll take a few weeks to get your epic mount, a lot of people never get it.

---
No, that is SandLOL in Silithus.
---
Except Questie doesn't work. You will have to find another add-on or hope someone ports over that one.
---
The problem is you have a loyal fanbase who liked it that way, and then a ton of other people who complained and outnumbered the loyal fanbase... so who gets their way? The one that makes the company the most money, of course. Which means the larger audience...
---
Classic WoW should be a service to those who enjoy classic wow. The rest have retail.

Too soon bro...
---
It's actually worse than DP for rogues. See my post for explanation.
---
I dont think I ever saw a pserver AV last more than 8 hours
---
Pretty high tier trolling, got me good. I skimmed through some of the files and it looked semi legit, guess I didn't look hard enough.
---
What kind of entitled attitude is that? "you won't let me play the game so fuck you I won't help improve it at all". Really?
---
is this bait?
---
You didn't answer my questions.

So, this new page just takes the displayed number at the top of the website?

Yeaaaah, that's not how credible data analysis works.

Sorry.
---
We tried.  They said no.
---
The problem with restoring AV is that all the \#nochanges people will cry about it, and then everyone under the sun will want their own little change added.
---
I love me some Old AV.
---
Sorry if this wasn't made clear: Do Stress Testers then get to keep their beta access, or will they be revoked the access after the stress test?
---
It'd almost me worse to get invited to this mini stress test if you don't get to keep your access for closed beta.
---
8 hours beats the 20 minute fight we have now
---
&gt; dungeon set 2 was epic but the rewards were meh
---
Well that's what the player I quoted from was complaining about: “making gear the only way to progress in the game.” There are MMOs that don't focus so heavily on power rewards to incentivize activities, but I don't know how you'd incorporate that into WoW. They've tried before with varying degrees of success.
---
I think you should consider seeking help. You seem extremely disturbed.
---
In PVP, you wear plate.
---
In PVE, you wear a robe.
---
The best Holy Paladin pre-BIS chest is Robes of the Exalted from Stratholme.
---
Then it's Robe of Volatile Power from MC
---
Then it's Robes of the Guardian Saint in AQ40.
---
Not until Naxx, with Redemption Tunic, will you be wearing a plate chest piece in raids.
---

whats most interesting about this interview is that it proves blizzard straight up lied in the past (which we all knew) with regards to them saying they didnt have the client or old code anymore for original wow.

---
They should definitely keep them. 
---
BGs provide structured, goal-oriented PVP opportunities that: you can opt in to, don't interfere with your leveling, have a distinct start/end with a clear winner, are relatively balanced, etc.
---
If they *just* did World PVP you'd lose out on most of those benefits

WoD had some of the best raiding of any WoW expansion, so that's hardly surprising. The only big problem with WoD was that players had fuck all to do. What was there was alright, not great necessarily, but not terrible either, but when you run out of stuff to do after two months and then have to wait another 5 or whatever months for the next update the game tends to get a bit boring.
---
Citation please.

It's funny how many people are shitting on WOTF when people ask about alternatives.

Hi, /u/Druerino
---
I’d like to counter that elemental shamans were a thing in good guilds, and by good guilds I mean guilds with players that had a decent understanding of game mechanics and weren’t just monkeys smashing buttons on a keyboard
---
I'm not entirely sure why you view stress testing as some kind of lesser form of QA. It's targeting a specific MAJOR system for testing during the beta stages of the software. It's just as important as the rest of the test. If they excluded it and layering had some kind of massive bug in it which would have been caught by monitoring it under high load (like launch) then that would be massively negligent on Blizzard's part.
---

Simply epic gamer moment lad
---
I agree completely I just think there will be some experiences we will never be able to truly reacreate
---
There are raid Shadowpriests (such as myself, actually). They're limited to 1 per raid and are there as a quasi-DPS quasi-utility spec to buff Warlocks with Shadow Weaving and passive healing capability from Vampiric Embrace.
---
But yes, you'll have a substantially easier time being a healer in any event. And if you are, then Undead simply doesn't bring much to the table when it comes to racial min/maxing. Its actual base racials are far better than Troll's, but Troll's Priest-specific spells edge out Undead's with Holy, as I said before. So if aesthetic is totally meaningless to you, that's my recommendation.
---
Good stuff man! Thanks you for the teams hard work!
---
While I get what you’re saying, some of the best world pvp I’ve ever experienced has happened in war mode on BFA in darkshore and across Kul’Tiras. 
---
I’m not taking away from how amazing classic is, but for what it’s worth, the faction rivalry in BFA worked well, at least for a while. 
---
That being said, BFA is a much worse game than classic.
---
Where did you find them? I'm curious now.
---
And this is where it gets tricky. Armor/Resistance values AFAIK are completelly random and armor/resistance reductions might not even work as intended, making bosses easier than intended.

[Wow, I'm so surprised /s](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqo8pi/seeing_some_of_these_bug_reports/eo6cnk1/). Yes people, it's entirely possible that blizzard makes mistakes. The damage values actually were incorrect.

I'm just asking for a citation, it's not that difficult to provide one.

Don't know why you're being rude.

&gt;compensated for their time.
---
You voluntarily give you time. Just as you opted in for a completely voluntary test option on your account management page. If you don't want to help them test then don't. You can't also complain that you aren't being given access to the closed beta though, that's not how that works. 
---
You are not volunteering for a specific test, you are volunteering for any testing they may need. The key word here being **voluntary**. It's totally optional. They owe you nothing.

How is offering a legitimate response to someone already calling others spergs petty? lol like what, is this real life?
---
It mentions people not invited yet. To get a beta invite you have to be subbed so it does mention it just not directly.
---
Not having any way to know if someone has the experience necessary for a smooth run will ruin many an experience. I'd rather have an addon that allowed me to choose the best than rely on anything else.

PVP rewards ruined AV.  People who were there only for the sake of grinding out rank and rep ruined it.
---
just finished testing. it's 1 chance per cast not per mob.
---
i went to a low level spider cave and rounded up 10+ and then would aoe down. clearcast proced 8.75% of the time. the difference from 10% is just rng and the sample size. if it was per mob i would have seen 10X the number of procs.
---
Why are people so simple minded, if people wanted mass world pvp outside BGs there would be mass world pvp outside BGs.
---
If there is barely/no mass pvp outside bgs it's because people LOVE bgs you potato.
---
bgs offer balanced battles, the opportunity to show your pvp skills, enjoyable respawn mechanics, objectives.
---
What do you get with mass world pvp? 
---
\- A cluster of players engaging another cluster of players in a less-than-one-minute-battle
---
\- Corpse runs that last longer than the actual pvp aspect
---
\- Melee/Non-aoe/single-target classes/specs barely get to do anything.
---
pvp outside bgs is far from balanced.

Not a fan of it but I doubt it'll really make a difference in classic.  5 man dungeons and ubrs aren't nearly serious enough for anyone to bother checking that shit lol.  *Maybe* people use it somewhat for MC/ZG pugs, but again neither of those instances are that serious.  Plus those raids, especially MC, can take awhile to fill up since they're 20/40 man raids, so people will most likely just want to fill it up and at most have you come to the main city to get inspected by the raid leader.
---
Questie doesn't even matter.  People could follow guides for most of vanilla anyway.  Thottbot was used a lot.

you must not have many friends huh?

Wow, you went above and beyond my expectations of elaboration. Hahaha. Thanks baca. 
---
Devouring Plague seems pretty swell for keeping rogues out of stealth. That's a great point that you make.

Exit the launcher and execute it again, go to your WoW tab and select the game version and if you have a Beta it will appear there.

Best of luck dude

---
The real win if you get added to the test IMO. At least the stress test. Get to go on and fuck around, chat with other people ingame that are excited for the launch and maybe have some kind of mass pvp raid.
---
There's not a whole lot you can do to specifically stress test aside from just gathering large amounts of people for PvP. Would be fun if Blizz would arrange some GM magic to port people to gurubashi arena or something for huge PvP brawls. I figure that would stress the servers well enough. That being said though this seems like a test targeting layering functionality in starting areas.

I asked you to cite the Twitter posts.

We could if blizzard was not so concerned about revenue and more concerned about creating a lasting iconic tribute to one of the greatest cultural creations of our time
---
thanks man
---
Fair point, also thanks for reminding me of the existence of the awful mod. I remember when guilds required it for raiding...ugh.
---
Is anyone else bothered by the fact that in modern WoW (and Classic) flight path mounts remain (pretty much) level with the horizon for the entire journey, where as, back in the day they would pitch and yaw much more naturally?
---
Could LW [Red Dragonscale Breastplate](http://classicdb.ch/?item=15047). Almost as much +heal but you give up the stats. Worth not wearing a dress though

I'm glad you had fun with it!  I definitely didn't feel the rivalry as much but certainly had some fun wPvP moments as well

meanwhile in retail... [https://youtu.be/iz1\_DLm3mCk](https://youtu.be/iz1_DLm3mCk)
---
That might be a little extreme. I'm all for the Vanilla experience but we have to be realistic. I believe you can read about their decision for this version of AV if interested. Best to just be optimistic and keep a positive mental attitude!

i've played wow for 8 years. what is this?

Mostly fixes this unless you have a bunch of throwaway volunteers who are also competent enough to pvp if you don't need to dodge.

I checked the two addons code from the core.lua file earlier in diff checker. Literally the only difference in the code of the two addons is that he did find-&gt;replace 'LookingForGroup' with ClassicLFG.

---
Dual-Spec, LFG, Guild Banks, Summoning Stones, Achievements, Mage Tables, Soulwell, Raid-wide Auras, WoW Armory, Mobile Auction House, Barbershop, New Graphics &amp; Animations, Heirlooms - none of that exists and there's plenty more.
---
Class balance is not balanced. There are many specs and talents that are just outright garbage and never used. There's no such thing as druid or paladin tanks in end-game. Your rotations are much simpler, some classes cast one spell for an entire encounter.
---
Gold is harder to come by. You can't rely on quests to level. Leveling takes MUCh longer. Most of the gear that drops sucks.
---
look i'm excited for classic as much as the next guy but OSRS is a completely different game that gets new content.
---
OSRS is not classic's equivalent.
---
Yea I remember in vanilla I made tons of alts. In retail i haven't wanted to make an alt since i can't even remember because the levelling is such a drag.
---
lol
---
Well, it's a good thing we have the Auction House.
---
up until wrath, they need to fix their mistakes there
---
You can target with @name, that has been tested afaik.  Not sure if the limitation that prevents totems is in or not, hard to get people to test basic shit.
---
At the very least I will probably be naming my hunter pet the same as my character though.
---
devilsaur mafioso in shambles
---
Yeah I heard that SP's only get one raid spot. 
---
How do you gear a shadow priest?
---
I’m like super curious now lol
---
You mention the trinket, but I thought the vanilla trinkets didn't remove stun. Also, the racial for undead is disease if I recall correctly, which can be stone formed off.  I'm going off very old memories, my apologies if mistaken.
---
Not at all
---
No. It’s not. It’s content creators and vanilla players right now
---
Every class... but shaman, which gives warstomp some good value. Either one's going to be a good choice. Do you want to have racials that are more offensive of defensive focused?
---
I think you getting in disproves this.
---
Its content creators and random players there's no confirmation that vanilla players get special access.
---
AV was one of the most defining experiences of classic WoW. 
---
If it lasts 20 minutes, it's ruined.
---
Even if someone made an auto-matching group finder people would not use it in classic. You want to know who you are inviting to your group, not just take any random class. And even if they did, they would still not have the instant teleport functionality available, so it wouldn't actually make a very big difference in practice.
---
you got inv just now?
---
just play private
---
Yeah they had to kill boars in the no pvp zone because the no lifer would gank them otherwise. Great episode.
---
I’ve been talking to tons of people in game, I’ve yet to meet a single person with my situation
---
really hope blizzard finds a way to make [raider.io](https://raider.io) and that shit not work. anything thats used to gatekeep people like that has no place in vanilla
---
I hope they split them up, but they might keep them together to get WoW as high as possible 
---
And if they keep them together, it could also hide if one of them doesn’t do too well
---
There probably won't  be another NA closed beta wave until Friday.
---
Tomorrow will be Stress Test invites.
---
Wednesday and Thursday will be nothing because it's stress test days.
---
Friday is a big MAYBE.
---
Potentially we could be waiting over a week for more NA closed beta invites. (Different than stress test only invites.)
---
It's the equivalent of a major change in wow though. It fundamentally changed the game's economy.
---
Largely, yes. But there are also random invites so as to pick from the entire pool of the playerbase rather than JUST the players that actually experienced Vanilla in 2004-2007. That's why they had posted the 'Beta: Not a bug list'.

It won't last 20 minutes I can assure you.

I have 31 subscribers on YouTube and have never made a WoW video. Where's my invite lol
---
Fair point, you'd think with a stress test they would want as many people as possible but I guess if it's just one server (assumption) they prob have more than enough with subs. Bummer, I wanted to see the pretty lighting
---
It baffles me that there are people as stupid as you lol.
---
Probably yeah. I always think of 40 being the point where you have basically everything mount, most spells can fill a talent tree.
---
It's to prevent allies from griefing you
---
When I say compensated i’m talking about access to the beta after they participated in the stress test. This is my opinion and you’re entitled to yours as well.
---
Well hey if you don't want it i'll take it
---
Code is definitely legit, because it's just a fork of a BfA addon https://www.diffchecker.com/qZxY2wQT
---
It's a pretty good troll though tbh, I can respect the guy for it haha.
---
This edit makes it look like Horde won though...
---
Yes if you are against a dwarf rogue they can stoneform your DP, but that doesn't remove SW:P and therefore they are still in the same situation (talented SW:P is 24 seconds). The only thing that competes against an undead priest is an undead rogue due to WoTF and Trinket which can trinket the first fear, and WoTF the second so you are virtually unstoppable damage on the priest for a good 30 seconds.
---
I'm having a blast reading these comments, most of them sound like the exact stereotype of a wow player lmao, so much fucking autism in one thread. I love it.
---
Okay post some proof here because beta invites seem completely random at this moment. I've seen people on the beta that started in vanilla all the way to WOD.

I’m not a noob to WoW but I am a noob to the hunter class which is what I decided to main. I did research and figured a boar was the pet I wanted to go with but do hunters only take Kitty’s into dungeons because of their quick dps? Just wondering if I take my boar into a dungeon I’ll look nooby. Also do boars even have growl?
---
Even if this wasn't a joke and LFR grouping was indeed implemented via this addon, what exactly will be the point of it if you won't be able to AFK your way to free epics in Classic like you do nowadays in retail?
---
There is no way a group of 40 randoms without competent RL, setup, pre-bis gear and consumes is even gonna clear MC or Ony, by far the easiest Vanilla raids.
---
I understand, I just can't help but realise that they are going to add a shit load of people to the stress test. Letting them all access the beta as well would turn the beta into a bit of a clusterfuck. They are intentionally keeping that more sparsely populated for a reason.
---
If you think a “legitimate response” is you acting out like a typical internet bully then you got some re-evaluating to do

I might buy gold to buy epics off guilds if I can't fake being a social Chad this go-around, Otherwise there's no point to play. I'd rather not stream snipe girl gamers in pre-raid blues.
---
It's going to be a separate client you will install.
---
People just pop free action potions constantly, no need for freedom. At the very least it isn't an exclusive ability for alliance.
---
As for pvp racials horde has WOTF, orc stun reduction &amp; zerk, warstomp, &amp; if we're talking only pvp the horde Priest racials are far stronger with devouring plague(UD) and shadowguard+hex (troll).
---
Ally racials are more pve oriented. 
---
Bubble is stronk doe.
---
Classes changed a lot. However you would be able to get a hang of movement (so you won't be a keyboard turner) and setup some keybinds
---
Yeah I agree. I subbed 3 days before they announced you had to for beta. 3 months is a long time so I’ve been leveling for the heritage armors. If I had known you needed a sub for beta I wouldn’t have because it’s kinda scummy.
---
lmao.....
---
Start of cata wasn't too bad. Sucked they added flying to azeroth but was rather entertaining watching the wrath babies cry that they were wiping in heroics and only getting blues and ghostcrawler telling them to suck it up.
---
There are some people in that thread that says they do remember it as blizzard states it is.
---
The thing with classic is that one it is very old so for many people, with all the changes wow got over the years, everything is mixed up. Wishes vs reality is blurry. Also, private servers got a lot of shit wrong, but players assumed it was the real deal since their memory was too blurry. Both things together means we have people convinced that Blizzard is lying because they are certain that it was the other way around, but it is just their memory that is wrong.
---
It's such a known thing that it almost certainly must have worked at some point. There's no way private servers permeated far enough to mislead *so* many people into believing it was possible.
---
Fixed! oops :) Thanks!
---
i wish people learned who the best players were from the open world instead of the safety of their 40 man premade
---
Just read it and I have to agree in every word you say.  Quite sad as I was hyped for Classic
---
LOL U MAD DOoD
---
No one's mentioned it yet, but the costs for mounts. Your level 40 mount should be the same at around 100g, if I recall. However, I feel like the level 60 mount was something ridiculous like 5000g, and the best solo farms in the game were like 60-80g/hr. I cleared MC before I had my level 60 mount and I wasn't alone in that. It has an impact in battlegrounds which will last into the release of Naxx as you'll always have people with alternates and newer or more casual players making it to 60.
---
You’re right. I’ll be playing both 100%. I enjoy playing BFA but I also miss classic, so I’ll be going back and forth.
---
I'd rather group with newbies and guide them, because that's how you make friends :)
---
Sorry, they said no furries.
---
Probably nothing changed for live.
---
Will encourage TBC and WotLK servers in the future. I'd personally love another crack at TBC as a non-filthycasualchild.
---
If the balance really shifts (unlikely in the extreme), they might consider putting resources into a WoW2 with the older design mentality. Honestly though, blizz knows how cannibalistic their ip is and won't burn live like that unless they think it's necessary.
---
More realisticly there could be an effort to add endgame to classic after the fact with events surrounding old content. Eg. Releasing a heroic-esq system post-nax, adding triggered world bosses, or even borrow from GW2 (or anyone else that does this) and add in-game leaderboards n' such.
---
Tl;dr: support follows the consumers, if people sub for classic that will lead to support for that content.
---
I'm pretty sure there have been actual studies done on the second example you gave. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident
---
Not at the moment. Was regularly watching Jay back when I was still actively playing M+ a few weeks back. There's no better way to get better at something than studying someone who is really good at it.
---
I have 0 subscribers and a video of my cat playing fetch, still waiting on my invite
---
Well, the doomguard would have to be enslaved manually. What I'm describing is the [inferno](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Inferno) spell where the infernal is automatically enslaved after it arrives.
---
However, the infernal arrived as a hostile NPC, only becoming enslaved after the initial AOE blast. The point being that it's effectively a 200 damage AOE spell that hits everyone friend or foe that costs 50 silver with a one hour cooldown.
---
The bug was that you could basically hit anyone with 200 damage, so if someone was low health after a duel or simply low level, you could kill them despite being on the same faction as them. I had fun with it when I was 12 because I made the mistake of signing up for an RP realm not understanding what it was. Didn't want to reroll server after realising my mistake, so I basically terrorised the local ERP joints by killing the denizens mid-coitus with inferno.
---
Thanks for showing me perplexity's stream; he nearly killed me earlier and I was trying to find it. :P
---
Darn I must've missed that part :(
---
You really don't need to min max in vanilla.  If you do wanna minmax though, yeah you'll be wearing dresses for awhile in PvE.
---
That has nothing to do with the above comment. Youtube has a terrible monetization system that encourages people to make 10+ minute videos when most content can be relayed in half the time.
---
I like the POV at Nefarian's room, what a good angle.
---
Broooo you gotta put the Arcane Power in there.... that's like the best part I feel
---
I always hear "LOOK AT ME" in Heath Leadgers Joker's voice in my head.
---
Whoa hold up, a video of your cat playing fetch? Wow this thing is rigged, you should've been the first person in.
---
Haha this bug existed in vanilla too. Also there was a bug where yous stack the agi totem in 1kn.
---
i can't think of anything more useless than vanilla raiderio
---
how did this comment age? any news on new beta inviteS?
---
You said "citation please" to a post with multiple points, or perhaps were being cheeky and responding with "citation please" like you did to the original messages. That's how it read to me at least.    
---
Regardless, if this information is not enough to sustain your lust for 100% satisfactory proof of all things, then I apologize as that's impossible to provide! This data is as accurate as you will ever receive, and even in regards to the developer teams information.     
---
   
---
This information would be good enough for a large majority of users/readers/academics. The fact that you find it 'dubious' (trying to look bright again) and call them "statistics" with quotes, is a joke.    
---
&gt; I'm not even debating whether or not the game was doing poorly before content patches 
---
Well, you were! Quite smugly in fact. Until me and other posters stated that you were incorrect.  
---
This will be my last reply here because your massive intellect is unable to be satisfied with quantifiable and valid proof (feel free to use waybackmachine as well and search each date yourself!) from multiple angles that only seems preposterous to you.
---
Or you make friends by steamrolling content and getting World's First.
---
If you want to hold hands and sing, that's your prerogative. I'm sure there will be times where I enjoy helping lower experienced players too. But when I'm specifically running an instance over and over for some goal, I want efficiency and skill.
---
I used to 2 shot them with my hunter like dogs.  (Any thing in cloth actually)
---
I really hope they will make a way to transfer config from retail to classic.
---
This doesn't really have anything to do with Classic then and will probably be removed.  Infernals weren't a summons in Vanilla.
---
This one I am not sure on.
---
Part of me wants to agree with you, since I never used it.  
---
Part of me wants to disagree because I recall a patch that would trigger the cooldown of any trinket when equipped.  
---
Now I might be getting mistaken from the time they stopped SP on Use trinkets from stacking with eachother, and then people started swapping them out of combat to beat the cooldowns.
---
1) You can’t take a premade into AV.
---
2) What you’re suggesting doesn’t work. Say you have 50 on 50, but only 5 on each side are doing the heavy lifting. You’d never notice because it gets lost in the chaos. We used to take 10 guys into Ironforge and hold off people for like an hour in one of the shops (can’t remember which) until we eventually got bluewall overwhelmed. For the people who are actually really good, it really isn’t that difficult to overwhelm much larger groups in Vanilla.
---
That's a complicated question. Basically boils down to getting pre-raid BiS and then aiming for any non-set pieces you can snag, as well as an early Anathema. Then you try to snag Fel Infused Leggings from Kazzak if you're in a guild that can secure such kills, grab PvP gear when that gear releases, and really "do your best" until more damage stuff drops in AQ. SPriests are there for utility first and foremost, which means the scant amount of gear available to you isn't really much of a concern since you only get scant upgrades in the first place.
---
With Classic it will become a lot easier to gear in later phases. I secured my position in a progression guild because of my vast firsthand Vanilla experience, mostly. It's a hard knock life for a lot of people who hope to be as lucky.
---
That’s what I was thinking
---
horde scum.
---
Decursive I think was one. Then any raidframes mod with mouseover macro for flash heal. That's probably all you need.
---
BB and GZ guards were notoriously aggressive but safespotting was a thing in both cities
---
How do you stop gaining xp? Do you just camp the BG?
---
im alli and have to upvote this, touche.
---
this wont stop me from slaughtering you though sorry chap
---
I should clarify that by 'client' I meant the 'Server Client', as opposed to the 'Server Database'.
---
Questie is fine
---
Raider.io is lame
---
Any word on when it’ll be available for pre-download? I’m assuming before August 12th?
---
...Can we see the video of your cat? I got nothing else to do while I wait for the disappointment that is me not getting an invite
---
Until Blizzard says anything on the topic it would be healthy with some amount of scepticism. You are not more correct than they are, just throwing an opinion out there. Whether or not the values are correct will probably soon be revealed to the public.
---
Yes.  That is totem twisting.
---
Though you really only have to switch out WF and GoA most of the time. 
---
Honestly since you can't really shock when you raid it's not terrible
---
I can appreciate his reaction haha
---
It seems like it shouldn't be considered a bug since all the Warlock things were bastardy like that.
---
Blizzard usually let's you pre download about 2 weeks before release.
---
oH cOoL i CaN bE a DeMoN hUnTeR?!
---
It's a separate client. The beta is currently 7.62GB, but it might be smaller at launch.
---
someone already made a working questie for the beta:
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/questie/
---
The potential problem with a mega server, is it basically ends up being the same as sharding, and the community becomes too big to actually function like a community.
---
I would be curious if there could be some mechanic to mitigate this?
---
It varied by group/guild/server. Some rolled on the green/blue/epic items and didn't sweat the small stuff. Others would roll on the whole chest.
---
Chests only have BoE items, so sometimes people preferred to roll for the whole chest because almost everyone was saving up for a mount or an epic mount or raid consumables. So everyone "needed" a chest.
---
It does, somewhat. If you install uBlock Origin, YouTube stops becoming a revenue source for people, and therefore there are less 10:01 min videos.
---
no he doesn’t.
---
To anyone else reading this, I also have a question but don't feel like making a new thread.
---
What's the file size of Classic? I might need to clear some space lol
---
After seeing more people get in today I rushed home to check my bnet client only to be disappointed once again. 😔
---
This is why I have no friends
---
You've got to buy that bow I'm razor hill.its actually pretty good at that level
---
Ok good it isnt just me
---
I don't think pfUI is shitty, it's just doing the best it can with the vanilla API.
---
Whatever BFA has to offer currently is neither interesting nor fun IMO. I'd rather be level capped at 30 in the Beta because at least the game systems in Classic are more fun to me.
---
BFA was lackluster, and that's apparent by the amount of people not playing it right now over a 12 year old younger version of itself. 
---
The Battle for Arathi Highlands in the beta was what I expected to get from BFA when I got it. Instead, we phased out in groups that large and got Warfronts.
---
Classic is killing it right now, and the fact that it is doing so while people are capped at level 30 is telling.
---
The thing about rogues and engineers isn't true, that why we always "forgot my lock picking tools" then went and got it after the run. People wanted to roll for them too.
---
I mostly watch streams to learn stuff. People levelling and doing low level dungeons in classic isn't very interesting in that regard.
---
Yeah, no one really used meeting stones in OG vanilla.
---
&gt; when you have not enough silver to learn all necessary spells/abilities?
---
Where do you get that assumption from?
---
At the end of the run, I train 100% of skills, and then buy vendor armor for any unoccupied slot.
---
I move onto Westfall / Darkshore in a great place, gear and skills-wise.
---

---
Yeah people always have and always will jack your node while you're fighting. The more people see others not doing that the less likely they are to though. 
---
High level nodes though...black lotus, thorium, etc...are pretty competitive.
---
How long are these beta codes coming out for? Will it close after this stress test or is it going to persist for some time?
---
If you really want to min/max you could crunch numbers and do some googling, but you really can't go wrong with a cat / wolf / wind serpent for dps.
---
Your boar will have growl, and don't worry about looking nooby,  we're all going to look nooby with this gear lol
---
That would make sense. I’m not sure how we’ll be able to reserve our character names on the 12th without the proper client installed so they might release it around the 10th. Who knows though
---
Waaaah, I don't want anyone to be able to use something that's ALREADY in the game. This would simply add a GUI and chances are there is something in the works, this guy was obviously joking though.
---
Who cares if someone wants to help list people interesting in a dungeon that you are as well, it will just reduce spam in trade or world, the only thing it would do is add some sort of GUI instead of swimming through spam.
---
Np! If you've never seen some of his PVP videos, the guy is actually insane. Here's his Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/user/Purp1exity/featured?disable\_polymer=1](https://www.youtube.com/user/Purp1exity/featured?disable_polymer=1)

Yeah that's true

LUL, is that what you tell yourself?
---
I am happy as fuck I’m not the only person 😂
---
Dont know shammy at 60 so take this with a grain of salt BUT wouldnt chugging some mana pots allow totem twisting which should secure a spot for 1 enh shammy? I know I come off pretty harsh against meme specs but, quite frankly, I knew 3 people who were CORE in my guild that made meme specs work (feral druid OT, ret Pally and shadow priest) and I really would prefer people playing what makes them happy. Enh shammys are BEASTS in PvP
---

An actual masterpiece. I'm calling up Blizzard Support right now, the fact that you're not in yet is blasphemy. *These* are the kinds of content creators that should be getting in.
---
Exactly. 
---
Plus in the beginning of tbc there were already proper hardcore raiders and world first races (nihilum vs sk gaming?). And most raids had hard entry requirements (nerfed several times during the expansion).
---
Was affliction not good in Vanilla? I played an Affliction Warlock for over a year but I was also 14 and pretty dumb. All I cared about was that I could destroy my mate's mage :)
---
the issue is that groups will get non pvpers to sacrifice themselves to check the opponent
---
Fairly certain there was no NA wave today.
---
I haven't had a wow sub since like 2010
---
One I didn't see on here: LOOT THE DOG! Classic wow won't have whose loot it is on the tooltip, so make sure you try to loot everything when you're in a group or raid so the sparkles go away and nothing is wasted, particularly raid mats.
---
A follow-up to the ninja looter issue is some ninja looters ran groups with master looter on. Sometimes you might not notice until deep into the run that only one person I'd getting loot.

none of what you said addressed what i said
---
With that being said, would you be able to tell me about Shamans in vanilla? I remember playing one, it was my first character in WoW. But I never got above level 30 or so, because I had no clue what I was doing. Apparently shamans have a spot in each party of a raid, and elemental is fun in pvp?
---
RIGHT!!!!!!!!!  I'll let you piggyback off my invite, I'll say your a my co creator.
---
THEIR SERVERS CAN SUPPORT 20,000 ON ONE PROBABLY. 
---
No you're not gonna level. it's the wild wild west baby. Let them fight
---
Why? I think some lateral progression or some fresh content that sticks to the vanilla feel would be really nice. Opening up Hyjal, Emerald Dream, Karazhan, fixing Azshara, finishing the PvP areas that were cut. Stuff like that. Just adding more to the game, not adding a progression raid every month. Just filling out the world we already have more.
---
I got an invite.
---
So then you what, 9/10 people?
---
You NA?
---
Just EU wave today I think
---
1) hahaha yeah ok, nobody's ever manipped bg queues before.  2) u'll learn who's good when you see a R14, nobody cares who's top dmg in this particular AV.  oh wait that's right, top dmg in this AV isn't the best in AV, the best pvper in this AV is afk farming honor 24/7
---
I appreciate Joana's skill, but he's not a good streamer. There's just no personality or engagement there. 
---
When I do watch a streamer, it's for two reasons:
---
* Entertainment because I'm not currently playing.
---
* Sniping so I can chain sap them.
---
This doesn't explain everything. Only the Horde gets stoneskin totem so this doesn't explain why Alliance players report instanced elites in BFD for example being too easy.
---
I'm sorry if I was not clear enough.  
---
If that's as accurate as it's going to get, then I've no choice but to accept it, and, at this point, have no problem doing so. 
---
However, I'd just like to bring attention to the second dip, in the second graph you provided, do you know what contributed to that? I am interested in knowing. 
---
As well as other posts mentioning the G.E being a main driving force behind the player count rising, we already have the G.E in this game, so, if we're to experience a dip in players, it won't be because of that.
---
If anything, Blizzard should be using OSRS as an example of what to do, and what not to do.
---
As I remember, we all enjoyed TBC because the quests flowed much better. The questing hubs were pretty organized, they typically weren’t incredibly far from the mobs you needed to kill, and you often picked up an item along the way that started a return quest. Vanilla tended to not be as organized, such as having separate questgivers in both Theramore and Stormwind sending you to kill bosses in Scarlet Monastery or something
---
Dragonmaw had a curated blacklist with a group of people who heard both sides. It was taken quite seriously.
---
Only real disadvantage I can think of is just the initial travel time getting there otherwise do it up partner
---
Remember the name, by Fort minor. So much pvp was done to that song!

---
"u gon learn today"
---
Yes it's foolproof. For all they know i'm the cat
---
He does it as part of his stream (from what I gather). That’d be like if I got upset a Mario streamer stopped and watched a Nintendo Direct segment. It’s a silly thing to get upset over.
---
Thats like saying ive been playing fortnite am i ready for pubg
---
Lmao. At least you're honest
---
Just an EU wave.
---
And there likely won't be another NA wave until Friday at the earliest for PURE closed beta.
---
Reason?
---
Tomorrow the stress test invites will likely go out. Then the stress test Wednesday and Thursday. Friday MAYBE, but I honestly doubt immediately after the stress test there will be a closed beta invite wave.
---
I am feeling like it may be another week for an NA Closed Beta invite wave.
---
Yes, you could manipulate queues. The builds that did were generally the same guilds you’d see out in large numbers doing WPvP.  Additionally, there were plenty of terrible R14s, and people who cared about damage done and k/d ratios were also usually bad. I don’t see what you’re getting at.
---
Yes, you typically split them across all parties in a raid, and WF Totem in particular is going to be even more meta now after the Fury Warrior innovations on private servers.
---
Both Elemental and Enhancement are fun in PvP, though the latter is a bit random with when it gets WF procs. Enhancement is almost entirely unplayable in PvE, but Elemental can be marginally useful there. Most Shamans will, like the other hybrids, be healing-specced.
---

---
I think I found the reason you struggle to make friends
---
It was punishing as a warrior questing solo. You got 25% through a fight and pretty much knew if you were going to win or not.
---
Not sure if you’re being sarcastic, but in case you’re genuine, you didn’t get xp from BGs in classic.
---
He has my sub now.
---
Just do bgs (:
---
Yes I even have a photo of you playing wow.   https://i.imgur.com/R9Byes9.jpg
---
Hard to tell what he meant. I assume he meant do you just do bgs
---
Dude its all in good fun chill
---
Transmog has it's purpose, and I understand that, but looking cool in classic was a privilege earned through hard work. Lower level gear looked like shit. Looking cool was unique.
---
The only real issue is that if you pick a class that night elfs can play that humans can't, then there will be no class trainer in the starting area.
---
Basically, yes.  This was one of the things that made 19 twinking semi-interesting.  You couldn't turn off xp, so you'd have to calculate exactly how many Deadmines runs you could get away with to get your Cruel Barb or whatever.
---
Frankly I always hated twinking though, and was never a PvP fan anyway, so it never mattered too much to me.

This just reminded me of an old glitch / exploit that you could only do with this boat in booty Bay. You had to stand facing a certain direction on a specific part of the wooden beam of the sail and be feared by either an enemy player or in a dual with a friend. You would be shot off the boat at speed and either fly halfway through the world or be teleported to an unreleased land that is hidden under the deadlines instance.
---
The reason being that back then the boats weren't on the land and the way it was programmed was the location was actually tied to a duplicate boat at the location 0,0 and not where you were standing at booty Bay. it caused a lot of glitches and lots of fun.
---
*Okay, I think that's fair.  And if we can take AV from a patch prior to 1.12, I also kind of want Rogues to be like they were in 1.8.  And obviously 1.4 was best for Shamans...*
---
That's the can of worms you'd be opening.  They said they were going to take the game from 1.12 as faithfully as they could, and to that end, you have to respect their consistency.
---
Epic Mount is about 1k before rep discounts I think, not 5k. That was epic flying in tbc.
---
1k is still a lot in vanilla though.
---
All I want is like...highres versions of the original cinematics. (particularly the intro upscaled to 4k with remastered sound)
---
REMASTERED that's the word I was looking for, I want them REMASTERED.
---
When people complain about mob damage they mean they are getting hit for the same amount of damage as in vanilla.  So the stoneskin bug is relevant to that, you're just picking at semantics.
---
GOG.com (Good Old Games) makes lots of old games workable for newer systems.  Blizzard gave them the rights for the early Warcrafts recently.
---
&gt;At what point do I get to wear plate?

Questie is fine, gearscore addons shouldn't even be an option and we should immediately shoot this down since gearscore REALLY does not matter.

Valid point. More WoW is better than higher graphics WoW.

Ehhh, it's from the episode before last, generally speaking that's long enough. Plus it's not *super* spoilery, without context it probably wouldn't make much sense really.

I'm almost positive I remember you were not able to. Especially considering poly regens their health, so they wouldn't want you sheeping someones mob and having the health get regened.

---
So? are we playing world of dressup dolls, or do we care about stats that make our player better?
---
No, but it may be in a few years. 
---
I'm not sure what Blizzard's true plans are for Classic. 
---
Do they really intend to just leave Classic as is, or are they just saying that, so as to not piss people off. 
---
I don't think it will be much different from OSRS, in that, people will get bored, eventually. 
---
It's inevitable. 
---
Sure there will always be the people that can find enjoyment out of the same patch, eternally, but I'd wager that it's not most.
---
You can't select multiple units.  I could never get into it (probably because I had WCII first)
---
A good UI addon and decursive. I don't know what UI addons to use for Classic though, on private I have Luna unit frames which is amazing because it has built in cast over macros, click casting, incoming heals, super customizable, but it won't work on Classic.
---
Yes because it certainly wasn't a thing in vanilla. People were more than happy to just carry you through naxx or take you along to rank 14 farming premades in full greens...
---
Okay, and so what it comes down to is having to heal as a hybrid in vanilla, regardless of the hybrid class. 
---
My buddy is going to play a warrior, and it would be fun to keep him up in PvP so he can wreck everyone. Seems like a healer priest is the way to go, and just ignore shadow priest all together.
---
Hunters probably have the least competition for gear. If it's a bow, crossbow, or gun, it's only hunters. If it's chainmail agi or AP gear, it's only hunters. Their biggest competition will be a couple of items that rogues and warriors are after, which are few and far between.
---
This is 100% what I would do if I was deciding on a new class. Blow many buttons on my rotation at endgame is all I care about anymore tbh . Thanks bro!
---
The question is who makes that decision. If it's in Blizzard's power to veto that I strongly suspect they will since having WoW as a package deal up high is far better for them than having Classic up there and retail with no viewership. Optics and all that.
---
How do you live?
---
* Ruined economy at lower levels
---
* Never win at any open world event (Arena trinket, AQ opening) as they will have 40 people helping them with whatever they need 24/7
---
* Heavy faction imbalance
---
* Server lag as 100's of level 1's are swarming the streamer in capital cities
---
That's just off top
---
Drake talon pauldrons, chromatic boots, flameguard gauntlets, lionheart helmet. Just to name a few choice pieces. CANT WAIT.
---
Yeah OP is wrong.
---
I disagree. Just make a bank alt and get them to level 5.
---
Make them your Enchanting char.
---
Level skinning and herb first then once you either hit max or get your mount go back and do the others if you want
---
I saw this dude soloing in wetlands bu the murlocs and I'm lvl 23. I stealthed my gnome rogue ass and he looked for me for a few min. Had no idea that was a streamer. 
---
Glad I didnt get ganked in front of 6000 people
---
Now you, you are true OG
---
Right, it would absolutely only be for greifing or for saving someone about to die.  Glad to have input from someone that played it, cheers.
---
I got 2 really salty hate-PMs from some very sensitive people here. 
---
So i’m not sure if everyone here is in the right mindset of “good fun”
---
mage or lock is probably your best bet
---
Wasn't hyjal not a thing until cata? Also you can't fly so might be hard to glitch like before.
---
Yeah, at the time, I didn't think it was much of a problem either because infernal and ritual of doom cost 50 silver or 1 gold (for demonic figurine) which wasn't a small amount of money in vanilla + the 1 hour cooldown. Full of flavor given the effort it takes to summon, learn the spell and then coupled with the fact that it eventually leads to running from it yourself.
---
Its going to be unplayable until someone brings back the equipment set mod.  Second best thing to transmog.
---
I was a rogue and I carried around so many sets of gear for varying 'today I'm going to look like a pirate' when I wasn't actually needing to be kitted out for a dungeon or whatever.
---
I had a set that was basically a lovely purple dress, trinkets, neck, rings, weapons, hat, gloves that I used for battlegrounds when I was feeling particularly like goofing off.
---
IKR.  I was trying to make these macros on retail because I forgot they gutted it in wod or legion or whatever.
---
You used to be able to go Bear-&gt;Bear to break roots without getting stuck in caster.
---
Bro I'm over here reading some wholesome classic tips, not tryna' have an existential crisis. D:
---
Why are you trolling
---
Have we figured out if you need a sub yet to be considered?
---
I was a noob too and I had the time of my life not knowing anything : D.
---
However if you want to be a competitive noob you can start with a leveling guide, then a pve rotation guide to maximize your dps/healing/tanking, and finally tons and tons of pvp guides and pvp experience in order to get good at pvp. And since you wont play private, then you will have to wait to do all of this till release!
---
Yeah, that's the usual outcome. SPriest is in a rare position. You can also sometimes get one OT Feral Druid, and rarely an Elemental Shaman. Enhancement and Balance (or Prot/Ret for Alliance Paladins) are just not going to show up in an optimized raid environment, and of the three specs that sorta kinda maybe show up, SPriest is the only one with a semi-regular position.
---
Of course, if you're not trying to be part of a progression guild and just want to raid casually instead, then casual guilds are more willing to let in offspecs.
---
Ok Cartman
---
Me too man haha
---
Ahh I had forgotten the 'town set'. You are totally right, equipment sets were a QOL addition, that didnt take away from the glory of your real set of armor by having a goofy ass town set. I, myself, dressed in classy clothes while about the town.
---
Parents.
---
did you understand the post? it's saying people in groups of 20 shouldn't be allowed to roll solo queuers
---
Fuck outta assface crooked nose windbag shit eating tiny balled weiner nose dumb dumb mcjabroni
---
This could be a bug or intentional, since they decided that they're using the 1.12 stats for items that are on the loot tables early on, but disabling items drops and quests for later gear until a later phase.
---
Of all the things I feel nostalgia for, this is one that I fear.
---
No the original comment was. Yours did not come off that way lol
---
? They didn't say that being Crit while sitting is a bug. They said this:   
---
&gt;Being critically struck while using /sit to sit does not cause abilities like Enrage, Blood Craze, and Reckoning to activate.
---
Now it SPECIFICALLY SAYS when doing the command and being Crit doesn't proc those abilities. Just like the other person said it's a BUG for it to be happening in classic. Which it is based off what they're saying.           
---
There's nothing saying you shouldn't be Crit when you use /sit
---
N O S H O E S
---
Soooooo raid on hogger?
---
Mage for sure. Although rogues can do some gold grinds as well.
---
There are some really good guides on YouTube posted by Frostadamus I would highly recommend
---
oh man, when the warlock summoned an infernal it was always hilarious to me because eventually we'd have to fight the damn thing ourselves
---
I miss that
---
This is great. A+
---
All the races can go everywhere.
---
Hunter
---
Is this like some circle logic? You consume the gnome to become part gnome then when you kill the alliance they, in the end, were killed by a gnome?
---
It likely won't work unless you have the add-on installed. Therefore don't install it and it won't make a difference.
---
The only way this sort of add-on works is if it's massively popular. Which it probably won't be since the classic community generally hates gear score type shit. Me included
---
They SAY walljumping will be limited or whatever but who knows. Oh man I forgot about the ZG one. I came across that without realizing it was a thing back in the day and legit thought I had discovered something new hahah. So much fun
---
I'm not trolling.  60 Druid Warsong 2004-2006. 60 Dwarf Priest 2018-2019 Private Server.  The game is boring, you grind to get the best gear onbly to replace that gear 2-3 times then you either pvp or attempt naxx.
---
Mage by a mile
---
Ahhh. How old are you if you don’t mind me asking.
---
Rag was such a gloriously stressful intense fight. He was so terrifying and huge
---
ur dumb lul
---
Hunter for sure. As far as what race, go with what looks coolest to you!
---
68 for druids, 70 for everyone else.  To learn the skill.
---
58 to have someone drop out of the sky and gank you.
---
To be ganked by someone with a flying mount, yes.
---
To compete with someone on a flying mount for nodes, yes.
---
As long as loot priority hasnt been changed by party leader you will get a roll for anything green or better automatically.
---
However you /roll for other important things in the chest like materials, potions, scrolls, etc.
---
Yep.
---
The guy said we think we do but we don't.  Well he was right.
---
I'm the only one with the courage to say, "We thought we did, and we never should've tried."
---
I’d advise against it for the sole reason that Darkshore is one of the best zones to level in from 11-18 or so. It’s basically the barrens of the alliance. 
---
If you level in the human starting area, you may find yourself running back.
---
This is me. I'm a little salty I need to start my subscription early August just so I can make my character names.
---
You forgot about tribe ! God tier warrior as well !
---
This guy on another thread said he has been invited today, he's NA. 
---
u/arinad
---
shaman tank!
---
I don't have any idea what my plans for raiding will be. All I know right now is that I don't want to hit level 60 and regret a decision that I made at character creation. Hahaha.
---
Someone was talking about racial pvp trinkets in vanilla, is that a thing?
---
Anonymous trolling isn’t courage.
---
In pve Hpal’s wear a cloth robe for a really long time. In pvp you can wear the plate pvp gear.
---
Going to have to agree. It's pretty much not a debate for 1v1.
---
The game didn't need the complexity in the class design because the rest of the game was fun.
---
Yep! I'm an RPer, so I also had traveling clothing and exploration clothing. 
---
I only looked like a clown when I actually needed to do damage/not die! (and even then, for the most part, it wasn't too hard as a leather wearer to find gear that looked relatively good together. Full travelers greens was a set I was in for awhile. There was another green set from the low 50s I forgot what it was called but it looked pretty good too if you could find all the pieces. Black with silver buckles all over it.)
---
Clothies and mail wearers though....a lot less cool options.
---
Although TBF even the tier sets for hunters are ugly.
---
Mine was 4gb. I already had BFA installed but not sure if it makes a difference
---
Any chance you can scan and upload this? Would love to read it again after all this time.
---
Think it was good in PvP.  Wasn't as great for leveling as it was in TBC, and wasn't good in PvE due to things dying too fast in 5-mans and limited debuff slots in raids.
---
Imo rogues are the best.
---
You can pickpocket, you can stealth solo farm bosses, you can stealth mine instances, and when you are in the open world, you have ways of escaping ganks.
---
In one of the interviews a dev gave an example of 20/30 'hypothetically', but I wouldn't be surprised if it was somewhere around there. 8-12 seems ridiculously low. We are going to have Q times up the ass even after the tourists leave
---
Vanilla player and never got very into TBC although it was really cool. HFP is so awesome, but I personally didn't enjoy the other zones much. WOTLK felt like a return to old style zones for me. Plus ICC was such a great raid.
---
The dailies....I was not fond of
---
Loads of people will say mage for open world AOE farming and potentially DM lashers etc. but honestly if it's gold per hour you want, hunter farming for farming mara in phase 1 and DM in phase 2 is going to blow mage out of the water. Mara is like 50-60g per hour with the potential to sell the prebis ring to players for a bit of extra gold. DM runs is easily 100g+ per hour.
---
A bit late to the party, but
---
Please loot your mobs, primarily beasts that can be skinned.  So sad seeing a ton of dead bears that that can't be skinned because the person who killed them didnt feel like looting it.
---
I remember aggro range in vanilla was HUGE. especially when it's higher level than you. Even the roads are not safe in a higher level zone.
---
Yea I know what is happening, I played original when it happened, and I played TBC arenas when it happened there too.
---
I have even seen this video before.  You lack the comprehension here bud.  
---
There are two main ways, spying on the enemy, and sending in a sacrifice.  
---
Both are stopped in the same way, if you refuse a BG pop, full team deserter.  Solved.
---
The real pros would figure out that you can dodge this situation by alternating.  Only queue after the opposing group is in a game, unless the faction imbalance is massive and all your opposition is on the other side, you come out ahead.
---
Ugh I hear you, I main a Hunter in BFA, and loooove to transmog to old tiers on any character. I 100% avoid the early tiers on my hunter. Not on my warrior or priest though!
---
Only on moon guard
---
People who haven't gotten a beta invite be like...
---
Here I am with the TBC one like a sucker...
---
Welcome to MMOs though you're probably trolling
---
Race doesn't really matter but hunters and their pets generally have a pretty good time traversing the world solo.
---
24 days ago you posted in a classic post about how much time you would spend playing the game when it released. Your reply was "24/7 unless its maintenance" what changed in those 24 days?
---
I love people like you, makes me feel better about myself. ty
---
Are those weird robots still there?
---
Just go back to BfA.
---
The argument against transmog was to see what players had achieved at a glance, but you're literally forcing people to look a certain way for your perceived benefit, when really there is no benefit. 
---
Xmog only let's you wear gear you've got, and if I wanna run around with my tier pieces xmog'd into early level greens at level 60 or whatever then I should be able to do that, because the way my character looks is my decision and has nothing to do with anyone else lol
---
Too many mages omg
---
Whatever you want to play.
---
Racial, no. Class, yes. [The PvP trinkets in Vanilla only removed three of the six major CC debuffs based on your class](https://i.redd.it/30945jrk22y21.png), and none removed Sleep (a fringe benefit of WotF in that you can break free of a Survival Hunter's Wyvern Sting).
---
Other than the intro where the nature bull was a badass and a bro... this is why I love Tauren.
---
You look huge and if you don't like getting targeted it's not the race for you. 
---
Orc is the best for PVP hands down
---
*Add me on bnet*
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
You literally just asked him to "1v1 me bro"
---
Sorry, I edited my original question when I noticed my error about the racial - class thing.
---
Thanks! I've heard so much about Tribe but I always end up watching the other APEs instead for some reason. Will definitely give him a watch. Added to the post.
---
I am truly not hating on Transmog. It has been a good addition to an evolving game, and it will never be taken from current wow.
---
THAT being said, I do miss the days of your characters look, goofy or not, meaning something. Call it Nostalgia I guess
---
guilty
---
Players will fluctuate a lot. When retail releases a new patch people will play that. When classic releases a new phase, people will play that. If classic has more players than retail on average, then they will continue adding TBC servers and so on, and most likely borrow a lot of things people like in classic for future retail development. Maybe they will have some more innovative ideas for classic like adding new end game content or seasonal servers, that sort of thing, we will see. 
---
&gt;Someone please correct me if I'm wrong--and I would love to see numbers and proof. But I am fairly positive that Modern WoW has an all-time low active player count. It is trending down.
---
There are no numbers, Blizzard stopped releasing that a long while back. We only know roughly how many has bought BfA. But yeah, WoW is almost certainly on an all time low, since it hasn't really had any new players for several years now, it's slowly draining out. But a lot of old players still come back to the game when a new expansion releases for example, so it's nowhere close to dying (becoming unprofitable) yet.
---
Tips suggested it might be devotion aura and Esfand kind of refuted it but i mean it can be possible that the character sheet is wrong.
---
16fps.  200 ping.  Vanilla checks out.
---
It’s not mandatory at all, it’s just that if you’re min maxing strictly for pve healing there are some better pieces. You’re totally fine just wearing the paladin tier gear. I raided all of vanillas raids and we never made our paladins wear cloth / leather.
---
Screenshot from Sept 2016. Hunter pet is under the hunter on the left.
---
https://i.imgur.com/uSr0A6l.png
---
exactly. the best part about classic wow is going out and finding new friends and learning who the people are on your server.
---
So the faction rivalry come back when there's nothing to do at max lvl?
---
nice.
---
Cringe
---
A++
---
This physically hurt me.
---
Tauren if you want to look secsy
---
Orc if you want to pvp
---
Troll pve
---
Once again Tauren is sexy as hell
---
If anything you'll be more likely to get in the beta. Especially if you submit an actual bug.
---
DM farm wont work because the instance reset macro doesn't work like private servers
---
YEET!!!!! Good shit
---
DMX here we go again
---
Im the scatman
---
It was so much the opposite of boring for me that I still play wow.
---
Yeah it's weird.  I swear I remember polymorph griefing in eastern plaguelands when gold farming.  The classic database also implies that you can't banish or mind control tapped mobs either.  But if they are certain about it I'm good with it.
---
One of the better responses Ive gathered.... mainly lets just say I played Shaman as an example. Would the early game remain the same (cause obviously late game is going to be crazier, and different), or would I change completely from the get-go? Im going to watch some streams for different classes, and judge the differences. Hoping for that beta invite ;-;
---
Well its to the point. thanks
---
Part of me to this day is unable to reason how they managed to keep an AoE Racial silence that gave free-resources to the player in the game for as long as it was.
---
You could reset instances in vanilla. Why wouldn't you be able to do the same now?
---
probably just population difference, there's a few oce people with beta
---
&gt; Logic
---
I mean, you’re talking to the guy that rolled on the faction with scoliosis and over-compensation issues. Logic doesn’t apply there.
---
I don't play either, so Im not quite sure how to respond to that XD
---
Being r14 doesn't mean you're good tho
---
Can you imagine if this entire classic client thing just turns out to be the greatest gas-lighting experiment of all time.

It's meant to test servers for launch so we have smoother launch, no one is forcing you to do it, but we all know you will if you do get the "invite"

All alliance races should level in darkshore from 12-21 with a bit of loch modan and redridge mountains from 17-20
---
Hey, man people can play both and mix up memories 14 years later when trying to provide feedback to make sure the game they love is as accurately made as possible.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w
---
Much better with the video.
---
Had two on Lightning’s Blade that were legend. Zyk and Zya.
---
Yeah I hear you man. I get that the current BFA version requires a sub, there have been a lot of fixes/new content and server up keep to pay for. However, classic is just that classic. An original state of the game, which they are phasing out to drag out interest but nonetheless there is no new work being put into the game/content being created. I do not see why I should have to pay the same amount for it monthly as I would if I cared to still play BFA. I just want that original game as it was to enjoy and I wish it was either a one time purchase price (ESO style) or a lesser sub fee like 5 dollars a month. 18 dollars CAD a month to play a game which is not new, not getting updates or work put into it? Does not make sense, there should be an in between here for folks like me who would come back for classic but do not wish to pay the same price as those who actually play regular wow. I do not think this sentiment is ridiculous. If it gets downvoted what ever, I am just expressing my opinion.
---
sweet now I can disrupt the AOE solo mage with fear and not worry about him trying to sheep my target as payback!
---
Ah, god forbid people want to play optimally instead of a way others want to play
---
Sorry I'm racist against non warrior tanks
---
I remember when this sub was just starting out, and everyone was so excited. Cool to see it come together with a huge playerbase. Wish we could get a 100k flare, or something. :o
---
In the old days, copy protection consisted of looking up phrases or words in the manual. The software would request a particular word which pretty much ensured you had to have the manual, which oftentimes was on “copy proof” paper. It was a way of trying to reduce piracy.
---
Damn. That’s awesome. It looks like I’ve definitely found something to pass the time until classic then. Thanks stranger!
---
They arent passing out stress test invites to people like you anyways. So you have nothing to STRESS about :)
---
LET ME IN
---
I didn’t say only vanilla. I say definitely wasn’t.
---
&gt;  all the #nochanges people will cry about it
---
  How's getting the original AV a change?
---
You only have to make it to IF
---
thankfully two hours is enough for me to dink around the character selection screen/kill a few mobs and feel out what class I want to play :D
---
What would you call the Warden Staff?
---
The only gatekeeping allowed in classic is to line up in Ironforge for gear inspection like real neckbeards.
---
98.6k viewers in total from that screenshot

GoT Spoilers are all over reddit. Chances are if you’re a reddit user, it’s spoiled.
---
You are not always suppose to have a smooth run.
---
It isn't mandatory to reply when you have nothing to say.
---
Dwarf Hunter
---
Yeah windfury is what makes the build viable.
---
That's a prison purse for their money.
---
Also, this was super helpful! Thanks!
---
So to cap it off, an Undead Priest would make a better pvp healer than a Troll because WotF fills the gap in your defenses, and having to re-cast Shadowguard a lot (only 3 charges) would take up too much time that I could be spending healing people. Cannibalism also seems super helpful, could possibly use after a fear or something to regain some hp. Does that seem about right?
---
Dude yes! This exactly. They have MORE than enough money to support the classic game servers for free even. But we are not asking for free, we are asking to PAY them again an upfront cost like other MMOs (ESO) to play just that experience and people just shit on us for it. People who do not play wow anymore because of the directional changes do not want to pay the sub fee which is in place for the regular game just to play the old game. You wrote it out very nicely and I could not agree more! Thanks for the input!
---
Maybe you guys should make a "Already fixed buglist" so you can diminish the amount of already-fixed bug reports you get to better get down on fixing bugs.
---
I believe that many people are recommending Hunter since with a pet you are very strong solo. My alternative recommendation is Druid. With Druid you're your own self healing tank and you have the option of stealthing through tough areas. Finally there are some areas where the swim form is very useful.
---
But really any class works.
---
Yeah I always did greed on everything for the money, if you need it then need it. 
---
Also, every group I ran rogues would unlock chests and we would still roll, is that not common?
---
I would rather not see either one of them.
---
No thanks. You don't own Classic. I can play it how I want.
---
This is one of the most brutal and real replies I have read this week, and I am subscribed to /r/freefolk.
---
The Honourable Alliance will once again lock shields to defend the realms of Men, Dwarf, Gnome and Elf against the abominations sent forth from other worlds.
---
Bring forth your Horde, it will be met with the holy light. Judgement shall pass.
---
Yes, please.  It makes reading the quests likes so much easier.  I guess if it doesnt get ported I might look into learning some LUA(?) and trying to port it myself.
---
If you have a guild bank account. They don't exist by default.
---
Exactly this. Everyone has their “but what about X” issue that they want to be a certain way. If 1.12 AV is a deal breaker for you, sucks to suck.
---
&gt; Also, every group I ran rogues would unlock chests and we would still roll, is that not common?
---
Did you also roll on every skinnable mob and ore/herb node?
---
Lockpicking/Blacksmithing/Engineering is a profession. One of the benefits of that profession is having access to locked chests.
---
If you can't open it, you don't deserve a roll.
---
Are we going to have long ass maintenance every Tuesday or is that a thing of the past ?
---
I contacted support, and they told me specifically that you could get invited to the beta without a sub, but had to have one to actually play. Are they pulling my leg, or ???
---
You can reset instances, but you can't use a macro to reset it, camp, and then get kicked to the entrance
---
Take a guess. :P
---
Probably, then they'll extend the level cap in the beta and the hype will be back.
---
Ahh yes the old nights of Rez Runs.  Literally taking the shortest path to a new zone through a level 50+ area when you were level 22.  Ended up spending a large portion of the evening running through deady zones and getting stuck in places like impassible areas in mountains.
---
Eventually you take the sickness and hearth to town.
---
That’s honestly a really good way to look at it.
---
They did at least tell you that there was an instance nearby if you didn't know otherwise.
---
Bingo
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
If I want smooth runs always, yes I am. I don't have to adhere to your playstyle. If I want to use a LFG addon, I will. If I want to use addons to more easily inspect a player's gear and experience before inviting them to a group, I will. If I want to exclude players from my groups that don't use these addons, I will.
---
No, I argued that Troll is better than Undead as a Holy Priest. Shadowguard has an internal cooldown of a few seconds anyway, so you're not, like, spamming it every three seconds. Devouring Plague is useless for a Holy Priest, and Hex can be decent in team battles.
---
But yes, Cannibalism is a useful racial. And frankly, in the end this is splitting hairs. You're not going to encounter too many situations where you categorically lost a fight or entire BG because you picked the wrong Priest race. Player skill, teamfighting capabilities, and teamcomps all matter more than racials. For me the choice is simple: Undead is a cooler race with better art assets, a better storyline, better starting zones, better-looking gear, and less grating voice acting (Trolls are fun for a while, but the hammed up Jamaican accent can get *reallllly* irritating after long periods of exposure). But if you don't care at all about those things and also think you're going to be healing in both a PvE and PvP capacity, then I think Trolls very slightly edge out in the min/maxing department.
---
Yes, but the problem is the evidence that is used to support their theory. People use videos such as a warrior using berserker stance and compare it to Asmongold when he uses defensive stance. I wouldn't mind Blizzard double checking, but it seems pointless to me.
---
Just torrent it.
---
fucking normie
---
Talking Druid and these are all available at launch and are better than anything in even Naxx.
---
What would you call the Warden Staff, Lv43 best tanking weapon in the game?
---
What about the Mark of Tyranny, Lv55 blue best tanking trinket available at launch.
---
What about Smoking Heart of the Mountain, Lv35 craftable blue best in slot also.
---
What about Wolfshead helm, Lv40 craftable blue that's best in slot Feral DPS forever?
---
Explain what MCP is doing so different that makes it bad game design.
---
Holy crap he's not recovering from this actual bombardment of insults. You had him at "windbag" but the "dumb dumb mcjabroni"... That was overkill.
---
Maybe a really dumb question, but will we need a sub just for the stress test? I'd like to help but not going to sub until August.
---
The difference between the two is no one paid a ticket for the ride in classic, it just happened organically.
---
They should open the beta up more and let us test it. Streamers do very little actual testing as their attention is divided across a ton of stuff. It's counter productive for the end product we all want. Let us in, Blizz, c'mon!
---
And if you’re flying to your destination?

"I disagree with you, therefor you have nothing to say"

nice

I would love to see this but then it would make the already horrendous honor grind even worse. Quite frankly, that is the only reason I can see to leave it in such sorry shape. Absolutely nothing beats the back and forth, feeling sad when I finally run out mana healing those who would struggle holding mid against all odds. Each brave alliance player falling beneath the pitiless, inhuman weapons of the horde while my Dwarf struggled heroically on. Screaming defiance literally in the face of an oncoming horde of Horde. Dying valiantly, dying with honor. Logging off tears of frustration rolling down my e-beard vowing vengeance and holy hell in my heart. Coming back from work while I ignore the whines of my soon departed girlfriend while I log back in and see the same name of those same heroes who stood with me against all odds. A hearty laugh, a pat on the back and back in the fray with the echoes of FOR THE ALLIANCE ringing from every peak. That is the real AV
---
Now it's the neutered who can get to the commander race of poop that, quite frankly, fills me with scorn. Where is the glory? Where are the names of those heroes who, against all odds, would spit their defiance in the maw of the ravening Horde? Where is the HONOR?!?
---
Okay, that's a good point. Additionally, you said that the only source of sleep is from hunters. Is there a limit to how many people I can use Hex of Weakness on?
---
Actually 100% hot guys
---
The only way to get "authentic similar experience" would be to erase everyone's memory.

Understand the mindset now?

Only have two hours though. Not enough time to get to 5 with crowded zones and run somewhere contested

---
....what guilds "required it" ? It only worked for like 3 or 4 weeks before blizz broke the functionality.

Some don't obviously

Yeah it's super fun trying to find a raid guild when you have to account for your raid start time changing for half the year.

History: I been playing wow since vanilla however barely raided in Vanilla as I was 13 back then and my parents had me on strict curfew lol. Have played through all expansions of wow except the current expansion which imo sucks terribly. I want to play a mage which has been my first wow character back in vanilla and was my main class in most expacs(others being lock/hpal). Very experienced wow player especially in pvp, with 2.4k+experience in 2s and 3s and High Warlord/Hero of the horde. Looking to get into serious PVE for classic and I can guarantee to play at highest level of skill for my class. I am looking a guild that will be able to clear all pve content up to and including nax. I do not care for getting world or server firsts as I still have a full time job/studying/etc and can't play the game for 15hours a day anymore like I did back in college.
---
People like me (The ones who paid $15 to renew their wow sub strictly for a chance to play the BETA) do not wish to waste our times on a 1 day level 1-5 STRESS TEST, we want the full BETA. I dont care for participating in the stress test if there is no sort of beta access afterwards. And btw, i'm dead center in the target market for someone who is eligible to receive a stress test inv ;)
---
Was just about to jump on eso for the first time ever since I don’t have a beta key. 😂
---
Oce players have gotten beta invites.
---
Blessing of Kings, Free Action Potion, Minor Speed Enchant on boots, Linken's Boomerang.
---
Late 20’s? 26?
---
What about rep loss? (Discount when buying mount) or will this not get high enough to earn discount soely by leveling the start zone(s)?
---
Ok at least there's still hope

---
It’s he only thing I have until 8/27 lol
---
Do you have to be subbed?
---
As someone who played starting in vanilla and quit in WotLK I'm going to say no. The game now is completely different from how it was even in WotLK. WotLK was almost unrecognizable from vanilla.
---
You will literally learn nothing and, to be honest, I think you would ruin the experience for yourself. The retail version today is so watered down. You can hit level 60 in no time where as, in vanilla, you're looking at 6-8 days /played to hit 60.
---
The people in the beta aren't using the best builds and all this other shit.
---
9am Thursday east coast Aussies.
---
This right here. Great farming class and damn good in PvP
---
How do I delete someone else's post?
---
Who cares at this point? GoT has become a meme because it was finished so badly.
---
Ratchet - fight!
---
The rest if the game was fun absolutely! But, why cant the class design be fun too then? Pressing one button rotations isnt fun or good design no matter which way you spin the narrative. Neither is having some specs being next to useless. That's just my opinion anyway - which I understand isnt that popular with the community.
---
Honestly I would just recommend watching some videos and getting a feel for the start of vanilla from that rather than trying to get anything from retail. It just differs in too many ways. Even more so for Shaman. It would almost ruin your experience!
---
I know achievements were meant to fill some of that void, however if they wanted it to be something you can do when you're not raiding or PVPing, then it needed to not have achievements for raids and PVP.
---
I wouldn't mind achievements as a sort of side quest system at max level. I also don't mind gear as progression; they just needed to find other ways to get good gear that required equivalent effort/dedication.
---
Not that I'm aware of, no.
---
And I believe only Wyvern Sting produces humanoid Sleep effects in PvP (though WotF can be useful in some PvE situations). Hibernate is also a Sleep spell, but it only works on Beasts (aka Hunter Pets and shapeshifted Druids).

---
Welcome to Toxic!
---
We are a North America based guild playing on Alliance. We will roll on a PVP server when they announced names.​
---
We are a semi-hardcore (we will lean more hardcore towards the start) U.S. raiding guild and have been playing together since April of 2015. We have raided mainly Vanilla content, but have delved into TBC and WOTLK as well. We run a 9 Hour raid week. Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Mondays are the focus of our main group. Before enough content is available, or enough alts to do more than one raid, raid times will be used for focus farming or remaining dungeon gearing. We look forward to having a stronger PVP presence in Classic compared to our Past. We look at skill, attitude, and gear/dedication to character in that order. We do not carry dead weight or people who clash with the guild.
---
While we take the game and the experience very seriously, we are realistic about our capabilities. The majority of us are in our late 20’s to early 30’s, maintain a full time job, and take care for our families. Wow has been a cornerstone in many of our lives for the past 14 years. While we are always pushing to do the new content, we do not leave our friends behind. The best part of wow that we all cling to over the many years we played is friendship and the relationships we make along the way. We are a gaming community with Wow being the focus of all of us!
---
Here at Toxic, we hope to bring a different type of guild from most. We want to be tight-knit, supportive of each other, not afraid to point our friends to become better; we encourage friendly competition; we look for members going out of their way to assist; we want to be that old school fun guild that doesn't feel like a job, but rather a community of friends who want to kick a little ass! I will put a lot of effort into bringing very popular posts and guides into a central location on our website ([http://toxicgaming.us/](http://toxicgaming.us/)) to allow for your focus to be on the game, rather than trying to research how to best play your class, or where to go to level a profession.
---
Our Leadership:
---
Our leadership has experience leading in all retail walks of life up: from Vanilla up to and including the Draenor expansion. The guild leaders, Pronator &amp; Michaelfox, have been around since the game was first released in 2004. They have experienced all end game raids during their prime.
---
Loot System:
---
Loot Council- The Loot Council will be made up of class ldeaders, and a random rotation of regular raid members. We will do a prioritized loot system where we are distributing the loot in the most fair way possible, based on BIS and class needs. We plan on putting a ton of effort into ensuring the right gear gets in the right players hands. We have always prided ourselves in being completely transparent with all decisions and encourage all to talk through all loot (outside of when we are raiding of course).
---
Main Raid Times:
---
We raid from 10 p.m. till 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (7 p.m. till 10 p.m. PST). Currently, the days we raid are Wednesday , Thursday , and Monday. Raiders are expected to be online an hour or so before raid for raid buffs and to pull on time.
---
We plan on going for every world boss that we can unless it is at an extremely unoptimal time.
---
We plan on doing a secondary raid group on weekends, strong alt characters or members who cannot make the primary raid time will make up the majority of this raid group. We will treat this raid just as serious as the primary raid.
---
Our Goals:
---
Our main goal for the Toxic guild is to progress as far as possible quickly (but enjoying the content as well) and also competing with other fellow guilds for progression.
---
Our Expectations:
---
We expect players to be the best they can be, always! This means you should know your class in and out (doing proper research from credible sources). You should have all the addons, macros, and keybindings your class needs in order to be the best. Don't be a clicker, no one likes a clicker.
---
What about PVP:
---
While &lt;Toxic&gt; is mainly focused on the PVE side of the game, PVP will also be organized and encouraged. There are quite a few BIS or easily obtainable PVP items for PVE raiding. We will be coordinating guild pre-made battlegrounds and other fun events!
---
Why Toxic?:
---
We are unlike any other guild. We take time to try to mold our entire team as a cohesive unit. We have done many super fun RP Events including Halloween in the Crypts of Karazhan, Christmas &amp; New Year's parties. We have celebrated unique birthdays as a guild and many other strange but incredible events. We are all in when we set our minds to something. Our player base in our 40 man bolstered an unprecedented 25+ of our team having a 90%+ lifetime attendance to raids (100+ raids). Don’t ask Why, ask Why not!!!\`
---
Our Current High Recruitment needs are:
---
Warlock, Resto Druid, Dwarf Holy Priest
---
People who play on Off hours/weekends, or dont always want to raid are more than welcome to join as well, we want to always have something going on. We will accept any role interested in our non primary raid times currently, as well as anyone who is just looking for a home for classic.
---
Look up Pronator on Youtube for some of our older raids, and guild meetings to get a feel for us.

Fucked the people who say this. So disingenuous.
---
Nothing official but they're assumed...
---
OCE servers are great to be talking about but one thing to keep in mind is there's no information on any plans for battlegroups come BG phase, so we may end up back in an NA battlegroup which... means shitty ping in instanced pvp
---
I mean, I don't expect much objectivity on this subreddit.

doing 15 RFK to get a corpsemaker? emergent gameplay...

pushing M+? doesn't even count.

Until everyone is decked out in T2 and above, the goofy ass appearance of everyone is one of the main highlights. Holy shit! Look at that dps warrior with T2.5 shoulders and all that leather, lol

Yepp. Blizzard is makinga mistake by requiring a sub for beta imo.

Being someone who started the game in WoD and is a nobody?  K

It's gonna be hilarious when they all start getting locked out of major guilds because so far from what I've seen they aren't good and they will be spending to much time editing videos instead of farming mats for the raids.

Thank you for this and I'll check them out. Asmongold is so trash as a tank I fear for all his followers. He really is that bad. I'm a God damn angel of mercy as a Dwarf priest but even I worry about my ability to keep everyone up with him tanking
---
Bit confused here, so if you get accepted into the stress test and didn't have beta previously, can you continue to access the beta after the stress test or are you flagged for stress test only?
---
While I prefer Horde, well said.
---
&gt; 2 - Ooo a chest! WAIT DON'T OPEN THAT! Everyone /roll to see who wins the chest. Unless it's locked, then it's the Rogue's or Engineer's. 
---
Or blacksmiths! If we wasted a precious metal on a key we should have rights to use it.
---
Why would we want to wash the smell of Alliance blood off?
---
That's what wow retail is
---
@ 125-150 hours to level an alt - the best alt for farming gold is to just fucking farm gold on your main for 125-150 hours.
---
OMFG, exactly this! old AV battling for days was the best thing back in the days... Please don't change it.
---
This. This comment right here.
---
Does the Minor Speed stack with pursuit talent?
---
If nothing but exploration is what you want then I have to second Druid. Travel form (run speed increase), stealth (in cat form), aquatic form (faster swimming), you can heal yourself, bear form is tanky, cat form is similar to rogue.
---
Hunters are also a good choice. But if exploration is the name of the game I think Druid has the edge here.
---
Thanks again, you've been really great. :)
---
So 7am Thirsday NZ time?
---
How many people do you think are in the Beta? 10? 20?
---
Streamers are a tiny fraction of the people testing the game and more are being added constantly.
---
Transmog is a participation trophy for people who couldn't clear the content before they could solo it :P

K now this. But government.

 Transmog is a participation trophy for people who couldn't clear the content before they could solo it :P

To STRESS TEST? Do you know what that means?

Nah he will be playing with &lt;Apes&gt; hardcore guild with tons of private server xp

Just start bringing less people to raid until you are satisfied

Cram as many people in one small area as possible to test the stress of the server?

It’s amazing the amount of people that don’t understand a beta or stress test are there for testing, and not playing
---
And have erect spines.
---
It's not 1.12.

that u seezy?
---
To stress test the server? Also the normal beta realms are unavailable to play during the stress test so people with existing beta invites can only play on the stress test servers

It's important, it's not for you to have lolerfun really, it's to make sure the game don't take a shit on launch
---
Ignore his snooty ass, it's funny. Even tho I'm doing the same thing in my chair lol
---
&gt; The problem with restoring AV is that all the #nochanges people will cry about it
---
????? what are you talking about???
---
#nochange = old AV, and OP is asking for old AV.
---
Sure you did
---
Accurate name
---
Honestly no one really knows. We have no idea how battlegroups or number of active pvp'ers on realms will be. If vanilla is anything to go by it will somewhere between very time consuming but doable to completely impossible for a random solo player depending on which battlegroup you're on and how popular pvp is at that time.
---
If those addons become a reality in Classic, I hope the community is prepared to become a *speedrunning* one, because the dungeons, mechanics and strategies are all well known, and since there are no updates planned for now, players' use of such addons to speed up their grinds (and classic is *very* grindy) is *inevitable.*

It says it does not stack with anything else, so I assume it would not. But who knows the sort of small details they might miss when the servers are initially launched, might see paladins going at near mounted speed before they even get their mounts.
---
My guild never made in to Naxx thanks to leadership being adamant about us beating AQ40 1st. With that said, we would mercilessly tease all our Holy Paladins about the Redemption tunic. They, above everyone else, staged an ultimately unsuccessful drive for us to push into Naxx for this reason
---
Indeed!
---
Paladin more high skill than Mage confirmed.
---
The stress test is only two hours, but the server is up for two days.
---
Smooth runs arnt a playstyle LOL. It means things won't always go your way. You can exclude whoever you want, doesn't matter to me. I just find it asinine that you think it's your right to have "smooth runs".
---
That's about access to the game
---
why would anyone play the beta seriously?
---
Same reason fun and legit testing.
---
If i got into the beta i would only get to like level 10 because i am saving my energy for the real deal.

---
Damn dude...
---
Why would you go to wowhead to verify stats on an item from Vanilla? It’s wrong for almost every item in the game from that era.
---
First of all, you can’t wear plate gear unless you’re a warrior or paladin at level 40 or above. Secondly, the boots weren’t added or changed to be plate in patch 1.11, they were in the game at launch and stayed the same throughout the entirety of Vanilla.
---
These are the boots as they existed in Vanilla:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=43
---
I don’t understand why we’re having this debate. The boots never had armor in Vanilla, and it made sense that they didn’t have armor when compared to the 2 armor that players got from pants. As dumb as it sounds, 1 armor on boots of the same ‘quality’ would be too high. It wasn’t an oversight on behalf of Classic Dev’s, they have always existed in this state in Vanilla, just like every other pair of boots players spawn in with in the starting zones. It is not a bug.
---
I always read it in D'angelo Barksdales voice
---
Lmao so true.
---
It feels fine most of the time but sometime you can see really weird stuff where the mobs don't aggro until you're almost in melee range
---
I feel like in this beta, values are fine but there are some conflicts or whatever that make it bug out sometime

**Benevolent Elephants**. A US Alliance, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
​
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy. Accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number 1 goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Casual members/PvPers/non-raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: 2 raid nights to be decided once majority get close to 60. However they will be 2 of Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursdays. (With a possible 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: Also to be decided once majority get close to 60, but somewhere in the 6:30pm-12am PST range. For 3-4 hours
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: Loot Council, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exactly details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time. 
---
Contact us:
---
* Discord: https://discord.gg/tyQpeJ3

Get the client downloaded and installed, see how it runs, get keybinds and settings setup for launch. Practice your route for your first 20 mins in a super busy start zone.
---
Ohhh I can already see it.
---
The addon will measure not only gearscore *in relation to each individual instance (*to see if your gear is effective there), but also your instance completion timers.
---
It's pure evil.
---
If I get an invite for the stress test i'll likely play it. Gives me an idea of what the competition will be like the moment of launch and gives blizzard data on interest/what their servers will need to be like. It aint full beta no but it helps the launch experience be the best it needs to be. Take it like that.
---
Mage, huntard or prot Pally. Prot Pally requires a SHIT TON of luck due to needing gear that wont normally come your way but they are BEASTS for leveling and farming
---
It's not like that on pservers therefore it's wrong.
---
1k viewer streamers really aren't. Alone at least. That's what I've seen on private servers tbh. For the most part they're left alone.
---
Even more amazing when the key word is right there in the name. Stress.
---
Honestly wonder how much of a stress test they can make when they don't really have that many potential testers because of their own requirements.
---
Which private servers? All the ones I've played on were finished in like less than 10 mins, Horde used the short cut to finish the match most of the time.
---
There is a global lfg that was added in 1.11, there was a citywide lfg channel between 1.2 and 1.11
---
That was also the patch it was changed from a default channel. I haven't seen anyone use that channel in the beta, so it may not be in place.
---
I love this subreddit.
---
doing M+ on live is neither interesting nor fun, but spamming RFK to farm a corpsemaker is somehow amazing and exciting.
---
As for the beta popularity, let's wait a month or 3 after release, mmmkay? I'll bet a 20 that the tarren mill/ southshore recreation will die out really quick after release... and vanish once BGs come out.
---
You mean 2 hours
---
I posted this and 7 other docs here yesterday  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqrvq3/a\_list\_of\_awesome\_wow\_documentaries/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqrvq3/a_list_of_awesome_wow_documentaries/)
---
If people were truly wanting the Vanilla experience then I should see people wanting server instability, looting bugs, and a bunch of other stuff that went along with Vanilla.
---
"this thing you're disappointed about is going to be disappointing" 
---
get out of here nerd, you have nothing to say
---
&gt; I'm starting to remember a few other TBC quality of life mistakes, but I'd say they weren't all bad.
---
I would say TBC is good enough to stil lbe playable, but it adds tons of shit thay I dislike. And the reason I want to play classic in the firstplace is to play without these endless QoL changes that Blizzard has added to the game, and that really starts in TBC.
---
Summoning stones for example is a huge one for example, like yeah its good. But it also means that there will be way less people traversing the world....
---
Out of 25 people for a raid maybe 2 people cba to go to the raid and start to summoning the rest, as oppose to vanilla where the entire raid groups up in Khadgar or wherever and runs to BRM as a unit.
---
:o my bad, seems like such a forgotten film
---
Soil and Disturbed for me lol
---
Oh dear GOD
---
Paladin seals....
---
Soooo many old skills
---
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CLASS TO PLAY FML!!!!!!!
---
Not easy if you have to sleep, work, or leave your house. If you have roommates, you will probably want their help to keep you active when you can't be. It's all about time.
---
This cancer addon is made by some retail babies who hate the idea of having to talk to people.
---
Nope.
---
I still have even more i know of I will add , AFK is a good one!
---
Tbh, this will be a huge factor for me to whether play Classic WoW or not...
---
ya lol
---
Maybe, but I think people severly underestimate just how much TBC actually changed how the game.
---
From what I've seen on private servers, those small streams don't really make too much of an impact. I think big streams cultivate a different type of environment. Like idolization.
---
I'm a little disappointed that we aren't getting the more iconic AV we all reminisce over (but supposedly everyone hated?). I mean I get there are practical reasons for going with 1.12, including the possibility that they don't have enough intact data from older versions and don't want to attempt to remake it from scratch. They've been pretty open about the fact that version control in 2004-2006 was really, really bad.
---
It's still a bit of a let-down. I mean 1.12 AV is still fun. Even its final TBC+ incarnation is still fun (if you play alliance at least trololo) and it'll always be my favorite BG. But I was really hoping we'd get a more iconic presentation on this one. I really wanted newcomers to experience AV as it was meant to be experienced, the way I experienced it before it was nerfed for the "gimme gimme now now now" crowd.
---
It's still early, but probably.
---
OSRS nearly dipped under 10k concurrent players less than a year after launch. It wasn’t until GWD, Zulrah, and the GE released that it even started gaining players.
---
I also plan/hope to get rank 13 at some point, doubt I will ever have the free time to get rank 14. But from what I know you can probably get rank 13 by just playing bgs everyday for probably 5+ hours. Maybe some premades here and there.
---
Faxanadu.... Man I loooveed that game for the nes!
---
Tillyx, just tryna relive my youth
---
Imagine if Blizzard would have invited people who were not streamers trying to make money, private server heroes, or people who were 5 when Classic was live to the Beta so that we’d get competent bug reports.
---
Mostly towellie imo. Fuck that dude.
---
I see it in nearly every thread about Classic. They continuously move the goalpost for what it takes for the game to be successful
---
True
---
Any Oceania players get in?
---
Missing summon Inferno for Warlock
---
I think there are about 1k people inside actually, most of which are spending their time doing niche content alongside their favorite streamer and casually stumbling on some bugs, instead of intently testing the game. For example, if I were playing, all of my gold would go towards respec costs to test all of the talents as that is a core mechanic, instead of spending my time running in Karazhan crypts.
---
Hunters get to use Mail armor at 40.  Dual wield melee weapons at 20.   wear leather up until then.. or cloth.  use pretty much every weapon in the game.  heh..  Roll a warlock if you want a pet class that is easy solo leveling.
---
don't think so
---
but if your being kited use blessing of freedom and always try have some swiftness potions

Everyone eventually learns you approach the ship hugging the right side of the dock
---
Yes, its a great introduction raid, with some really good loot which makes always relevant throughout the entire game basically. 
---
Thunderfury and Spellblade for instance.
---
And its probably the only raid that can be speed-run really fast as its not as threat sensitive as BWL or Onyxia.
---
IIRC you can select up to 4, you have to hold down either shift or ctrl to be able to drag a box around them. No way to save unit groups though.
---
Question, do you have to be subbed to live to receive an invite if anyone can confirm
---
Added, #14
---
holy me too dude, sec i send pm
---
1.12 is the AV that you would be complaining about. 1.12 AV in #nochanges. Reverting to an Older AV would change that
---
OP,                   Thank you!
---
Oh yeah I forgot about BSs, sorry it's in only been you know... since vanilla haha.
---
No one knows yet. We will have to wait and see
---
Started in 2006, got a rogue to level 42 in vanilla up until BC was released 2007. Then I maxed multiple alts in every xpac up until BfA. Not sure where you got the assumption I started in WoD from, but that's mad disrespectful to assume that. Any real OG player knows any xpac past WOTLK was shit. Respect your elders son.
---
Race: Night elf, you can just stop anywhere and stealth for security when you need to.
---
Class: Hunter, druid or rogue. In that order.
---
fixed and added more :)
---
Part of the addiction in vanilla was the community aspect.  Join a large leveling guild, seeing the same people your level each night meant forming friendships.
---
I developed a core group.  Over a 5-7 year span, some came and left.  There were people who went to better guilds, or guys from other guilds who joined you.
---
Anyone in the upper tier of level 60s had a reputation and relationship with others.  There was gossip and drama, which guild leaders girlfriend left him and formed their own guild.  Who ninja looted their guild bank and formed a new guild.  People recruiting and convincing others to join their team.  Kind of like some mini pro sport league.  Guilds disbanded and groups formed “super guilds.” 
---
Also random memory from Vanilla...who remember “DKP.”  I think it was an old Everquest term.  Basically time spent raiding or donating bought you guild currency called Dragon Kill Points.  Then you spent it on gear upgrades in raid.
---
https://youtu.be/up863eQKGUI
---
Nothing yet
---
I didn't think vanilla had custom chat channels. I thought that was added in 2.2. In vanilla the closest thing to a global channel was World Defense and you needed to be like rank 11 to say anything.
---
Makes sense it's just a different perspective for me. When I think people like an instance I assume they mean they like the actual mechanics and whatever instead of mainly "this has loot I like". Interesting, thanks!
---
I just enjoy the irony.
---
M+ on live? boring as heck.
---
spamming RFK and SM GY on beta? new and exciting gameplay.
---
I'm also in asmon guild in the beta ( as is like 50% of the alliance side). Out of the 300ish people online in his guild, he couldn't even get 80 in arathi according to the people spamming Gchat... and that's the first big event. I can't imagine the enthusiasm eing much higher for the 10th or 20th one...
---
Addon name plz?
---
To hellfire with your light, I embrace the shadows!
---
Its over for WoWcels.
---
Old AV should be preserved the same way the game is. It isn't available anywhere else.
---
I agree they are being silly. We can all agree that it seems easy, but if that is the way classic it, then so be it. The game is called wow classic, and is not a carbon copy of the game in 2004 anyway, if the classic team feels they need to make it harder than it was, then I would trust them to make that call.
---
The low damage is actually something that could be off and esfand and co. actually touched on it today during classicast, i believe it was tipsout that gave a solid opinion on it. The vid will be out tomorrow i can link the exact section at that point.
---
SFK special items: none
---
U fkn wot m8?
---
That's not what no changes means. No changes outside of vanilla.
---
i assume this will be server locations
---
https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/ui/UI5GHS0013QD1557845843113.jpg
---
it will be nice to play classic with less than 350 ping
---
*give tears*
---
Started in WoD boy, you ain't fooling anyone little man.
---
R/hockey has a sidebar photo of the week. It would be cool if r/classicwow did something similar
---
It could happen very early on, but yes, it’ll eventually be level 60s vs. level 60s.
---
Just like the old days where people would spam trade chat that they need help somewhere and level 60s would pop out of trees.
---
When you get into beta and actually get to that part you'll understand what I am talking about. 
---
To lay it out for you since you clearly have no idea. That particular area has a really low spawn rate for the mobs there. When the game launches that spot is going to have a lot of people doing that quest.
---
In your ignorance you claim it can be fixed with grouping, but again you show that you haven't actually tested that area lol. The drop rate for the arm bands is ***abysmal***. 
---
So, low spawn rate for mobs, low drop rate for items, and a large influx of people means it's not worth doing that quest at all. 
---
I would fucking love to see you get into a group to "be social" only to have you sit with a finger up your ass while you wait for mobs to spawn that have a drop rate that's dog shit. 
---
You really are clueless lol.
---
Hi, /u/Itakio
---
Random zone in the level 35 range.  Each had a town, maybe a river connecting them.
---
South shore and Tarren Mills I think.  Just non stop PVP slaughter and for just about nothing but fun.
---
but the AV in 1.12 is the one that changed, nochange should mean getting the old AV, not the changed one from 1.12.
---
They use v1.12 for talent tree and skills, it doesn't mean they have to use the new AV.
---
Activision never knew it
---
5 seems on the very low end. Probably at least 10. It was more like 18 hours for rank 14.
---
500 person hogger raids
---
Don't try to 'train' yourself to be ready. Go in there blind and enjoy the magic to its full potential!
---
Vanilla was a very community based game, and you will not be alone with learning classes.  You will bump into people who will help you, you'll make friends, and join a guild to grow together.
---
No one is going to rail you for being a 'noob'.
---
AV was changed multiple times in Vanilla.  1.12 version is for sure changed, and technically hits the \#nochanges mantra.
---
The stance of the characters are so odd lol
---
Hopefully that shit wont be an option to add as an addon in my dear classic client.
---
Gnarls Barkley - Crazy
---
I created an orc warrior and had this running in the background. Literally only played it maybe once or twice that first day of leveling, but whenever it comes on I instantly think of my level 1 Orc Warrior in Durotar.
---
Well, if those nochange people are going to cry, they should be crying about using 1.12 in the first place. Shouldn't they want the very first version of vanilla wow? It doesn't make any sense.
---
Yep, holding ctrl let's you box units. The pathing is so bad though I find it much easier to move units individually unless I'm moving a lot over open terrain.
---
DMX in the fucking Barrens. I’m totally doing this!
---
Hi, /u/rasputinrising
---
They don't make much sense because they are a collective who don't all agree with what should and shouldn't be there.
---
Imagine having a wife and getting onto the classic wow subreddit every night to flame random people you know nothing about. lmfaoooo could never relate. I hope you get through whatever you're going through man, you seem like a lot of fun at parties.
---
The macro just let you logout and reset with a single button press, couldn't you reset the instance and then just logout manually? It's like two more clicks.
---
The average group didn't even know half of that shit existed lol. I was blowing people's minds with the Jujus. Wowhead and resources like that just didn't exist back in the day. Everything was word of mouth. Obviously, you wanted to do the best you could in Raids because every mistake is just wasted time. More buffs = Better chances. 
---
True story, all of those buffs have their own versions for every class.
---
How to win the entire campaign:
---
Step 1: Make a wall of archers
---
Step 2: kite enemy units into it
---
gg
---
Barrenschat.com might have something like this
---
The guttural crunch of a kick interrupting a cast
---
I’ve really started backing away from Classic. It’s made the days go by even faster IMO. We’re already at like 98 days and I thought we were still at 104....
---
Just in time to get back home after dropping the kids at school. Now I've just gotta get selected.
---
Give hunters purge and I'm cool with it
---
Oh for real? Every class guide is like that? They really aught to change their wording. The prot one comes across as saying all 18 of those things is downright necessary. I'm glad to hear thats just not true.
---
I fully agree with putting forth effort for the good of your guild. But there's definitely some limits lol
---
Probably none right now as you need an active sub
---
I am having the opposite problem. All I can do is watch streamers and it makes me want to play more then anything right now. 
---
Watching has become more important to me then playing any other game :(
---
I was one of the people who were very happy to see them making 5-mans and 10/20 mans more important.
---
Hey hey, not all of us are up at 35+ don't do us like that :p
---
On private servers even casual guilds ask their members to come fully buffed consumed because it’s a small chore but helps with progression immensely.
---
This can be said about retail as well.
---
Cata was definitely the turning point. Only 5 more levels but my IC gear was replaced by BOE greens. I spent a week trying to do 5 man dungeons. They added a bunch of shit I didn't even understand in terms of talent trees. I'd been playing for 4+ years at that point and I had no idea wtf I was doing anymore.
---
You cannot get R13 by playing 5 hours a day.
---
The jump from Vanilla to BC was much bigger then the jump from BC to Wrath.
---
All three were glorious in their own time.
---
It was like the improvements of each were “earned” by the players.  
---
Example:  People bitched about flying mounts and how it ruined Vanilla.  But back then, you wanted to fucking fly after running around for 3 years.
---
Class simplification and homogenizations happened over the years.  But in Vanilla there were entire specs or even classes that felt useless in a specific role.  
---
Spend 300 hours leveling a paladin to level 60, only to realize your tanking abilities suck to real tanks, your dps sucked to dpsers, and your healing (in cloth gear) was subpar.
---
Why would a paladin be in raid?  Cause you could buff people with 5 minute blessings before a fight.  Shit some fights had you reapplying buffs during the encounter.
---
Players will always take the path of least resistance to gearing and progression. There won't be much TB/SS battles by the private experienced pvpers they understand that once P2 hits they will camp Throrium Point and Marshalls Refuge flight points farming honor until BGs launch. No hate by that. But only those trying to get the feels and nostalgia will push for TM/SS battles. That's the $20 bet I've already made.
---
Well, they did get to 30 in like a few days (classic).
---
Pinned even
---
there wont be cross realm, how do you think this addon would cause any issues at all? because people use a UI instead of spam tradechat?
---
Thottbot was a thing. There was like thousands of Geocities with information. Ever guild I was in was using outside resources to get better.
---
Those lists are bull. The only ones that care about all those consumables are the hardcore raid guilds that want e erything done as fast as possible. Fact is if you don’t have the time to invest in all that farming, you aren’t going to be in one of those guilds. Join any of the other ones that don’t force such strict requirements on their members.
---
It’s doable but takes a long time and you need to play 12-14 hours per day consistently. Joining a premade helps a ton to shave off time and effort.
---
I'm in a similar boat. I started in 1.12 but didn't know how to play until deep into TBC, which in a sense didn't affect vanilla content but made azeroth feel empty.
---
You can also join or create any custom channel, wouldn't be hard to /join lfg
---
To me the extremely long very old-style AV was the truest vanilla experience of AV. When you say "remember back in vanilla when AV would last for days?" people immediately know what you're talking about. Even people who didn't experience it would have heard of it.
---
Zug zug.
---
I think Classic will have more time played per player with a smaller player base and BfA will have a larger playerbase but shorter amount of time played
---
Does that make sense? 
---
People will play the "new content" for the 2-3 weeks that it lasts then go back to another game or play Classic IMO
---
Rogue seems incomplete?
---
Otherwise interesting getting their last ability at level 40?
---
I'd go for a Druid honestly. You have almost everything in your toolkit, that allows you to play solo. Pick up Skinning + Leatherworking, if you think you'll not be able to do dungeons / raids much. Or just gathering professions and make good money on auction house, so you can get your gear this way.
---
Plus tbh, Druids are really fun to play.
---
Your group is not reflective of the general population. In BC, where resources were much more available, my Guild got server first kill on Kiljaeden and half of those people couldn't tell their ass from a hole in the ground. A majority of players did not keep up with this shit. It's just like today. All of these resources and how many people do you see actually using them?
---
The ice stone has melted
---
Hence why id mention him , for a guy who's not around hes does have a huge amount of followers...
---
yeah weither it just existed  or people can just join it and create it is about the same
---
we certainly had guild class channels.for raids to shit talk in
---
Your post implies that they are storing written code in a database somewhere as opposed to just values... that’s nonsense.
---
The question is what the definition of "fully" is in those environments that aren't quite so hardcore. I'd argue that the process and commitment to seeking out and playing on private servers places most of their demographic above the usual 'casual' crowd inherently. But I could certainly be wrong.
---
Yeah, it's gotta be an alt you actually get enjoyment from for it to be worth it.
---
Yep, I'll be using /join lfg or /join world - or whatever the consensus winds up being. I just mention the built-in global channel because it gets rid of the possibility of trolls creating lfg and world channels and making them private.
---
You can always roll on an RP server and your character can be a transvestite.
---
Classic WoW requires a regular WoW subscription to play. Nothing more.
---
How are you so sure? What evidence is there to support that “private servers got it wrong”? The way I see it the amount of work that was done creating and puzzling together the mangos code that private servers are built on is probably more accurate than blizzards work after what not even a year? The private server community worked for years putting that code together.
---
I'm gonna gather up as many priests as I can find and try to get a flash heal wave circle going. Cast as soon as you see the guy to your right start his cast and target the person to your left.
---
I got downvoted instantly when I spoke up, and I ain't even white lmafo.
---
Cant upvote this post enough well done OP
---
Put down the mouse and take a nap.
---
lol nice 👌
---
OP, fuck off, its a fucking vidya game. People can play however the hell they want to. Have fun chasing the dragon
---
[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XutoehG6ZaQ) that gives a bit more detail on [this list](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/567071825478156478/576291328481296384/consumables.png) but basically the higher in the column the item, the more important it is to have.
---
OCE
---
If you're attending raids each week, that gear will come your way pretty quickly. Most of it is holy gear anyway, because most of your damage will come from consecrate, and you'll need to heal yourself. Invest in skull shield, slap on some tier 1 and you're probably set.
---
idk but i turst buzzard
---
Well, 25 years later, I feel stupid.
---
I will see you on the battlefield.
---
Tipsout never played vanilla. He is a bad source. Early sungeons were easy on hardish one was maraudon.
---
It was a cycle of hatred as old as humanity. You get ganked and become the thing you hate when you're finally in a position of power.
---
LF39M Hogger need all
---
The Beta test was successful. As a ghost, I received no experience when my party member killed a pirate, but I did receive 5 Ratchet rep along with 3 rep for each of the other three Steamwheedle Cartel factions (Booty Bay, Everlook and Gadgetzan).
---
You can do what you want, but it will definitely exist.
---
oh man! I can't wait, my dad works at blizzard and he told me chen stormstout is leading more pandaren to the horde!
---
Esfand did play back then and he was agreeing, tips was just one example. Blizz has an original 1.12 client working so they will confirm either way.
---
you have to be outside the instance to reset in vanilla and classic. you can't use the macro to reset it inside and get sent back to the entrance, and that neuters a lot of the dungeon farming methods.
---
Good pov
---
[Lazyspell](https://github.com/laytya/Lazyspell) was/is one, but it'll likely need an update and depends on addons that also need updates.
---
I don’t understand this. I’m poor (not like living in a shack poor) but not well off by any means. And 15 dollars every month is almost nothing.
---
If you can afford video games as a hobby, you can afford 15 a month
---
Literally the whole thing...
---
How is it not my right to choose who I play with?
---
I find it asinine that just because you want to live in 2004/07 means the rest of us have to.
---
That’s a private server which they aren’t allowed to stream anyway. 1k viewer streamers on classic on launch day? Big impact.
---
Before release it was talked about for NE warriors as a 60 specialization, I believe.
---
i highly doubt doing it solo will be possible
---
No, you're just not very sharp. It's practically dripping with satire from start to finish.
---
So just to be clear, did you also test it versus single mobs and ~8.75% of the time it procced then as well?
---
10 fps lol
---
What do you mean by destructive? I'm not familiar with anything his guild has done, just know that they're super hardcore.
---
“Day 100th BC”
---
BC
---
BEFORE. CLASSIC.
---
I’m crying right now hah. That’s too good.
---
I might suggest dwarf hunter, for the exploration roleplaying aspect of it. Plus I think they have some bonus to discovering treasure.
---
Frost Oil, keep a stack of the stuff in your bag and put it on your weapons.
---
Am I in the right sub
---
Bad troll is bad, u mad bro?
---
I explained in another post, but warlocks weren't an issue in WSG, but in duels/arena because of abusing bandages, long lasting DOTs and LoS.  
---
In WSG I didn't really feel challenged by any other single class, except when BC came out and paladins could pick up flag, not be slowed, had enough armour to soak up my pet and could out-run/mana my dps with healing. Never lost in duels to pallies, but couldn't stop a good one taking and capping the flag without team help.
---
Why do you have so many accounts?
---
This is incredibly informative, many thanks! Great spreadsheet and looks like a lot of work went into it
---
Here's a [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpqmpB0b3vs) of a 56 (probably with around 4k armor). The non elites are hitting him for  18 or so.  Compare to asmon in dm, the non-elites are hitting him for around the same at probably 1.5k armor.  The elite damage seems ok, it's the non-elite damage that seems off.
---
The guy who started looting the chest actually got it lol.

&lt;Eye of Insanity&gt; **[NA - Alliance] [PvE] [Hardcore] [Pacific]**
---
__*Intro*__  
---
We are a guild formed for the specific purpose of pushing as hard as we can to be the realm first and best on our server. We are looking for all competitive-minded players who want to make the most out of the time they put into raiding. 
---
__*Expectations*__  
---
Each player must come fully prepared each raid night. Respect the time that everyone puts in to raid. Have consumables ready, do your research of the expected fights, be online and ready to enter at raid time, and be willing to change and adapt during raids. Keep chatter to a minimum during boss explanation or pulls, and bring any issues during raids to officers to keep things moving.
---
We use a loot council system comprised of raid role/guild officers, guild master, and rotating core raiders. 
---
Classic WoW is a based around community and having fun, and we want to keep that atmosphere in this guild. You can be committed to efficient raiding and still like the people you play with. This is an adult guild, expect adult topics, some swearing, etc. Members must be respectful of each other and the fact that people come from a variety of walks of life. ANY racism, sexism, homophobia, etc will not be tolerated.  We all share a common interest in Classic WoW, and the golden rule applies here.

__*About Me*__  
---
I have raid led since siege of orgrimmar, and have pushed heroic/mythic progression since then. My team went 6/9M ToS,  10/11M Antorus, and I left BfA during our Zek'voz progression in Uldir. Our officers strive to keep guild leadership as transparent as possible to make sure no one is feeling that their voice isn't being heard in the guild. 
---
__*Raid Schedule*__

Tues/Wed/Thur 7:30-11:00PM PST We will drop days as we clear faster.

Well.. It would be easier for the company that created this game to recreate it compared to people who did it as a hobby, or whatever reason they had. Blizzard does have a working 1.12 client as well. They test things like mob damage, aggro ranges, etc., through this test client. So their information is definitely more reliable than the people who were rebuilding wow based off old videos or memory (which isn't exactly the most reliable source). 
---
In fact, to say that private servers had it right.. well that's just inaccurate. If you compare 3 different private servers there are differences between them. Everything from aggro ranges to mob damage. It's just not accurate in any way. Yet, it was the best we had.
---
Mages also make bank selling ports in Kargath.
---
If you're in a decent raiding guild as a MT or OT, the guild will fund those.  If you need to farm items, then people will help you farm them.  Everyone understands that the raid succeeds or fails on the back of the MT, so people are more than willing to you out.
---
No it will be at 11am Thursday in NZ.
---
👍
---
looks like no NA betas todas :(
---
There was a guy I talked to who claimed he got one on another thread
---
I'm very down to get my bis level 5 gear. do some wpvp :)
---
Yes sir
---
I could never figure out where this picture was taken
---
I saw soda in /global the other day
---
I'm ignorant to the WoW Streaming scene, but I was watching his stream during this and he just comes off as super entitled, like its everyone's obligation to help him get this axe.
---
Yeah. Out of 100 casts single Target I got 13 clearcasts. So a little rng help there but still perfectly normal
---
The macro and addon API is from Legion, so it's modern raid frames and macro writing. Totem stomping macros were killed in WotLK I believe, so no, they should not be working within the updated macro API. This is why mouseover macros are working, because the macro API is updated.
---
Raider.io is cancer to new players that are good without any friends.
---
Just do it as a ghost get the speed and spirit res...
---
Eh.  Getting to practice your level 1-30 route is a pretty big deal to some.
---
Can this run on my retropi?
---
Damn this is basically why I stopped playing my prot warrior, was having a blast tanking dungeons and made it to 60 a little late and people were clearing MC by the time I was pre-raid BiS. Spent the next month or two looking for a guild and only got one trial that required 200+ fire resist which I acquired but they decided they didn't need me. So I just became a super altoholic and would sometimes raid on my brothers mage.
---
Kind of don't wanna go through that again but who knows, tempted to make either a mage or warlock just to up my chance of raiding asap. Or try the tedious vanilla healing, started healing midBC and fell in love with it.
---
&gt; Practice your route for your first 20 mins in a super busy start zone.
---
Lol @ level 5 in 20 min on a crowded server.
---
&gt; Am I in the right sub
---
considering the title, yes, 'cuz the reddit seems infested with Horde "flexing" by showing how cool they are by repeatedly insulting Alliance.
---
Formerly a tank (main OT)  for one of the top Gurubashi progression guilds. Experience tanking and offtanking all Vanilla content up to twin emps. Took a break to party (college lol) and then came back and dpsed Cthun up to four horsemen in Nax. 
---
In Pvp was rank 9 and rolled with some guildies who pushed rank 13 and 14.
---
Had a lot of good times progressing and pvping and looking to enjoy it again with a fun group of people, who also have lives, spouses, careers, etc. My RL responsibilities and career limit things since I can only really raid weekdays 10am-2pm or 12:30am-2:30am PST, but if there's a weekend guild out there that could work too.
---
* Intended region- NA I suppose
---
* Intended server type- PVP or PVE
---
* Intended faction- Alliance
---
* Intended raid/play times : Preferably weekdays 10am-2pm or 12:30am-2:30am PST, or whenever or weekends.
---
* Preferred form of contact (Reddit PM)
---
There is an end goal in sight when farming RFK. Getting that one piece you are working for is extremely rewarding. In BFA there is always something slightly better. It feels so unrewarding to get the regular or even warforged version.
---
If you can't clear the mobs surrounding the chest by yourself, you don't deserve it either.
---
I wish my life was half as interesting as that guys
---
It is an actual thing. There is code in the client that adds the leeway of 2.666~ yards when checking distance (melee against everyone, and melee/ranged/spell against players) for spellcasts if both caster and target are moving: https://i.imgur.com/aTgKWkG.png
---
The actual movement flags that are checked there have changed between expansions, the image above is 3.3.5 client. But yes, it was for sure added as a lag-compensation measure.
---
And the server didn't lag to hell and crash. Gives me hope!
---
I remember it used to take me at least 30 sec to load in when I hearthed to IF.  I upgraded my RAM and when I hearthed to IF it was instant I was so amazed.
---
they already confirmed that damage was correct. you can check it with reference videos as well. the current damage is right on the dot. people just remember Vanilla being harder then it was because they were much younger and worse at the game.
---
For some reason people get entitled about Betas and think they are owed something.
---
Forgot about good old frost oil, thanks.
---
Only if that means i have 8x the chance
---
https://i.imgur.com/zh5iSb3.png
---
Yup levelling on westfall I was on a huge DMX kick. I was like 16 or something haha
---
Do you get an email if you get invited to the beta?
---
What I personally think will be cool is tbc retuned to progress horizontally. So basically the level cap stays at 60 and if a properly geared player wanted to jump straight into raids they could, otherwise there is 5 man's and questing to sink time into if your bored.
---
Their serverw can support 20k with phasing, sharding though. This will just have layering.
---
Did vanilla have UI scaling?  I don't remember.
---
ITT people that think Vanilla raids are hard. The difficulty of vanilla raiding is in the meta game and managing 50+ people to be full prepared and equipped to do raids, pvp, and world guild events like world bosses.
---
That was so iconic the way he said it. RIP Heath.
---
I have a friend that off the cuff mentioned classic wow and asked if I was going to play. 
---
The damn fool has no idea.
---
enjoy your beta invite
---
it could be either. they changed the beta to "Beta and Stress Test"; the only way to confirm it is to see if you can log-in or you get past level 5 on Wednesday.
---
Exactly.
---
Vanilla raids themselves were never difficult, people were just noobs with bad-itemized gear, bad spells/talents, and nowhere near as much experience with the game.
---
Things only start getting moderately difficult in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Your in just for the stress test. Gz :)
---
I do want to get a feel for what the initial zone will feel like crowded, how well layers will balance. I've been pondering the idea of going to sleep after work Monday right around when the servers open, I'm EST. Then wake up at 2 or 3 am when the no lifers are off in later zones and the general public has gone to bed. 
---
Reason... I really don't like fighting over mobs. I feel like I'm being an ass when sniping things, but if I don't I wouldn't make any progress. So instead sleep and let the first wave go through.
---
It literally says something like: +1 stamina, &lt;Random enchantment&gt;. I'm talking about the stats, not any name.
---
Why lie?
---
The entitlement is real
---
Warlocks with Heath stones, health pots, and void sac lol
---
That was fun to watch.
---
Same position as you, still no beta inv :(
---
Cheers mate. Joined
---
After the initial wave of content creators it's seeming to be completely random. I've talked to people that started in vanilla all the way to WOD some have played recently some haven't played in years.
---
Much like Classic WoW, classic reddit is just better.
---
Skullcrusher!!! Recognize a lot of people in there. I was in Immo for awhile... never was that great though. I got gkicked for turning in a nef head for my mages Stamina neck Lol. We were doing Naxx by then so most people had the neck. Mistakes were made. 
---
After that, I especially remember playing with the guy who bought Wrays account when we switched servers after Skullcrusher guilds moved... I forget where we moved to. I think Wray sold the Warrior for $1k back in the day, worlds first Thunderfury, go figure!
---
anyone know how you find out if you are invited to the beta? Will I get emailed?
---
Baba O'Reilly by The Who. 
---
Tom Sawyer by Rush
---
And anything by Breaking Benjamin, The Shins, and The Vines.
---
Man this hits too close to home right now
---
Some people said they resubbed the day before getting beta
---
I saw it on the launcher before anything else.
---
How does it smell?
---
Every day.
---
I needed this so bad. Im trying to decide what talent Im gonna take but I have vanilla through MoP all mixed around in my head. Its hard to find a complete and super concise list.
---
I 100% thought Ice Lance was in vanilla
---
blizz give this man beta access (if you don't have yet)!!
---
First off, it's not much of a spoiler, it really doesn't give away ANYTHING about the plot.
---
Secondly, it's not even from this week's episode. Stay off social media if you're behind and THAT sensitive to spoilers.
---
And lastly, this season, especially the second half of it, has sucked. Spoilers can't really ruin something that's already shit.
---
You may have heard of this thing called layering?
---
not to mention 20 mins without dynamic respawns, shit aint happening
---
Actually there is a thread here saying that a stoneskin totem bug is to blame for the.low damage.
---
The efftects of the totem were not removed after the buff fell off or something.
---
Well no, i only mentioned that staff because its the first item that counters resistance that came to mind as an example. There are some rings, trinkets and armor pieces that you can get earlier on...
---
Baited
---
Where's your citations then
---
Just saw this on GOG with WCII on sale. Picked it up because I never played the first one. Loaded it. Played for 3 minutes and just couldn't get over the UI. I never would have thought some of the basic features in WCII would make me feel spoiled.
---
Good news is WCII for $15 by itself is worth it so I'm still happy with my purchase.
---
It gets me more hyped, and honestly I get a really weird “at home” feeling watching pre-cata wow.
---
Also there a lot I need to remember and learn because I started very end of vanilla. I got to 58 just in time for the dark portal to open.
---
Raider.io is literally aids in retail. I hope It never finds its way into classic. Not worried about any other addons.
---
The human warlock I am forced to play to appease my real life Alliance favoring friends is just a deep cover Undead.
---
And that's what I need to keep telling myself.
---
Maybe on player movement event. Same way it checks if player is close enough to NPC to pull it, same event would be used to apply aura if he is close enough?
---
Nice comment
---
Unless I get one shot from 100 yards away by level 4 Mangy Wolf, my character gets deleted, and my game is uninstalled, this game is not hard enough, and it's not how I remember it, therefore classic wow is not vanilla wow and Blizzard lied. FUCK YOU
---
so i got into the beta on day 2 and my wow account that got in was made at the end of Wotlk however my original account from vanilla i recovered a few years ago and had blizzard link it to my main account. So having your old account from vanilla linked to your main account might help cause it does 100% seem like only accounts from vanilla are getting beta access atm.
---
Just need an subscription
---
 /Invite thimmy3.  ?
---
Sick thank you very much
---
I hope to God Dungeon.IO is among the list of Add-ons that Blizzard shuts down. It will literally ruin the PVE. Taking a risk on a Pug was part of the experience.
---
Cata kinda ruined a lot of the zone nostalgia for me, especially thousand needles and flats. But The simplified talent system really makes me feel   less immersed.
---
...you‘re a good man.
---
I'm not even convinced player population is the issue. You can play on a full server and join an active guild and the sense of community still feels lacking, this game just doesnt bring people together like it used to.
---
good video but that guy in the back is annoying to listen to listen to.
---
Theres a bug similar to this on mages dampen magic
---
Make new friends like us loyal Horde players.
---
&gt;doing M+ on live is neither interesting nor fun, but spamming RFK to farm a corpsemaker is somehow amazing and exciting.
---
Yes, and that's because of something that Retail lacks severely, the community. Sure, game systems in Classic are, IMO, more engaging even though they tend to be more tedious or simple (something [Preach seems to agree with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wj5W42GiUE&amp;t=38m38s), even though he thinks the gameplay of Classic is "garbage" and never expected to like Classic). 
---
Spamming RFK is a loot hunt that is not tied to the rates of WF or TF. You know that that boss after the next few mobs has a chance to drop Corpsemaker. In Retail, you know the instance drops the visual you want or any activity has a chance at giving you gear in the slot/s you need, and a smaller chance of that gear actually being useful. 
---
I'd take the chance farming an instance for an item I know is good for a slot I need any day over the chance of the right piece dropping with a smaller chance of that piece being the upgrade I need.
---
&gt;As for the beta popularity, let's wait a month or 3 after release, mmmkay?
---
There's no need to be condescending. We are both fans of WoW, the only difference being what version we like. Classic will be successful in today's standards without a doubt. Financially, after they got past the server structure and R&amp;D for the Legion client + Classic Data, this is gravy. There's no new systems that need to be made, none of the art is "new" (although I know they hired someone to help recreate Classic graphics) and many other aspects don't need to be re-developed. They get more people subbed to WoW with basically no new content.
---
By the success standards of Classic's time, it will blow them out of the water (original expectations were &lt;1 million players subbed iirc). And when you are waiting for 9.1 to drop and the new Mounted Combat system is ruining the release of WoW: Warchief's Judgement, you can hop onto Classic (for free if you are a Retail player) and shoot the shit in some older dungeons, slow down and make friends, enjoy older Azeroth for what makes it special. Maybe you might like it? It's worth a shot.
---
&gt;I'll bet a 20 that the tarren mill/ southshore recreation will die out really quick after release... and vanish once BGs come out.
---
Maybe, but the systems go deeper than PvP events. 3 months or so after release is a good timeline for the release of BWL and the Honor System. PvE will be bumping again as a new raid is there to be farmed, and PvP will be big as the R14 grind starts again for the first time in 12 years.
---
It's not like this stuff is going to happen every single day or maybe even every single week, but one Horde/Alliance player dies while leveling an alt and they can't take it any more, they roll in on their 60, kill lowbies, and spark a larger conflict. And that'll be enough, for me at least.
---
**Looking for weekend crew**
---
Hey all, I am looking for some players to quest through classic on weekend nights. I am a father of three and a full time student so my availability is pretty much limited to the weekend. I don't mind playing slowly and would prefer to find players who would like to meet up on Saturday nights to level with each other. 
---
Some basic info on me:
---
* NA region 
---
* Normal/PvP
---
* Alliance **or** Horde (Mage)
---
* 8:00 pm-10 pm PST
---
* Some simple rules: I intend to play this casually. I am not interested in min maxing--I prefer to enjoy the journey. As a result I'd like to play with like-minded individuals who don't mind taking their time and enjoying the game slowly. I will not be leveling the character outside of our play times, so if you want to continue on other days/times then I suggest making a second character, that way we stay leveled together. Otherwise, just be respectful, and come with the intention of having a good time!
---
If you are interested please feel free to reply to this post, pm me, or message me on discord, my user name is  Mae#9330
---
Then a month later he changed the tune in his pipe and blizzard mega-nerfed all the five mans :,(
---
It was a sad day for those of us who couldnt raid but still wanted challenging content.
---
If you care about advanced boss mechanics you might as well stick to BFA, no raid in vanilla is mechanically difficult.
---
The hard part comes from organizing the raids, making sure people show up with the shit thats needed and having good communication.
---
you're comparing a capped beta to a full release game buddy.  Even then if you compare vanilla to say BFA, vanilla takes a steamy dump on it.
---
this is satire you fool
---
You hush your whore mouth. I've killed enough Alliance in my day to make Arthas look like an amateur.
---
Plus yeah I'll be messing around on a Horde pvp server alt whenever I get the chance.
---
huh guess I heard very wrong then. That's some shit lmao. But good to know
---
Okay cool! Thanks for the information
---
Yeah, you will have to get naked, die and run back like the old days.
---
The dedicated will still find a meta and farm instanced content i bet.
---
Just like Dany forgot about the Iron Fleet.
---
Played pally in 04, played pally in the 12 or 15 private servers I've played on since 2010. I see no reason not to do it LETS GO white swing my way to 60 one last time.
---
What is the purpose of this?
---
The average Classic fan everybody, feast your eyes.
---
how is the most important class the last? sheesh
---
Lying is a bit hyperbolic
---
I love how interconnected WOW can be. Looking through your pictures, I suddenly realized it's the guild from Fura's Warsong Gulch video, NA vs. Immortality. Good times!
---
I lasted maybe an hour, but same story.
---
Me too friend. It's a darn shame that veteran players like us are mad shafted.
---
Find it on the scurvy seas, argh!
---
Yes I have.
---
3,000 players per layer is still a fucking lot of players.
---
Solo'ing Rank 13 will be impossible on any server that has a rotating rank farming group. In the original grind, every server had multiple rank farming groups, if that repeats itself on Classic you'll never solo farm Rank 13.
---
Hi, /u/SandwichMan96
---
You could make a dungeon search tool with lua pretty easily. Remember classic wow has the decursive add on for removing debuffs from the raid effeciently. You can definitely add all of the quality of life features back in with classic, at least if it is UI related.
---
Gotta see your Tauren somehow
---
Don't you get it from Booty Bay?
---
It's not, Rogue definitely is one of the fewer button classes. I did like a triple take from 42-60 when doing it to confirm. Unless I did indeed miss one. I'll check again.
---
UD is better for pvp. Free skill trinket, touch of weakness gives 1 point of shadow weaving debuff and has a change to make melee blackout. Devouring plague is op as heck. In Bg's it still shines even with cleansing. You get a free first aid bandage from cannibalism from humanoids in pve and pvp.
---
Just a thought, but... why do people assume we can only have 1.12 and not the old AV?
---
I think it is a plausible change we can ask for, if the majority of Classic players agree to it.
---
Not one of these comments so far even tried to answer the question.... lol.
---
I would assume that you can do it no problem at level 5+. You may have to run to SW for your class trainer since Druid and Hunter don't have one in Goldshire.
---
You do realize that at least 50% of these reports are based on asmongold videos, a player who.... \*GASP\* palys alliance. Sorry, but it just hurts how crazy the community can be when thinking they remember 15 year old damage numbers correctly (not your comment in particular). The Stoneskin bug was not that relevant and was mostly the cause for Joanas tiger video. Don't get me wrong, reporting bugs is important, but people have to realize that their memory is foggy and Blizzard has a working 1.12 client (with an actual non private server backend) to compare things to.
---
Qeue some For Whom the Bell Tolls @ 10:40
---
Oh yeah, herp derp calculated the wrong way.
---
Something like that i believe &lt;_&lt;
---
Ah that's too bad my dude. Not for everyone and I didn't mean to push it on you. Just wanted to add a counter point for others still deciding!
---
This is what I did pretty much every level. I'd  expand my base while making a ton of archers to surround every space of the perimeter around my base.
---
Mmm Ragnar Os 🤤
---
One day actually.
---
Depending on server. I got to rank 13 playing about  12-14 hours during the week. And the weekend was closer to 16-18. I was in a pvp guild and we rotated who were in the top 1-3 spots. There was a point I fell out of the guild briefly when they had randoms instead of guild members in front of people who have been working their ass off. So I grinded I think most of rank 11 without them until they realized I was still top 3 or so and they needed me to slow down. Forced their hand a bit there.
---
It seems there are a fair amount of people who are focusing in on higher ranks... I got about 70% through rank 13 before I thought the patch was coming out when they changed the honor system so I went on a DK spree unfortunately. 
---
Still not sure if I have the time to pull off another grind like that but maybe I’ll start slow and if I can get in a good group I can push the last few ranks hard
---
Holy fuck that McConnel. Man that was funny 
---
No Towelliee in sight, glorious.
---
Who said anything about clearing them? Pull the mobs, wait for the healer's HoTs to pull aggro, Vanish, grab the chest. =P
---
I’ve seen people say it before, but if a racial ability is the difference between you performing okay and performing badly I don’t think the ability is the problem.
---
AGREED LULW
---
Thankgod on OCE we only have Quin and Chinglish which will be easy to avoid.
---
art
---
This was also super important for the "dungeon" missions since you had a very limited units
---
in EU that translate to 1 am to 3 am - not going to happen for me as I have a job to go to in the morning.
---
But if I am selected I will log in later in the evening, I hope someone will organize some fun activities at that time.
---
Also, if I understood correctly, they are merging the battle net drop down menu item, and I understood people don’t get email confirmation of the beta, which means checking if you got in beta got more complicated as you have to try to log in (and likely fail) versus just checking the drop down. Sounds about right or am I getting this all wrong?
---
pfUI is actually awesome
---
I raided through Naxx in vanilla (not pserver). I know. MC is just boring though. It has a bland orange backdrop and no real notable bosses besides rag.
---
You Can just do that on any p server
---
Solid, thanks a ton man
---
Im playing on a pserver and classic isnt hard. It just has old school rpg mechanics that aren’t very mainstream anymore. Fuck Baldurs Gate on the highest difficulty is harder than classic vanilla. 
---
The game is meant for 12 year olds and up. If a 12 year old can play it its not going to be super hard. I can’t understand people thinking this game is like playing against insane chess AI or something.
---
Dat fuckin widescreen tho, very jealous
---
undead cannibalize
---
FUCK RAIDER IO
---
Undeannibalize.

Just wait, imo. It's so "different" anyway. Just enjoy streams and pray for beta :)
---
oh yeah? well get fucked light boy
---
--Xxshadowgank
---
Sooo, doing what the average player will be doing?  Doing "random stuff" is probably the best way to ind any issues.
---
Watch the Blizzcon video where Omar goes on stage along with Ion and a few others.
---
Ion specifically mentions the LFG button is there but wont be useable. Its just from them porting classic onto the modern client.
---
Wait till you get to run with the big dogs at 60 with *ALL* your abilities!
---
Permanently I assume?
---
I need to sit down and watch this entire video, I watched maybe 10 min or so (time constraint). 
---
I am an antisocial player always have been, but my shitposting on realm forum and relentless ganking actually made me quite a few friends from both factions. A lot of whom I will be playing classic with. I won’t be raiding, I intend to continue my way of being a shit lord and see where it takes me this time. 
---
I’ll watch the rest of your video when I’m done at work.
---
Well of Course there are going to be Group Building addons.
---
There will also be gearscore addons. 
---
People will try to bring stuff they are used to have in modern wow. Nothing you can do about it.
---
Well, I would say Garr is notable as well at least. And for the looks, I just like the thematic raids.
---
And yeah, obviously MC isn't the most difficult raid, but its a quick raid once you are geared and I'd do MC over Onyxia any day.
---
Can anyone thats got a beta invite confirm if they got it without being a active sub? i see so many claiming both sides
---
There really was something to the original formula for these games, dude. Of course nostalgia is a factor, but that doesn't change the fact that these games were objectively great, too. That's why they got so popular in the first place. I guarantee if Blizz took a platform like Diablo back to the formula they used in d2 it'd also be a hit.
---
And dont forget shittier computers. 40 players all casting spells and stuff would cause a lot of comps to crap their pants. Input lag, video lag, low frames, etc made raiding a loooot harder
---
There better not be a fucking leash mechanic on world mobs (I guess Kazzak but everything else should be allowed).
---
You were able to kite shit as long as you wanted at least up until wrath, so things like bringing devilsaurs into crossroads should still be possible.
---
True, I mean you should even have +10 when rolling on loot due to being a “veteran” right 😂
---
The center thing was a ignite add on that popped up after combat :D
---
There are two types of people that watch streamers, the ones that watch for the game, and ones that watch for the streamer. I never really understood the first camp either, but to explain the second group, it's like listening to a podcast. It isnt so much about what theyre playing, you're more watching for the streamers personality and character or whatever they like to talk about.
---
TERRIBLE
---
well, even if this was real (which it isn’t by the way) what’s the most such an add on could do:
---
-	group only people from same realm
---
-	find a tank, healer and 3 DPS and tell them - group up
---
they would still have to walk to the dungeons, they would still have to run it.
---
I the end would that be so much different than replying to someone LFG in world chat?
---
Well keep your damn stress test for yourself Blizzard.
---
Why not ask your beloved streamers and youtubers to stresstest your fucking Servers !? ?
---
From what ive heard said on this subreddit is that most mobs were leashed to their zone by the time 1.12 came around
---
&gt; What evidence is there to support that “private servers got it wrong”?
---
All of the data and scripting for every mob and encounter was server-side, which private servers doidn't have access to.  They had to do it all from memory or watching videos.
---
Things like quest rewards, XP awarded, drop tables and rates, and a whole list of other things (including agro radius) were entirely made up by private server devs.  That's why there are major discrepancies between the performance of certain classes/specs on private servers vs vanilla, and why the fastest to cap on private servers was nearly 48 hours of playtime faster than vanilla.
---
There's an interview from one of the devs about it somewhere, but I'm struggling to find it, I saw it on this sub not too long ago.  Maybe someone else has it available.
---
Nah just seeing them at that location is enough for you to put together why they are there.
---
Yep, it’s gonna make bank, this sub kids themselves if they think otherwise
---
They weren't, I was kiting shit to XR on my DK back in wrath.
---
The only mobs that should be leashed are the world bosses, and I am only certain of Kazzak.
---
Not really, no
---
Engineering + Mining as I level, drop mining for herbalism once I've stocked a decent amount of ore for grenades and sappers etc.

Oh, this guy is active on the WoW Classic discord. Defends anything and everything about Retail. Huge tool.
---
In pve you wear a dress, in pvp you should wear plate, or at least mail.
---
I started like 1 week after TBC release, never played real vanilla. But, just seeing the streams it already feels like an rpg again. Frost Mages have Fire and arcane skills. Warriors have all the skills for tanken and dps at the SAME time. Just switch stance. In retail you only get the Skills you spec into. Also welcome black heroic strike &lt;3
---
What friends?
---
Just wait for STV that's when things get real heated and angry it's a warzone

Because raiderio type systems do to the new and developing player exactly what you’re complaining is being done to you here. The entire point is that you want a system like that because it helps you, but it hurts a significant amount of other players. Your precious right to a smooth run has a negative impact that is at its core antithetical to the vanilla experience. 
---
It’s completely possible to engage the community on your server enough to be able to form a competent group. It’s also completely possible to develop a large network of players you consider *worthy of your presence *. There is no cross server grouping. You aren’t pulling random people from across a multitude of servers or a battlegroup. It’s just your server, get to know people.
---
Maybe there is a similar bug with other buffs (Mark of the Wild, or other things which give armor)?
---
Can't wait!!

he was never a pro in fortnite but he was still really good, just not a pro
---
Any reading is better on vertical. 
---
Programming is a huge example where vertical is straight up better. 
---
But any text centric context is better vertical in most cases. 
---
Plus splitting the screen in half gives you less cramped applications when they’re on top of one another on a vertical screen compared to beside each other on a horizontal screen. The changed aspect ratio lends itself to less cramped applications.
---
Stoneskin totem doesn't increase armour, it reduces melee damage taken by a static amount.
---
Wait. Classic is a completely different experience.
---
I agree. Those dragon attacks were some of my most memorable moments from the early days of wow.
---
I am not 100% certain but I thought I read somewhere that corrupted blood might make a comeback for a brief period so everyone could experience the mayhem. I'm nowhere near sure if that's what I read or was someone wishing for it, but that would be goddamn awesome! Even if it's just for a few days or a week.
---
oh, haha
---
Asmonguy made an edited  video about the battle, I enjoyed that one.  But I don't watch raw twitch footage that format has nothing that appeals to me.
---
As I am starting again with druid I am pretty much forced to be resto. Sure I am fine as I did play resto from Vanilla to MoP when I started tanking.
---
I still do play resto druid quite a lot in retail. Hearing that VuhDo comes to Classic is huge blessing. I just love that add on more than anything for healing. It's challenging to use and set up but after you learn it, it's so customizable that you can easily make it to suit your needs.
---
I used to live with grid + clique back in WotLK and it was fine but after I swapped to VuhDo there hasn't been way back.
---
Hogger raid confirmed.

Most monitors have vesa mounts, so if your monitor doesn’t already rotate 90 degrees you can just buy a vesa mount and rotate it yourself.

In display settings you rotate the monitor on your OS so that it displays correctly

Noone Really knows
---
Man, i wish i still got some old screenshots
---
Cool pictures!
---
Hey guys
---
Im InsaneKane and im glad you like my addon, watch out for the next update where i include gearscore for smoother operation !
---
I got an email but I’ve heard people say they never saw an email but noticed it on the drop down box in the Battle.net client
---
Yeah it’s the mix for me really. I played 7 chats to 120.
---
Like, really ... the hearing is so fast. I stopped mid December. But at that point, I got 120 with my Druid, and every day I got like 20 itemlevel plus. Until I had like GS 376 or something like that after just one week hitting 120. and i am working full time, so I Play in the evening and Weekend. It doesn’t feel like a rpg. I feels like a slotmachine. You only hope For titanforging and nothing matters.
---
So I did Uldir normal clear and heroic 8/9, at some point every group wanted solo orbrunners or aotc achievement. And i really didn’t care the „stress“ doing ghuun heroic for the same itemlevel I get in m+.
---
I did Taloc mythic and imo the fight was so much fun. 
---
The fight should actually be like this on every difficulty, just more or less easy. It’s not the goal to jump down the elevator in lfr and die so you can go afk and don’t have to play this boring fight. Mythic version was so cool. And i did Mother. Well we tried, but literally wiped at 1% (11%). And Never got it :D
---
For me Uldir was boring as fuck, insane amounts of trash, most bosses were „kill adds fast“ mechanics and the overall visuals of the raid were bad. It all looked the same except elevator and ghuun lair.
---
In wod i had way more fun, tho I only played to BRF. We did BRF normal and HC and quit after. Leveling was fun, high maul was very good but BRF was insane. The different fights were soooo much fun. Never did pvp tho ^^ but I also never experienced this huge content drought:)
---
And because that's what vanilla was all about and how you meet people and build a strong community. Like I don't get that guy if you want a game where you only play with the best and clear the content as fast as possible then why the fuck are you playing classic? He does realize that there isn't anything more once the stuff is cleared, right? 
---
Keep that shit in the retail game. Keep classic, classic. If you don't want classic, then don't play classic. I for the life of me can not understand these people that hate retail wow and then want everything in classic that made retail worse.
---
(i might be wrong but what ive been reading so far leads me to believe...) these work for private servers that are based on actual vanilla and they definitely worked in retail vanilla but Classic WoW's API will be based on the current retail version and worked back. A lot of changes to the API moving forward on retail were to specifically break addons and macros that performed certain functions (auto ranking, cleansing, healing, purging, 1 button rotations etc)  
---
It means that none of the old 1.12 versions of addons will work. Addons that will work in Classic WoW will be closer to their current versions and will need to be slightly modified.
---
I think its stupid it requires an active sub to be eligible for invites. I would be ok with it if I could sub after I got the invite. I created my account in 2005 and simply because I dont want to sub for BfA I cant get a Beta inv.
---
Wait I thought I was remembering wrong and that I base my stuff on private servers, there can't be a damage bug in classic, that's what dozens of Blizzard zialots told.me.
---
I resubbed after years today. I just don't want to be wasting my money :(
---
Hey man if you don't mind can you tell me your character name in retail. With all due respect, you are exactly the type I never want to group with. I've seen your type a thousand times, you make a mistake that's entirely your fault and leave the dungeon instantly, because there's no way it could actually be your fault, you're a pro gamer.  Thanks.
---
You're not going to convince me to worsen my experience just because making my experience better might hurt someone else's experience.
---
Like I said, you want to hold hands and sing, that's your prerogative.
---
Nostalrius was a big vanilla pserver, before Blizz shut it down. Blizz hates pservers, but a lot of people claim classic wouldn't even be a thing without Nostalrius' (and other vanilla pservers) popularity
---
Any lvl five BiS lists?
---
Why do you want to play classic then?! Jesus classic was made LITERALLY for people that want to play the game from 2004
---
I'm in, didn't seem to matter.
---
Just because you spent 5 seconds putting some new text on it doesn't mean it's not a repost.
---
I got into beta yesterday. I‘ve resubbed my old account I had since Feb 2005 just a few days ago to check on my old characters. EU btw.
---
Still remember it 20+ years ago moving every unit individually forward one space with footman up front, archers and clerics in back, and eventually special escort units. And then waiting like 20 seconds to see if I aggroed any enemies from the scary corners or pathways. The patience I had as a young child
---
Love getting them Deviate Hides in Wailing Caverns.

I do find it pretty funny that so many #nochanges people are really just "make it like the pserver I play on".
---
early access and beta are not the same thing.
---
they are limiting their pool in terms of numbers and probably excluding the most die hard vanilla fanbase.
---
Ahh ok, my mistake
---
Legion was great imo. 
---
It wasnt Vanilla and had its flaws ofc, but I think it had some elements (like class identity and coolness factor) from it and it just felt cool to have artifacts, collect weapon skins, mage tower etc. Not to mention great M+. Halls of Valor will always be my favourite. Healing Hyrja on high Tyrannical keys felt so good. Raids were also quite good. DK class campaign was insanely good.
---
Cool. Looking forward to resubbing in August.
---
Bonus point for Immortal reference.
---
This is great, thanks for putting it together!
---
I believe Hunters didn't get Disengage until BC, also Priest seems to be missing Flash Heal.
---
Im InsaneKane and im glad you like my addon, watch out for the next update where i include gearscore for EVEN SMOOTHER operation !

Heh yeah I might check it out if have time

Wow he looks pretty decked out for a level 6. Most be Dodgykebabs sponsored toon.

Google `vanilla wow eastern kingdoms loading screen` and its in the bottom left.
---
The fact that there's like 10 of these posted a day says no Its not relevant anymore.
---
The first one maybe but now it's just annoying.
---
I want the content and the difficulty, but I'd much prefer some QoL things from later expansions. Since Blizzard has said no, the developer community will step in.
---
I've been using my beta access solely to develop a LFG addon that will be available on launch.

Is watching random guys play video games an American thing, or is that also common in EU and I'm just too old to have noticed?

Error 132? Had it yesterday after a few weeks break - the game was running fine in march. Needed to create a new prefix, copy the game into it. Then I installed latest DXVK into the prefix, disabled streaming in the launcher and set DX11LEGACY as the renderer (but not sure if the renderer is necessary, will test that later). Good luck!
---
Liar, 12 year olds don't have jobs and shouldn't drink alcohol.
---
Trust me. Re-subbing doesn't scratch that itch. I know cause I did it. Got bored in 3 hours.
---
No it isn't. That isn't what all of us want at all. I want classic. I don't want new classic. Look at bfa. Do you really trust blizzard to make new content? Is there a chance they make new classic content that is great? Of course. But is there more of a chance that they fuck it up? I'd say yes. And a lot of people don't understand the ramifications of seemingly simple things. For example do u know what I think is the biggest thing that ruined wow? And by ruined I mean ruined the sense of community, the sense it's an actual place, world pvp, etc? Flying. Flying did more damage to what vanilla was than anything else. Even moreso than dungeon finder. Flying made world pvp basically non existent cuz you could fly away. Made it where you stopped meeting the same people while you were levelling and making friends, etc. 
---
My point isn't that flying is bad or anything, it has it's pros too. My point is just that minor things can drastically change how the game feels and plays and I don't want those changes. Those changes are why we all want classic wow.
---
I had this. Showed up on launcher, no email so far.
---
fuck raider io, it killed retail
---
Disengage is def in Vanilla it just didn't do the same thing as BC. And yep, I added Flash Heal in at 20. :)
---
Possibly to stress test the server
---
In the old days I remember one av lasting at least 24 hours - you’d log off to sleep, wake up and then carry on the fight. Pretty epic (and beats wsg premise vs pug boredom) but not a particularly fast way to grind honour!
---
How does not wanting undergeared inexperienced players in my speedruns and wanting to be anywhere in the world while I use a nice UI to find groups translate to not owning my own mistakes?
---
Imagine being this triggered by someone you can choose not to watch. This sub is seriously making me lose faith in humanity lately.
---
The bottom left? That seems like it would depend on a lot of things.
---
I agree.
---
Hey kane i rate it, good effort
---
[deleted]
---
I could see them releasing things like Wrath and at that point it's going to be over for them once again. Hopefully they just decide to start over and not add in the stuff that made people quit in the first place.
---
They definitely do. I think flying hurt the vanilla experience more than anything else for example.
---
The Classic API currently allows the client to get the health deficit of the target and raid/party members. Frames simply wouldn't work without it.
---
The API currently allows casting different ranks of spells. Macros simply wouldn't work without it.
---
So how exactly do you think these addons and macros are going to be disabled?
---
PvP for Horde.
---
PvE for Alliance. Paladins and Dwarven Fear Ward are hard to beat.
---
yes
---

---
Man, I'm gonna Blink against a wall, until I'll get where I want. I have enough time and autism to succeed eventually.
---
?????????? Im sorry but what are you saying?
---
&gt;My point is just that minor things can drastically change how the game feels and plays and I don't want those changes.
---
But thats guaranteed to happen if they take the TBC route.
---
I did not even realised until you said it..blew my mind. I never fully accepted instant flight,but i guess that thing made me forget about the original flight paths..
---
you see it as a drop down window over the Play button (same as if you have more than 1 account). Also, you can see it on your battle.net account, you'll receive another game licence for WoW disguised as PTR.
---
So you read through all of it?  
---
What addon did he take the code from then?
---
&gt; else finding it hard to wait to absolutely shit on these streamers and their egos? I know not everyone can be 
---
Goodluck. Doesn't really matter how good you are when your outnumbered 10 to 1.
---
Lol. Damn the consquences. The world revolves around me. To hell with stopping 1 minute to think about why a 15 year old game has so much hype about a re-release. I don’t care about undermining the core features that made it special enough to last a generation. I’ll use my add ones and mods thank you very much because earning a spot in a top guild or developing a network of players is just too damn hard. 
---
My old school method of finding groups never failed before gearscore/lfg and will never fail because I’m always in an active and competent guild. It’s never been hard from BC to BFA to find a group the “old school way”. Did you really type that?
---
Ive rewatched this a couple of times now. I still think, from a technical standpoint, what they did to revive classic WoW is pretty awesome. Wish i could play the beta :(
---
Why do I remember this video ?
---
All that is good. Flying and welfare epics, not so much.
---
Not to mention the average internet connection was a lot worse than now, and server technology is far better.
---
That's literally what I just said
---
I think "Server Client" is as confusing as you are gonna get, actually.
---
I did 14/15 as a main healer priest in vanilla too. Back then we had like a roster that was split up in disc and holy. Only in naxx did we have any shadowpriests.
---
Private servers just optimize things to the maximum, healing really isnt a problem ( you could run like 7-8 heals early on, but most guilds still use 12 healers to build up a solid roster for AQ/NAXX ). Because you have SO much overhealing, all priests run PI spec and you have one that specs up to shadow weaving (after 16 debuffs). 
---
Debuff slots are like gold in raiding tho, 16 is still limiting the optimal dps so much that you cant use certain dots or things like paladin judgements on bosses.
---
RP-PvE
---
It is a change in the way that you cherry pick what you want.
---
Well. Two hours and a level cap at 5. Sounds like an interesting Hogger event too me.
---
Had some kind of bejeweled game as well iirc. So much fun.
---
For most dungeons, if your dps doesn't pull extra and "focus the skull", yea, you can very well carry as Tank+Heal duo.
---
Lmao
---
Tipsout is incapable of giving a solid opinion

Where?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bqw8oq/anyone\_else\_planing\_on\_playing\_both\_current\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bqw8oq/anyone_else_planing_on_playing_both_current_and/)  
---
seems pretty positive and not what you're describing.
---
It would be cool if we didn't actively try to fracture communities; people can play both.
---
Strong Elliot Rodgers vibes
---
Yeah, seems lot of EU got in this time. I got in and know at least 1 of my private server guildie who also got in.
---
Tailoring + Engineering
---
Viable? Sure. Fast or fun? Probably not. Dungeons give SHIT xp after the quests are done, so you will have to do an ungodly number of runs for each dungeon, and no LFG means you will have to repeatedly find new groups as most players won't repeat leveling dungeons many times.
---
 Wonder if blizzard would release a neatly packed turd, would you purchase it and consume?
---
And to think I used to hate McCool
---
I've been on private servers since WoW-One (Feenix) many, many years ago. This was while I was also paying for 4 subscriptions for retail wow for myself, my wife, and my two teenagers. I continued subbing while also playing retail. I just missed vanilla and only canceled our subs the day Nostalrius shut down.
---
From my own experience, I can offer that playing vanilla (no matter how "wrong" things pservers had going on) that it did not deter my interest in classic/vanilla once Blizzard announced a real version from the original developers. I have leveled to 60 more times on pservers than I ever did on retail vanilla, which was 3 times before TBC came out, and probably 20 times on "illegal" servers.
---
You and I may not be the same, but the experience of playing vanilla was, and still is, regardless of being over saturated, completely incredible. However, if you feel the way you feel, then go with it. On my end, I can't get enough of it. Watching streamers, playing pservers, or watching classic beta is not affecting me in the slightest, other than reliving things by watching others discover how awesome it is.
---
Someone will make a list and it will be glorious.
---
Try streaming, I hear that helps
---
I resubbed for the Beta the day the classic release date was announced. No beta, yet
---
Tailoring + Skinning, then drop Skinning for Engineering and eventually drop Tailoring for Enchanting, not sure if this is a bad plan tho
---
Try a private server if you'd like to get the feel for classic but I'd just wait. It's an entirely different game than current retail
---
Definitely satire. I heard about a dungeon.io addons for Classic, besically akin to gearscore. Not sure if that is a joke, too.
---
would questing with  the same combo plus aoe dps be faster? like a with mage?
---
You are amazing! I know this is out of the blue, but thousands of us are waiting for response of RP-PvP and a lot are waiting for oceanic server confirmation.
---
Could you kindly poke on someone and hurry up the response to these?
---
Keep up the good work, the classic team is really giving us the authenticity blizzard had back in the day with community conversation :)!
---
You mean like the entirety of what we're getting as 1.13 being a frankestein of various patches?  
---
  Guess we should release everything as soon as classic launches because that's how 1.12 was.  
---
  Let's release BC a couple months later too because that's what happened with 1.12
---
They do that to maximise subs and donations
---
I've got a couple in my guild, good people
---
I was using "Godtier" more like master of the class / game in the context of Vanilla. Or in Joana's instance, it refers to how much dedication he puts into mapping out the optimal speed path to 60. Watch any of the streamers listed and you'll see what I mean. They are more than masters of their class actually, more like masters of the exploitable nuances that the majority overlook. At least in my opinion.
---
&gt;the maximum level will be set to 5. The test will also take place on a  PvP realm, but since the starting areas are sanctuaries you don’t need  to worry about attacks from the other faction
---
What a relief
---
. . . I was being satirical, because combat between a bunch of lvl 5's with terrible equipment would be awesome, but are the starting zones literally [sanctuaries](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sanctuary), where PvP flagging is impossible? That's not the classic we remember.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
This. It’s so much easier to connect than it used to be. Any farmable event will be absolutely dominated by streamers. Just the way it is now.
---
I think this is a troll, but a couple of us are actually working on an LFG/LFR addon.
---
It works by creating a realm-wide chat channel that gets hidden from your UI. Whenever you "queue", your client sends a hash into this invisible channel with your selected roles and requested dungeons. All the other addons read this and add it to a cache. Whenever there's a tank+healer+3DPS queued for the same dungeon, their hashes get removed from the stack and the oldest player in the queue automatically /invites the rest.
---
We've got the basic functionality down, it's really just getting the UI to look like Retail. And we're thinking of adding some discord stuff to it too (the first iteration was a discord app, but we decided trying to get everyone on a realm into one discord server was one step too many).
---
The thins is, I really have no idea how Blizzard is going to disable the addon as they said they were considering. It uses the chat protocol, which a ton of addons rely on. There's really no way for them to stop it without breaking everything.
---
Blue post said the big thing this week is stress testing Wednesday and Thursday, and while most won't continue on to regular beta I think I understand some will
---
had, don't think decursive works anymore (nor would it with the legion api)? I might be wrong though, but I have more faith in blizzard being able to find ways to shut down the addons even if it means hurting minor things in the process since they control what you can and can't do
---
This is why I love being in a guild. Pugs are 90% filled with drama and players you don’t want to group up with again. Sometimes you get a good pug, but there is normally always one impatient or selfish player in them.
---
Np. I'm just dicking around finding anyone with questions and testing it. I'm pretty experienced with mage so I'm doing a lot with that class. If there is anything else you want tested let me know. So far everything seems to be pretty solid. I did notice you can't sheep a tagged target which was in 1.12 apparently. I'm blinking everywhere now trying to break it.
---
I learned to love gnome when I played a Tauren for my first time after. Everywhere I went it felt like it took 3 times as long. When I was gnome, I felt like I was moving 3 times faster.
---
classic wow ≠ raids
---
I mean you could always just look at it that Humans have a 10% Bonus to rep gains so your real min max to getting exalted would be with a Human.
---
You're the one arguing super dumb semantics and saying people are cherry picking.

---
Questing would be faster, yeah. By all means do the dungeon quests, but focus on questing in the world otherwise. I wouldn't recommend leveling as holy and prot, though as their benefits are unnecessary and their drawbacks will slow you way down. AoE DPS might be faster for you, but an AoE grinding mage doesn't really need you and would probably prefer to do it on their own as you don't provide any benefit and cut into their XP.
---
I think you missed the point. He will have spare time to level the alt when his brother and friends aren't playing as he doesn't want to out level them on his main. He specifically wants to level an alt.
---
Yeah, pfQuest is the most important one for me. I know elvui and luna are coming to classic, so thats pretty much taken care of.
---
I also would like to know.
---
It did at some point, but I can't recall if it was 1.12 or 2.0 that had it. I was in a few multi-guild channels.
---
At 1mbps even with an invite I'll probably miss it. lol
---
1.9 made LFG and Trade link between cities. I vaguely remember that horrible global LFG channel, but I thought it was 2.0 that added it in preparation for the upcoming BC stuff. I've been looking through patch notes and can't find when it was added.
---
Instead of thinking how much dps/hps I can do just think about what playstyle you would like.
---
Yeah I'm not too worried about rep though as opposed to DPS at least.
---
I'm pretty sure a corpse has a more interesting life than that guy.

So it seems lol
---
Looking for guild
---
* Intended region: NA
---
* Intended server type:  RP or RP-PvP
---
* Intended faction: Alliance
---
* Intended raid/play times: 7:00 PM Central (approximately three times a week as able)
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild:  This is very specific... I am hoping for a casual raiding guild.  I want to raid, but I am a package deal with my family.  My dad is not a good gamer and I would love to see him in a guild that is pretty social.  He played the old warcraft RTS games, diablo 1 &amp; 2, and we have casually played WoD and Legion, but I think he would really like the RPG feel of classic.  He would probably like dungeons, but not the longer raids.  I am a little hesitant to bring him on a PvP server, but i think if we ganked some suckers in Arathi at the right time, he would enjoy the little bit of world PvP.
---
* Any pertinent rules: fun over function.
---
* A preferred form of contact : PM or reply on reddit (just to get things going)
---
Normal guilds will expect ALL players to make an effort for raiding. Bis is not required for all items but they expect players to gear up.
---
Food buffs. Elixirs and pots are required by tanks. DPS and healers, as it helps all your stats.
---
Holy damn that chart is misleading. You're right that it declined, but whoever made that chart chopped off 20,000 from the y axis to exaggerate how dead it was.
---
In any case, one thing that's nice with classic is that we can expect content updates for the next 1.5-2 years. The population will of course spike and then drop immediately after BFA fans leave, but I imagine it will steadily grow over the remaining time period. After that? I don't know. No kings rules forever, my son.
---
CC DPS classes can make some dungeons way easier, but not required if tank and healer are doing their job well.
---
Shit if I'm going to raid as a mage in vanilla then this addon is basically required. Thanks for reminding me
---
Gratz. I hate you.
---
Naah. Have a friend invite you, leave group inside instance and log out. You will get spawned at instance door.
---
Roll gnome, wow model changer.
---
No i love gnomes i love them so much it created a fetish to have an orgy with gnomes irl havent succeeded yet fortunately
---
Just how many quests can we get done with a group of level 5s? I’d like the think the level 8/9 Murlocs in elwynn wouldn’t murder us all...
---
If dungeon.io is anything like Raider.io it won't even use gfear to calculate score. On retail it only looks at dungeon completion times to calculate the score. 
---
I doubt this will even work in Classic though, as there is no api to track dungeon times.
---
Just a heads up, for some "mysterious" reason this change doesn't always stick.. so sometimes even with this toggle it jumps to the new design. 
---
In that case search "old reddit extension" for your browser, it will force a redirect to the old design.
---
They need to advertise it somehow and giving beta access to streamers is the cheapest and easiest way.
---
someone recently postet a line like this
---
/run C_Timer.NewTicker(60, function() DoEmote("laugh") end)
---
use it and bless yourself and everyone around you with /laugh every 60 seconds. just embrace the annoyance
---
An over 3x drop in players is still a lot.  
---
And yeah, I think classic will survive even more than OSRS, also they said if we wanted independent development that they're open to the idea, but I feel like people would prefer TBC -&gt; Wrath servers instead, I highly doubt we'd get both options though.  
---
I played on Nost for 2 years, I know that Classic will survive healthily.

Wow, that addon is legitimately terrifying. I really hope Blizzard either removes whatever functions allow for it, or at least permanently bans anyone who creates, shares, or uses it without warning.

In what way did it hurt retail? I don't really use it (have it installed though). But i don't really see it impacting anything.

Wow Classic Remastered is coming 2029.

Is there a way to see exactly when the account was registered? I only can see the transactions concerning digital expansions. Unfortunately i forgot when i started wow vanilla :-/
---
*Troll Shadow Priest is absolutely, undeniably better than UD*
---
I'm sorry but I can see an argument for why Troll might be the preferred SP race for pvp, however by saying it is "Undeniably Better" you can't be anymore wrong; and I'm sensing that you haven't actually pvped with a Shadow Priest in vanilla based on your post history.  
---
I think you underestimate how strong WOTF is, that ability alone causes serious pvpers who are planning to main lock/sp roll horde.  Ontop of that they are other strong aspects of undead.  /u/noo0baca goes into a more in-depth explanation in a comment below.
---
I mean Asmon gets \~30kish watching youtube videos. comparing his numbers to a raid stream numbers aren't a good comparison
---
people dont get invites because their score is too low, and their score is too low because they havent been in that dungeon
---
Bug
---
there's a druid trainer in SW's park.
---
But you have to go back to Darnassus to do the bear form, cure poison, and aquatic form quests as they are only given by that specific trainer. The rest just tell you go meet him.
---
Yeah I guess the major difference with classic is the fact that not every class has a generic aoe, stun, escape but each has their own niche.
---
Yeah don't bother with a TL;DW ...
---
asmond still not have the axe?
---
No emails, i think you need to restart the launcher for it to appear. At least thats what i did every time i checked it.
---
roll Human.
---
seriously, the bonus intellect won't make that much of a difference. roll a race you're happy with rather then one that is "BiS". what's more important: min-maxing the game or rolling a race you enjoy?
---
i'm going Night Elf Priest, which, is probably the "worst" Priest race just because i enjoy the animations more then the Human ones.
---
A similar functionality already exists in Vanilla. The meetingstones in front of dungeons are used to automatically form groups. You get put into a queue when you click on them. This was added all the way back in patch 1.3 and was only removed when TBC came out, because they turned them into summoning stones.
---
The current API also allows the client to get the information also, that's not the problem.    
---
Over the years, starting with 2.0 TBC Blizz implemented a bunch of measures to stop addons/macros like the ones discussed from functioning, not from retrieving the information.  
---
It's pretty impressive how far some of the vanilla addons used to go, they would automatically re-position your allocated raid frames in a number of ways, it would work out who is the most important healing target based on incoming damage etc (still possible) but it would also re-position the unit frame to the top of your custom frames or list of frames so you didn't have to use your mouse (no longer possible since blizz implemented secure frames in combat). modern addons can still show you the information but do so with visual indicators like glowing frames.  
---
Since 2.0, health (or lack of) is no longer a conditional that can be written in to a macro. You can't make a macro that checks missing health and uses rank 1 healing touch if its 100-300, rank 2 if its 300-500.  
---
Where you used to be able to leave your mouse over the top of your custom healing frame list and repeatedly press a keybind for your custom macros, you will have to at least hover over frames and cast the appropriate spell.  
---
Theres probably an addon that tells you what rank is most effective to use on your target but you will have to cast the appropriate rank with an individual keybind or click.

I can see this being a big problem with quests like the BRD prison escort for trinket and ony attune.
---
Because you want cherry picked content as has been pointed out. They give you this, and next they need to add or remove something that be others ask for otherwise you guys with your smaller voice as you said, got preferential treatment.
---
And every time one of the no change brigade says to go play retail you prove the point most of us know is true, that you think the game is some playground meant for you because you're special. I was in the original beta, I played the game in 04 until now (I admit rarely, especially this current snore of an xpac), and I'm in the beta for classic right now. And guess what? It's awesome. 1.12 was the best choice they could make imo. We got vanilla, we got basic QoL changes without going too deep, we get the final versions of many great pieces of gear (some will argue progressive is better but we were never getting that so least the version we get is the best one in most cases).
---
 They have already fixed a lot of our complaints about their plans and to expect them to continue to do so is insane. No one in the beta is going on like this in public chat because the game is straight up fun as it is. If you don't like it then that's unfortunate but that's all it is. I hope you come to the realization that we got something incredible on our doorstep and you need to enjoy it as it is and not worry so much. You will have fun, I promise you.

Alchemy + Herbalism.
---
my main character has been Alchemy + Herbalism since i started in Vanilla back in '04, even tho i lost that account, when i came back during MoP, i picked up Alchemy + Herbalism again and stayed with it until Legion. i haven't played BfA yet.
---
yea but it's not just the int, escape artist is really good for pvp
---
This was the episode that aired two weeks ago.  If you haven't seen it yet you can't even call yourself a fan of the show at that point
---
i didnt get anything ):
---
Ah ok, never really seen that happen myself. Then again, i play 90%+ of the time with friends and guildies and i try to stay away from the matchmaking tools whenever possible.
---
Same actually, I vividly remember pissing people off =/
---
Is this maybe something that got changed in 1.12?
---
&gt; it will try to put a warlock in every group that can summon you.
---
Pretty obvious satire there. :)
---
Streamers tank? You mean like lvl 30 tanking on the beta w/o talents? There are plenty of guides online but before every boss pull you should already be stacked on rage from the previous mob. Rage has never been a problem for me.
---
While I don't want raider.io, all these people claiming it killed retail are fucking comical. I don't really have any friends playing BFA and I strait pugged my way to a 1400 score in 2-3 weeks and I get in groups easy now. I don't want people who haven't put any effort in my groups and that let's me know. Just like if I'm forming up a group with pugs in classic and invite someone to realize they're in terrible gear for what we're about to do, I'm going to kick them. They haven't put in the time and effort yet.
---
The only people who think raider.io is bad for mythic plus are the ones happy to ruin a key with a couple shitty plays or do terrible dps. There's a timer on the dungeon, there's not time to hand hold a shitty player. Classic won't have a timer gating your ability to get gear, so that's not an issue.

Unexpected GoT meme.  This gif has good potential

Rage starvation is the lot of the warrior.
---
After all these years I still hear my undead warrior telling me /
---
not enough rage
---
I'm not a complete newbie, but my memory of Vanilla and preWotLK is hazy at best.. so unfortunately I am going to be that guy in dungs that has to ask for advice and needs constant direction (same with talents and certain weapons).
---
I was going to run either undead warrior, priest or troll shaman, however I am concerned that when I get into group scenarios that require a tank or healer with a bit of know-how, I am going to let the group down a bit.
---
So my question is (depending on the ratio of complete newbs vs veterans, should I role tank or healer, and if I do, how should I approach group scenarios if that group mainly consists of veterans.
---
I'm quite eager to learn, and will likely be playing with friends for most of my levelling, but I hate being rushed and exposed to angry, impatient people if the general expectation is that a tank or heals should know what they're doing.
---
&gt;Ooo a chest! WAIT DON'T OPEN THAT! Everyone /roll to see who wins the chest.
---
God waits for no man, and neither do I on chests &gt;:)
---
Preach video, he gives a lot of good tips for Warrior tanks especially about Rage conserving.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wj5W42GiUE
---
You're always rage starved and have to spend it very wisely on multiple mobs. You have to be on the ball, it's difficult from deadmines all the way till 60. Hint: build rage toward the end of a fight so you have rage for the next pull.
---
Nah it's just Bobby B, he's so good, he can wear plate armor at level 6.

The success of OSRS can be widely attributed to the great dev team and the updates they made to the game since OSRS was released. It's a completely different game now, but thanks to the fact that the dev team listened to the community and the polling system it was a huge success. OSRS was dying before it got major content updates. And the same thing will happen to Classic unless the dev team finds a way to keep players interested after Naxx. Whether it be new content upgrades or BC or whatever, they need to add new content for Classic players or the game will stagnate and die in a few years. And this is not an issue they can start working on in a few years, they should start thinking about it pretty soon.
---
I know and understand it, which does not mean I have to like it. 
---
Those streamers have no interest in finding Bugs or whatever. They even Report "Bugs" which are no Bugs, because they likely never really played classic back then. 
---
In the meantime Players like me or many others who have played vanilla for far more than 1000 hours back then got no access.
---
This beta is a pure PR beta. It has nothing to do with Fixing stuff.
---
I get the Point of this. They dont want People to burn out during beta and they want a big Hype and alot of PR from Content creators.
---
You're correct, Ion has mentioned a couple times they're thinking about bringing back both the corrupted blood and "unkillable" c'thun.
---
Within the simple macro API, you're right. But an addon can absolutely change the keybind to a different rank of a spell based on missing health.
---
I'm watching cdewx on Twitch now and he has 2 entire bars full of abilities full of keybindings. Which is around the same as BfA currently.
---
" i am strictly pvp player"
---
End it there, wrong mindset dude. This is vanilla wow, every aspects of the world and its activities are linked.
---
To be a competent pvper you will need to raid as well to get some off sets/weapons etc.
---
Above all you will need a guild and a group.
---
Cheers
---
If you have a competent healer and not total shit gear you'll have multiple mobs hitting you and generating rage. From what I remember leveling my warrior in vanilla beyond the initial pull where you have to manage your rage to make sure mobs are sticking to you and not running to the back lines, you will have plenty of rage to sunder everything and hold aggro easy.
---
I started leveling my warrior when people were still learning how not to be terrible and I got compliments almost every run at how well I held aggro, how much dps they were able to unleash without worry, and how little the healer had to sweat about keeping me alive.
---
Honestly, leveling a warrior was some of the most fun I had in the game. People always talk about how miserable it is but as long as you keep up on your weapon you're golden. Between being able to make a dungeon group instantly and flying from mob to mob with charge and intercept warrior is a blast. I played an undead and with bandages and cannibalize I had little down time.
---
I would definitely not level as prot as the talents aren't going to make or break running low level dungeons, and arms/fury is so much more fun for solo leveling. I ran as arms and it was the best.
---
Hope this helps! Running dungeons at sub 60 is one of my favorite parts of the game so let me know if you hsve any questions :)
---
yeah it is, but seriously, aesthetics and enjoying your character are much more important, imo, then min/maxing your character. i don't think i could play Dwarf, even if Fear Ward/Desperate Prayer are awesome. i just don't like how they look with the old models. if we had the current ones, though, that'd be different.
---
I am interested would like to follow up closer to release.  I have a few friends and family that I will want to bring along, but most importantly is my father who, admittedly, is not a good gamer. He used to play RTS warcraft, diablo 1 &amp; 2, and I got him to join me during WoW WoD and Legion.
---
I, on the other hand, want to get into some raiding, but nothing too hardcore or mandatory as my schedule varies greatly depending on time of year.
---
Grinding quests  &gt; grinding &gt; traveling quests &gt; dungeons; in terms if exp. 
---
Don't bother with them, unless you wanna have fun of course.
---
Well, if you arent tanking a boss or multiple mobs in a instance, you are going to be rage starved. But once you have aggro off 2-3 mobs its not too bad. And ofc gear and levels will help. But its mainly that dps keeps their dick in their pants at start, so you can get bit aggro on all mobs, get the rage you need and can keep aggro on them.
---
If they aoe at start, then you are just running around trying put out fires. Better just give up and try to get few back, let dps handle what they pulled. If they die, on the next pull they will be bit more careful.
---
What I think could be the best compromise would be once every few months they give us a 2 week period where they bring back the original. That way people can get a chance to try it out and see what it was like but not have it be the only option. Try petitioning it that way maybe, more likely to get a special event twice a year than a permanent change
---
It's very good idea for them to let us play classic for just the sub. A lot of the most avid players already bought original WoW and all its expansions one by one. Those people would grumble a bit and buy the new version of classic, but a lot of the people who are sceptical about the game wouldn't.
---
Getting into the beta proper seems unlikely, they said its a small beta and seem to be going for that so far. However, the stress-test weekends seem like they wouldn't be that hard to get into. If you've not played retail in a long time it's not like it's absolutely dire. It's just not very good either, but I came back a month or so ago and I've mostly enjoyed myself progressing. Seems like its starting to fizzle out now though. But if I don't get into the beta I think I'll enjoy 8.2. as long as that's enjoyable.
---
I don't see how that would work, since theres no M+ in Classic, so there are no leaderbord API's to base the score on.
---
Nope. They said "we may be restricting some of those new things as well" when talking about the API functionality in relation to addons that disrupt the vanilla social experience by being able to communicate together. [Source](https://youtu.be/wS1juqaiW3o?t=2542).
---
But to do that, they'd have to remove all addon functionality with chat and that would break just about every addon.
---
I leveled a mage through Vanilla content during WOTLK, and it was definitely easier and quicker than Vanilla. However, I still enjoyed it because you still got talent points so levelling felt meaningful.
---
One thing I can say is by WOTLK they changed the elites throughout the world to normal. So, in places like Jinthalor in Hinterlands the mobs were no longer elite. So those quests became way easier to complete. I remember back in Vanilla it took me a full group and a couple hours to get through Jinthalor.
---
Awesome. Thanks.
---
I think rogue could be sorta, kinda, eventually like Retail Enh (Which i play also) but the play styles of every class is so vastly different that nothing really lines up. I will be playing Shaman, knowing they are lowish damage dealers in dungeons and even specced enh i will be healing so i need to save some int gear
---
[raider.io](https://raider.io) in classic?
---
I say go for it.
---
Gearscore won't be an effective metric because Classic has a shitload of items that break the powercurve that gearscore assumes; higher ilvl doesn't mean it's better in a significant amount of cases. Also, gear scales linearly in Classic, the differences between a MC raider and a 5 man geared hero aren't as drastic as the equivalent on retail would lead you to believe (AND some classes don't really get big gains from gear to begin with until they hit some of the later tiers).  
---
Completion times of dungeons is a really adorable outlook; how do you quantify that a lot of dungeons are built to be their own zones? If you are going to do a BRD run that goes all of the way to Thassarian, it's going take hours unless you are in a 60 only group, which is a tall order when the dungeon spans from 51 to 60. What if you are just doing Jailbreak for Ony's attunement? More importantly, how does this addon differentiate between the two? 
---
There's a lot more stipulation of content with any given dungeon in Classic then there is on live. Are you running Dire Maul East? West? Full clear of all wings? What wing of Mauradon? Full clear? What if you don't have the Staff to actually clear everything? UBRS/LBRS? Who has the key for UBRS? 
---
If you are looking at it from a raiding standpoint, this is still a really stupid idea as most raid bosses only drop 2 pieces of loot that have to be distributed to 40 people so it's not like someone clearing raids regularly will be super geared until literally months of doing it and at that point, they likely have a consistent group/guild they run with.
---
Honestly, most content can be done as long as you have warm bodies filling out your group. Limiting yourself on who you invite is going to backfire spectacularly and only make you look foolish. I'd be really surprised if this sort of elitism really caught on in any meaningful way. 
---
Trying to use modern metrics to vet players in Classic is an exercise in futility; being an elitist about them is just going to make people not want to group with you. 
---
Even if you try enforcing these arbitrary metrics that don't mean anything, you are setting yourself up to limit the amount of people you are playing with from the outset and are likely going to find groups considerably slower which is setting yourself up to fall behind in the long run. 
---
Classic rewards persistence, not skill; those who roll the dice on players will get things done quicker than those who don't AND will likely have more friends to continue running things with then someone who is being a tryhard in a game that just doesn't reward it. 
---
As I said, go for it, I will enjoy watching the tryhards who don't "get it" trying to enforce arbitrary vetting processes that will only lead to them getting laughed at.
---
OSRS receives constant new content updates and quality of life/bugfixes. The game was actually close to dying until jagex polled to recreate the God Wars Dungeon, content which was after the game build they originally rereleased. 
---
As much as I enjoy Classic WoW, people really need to be more considerate when comparing OSRS to Classic WoW, because the former isn't the case of a game build locked in stasis, but a build that was receiving less and less player attention until efforts were made to reintroduce later content and introduce new content, etc. 
---
While the devs say they want new OSRS content to retain the feel and principles of the old game, that seems to be an utterly alien perspective compared to WoW Classic's strict #nochanges community. They are two very different cases.
---
Resubbed before or after the initial wave?
---
hey bliss plz stop people from playing the game they want to play the game
---
But why...
---
Or even just give the map to the pvp team ans say "do this"..
---
Also I´m not subbing to test their servers. Waiting until August.
---
Just out of curiosity, why in the world would you want a LFG addon in Classic? Also LFG is for automated group matching. This will not be allowed. Maybe with some tweeks it might be allowed but why?
---
Undead meth sores lol love that one
---
Thank the gods for Bessie
---
My entire point was that WOLTK had the highest subs, and a big part of that was that it was the end of the Arthas story. Every expansion since has steadily gone down in sub numbers. I don't know how to be any more clear about that. You have trouble reading apparently, so I'm done with this conversation.
---
It gets better with gear, stats and talents. Then it gets even worse because you'll be stacking defense, more armor etc. so you will be hit even less thus get less rage. Such is life of prot war. Half of the threat responsibility falls to DPS, if they are getting threat capped, they just have to suck it up. You're looking at the right class if you're looking for challenge so keep at it.
---
Uhhhhhh those are the figures Jagex themselves put out in January.
---
Rush if ban, very against tos
---
Get used to it boomers, vanilla is a streamer game.

---
Old school RuneScape continued to iterate on the original game. I see no problem with them continuing to release level 60 content to keep people playing classic. With that being a proven model employed by literally the most played MMO in the world right now, seems like the obvious way to go.
---
I understand people wanting them to release TBC ect. However, they'll lose people every time they "release" a new expansion if they force it on people. The other option is to maintain servers for the old expansion every time they release one. That just doesn't seem practical from cost/corporate perspective. So I really don't see them doing that.
---
That addon is an abomination against the Universe.
---
After.
---
So VERY against the TOS they overturned the last ban wave because of it.
---
Escape artist won't be as good for mage as it will for warlock
---
To zoom your camera further out
---
Alright put the pitchforks away for now. True vanilla is still on the table.
---
As someone who could be considered a casual (&lt; 10 hours a week), would Classic be the game for me? Are there casual guilds and will I still feel like I have a reason to play?
---
this sub needs to ban twitch clips
---
1) When a company tells me (a developer) that something might not be allowed, I like to force their hand. To break the functionality of the addon we're developing, they'd have to remove the chat API calls, which would completely break most addons.
---
2) I want to be able to click my interested dungeons and go back to doing something else without having to be in a certain place or read chat.
---
"Unsubscribed player, awaiter of the mighty beta invite. Forced to watch the streams while the testers level, duel, have fun and run dungeons."
---
Think of gnomes as under dogs, every other race towers over them. You have to earn your stripes when your tiny, your character could be doing just that.
---
So can you be invited to the stress test but not have access to the beta?
---
The damage values of 1 mob was incorrect in 1 circumstance and people on this sub took that to mean ALL damage for ALL mobs was wrong, even when proven otherwise.
---
They no longer report the direct numbers. You have to look at the total active battle.net players, which is largely wow and other evidence like Google search trends.
---
It's not huge for mage or lock. If you were tossing up rogue or warrior EA is really good, but mage and lock both are fine without.  
---
It is nice, but human perception is nice sometimes too. EA on mage/lock isn't dramatically better than perception imo.
---
Because with a few button clicks, I'll be able to get into the next group for whatever dungeon I want without having to read chat or stay in a city. I can go back to doing something else.
---
And because Blizzard says they may disable it and we believe they won't be able to, so it's a challenge to us.
---
Play human. Playing a race you hate because its slightly better will get you nowhere as chances are you'll lack the motivation to actually play it to a point where having the bonus int and EA actually matters.
---
I find the lack of engi + combos....Disturbing
---
EU, got in today at this time as well. Day 1 account. Also played closed and open beta for vanilla. Been in every beta since Cata and got into BFA alpha. In case anyone want to know.
---
Do you really think you will get smoothers runs from it?
---
You should stop climbing questionable towers to kill you enemies
---
Wait, I though ALL mobs were doing at least 50% too little damage in all circumstances? The servers cant possibly have the right values in almost all other areas, that's what dozens of private server zealots told me.
---
WoW is still a fun game to play while waiting for WoW to release lol. 
---
For real though give it a go BFA isn't nearly as bad as people say. I will be splitting my time like 70/30 in favor of classic.
---
Its because Asians are often kept out of high level  positions in jobs and schools due to BS factors like "lack of leadership qualities" that people in power throw around to keep them on the outside. 
---
The fact that so many succeed despite that is often used to explain away why it's okay and couldn't possibly be happening.
---
I watched that today and right after it finished I checked and I got into the beta
---
Not only that but an addon that assigns a score to gear is going to be next to useless unless you manually go through every item in the game equipped on every class and determine how good it is on whatever arbitrary score system you are using. 
---
Item level in classic is not going to be an indication of how good a piece is as there are a lot of items that are much better than ilvl would suggest. Likewise, there are a lot of items that are a lot worse than both their quality and item level would suggest, Vendorstrike is a notorious example.
---
Imagine people paying you to test your game.
---
After 2 to 3 years I think I rather go play TBC again. I dont thrust the choises of people to be better than the choises of blizzard pre-cata.
---
I'll have to get that extension.
---
Because yeah, like you said, for some "mysterious reason" it doesn't always stick.
---
HEY BLIZZARD HOOK A BROTHER UP MAN! I'LL SUCK YO DICK!!!
---
I play in 540p now. Because I have no gpu. And my brother wanted to watch me play so I streamed it for him and that's all my integrated graphics could handle.
---
Here I thought we were having an intelligent, analytical discussion and all of a sudden you resort to personal insults.
---
Good day to you sir.
---
Well, I'll be able to see the gear, spec, and previous experience of everyone in the queue before accepting their invite, so... yes.
---
Thanks for the heads up and the tip.
---
Secretly I am glad, I guess I will be doing the long walk once again from the night elf starting area to the human starting area at launch!
---
The only thing I will say for TBC is it actually made all the specs somewhat viable. I feel bad for the people who want to play ret pally or any other "meme" spec in classic. That said, I don't want them to progress to TBC. 
---
I liked TBC but, adding another main city, concentrating max level people into a smaller world and adding the first iteration of the dungeon finder, didn't like any of that. Also, personally gripe, I freaking hated the tanky resillience pvp gear. God I hated it. Making raid gear more or less useless in PvP made me quit doing PvP.
---
The level uo sound, ding!
---
I love it. But then I like healing in raids. What I love most about shamans is the versatility. Especially in pvp and group pvp.
---
I forget are there pet talent trees for hunter pets or was that later xpac
---
Same here, skipped to wc2 😜
---
WC o&amp;h is literally unplayable for me. WC2 is so much better
---
Hmmm would argue with maybe Blessing of Sanctuary here ... but thats 30+ at least and quite to high for BFD.
---
Are there any other spells that reduce damage taken directly? Or maybe items/world buffs?
---
You just run through as a ghost and rez at the graveyard in the area you want to be in.
---
&gt; I explained in another post, but warlocks weren't an issue in WSG, but in duels/arena because of abusing bandages, long lasting DOTs and LoS.
---
Ah, gotcha. When I was playing duels were usually held on a flat bit so LOS wasn't much of an issue, and arena is a whole different game to 19 WSG with 1.12 rules.
---
But I can see how they would be nasty if they had an obstacle that blocked arrows to hide behind and you weren't allowed to get too far away from them.
---
The pserver I'm on right now has huuuuge aggro range, and the mobs follow you for miles.
---
Only thing i have to complain about is orc start area ground or actually EVERYTHING, its soo red and soo bright. It literally hurts your eyes (it was late EU time so its mid day in ST, if that matters). The gamma/contrast/brightness sliders didnt really help make it anywhere near what the area looks in private servers. I dont really care that it looks the same, i just want stop the eyestrain.
---
Same settings in tauren area, aaah, it was so much better.
---
I love how much better the client works, its so smooth. 1080ti didnt even ramp up fans (just in one area in tauren lands with max ground clutter, all options maxed, 8xAA, 3440x1440p @ 100fps.) Load times are much better.
---
Horde don’t have proper plumbing
---
They poo in holes haha
---
i bet they gonna test the layering in the start area with this
---
That's one of the reasons why Tanks switched from 1h Shield to Fury Tanking - which generates more Threat/DPS/Rage
---
awesome, this really reminds me how crazy good Benediction was (is)... You get it in MC and then never swap until naxx as it is that good :D
---
Hogger raid incoming
---
I played a gnome twink and I loved it the little guy doing big damage is always fun you will learn to love it.
---
Twitch clips can be really valuable to have, but I agree that this here is usless content.
---
Sorry just now got around to checking replies. But you got it right. I specifically want to be leveling an alt for this exact reason.
---
Its listed alphabetically.
---
Yep, on Pservers 40v40 were 100% decided by scout + rush tactics.
---
The reason for this is that by the time the server uploads the packets with the characters approaching, the 40man raid is already on top of you.
---
So you're basically just chilling, then suddenly there's a 40 man raid literally on top of your head.
---
Really hope they fix character draw distance / rate.
---
I hate that guy. He just sits in Asmongold's call and complains while his chat calls him McCool. That's the kind of nickname he would get as an elementary school substitute teacher who cancelled homework.
---
This is why I love classic WoW
---
Not Vanilla and I forget the mob name but there was a demon outside of the Black Temple that was un-killable without a quest item. 
---
Kiting him to Honor Hold or Thrallmar was hilarious.
---
I did take 1 month sub when the beta was announced, got in yesterday with rest of the EU (non-streamers).
---
I was hoping joana was back!
---
WC 1 is actually free on abandonware and runs in dosbox
---
I don't need to do any research, it absolutely is better to be Troll in Vanillas PVP style. No doubt.
---
Yes. 100%. Did you even read the readme file? :D
---
/O/
---
⌨
---
So the addon "updates" your gear, spec and exp to the server just like raider.io? 
---
The forming a group with the right classes is something you dont need the addon for.
---
As I did some higher m+ before I noticed a big diffrence between the lower and higher groups.
---
Higher rated groups seems to break up faster than lower groups. In classic the dungeons ain't hard. Its not like high keys. The best pick would be a social group that sticks around till the end. A group breakup is a bigger timewaste than a few wipes with all the traveling and group forming. I understand your worry about doing dungeons with "bad" players but the game is easy enough with 2 lines on explanation before a boss of hard tresh pack. And when the game is this eazy, having done a dungeon before sais not much about the players skills.
---
Also within the classic communitie raider.io and gearscore like addons are looked down oppon. It will not atrackt the "better" players I guess.
---
I wish you luck with the programming but there is zero need and low intrest for an addon like this would be my guess.
---
LOL good at the game? Who? I know it's not Esfand, Asmon, Swifty, Tipsout. Vernuki is a retail it seems. Only one I can think of is maybe staysafe since he seems to be more focus on speedrunning.
---
AoE frost mage, easy choice here. Not as fast as warlock or hunter to level up but when you get to farming you will outcompete everything with the amounts of things you can kill at the same time. Count in other utilities as well: not super gear reliant, freakin TELEPORTS, free food and water. Skinning is going to net you 50+G/hour alone if you're farming beasts, even if you vendor it. Second proffesion doesn't matter but any gathering one is obviously going to be best moneymaker.
---
Hope we get them I would hate bad ping can kiss rank 11 goodbye
---
It doesn't prevent you from it, but it also enables you to not participate in any socializing, since it's not necessary. Look at retail wow, does lfg or lfr prevent people from making friends or talking to another? Nope, but the people stop doing it because it's not necessary.
---
I'm not sure who said it's not your right to choose who to play with.
---
And once again, Kevin Jordan said this outcome was not intentional. It **was not** intended that Seal of Rightousness procc *more* effects than SotC.
---
You're just repeating the fact that this was a design oversight that was not intended and was fixed in the pre-patch. Everyone already knows that.
---
A metric shit ton
---
In case someone is not being ironic here...it is Game of Thrones.
---
Holy crap I thought I was the only one who did that. I remember going through some dragon infested place for hours getting absolutely massacred. Before realizing the small entrance into the next zone I thought I found wasn’t usable (at least I thought it wasn’t)
---
I hope blizz notices just like other games give the players the tools and the zones dont force it on em
---
Rogue stealth, murlocks, gun sounds, blink, frostbolt, the wandshot sound...
---
I love all the sounds but the best one is a dying male night elf.
---
only one of those things we were talking about but keep going
---
Life is overrated anyways
---
Ayyyyy fellow scaper.
---
HENCE THE JOKE
---
I don't think the classic numbers matter much for BfA, but it'll get interesting when they release a new expansion. Right now Blizzard won't care if a person plays classic or retail as long as they pay for the subscription. But if they don't sell the next expansion because people just play classic, well that's when things may change
---
Well, as someone else pointed out, apparently you'll be able to /who and see everyone on your server's faction, regardless of what layer they are on but I don't know if that's true.
---
Is this Pre or Post Reckoning bomb?  I can't remember.
---
Real Pepega right here.
---
# &lt;Lok'tar Ogar&gt; [NA-PvP] [Horde] - {PvE + PvP} (Semi-Hardcore)
---
**Lok'tar Ogar** \- We are currently recruiting members for our warband!
---
Hello everyone! I am Ryan aka Draka/Lovings the GM and MT of &lt;Lok'tar Ogar&gt;. I will continue playing an Orc warrior as I have done from Vanilla-Wotlk. I peaked in Wotlk as a server first Fury Warrior and guild officer. Unhappy with the direction of retail and the warrior class I unsubbed.
---
Here we are today after almost a decade later. Awaiting the relaunch of classic wow, and I couldn't be more excited!
---
This will be a **freshly formed** guild. You will **not** have to worry about a veteran guild core that will be biased towards new members and loot. This guild will create lasting friendships and accomplishments that will follow us until the end of the server life.
---
***Our Guilds Goals***
---
* To be an **active** and **known** guild on our server to both Horde and Alliance. We strive to be role models to other members of the Horde and our community members; while maintaining ruthlessness and dominance over the Alliance. **We are looking for Dedication.**
---
* **Experience** and **progress all content**. It goes without saying that we will clear all dungeons and raids, PvE world bosses, and enjoy PvP/WPvP. As Blizzard will update the game in phases, we will stay competitive and up to date with each phase.
---
* **Have fun** and **make friends**! If you're time investment with &lt;Lok'tar Ogar&gt; is not valued, enjoyable or you're hard work is not recognized... what is the point?    *Zero tolerance for drama and poor etiquette; will be dealt with immediatly.*
---
* **Strength in numbers**. Through leveling and gearing we will need to help each other and have each others back: dungeons, group quests, elite quests and being ganked and camped. It is expected to come to the aid of anyone who needs it.
---
* **Using time efficiently and effectively**. The player base is a lot older now most of us have commitments outside of the game. With this I hope also brings maturity and wisdom. Our guild is a team. Every member will have purpose. If you are constantly late or absent from guild events, everyone will suffer. Min/Max is not required, but encouraged. Everyone will be lent a helping hand up, but you are expected to pull your own weight and be the best teammate you can be.
---
***Raiding*** \-- Suicide Kings / Loot CouncilRaid Group 1 will start Raiding *one month* after launch.Looking for Class Leaders as an active leadership role.Most raids in vanilla thankfully do not take a long time to clear if well prepared. Know your pre raid BiS prior to 60 we will help you, ask questions!
---
***Raid Group 1*** \--Suicide Kings / Loot Council*Tuesday/Wed 8:30 PM - 11:45 PM EST*
---
This will be our **progression** raid comp with only our Mains BiS + consumables. Players are required to maintain an attendance of 80% (Every 5 weeks you can miss 1 raid group. Min 2 hr notice)After every raid people will have the option to stay in raid groups for World PVP as a full raid, Premade PVP or World PvE. *Every 60mins Raid time will be a 5 min break.*
---
***Raid Group 2*** \--/ Loot Council*Time -TBD Thurs/Fri or Sat/Sun*\------(RAID GROUP 1 UNTIL PHASE 2/3)Between phases 2 and 3 there will be a second raid group formed. (Raid Group 2)We expect every player at some point in phases 2-3 to have an alt level 60. Group 2 runs will be used to help gear up Mains in group 1. Swap out players who go on vacation, play and practice with new members, enjoy meme specs, create more gold for the guild, farm more recipes and just fuck around. We can also sell loot to PuG's from group 2 when it is no longer needed and split the gold equally across guildies. This has a ripple effect as our group 1 and group 2 no longer need gear we could start 3rd alts or sell more loot and everyone will profit.
---
***Community Events***
---
* Duel tournaments, Scavanger Hunts, Meme Contests -- for prizes!
---
***Enough about us lets talk about you!***
---
* &lt;Lok'tar Ogar&gt; Is looking for Semi Hardcore players ages 21-35.
---
* Commitment, Respect, Honor Trust are core values.
---
* Some Prior Experience in World of Warcraft is Required.
---
* Discord + Headset and Microphone.
---
All Roles are Currently being reviewed and accepting all applications Here or on Discord!Lovings#0346
---
No you volunteered to play early, not to test. I doubt you give a shit about testing considering you miss the entire point of the stress test alongside the beta, you're just an entitled fuck.
---
I would watch Asmon if it wasn't for McDouche.  I appreciate Asmons sarcasm and understand that he makes and defends dumb arguments for interesting controversies.  McClown just thinks being as rude as possible all the time is funny.
---
First rule of comedy: Being intentionally annoying, is still annoying.
---
I don't want them to take the tbc route
---
Fucking rekt
---
Wtf? But thats the reason I rolled mage...
---
Gear score in vanilla is not the same as it was in wrath. Gear score in vanilla is pretty fucking useless for what you want to accomplish here. Looking at a players gear is much much better.
---
This won't happen during realease unfortunatly...
---
Players will focus on leveling.
---
Top content
---
Okay. I'm heavily siding towards mage instead of hunter, especially due to that comment chain discussing how dungeon farming will be getting hit hardly the reset change.
---
But I like to RP as the asshole...
---
I remember that somewhat vaguely!
---
They don't email. Just check your battle net account
---
You wrote what I was thinking. I hear those all the time on television including the boar sound.
---
I don't think a lot of people here realize that you are being literal. Gear score in vanilla is literally useless for the purposes that is being talked about here.
---
#NOCHANGESREEEEEEEEEEE
---
How the fuck can you guys put so múch time into complaining about everything.¨
---
Things like this will obviously not go through, and those of you who complain that we can arrange characters in the character select screen are flat out retarded.
---
Just fucking stop
---
Are you sure this isn't just a feature of the bug they've recognized ? As in, you've put down a stoneskin totem, you now have the permanent buff, and then when you put down a new one it doesn't change anything.
---
Yes, that was definitely not that way in vanilla.. fix pls
---
In one of the earliest interviews, one of the devs said they will flat out block any addon functionality that does exactly this, so I don't think anyone should worry yet.
---
Personally, I'm fine with the concept because I think it's funny.  I'm much more concerned with this guy not explaining how it works.  I have a really bad feeling it just automatically searches for classes with the /who Search function and spams invites at everyone.  I would absolutely hate that.
---
Private server raid bosses have increased stats, like armor values increased a lot, take C’thun for example, has around 2000 more armor than vanilla, therefore expect melee dps to have a large increase in dps on classic
---
You make it sound like doing what the majority wants is a terrible thing. But a vocal minority should dictate what others get - thats fair to you.   
---
I cant even speak about what AV version is more enjoyable. I never played the old version as I only started in BC. But if your whole argumentation revolves around "if you dont like the stuff I like you are not a real xyz..." then I dont want to be on your side by association.
---
Every man for himself is arguably one of the best racials in the game especially for pvp. Although escape artist has a shorter cooldown. Picking gnome isn’t for everyone but I like it because people seem to underestimate you as a player.
---
The first part isn't what you said.
---
 To answer your question though, I said your type. It's an implication based on my interactions with the same type of people. I never said you claimed to do those things. I said the same type of people that act the way you do based on information you provided do what I described.  It's a stereotype, one that I find to usually be true. 
---
Can you answer my question though, why do you even want to play classic? It isn't about going through content as fast as possible, it's about being part of a community and world,  the things you want will destroy that community. I can't understand why you would ever want to play classic. The things you want are a big part of the reason for why the game is in such a sad state right now.
---
You're right, in part, but there are many Alliance players suffering a separate issue regarding low damage
---
will give him a chance, I was enjoying staysafe since he was doing a route I planned to do, and we both learned many things from his 1-12 run.
---
So if a fellow horde pulls 2 by accident Im not able to help him out by sheeping one? This is a bad change..
---
You wont be excluded.
---
But Dwarf Priest and Human Rogue have a pretty big advantage in PVE.
---
Orcs are absurdly strong in PVP so you'd wanna pick them most of the time if you're going to pvp.
---
Undead male ofc, is the master race, so if you're a rogue, mage, warlock or priest on horde side, you probably wanna be going with that unless your a wanker.
---
Tanaris is a nice sequel. Can't wait.
---
What I like McConnell
---
They will hopefully make modern wow better by understanding what an MMORPG used to be.
---
They do
---
This is the biggest reason I quit. It’s not the terrible itemization, dead worlds, or terrible story. I just miss feeling like a mage. Now I’m just caster 2 with blue spell effects instead of purple.
---
The addon doesn't rank players based on gearscore. We're not using any score at all (besides an upvote/downvote system). You're simply able to see the group's gear before joining the group.
---
The main point of the addon is set-and-forget. You can login, choose some dungeons you're eligible for and would want to get in a group for, and then go about your day, not having to stay in a city or a zone, not having to read chat, etc.
---
And there are some very useful features, such as making sure someone in the group has the right key (or lockpicking skill):
---
* Scarlet Key for Scarlet Armory+Cathedral and Scarlet Hold in Stratholme (or a rogue with 175 and 275 LP respectively).
---
* Workshop Key for Gnomeregan
---
* Mallet of Zul'Farrak for summoning Gahz'rilla in ZF.
---
* Yeh'kinya's Scroll for summoning Avatar of Hakkar in Sunken Temple (or someone with the quest).
---
* Scepter of Celebras for Maraudon
---
* Shadowforge Key for BRD (or a rogue with 280 LP).
---
* Crescent Key for Dire Maul (or a rogue with 300 LP).
---
* Skeleton Key for Scolomance (or a rogue with 280 LP).
---
* Key to the City for Stratholme (or a rogue with 275 LP).
---
* Seal of Ascension for UBRS.
---
* Drakefire Amulet for Onyxia.
---
* Attunement to Molten Core
---
* Orb of Command for BWL
---
* Honored with Argent Dawn for Naxx
---
This is just one of many features.
---
Sandor is the best character on GoT, fucking fight me.
---
That doesn't work
---
Right? At first I thought Asmon was just being polite since McComplainer didn't get into the beta but for some reason he kept him around so that he can sit around and playfully insult people. It's not cute. He also sounds like Seth Rogen, have you noticed?
---
The qol things are what destroyed the content and difficulty. you can't really see the relationship? You really can't see how a dungeon finder destroyed talking and meeting with people? You can't see how only accepting the best applicants destroyed making better players all around and building friends and community? You can't see how only having the best players so you frankly get carried through content destroys the difficulty? 
---
Also vanilla wasn't difficult. I don't think you even played difficult. Vanilla wasn't harder it just took longer. Having to bandage or drink after a couple pulls isn't hard. Having more downtime and less attacks isn't harder, it's just different. Mythic plus and current raids are exponentially harder than anything in vanilla. Qol changes are what killed the sense of a world and community.
---
There are videos from 2005 vanilla wow, Joana leveling guide for example, where you can look the damage of tigers and compare the two, you literal cretine. But no, Blizzard can't POSSIBLY fuck up ANY values and introduce bugs, no no, it's ALL those meddling private server dudes that try to compare Classic with em.
---
STFU.
---
\#feelsgoodman
---
Its not shaky at all. Everything we get is in its final 1.12 version but access to content is staggered.   
---
Is AV in its 1.12 version? Yes.   
---
Is AVs release staggered to roughly reflect the timeline? Yes.   
---
Logic checks out.
---
&gt;  It isn't about going through content as fast as possible, it's about being part of a community and world
---
This is your opinion. I've rolled with a speedrunning guild. We plan to have fun in our own way.
---
Disclaimer: I don't support LFG/LFR in vanilla.
---
If we feel the need to ask Blizzard to prevent us from using an LFG add-on, maybe LFG isn'y so bad after all? If it was genuinely as bad as everyone claims, we wouldn't he worrying about it.
---
You're on the wrong subreddit
---
I know I'll be rolling a Tauren Shaman as my main. I might do an Alliance rogue again though. That was a good time.
---
You're right. Our addon doesn't use any sort of "gearscore", it simply allows you to see everyone's gear before joining the group.
---
Alright I wish you luck. This is never something I would use but i get that you think its handy. My idea is by removing the social aspect of groupforming people are way less invested in the group/dungeon and chances the group will fail are increased.
---
Indeed, to bad they screwed the series tho.
---
Is say best money makers will be Herb/Mining and farming mobs / DM as a mage.
---
You can make some decent money off enchanting also if you have the rare patterns.
---
Which hides sabatons of blazing light
---
Yeah, that made me think it was fake, but then there is actual code that looks legitimate, so I don't know.  It would be as useless as Meeting Stones in Classic if all it really did was just spam invites at people based on class.  But perhaps it's intended to be annoying as hell considering the entire thing sounds like satire.
---
You said it's not my right to only join smooth runs.
---
Choosing who to play with so that I can guarantee smooth runs is my right.
---
Hahaha, i thought the same as you. I feel so dumb now
---
Yes but that's the point.
---
Hogger raid ..... Confirmed.
---
When you join a group, tell the group before you start, if you plan on rolling on something that isn’t for the spec your in the group as. Like if you join a group as feral, but you plan on needing on resto gear instead, then tell the group before to avoid confusion
---
Who is representing godtier for other classes?
---
I disagree with you, but the shit clips need to stop.
---
Whether you like it or not the Streamers are brining tons of attention to the game, and will make for some great experiences and events across the servers.
---
Brilliant. 11pm for the UK. I won't be playing that then because sleep for work is more important to me.
---
You better be able to get into Hyjal, It was one of the best moments in vanilla for me. 
---
At the end of a raid someone just took us there and it blew my mind, an entire zone fleshed out but unused and saved off, iconic stuff like archimondes skeleton in the world tree just hidden.
---
And then I saw the construction signs and it was crazy seeing something so out of place, with the water pit that you drown in before you reach the bottom.
---
It's on my list of must do's.
---
Not with that attitude
---
I do and I also keep checking my bnet account
---
I know what you mean. I do not like playing tauren. It's fine if others play taurens, and I think they look cool in armor. But I do not like playing them, and I won't play them. If I cannot be Forsaken, then I won't play Horde.
---
I say play a human. Accept not having the intellect racial. Humans get other racials. Play what you will enjoy playing. Don't force yourself to play a race.
---
He has literally put random parts of various addons, renamed the variables etc to make it look more convincing. The addon does nothing. :P
---
Ah okay, I always wondered if exactly this was possible when I thought of addons "communicating" with each other, and I figured it was possible from what I've heard of addons in WoW since late Mists &amp; WoD.  I'm not particularly in support of it for Classic at all, but I do find it interesting.
---
Indeed, in one of the earliest interviews, the dev said they will block addon functionality that tries to do exactly this, but I assume it is as you say: If they block, for example, addons communicating with each other, I have a feeling that could stop a whole host of addons from working that people consider basic, but I'm not sure.  Is there a very specific, niche function your/your team's addon uses that could be blocked to break it without majorly affecting other addons people commonly use?
---
Yea because they thought it was too extreme of a ban without warning. You have been warned now. If you think you wot get banned again idk what to tell you, but I know i sure as shit won't risk it.
---
A lot of people aren't joining a dungeon group for the social aspect. They're there for gear or quests or something else.
---
&gt; Alright I wish you luck.
---
You might not want to. If we are as successful as we hope, then the old ways of finding a group will die a slow death. Between us and something like Discord, there won't be "LF [Role] [Dungeon]" spam in chat. Our goal is to make the addon a must-have.
---
Really?  I thought there were ways to do it.
---
Some people claiming it here:
---
https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/534914-world-of-warcraft/46049391
---
Berserker Stance at level 17? How did you do that
---
I tried watching a retail stream, and it was zoomed out all the way. I thought I was watching League for like 10 minutes haha. So flashy and.. boring heh.
---
I don't know which xpac (my guess is Cata), but pet talents weren't a thing in classic.
---
HAH, if you're experiencing a 90% problem rate, something might be wrong with you.
---
Hilarious!
---
Dont act like there werent any group finding addons in vanilla.
---
I remember using a tool called "Call To Arms". It basicly scanned and stored the /lfg /world /4 -chats for text messages with LFG/LFM in it and showed these in a nice interface.
---
Looking forward to use this again since it keeps the chat windows less spamy (since those messages wont appear anymore in chat if that option is selected)
---
Not to mention it's a whole different video with similar name. But who cares right
---
I did say "at least", eg. "this is the minimum number they'll have to open just to cater to the pserver population".
---
At this point everyone is more than clear that there are no keys. Chill
---
I enjoyed some of it for a bit too, but it absolutely did not work well, phasing and world quests made wpvp awful. Suddenly you would phase into a 40 man horde area who are in a group doing a wq and it's just nothing.
---
&gt;  If you wanted to play classic on launch you'd have to sub before hand anyways you're still paying month to month you don't pay by week. The only way you'd lose that money is if you quit before your sub ran out later on down the road. 
---
I don't need to subscribe before the game launches. I can start it when I actually can play the game. And I do lose money. I'll be paying for 2 weeks that I won't be playing the game. I don't want to play BfA even though the subscription is tied into it.
---
&gt;Allowing you to claim names is perfectly respectable, and with beta normally you have to prepurchase to get it so I'd say this is fine. If you want it bad enough you'll pay. Nothing is free, if you bring that kind of attitude into classic you'll just end up sour.
---
Or, Blizzard can just allow everyone to have the same opportunity to make their character name when the game launches. Like it was when it originally launched.
---
Not going to lie, that plus bubbling people to yoink their chests completely sold me on Paladin.
---
You forgot about the little Payo ofc
---
Seriously, pure misplacement of the r/iamverysmart 
---
Someone who reads this addon description and even has to take the effort to look at the code, seems to have not the slightest feel for satire. The description is dripping with sarcasm and you really looked at the code and are now acting like is wan't obviously a joke? Come on dude
---
&gt;only expect you to attend 1
---
Actually expect you to attend 3 and they choose which 1 you get to be in
---
Nope, and you can't find a single video from back then showing the same red trail as there is now.
---
Druid and hunter are usually the fastest levelers and both get early extra movementspeed, but honestly just play what you want. Classic is a long haul game and even 'few hours per day' is enough to reach level cap, and by then you will have fully explored a lot of the game.  
---
Reasoning: 
---
Lets say you go slow, you explore within your level zones and you read quest logs. If you don't know where to go, you kill some mobs near you while finding out where to go. While travelling and exploring, you kill mobs as well. Its not grinding, its exploring! You're the berserker, here to conquer the land you cross and your enemies shall fall before you!
---
It might take you anywhere between 240 and 480 hours for a max level character. Fully grinding it would be about 180 to 240 hours. You play 2 hours a day (14 avg week), and you'll be max level within 3-6 months real time. As much as you can, use your hearthstone and log out at the inn each day for rested xp.
---
Install a quest addon, (maybe skip quest logs), maybe use a guide, don't spend time unneccessarily exploring outside of your level zone or travelling for single quests, as you'll get around eventually... and it would take you, similarly to fully grinding, 180-260 hours to 60. Put in some extra hours on weekdays (4 to 5 hours on 2 different days) and you can even maintain a raid schedule in a semi-serious guild, if you farm your gold/pre-bis doing the weekends. (Raidlogging)
---
Both scenarios assume you know nothing of classic prior to play and that you aren't new to gaming in general.
---
Not saying you should do this, just saying that its possible. The only thing out of reach for the long term player are PVP rewards. PVP get benefits for intensive playtimes due to the decay mechanic. That said, reputation PVP is certainly possible, i.e. being exalted with alterac valley if you fancy.
---
Just play what you want, imho.
---
You can type "blizzcon 2018 classic wow panel" in youtube, its the Ion part near the end.
---
Ok I'll bite. Why?
---
In that case it would not seem to work on anything, in lavender_hog's example it works on plainstriders.
---
This is what I loved about Cata, getting only blues and needing to really manage your mana as a healer. This kind of took me back and it felt good.
---
Are you being serious?
---
Night elf Druid
---
Lmao yooo
---
Then why do you keep on saying you are developing a gear score add-on? Do you know how ilvls works in vanilla?
---
Yeah difference is twitch banned anyone streaming pservers bud. Even sodapoppin and asmongold couldn’t get away with streaming them.
---
Had this idea as well!! Sounds like a great way to keep the community active
---
&gt; Indeed, in one of the earliest interviews, the dev said they will block addon functionality that tries to do exactly this
---
Not quite. They said "we MAY be restricting some of those new things as well" when talking about the API functionality in relation to addons that disrupt the vanilla social experience by being able to communicate together. [Source](https://youtu.be/wS1juqaiW3o?t=2542).
---
&gt; Is there a very specific, niche function your/your team's addon uses that could be blocked to break it without majorly affecting other addons people commonly use?
---
No, it literally only uses the SendChatMessage API call and the CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL event. We're specifically not using any function calls that weren't in the 1.12 versions of DBM and Recount (and that are also still available in the modern API). If they're going to break our addon, they'll have to break the two most popular addons in the game.
---
Your analogy makes a lot of sense to me, I see this differently now.
---
its world wide. Games are sport now.
---
I find female gnomes to be far more tolerable than male gnomes.    
---
Also, running around after downing a noggenfogger in WSG and nuking people is the best.
---
At least something good came out of season 8.
---
Cakeday and beta!! Gz
---
Who's ready for dungeon.io and parsing in classic
---
We're not developing a gearscore addon, we're developing a LFG/LFR addon. I mispoke when I said gearscore. I really just meant gear-inspect.
---
Thank you for the clarification.
---
Yeah, can't wait to play demon hunter!
---
I also played LB. Alliance or Horde?
---
Honestly I think it's pretty smart of them since I've had a few friends immediately re-subscribe to retail just for the chance of getting a taste. People are willing to do quite a bit to get back to the year 2005.
---
Every Man for Himself was not in Vanilla. Humans had an activated version of Perception back then.
---
Imagine thinking this lol
---
Well, it worked.
---
Does your add-on recognize what talents a person is specced into?
---
Your comment just bashes blizzard but doesn't actually address my point. If they let all these huge private servers up, they might lose their IP. They aren't going to let that happen. Same with EA/dice and privately ran bf2 servers.
---
Looking at the time table, my guess this is only for US.
---
Shadowguard is an awesome spell and very powerful.
---
DP is a burst ability but cost a shit ton of mana and can be dispelled.
---
Troll &gt; UD
---
Sacks of shit tend to crawl back
---
Are you using baldur's gate as an example of an easy game?
---
*Longsnout spawns*
---
Classic.db is another option.
---
Asmon grew with the BFA launch and peaked at 88k viewers in uldir. Watch his stream stat page. The BFA launch was what made asmongold that big.
---
A week of hype of a new game is not an indicator for anything.
---
And that asmon can draw 100k viewers is the direct result of his successful BFA launch
---
I checked out some youtube videos and added him to the list. Can't believe i've never heard of him before.
---
Ok
---
I'm sure they are out there. Just throwing out the ones I've grown to know and respect.
---
you also really smart or?
---
This version of AV will not be the same as the Retail Version. This version will take about 4 to 8 hours to win. 
---
The version you are referring to took about 3 to 4 days.
---
Started in vanilla, hit 60 in TBC.
---
Out of your perspective it must seem like it :)
---
even on the best faction, you are choosing the worst race. Gnomes are where it's at.
---
level 5 endgame boyz
---
Good thing they are all NA, my oceanic server will be safe.
---
I could have handled it if the AI was actually competent enough to not just walk past enemies and die when on attack-move. The amount of babysitting troops require on top of the clunky controls made it too frustrating to play.  
---
I now understand why they skipped it when it comes to remasters.
---
Yea ofc that is a risk. However since the audience to watch streamers play wow is somewhat limited, it's highly unlikely that will happen to many realms.
---
But Blizzard should be aware of the possible risks of streamers, which is the reality we live in, and you could easily discuss tools to limit this kind of server-flooding. 
---
Just a few from the top of my head:
---
- Limit character creation to those who allready have a lvl10+ character on a realm.
---
- Have people on the realm be able to send invites to new people, if they want their friend to come to the same realm even if it's almost full. And limit amount of invites ofc.
---
- Limit faction creation early to keep faction balance (If for example an alliance streamer make lots of people start playing alliance)
---
- Free character transfers to selected low pop realms.
---
And all these tools would be healthy w/o streamers also, just to keep healthy stable communities.
---
as a long-time alliance player, I only roll night elves when I play druids. Bearded dwarves and gnomes are the only races worth playing.
---
ok this sounds more fun than the other beta. 24hr of madness.
---
I honestly dont see anyone in method switching to classic. Maybe if they decide to step down from WF raiding to chill a little bit. World first raiding on retail is hard, time consuming, and challenging, even mentally. To step down from that to have a less stressful time in classic makes sense. But no competitive player will sack BFA for classic
---
You're too sure about it not being another bug.
---
Beta is beta is beta is beta.
---
Class?
---
It's on that same addon site willitclassic.com [this one](https://willitclassic.com/view/fBiZ2n2XfMqpSVIRZ1m6)
---
I was an Orc Hunter.
---
Taurens has racial perk for higher HP.
---
So there SHOULD be a difference, but dont know numbers.
---
Try it for yourself
---
&gt; some of the best world pvp I’ve ever experienced has happened in war mode
---
It's not really wpvp if it needs a "mode" IMO
---
1. They have more than enough beta testers. They probably wont even be able to fix all the bugs until release. Thats how every blizzard beta goes
---
2. The die hard vanilla fanbase was probably playing the game when vanilla was released and people with those accounts get priority so most if not all of them will get in the beta. 
---
3. I dont think the benefit of requiring a sub would outway a few good beta testers. The fact of the matter is that the big things are going to be found and fixed but there will be small things that arent right but thats not because we dont have enough beta testers but because they dont have enough time
---
Does that mean if I clean off dust from my Sempron 2400+ with 7600GTS, I will gonna have a bigger chance for the beta? I just remembered, my old 80GB drive still have WoW installed.
---
Be right back.
---
And my streak of not getting a Blizzard beta in 15 years continues.
---
I am not faction bound though. I'd play either side.
---
i only casually tanked in vanilla but main tanked from tbc onward on a warrior and pally and have to say up until recently rage starvation was a pain in the arse, and in some cases better kit could make it worse, knew a druid tank once that thought he was a god for getting over 100% dodge, cant do it anymore but could in TBC, until he went to tank and realised by not getting hit he was getting no rage, same is true for warriors, you want to get hit just not that hard or have the health to soak it so you get the rage

\##**&lt;NAVN KOMMER&gt; \[H\] \[EU-PVP\]**
---
We are a Norwegian guild who still havent landed on a guild name. We are a very broad guild with high ambitions in many areas. Our two main goals are to 1. have as much fun as we can while playing wow, and 2. raid all content efficiently and at a high level. A large part of our core members up til now have extensive experience with vanilla content (both from retail and in "more recent versions").  
---
We are despite not having a name yet, quite developed with a discord of more than **200** members, and we will definately be one of the top Norwegian guilds to look out for. We are also communicating with other Norwegian guilds and communities who will all choose the same server. So rolling with us means starting on a server with a large Norwegian community. We have a better detailed description in the welcome channel of our discord server.  
---
Norwegian is our primary language, but swedes or others who understand Norwegian are welcome to join. We have quite a few swedes already. **Velkommen inn!**

Sometimes the aggro range can be reduced because of lag, ever notice a mob just randomly aggro you even when you (and the mob) didn't move? Might be that.
---
McConnel is needed to stop Asmons head from exploding js
---
I remember fearing enemey targets tagged by other players who were definitely not grouped with me.
---
Smells like Blizzard is making a change that didn't happen on vanilla live retail.
---
Poly should not in any way shape or form tag the target, tagging is only given upon dealing damage.
---
Applying a dot also doesn't/shouldn't tag until the first instance of damage.
---
The tradechat is now a working actionhouse. The looking for group chat is now the groupfinder tool.
---
Ah! Well I guess you’re just gonna have to roll gnome then!
---
No. So many posts asking the same thing.
---
So that is what that icon is! Thanks:D
---
it’s a beta, not early access.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**​Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK or simply apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
*P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.*

---
if you can would report it as it may just be something that was overlooked and not planned to be left in, problem is where they are using the modern system and putting classic onto it some things will get missed
---
Do you see if you got an invite, if you currently don't have the game installed? Like I see in the bnet client only the "Install"-button but I cant choose any regions obviously.
---
dwarves are practically horde as far as i'm concerned.
---
gnomes can fuck right off.
---
Thanks for giving me hope... -\_-
---
It is very likely that I will be hosting a horde guild. but I am in the same boat. I played as Horde for the entirety of WoW so far so I wouldn't be opposed to going Alliance. It really just depends on how many of my "old" friends I can get onto my guild rooster before launch/beta.
---
Why are there so many people asking this question?
---
Imagine being retarded... Guess you don’t have to imagine hard. After nostalrius Blizzard made it pretty clear to twitch no pserver streaming. Find any proof of a decently sized streamer risking their paycheck to stream some classic wow after twitch started enforcing the rule (you can’t).
---
That just seems awfully greedy.
---
&gt; Looking forward seeing hundreds of level 5's slaughter each other in massive PvP battles.
---
The true stress test is letting everyone spawn inside the jail of gm island give them invisibility and let them cast AoEs.
---
Same lol I’d say the majority of his viewers like McConnell, he provides content and is pretty funny as a juxtaposition to asmon
---
they're doing that with raid frames
---
but fuck you i want to play vanilla
---
I need to find a mage that focuses on pvp! Vurtne levels of godtier!
---
Each to their own. I will be using a quest helper add on.
---
also remember unlike on retail not all dungeon's quests are at the entrance some are out side some are part of a chain in the area of the dungeon, realistically you are better off questing with your healer mage group and then when you get the quests fro the dungeon do it once at least for the quests and then keep questing outside
---
You get sapped/poly'd. Leaving you helplessly watching the other dude peace out on the boat/zeppelin.
---
I dunno how they tested it, but let's say they started testing against a plainstrider without the totem, then put the totem down and saw damage change. Then went on to a zhevra, put down the totem, no change, etc.. 
---
Probably not the way they tested it, but just saying it could've been.
---
Yes. When you get invited to a group, you'll see the gear, talents, total number of clears, and a custom rating we're experimenting with (essentially just an optional upvote/downvote system that decays over time) for every potential member of the group (except the ones you're already grouped with, assuming you all queue together).
---
We're still deciding whether a potential 4 group members should be able to exclude 1 group member and re-enter the queue or if, after "inspecting" everyone, you can simply decline to join the group and re-enter the queue yourself.
---
I used quest helper as soon as I could back in 2005. This time around I'll actually take my time and read most of the quest texts, I hope this will create a better feeling of immersion.
---
I really wanna try a prot warrior but I have very limited tanking experience and that was with retail.
---
Probably because of how popular early access is these days. Younger people likely view a beta as essentially the same thing.
---
Cant you just excapt that OSRS died within a year and had to be revived?
---
If you think otherwise...
---
that's the classic spirit!
---
Yeah F that 3rd rule. Gatherings nodes are a free for all battleground. Fighting with another gatherer for nodes is part of the fun.
---
I'm not sure what class he will be playing this time around, but Cilva is an awesome mage that comes to mind. He doesn't usually stream though. I'm sure some of the great retail R1 mages will be amazing in vanilla as well. Xaryu has been streaming a lot, but he's got to get some practice in to adjust to vanilla.
---
well, all the old forums i've seen have been pointing at a difference between scalings for weapon skill when the difference is greater than 10, so we'll have to wait and see.
---
Does anyone who got in have something showing on their battle.net account ? I'm in work at the moment that's all!
---
That’s not very gang related of you
---
Being in War Mode is the exact same as being on a pvp server since there are no pvp servers anymore.
---
"To each, their own."
---
maybe sanctuary means this: 
---
  Though all starting areas are protected by level 65 guards, there is no real need for them, as quest givers in starting areas are not flagged for PvP and may not be killed by enemy players, even on PvP servers. This is likely intentionally done by Blizzard to prevent enemy players from killing beginning quest givers and preventing new characters from playing the game. 
---
I recall that you are not automatically flagged for pvp as a player (even in the main city that is ?)  but can flag yourself for pvp  
---
source: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Starting_area
---
Reputation depends on level not area, that is you get less rep for lower level quests. If you plan to go to Darnassus as soon as you create you char and level there you'll get the same amount of rep as you were leveling in your area.
---
So... would you consider yourself bifactional?
---
I’ll see myself out.
---
I will use one just for the convenience and the fact I wanna reach endgame faster. If it wasn't for that I would probably not use one.
---
I got my email two days after I got beta access... so yeah, they do, but it’s smarter to check your launcher.
---
Yep... some people like it. But I imagine most vanilla players hate it as I do, which is why it’s good we have vanilla and retail.
---
Yes definitely, I can only play for the same amount of time and I will be playing. Plenty of others are in the same boat, no reason not to enjoy it.
---
Pretty sure you can technically train it at 1 as long as you get 10 copper
---
Stop act like every design mistake is somehow on Activision
---
Every heal class downranks their spells though, what do you tell shamans for example?
---
!remindme 33 hours
---
This is misleading.
---
OSRS is not a great comparisson. OSRS still has new content made based on the fanbases wishes. 
---
A rather more fitting comparisson would be Runescape: Classic, which was the vanilla game unchanged from it's original form. 
---
While OSRS has enjoyed great success, Runescape: Classic shut down august last year. 
---
Look, I'm not saying Classic will fail. It most certainly will not. There is a huge community that has begged to be able to play Classic on official servers. Myself being SUPER interested and can't wait to play - I never did pirate/private servers due to their always imminent ends. However, let's not forge narratives that don't make sense. You can't say "Look at OSRS" ignoring the most fundamental part of OSRS being that it gets new content (while the game keeps it's original design philosophy) - while at the same time this community has a hard on for "NO CHANGES". It just doesn't add up. 
---
OSRS is succesful - Classic will be too, most likely. Not for the same reasons - and personally I have my doubts that Classic will still be growing in years to come (unless expansions added or actual new vanilla content) like OSRS is.
---
Depends on what a decent sized streamer is. After most there were tons of people streaming Ely**um li**ts h**e, northd**e, the tbc servers etc. The most recent examples are talesavo 150-400 viewers always. Og_jefferey getting up to like 1k doing dueling and wpvp shit. You probably don't know because you don't play private servers. Even monkey news streamed northd**e for a while at the start and all of Ely**um and LH lmao. Keep talking on shit you don't know about.
---
sub is enough
---
would say 80% of pugs i do are fine and no one says anything other than hello 10% want to talk and be sociable, crazy on an MMO i mean who wants to talk? and the other 10% are retarded to the point that you think they need putting down. for example the group i had the other day where one of the DPS pulled a mob that the thank wanted to skip for some reason, every other group i have been in just killed it, and he blamed the healer and tried kicking them and when i refused to kick the healer the tank and other 2 dps just stopped with the comment of "i have nothing else to do so until the healer is kicked i'm not moving" i promptly left that group and joined another
---
Feels a little bit empty imo. Good attempt still(assuming you made it).
---
Of course it's opinion, but fighting for changes to the game isn't opinion. It's actively trying to appease you by making the game worse for everyone else.  Its like saying you want a game to be a buggy mess because then you can glitch it to go faster. Just because going fast is fun to you, doesn't mean it wouldn't ruin the game. And to be clear again that is an analogy. But a proper one because I firmly believe the things you are arguing for to make the game faster are exactly what would ruin the game. 
---
Furthermore if you already have a guild to run the content with then why are you arguing for shit that you wouldn't use and that would destroy the experience other people want and what classic was designed for and advertised as?
---
Best scene of this season. Hands down. So much feeling in this one scene to have both the lone wolf characters show that care to each other.
---
I am squidward
---
I consider making the best community for the most who would like to take part in the experience I want to help guide into existence. If more people would show up for a Horde side guild over an Alliance side than that would be optimal but it isn't wise to just assume that picking a side a server a member limit a charter and everything before a conversation had been started.  
---
If you are roleplaying on a reddit post you are a cancerous blob of undefined garbage.
---
Let me know if you find out, I THINK I started during the Ahn'Qiraj event in Vanilla but would love to know the exact date
---
About chests in the wild: Loot the whole chest, so that it despawns. 
---
I once killed 5 murlocs over the course of almost 10 minutes only to find out that there's just a dalaran sharp inside the chest, because the previous guy didn't loot it properly.
---
At low levels like you've seen in the beta you are fairly rage starved, however this shouldn't be an issue because at low levels one or two sunders is enough to hold agro on most mobs.
---
Warriors shouldn't be using heroic strike and should be prioritizing revenge over sunder at these low levels. Also warriors should try to save up rage as  the pull is ending so you can start the next pull with plenty of rage. You can also use blood rage between pulls to keep your rage high if you need to wait for drinks or its a long run.
---
Can you exit war mode?
---
So if history repeats itself when you compare it to OSRS... does it mean that classic dies withing a year, just like OSRS?
---
That was on a private server?
---
Was the priest/warr AND mage your characters? If so that is some dedication, priest healing AQ, tanking naxx and rank 13 on mage?
---
I played a lot of rust and its almost impossible to compete on high pop servers if you dont have a few people and a lot of free time. The problem is that you can be reset so easily and some people (including me when I was in school) go really hard and have full ak's after a day
---
Its odd, but i always bring up this fact about my paladin, He wasnt anything like this. But i was tier 2.5/ llittle but of tier 3. But seeing people circle me made me smile. Oh the wow ego boost lol.
---
Lol there was a similar one, but it got removed for low effort
---
Fuck me :( EU and playing since 2009. 
---
Hope I will get it today
---
i've never used one, so, i don't see a reason to start now.
---
Don't do this!

Be thankful that you are not hooked yet. You have 3 months to do so many things, before you start playing every spare minute you have. I suggest:  
---
Read at least 5 books in the following 12 weeks.  
---
Go at least 36 times to the gym in the following 12 weeks.   
---
Repaint your appartment, do a huge cleaning.  
---
Get your teeth done.  
---
I could go on. You will have time to neglect your real life character for the virtual one. At least show some attention towards your real self for the next 12 weeks.   
---
Cya in Azeroth soon &lt;3

Thanks go away dip shit

---
Streamers bringing in a bunch of actual retards. These are the people you’ll be playing with if you roll Horde :^)
---
Because Blizzard (and this subreddit) says our addon might not work and we're out to prove them wrong. Using our addon will let you set-and-forget your desire to enter a dungeon and let you go on doing something else. It was widely loved when it was released in WotLK and it will be widely loved again.
---
Do you also not intend to use Discord because it didn't exist in 04-07? Having a realm-wide chat there would change/break your precious idea of what Classic should be.
---
Then put of nowhere you get owned by a murloc.
---
&gt; I now understand why they skipped it when it comes to remasters
---
I'd argue that's exactly why it needs a remaster. The story is good. The IP is strong. The RTS market isn't oversaturated at the moment (although an argument could be made against competing with yourself). And the original is, dare I say, unplayable to the modern gamer.
---
But then I'm a WCII fanboy who felt a lot of the changes in WCIII took the franchise in the wrong direction. That's heresy I know. WCIII was the stepping stone to WoW. But I wish WCIII was a little more like SCII. I could be wrong but I feel like remastering WC 1&amp;2 from the ground up could have been closer to that.
---
That said I'll still be playing WC3 remastered. Just Tides of Darkness Remastered or even a WCIV is what I really want.
---
"new content"... ? You mean 15 year old content?
---
MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD
---
Dont worry bro, we are gonna make tons of friends in Classic
---
&gt; Not that I have a problem with streamers I just dont care about them... at all.
---
If you "don't care", why do you comment on it then?
---
I probably won't use one at all.  I don't like feeling like I'm just going through the motions on auto pilot like I do on Retail.
---
I'm not sure but I may well use one. There doesn't seem to be much difference between using an addon or alt-tabbing to check wowhead.
---
ppl keep telling me bm hunter sucks for end game did they lie to me ?
---
First off, just let the group know you're new and need some help getting along, and to take things slow. From my experience, we would rather take the dungeon slow and progress, than wait another hour for a new tank/healer. Early dungeons won't immediately throw a hard encounter at you, you'll have plenty of time to learn and progress as a player. Getting to play with your friends will help because you can learn with people that won't bash you and leave you in a tough spot.  
---
Regardless of the ratio, role what you want to play, can't decide? Make both. You aren't going to know how to play something right out of the box, you need to fail. Sure you'll run into assholes, but you'll also run into vets who want to teach and help.
---
If you're a tank, let them know you'll be pulling slow because you're new and learning.
---
If you're a healer, let the tank know to pull slow because you're new and learning.  
---
You can read up on how to play a class all you want, but nothing is going to replace getting out there and wiping, and that's ok. If you piss someone off, oh well, you didn't need to play with them anyways. Just don't be afraid to ask questions, and let them know you're still learning.
---
I'm going herb/alch with my mage, incredibly useful professions.
---
somebody has to actively look for people and you have to interact with people  
---
that alone is a huge difference
---
It’s a stress test. Its for Blizzard not for the players. It makes sense it is during mostly work hours because it is their job, not an event.
---
snowlbeasts?
---
&gt;Holy damn that chart is misleading. You're right that it declined, but whoever made that chart chopped off 20,000 from the y axis to exaggerate how dead it was.
---
Uh, only if you can't read. The curve itself is still as bad.
---
It's exciting people for sure. Did your see the wild WPvP that happened in Arathi? That was one of the most epic battles I've seen and I played on Nost for over a year. 
---
I agree this clip is shit, things need to be moderated but not banned
---
u can do surveys on mega to extend the limit for free
---
Added #15
---
I am sorry but i cant sympathise for you. I played from 2004-2009 and have 9 years of experience on vanilla private servers but lost my original b.net account so the one i have atm is from 2012.
---
Wish there was some way for people who didnt keep their old accounts to get into the beta as well :D
---
to most people beta is try before you buy, why would you want to test for bugs? this is why its a bit annoying when i see people like that get into beta before me i like finding bugs
---
also one crucial point is the ability to check on your map where to get quests. For example booty bay is a labyrinth and you don't want to explore each house every 2 levels to check if some new quest is available, or to change zones to do the same thing when running out of quests.
---
A totally new account doesn't need to buy anything anymore, just a sub.
---
With the same sub you can play both Classic and retail.
---
You only need to buy BFA if you want to access BFA zones, otherwise you'll have access to everything up to Legion.
---
Activision and Blizzard work as 2 indiependent companies, both owned by Activision Blizzard.
---
nope that was on retail 2 days ago
---
Not pointless at all... vQueue is great to filter out spam/trade messages in world chat to only see LFG/LFM messages organized as a big list. That's the only thing it does actually, it's not a matchmaking service.
---
Made it that way so the icons on the desktop don't obstruct the framed pictures.
---
Good luck to everyone to at least get into the stress test (and maybe reteining access?) o7!
---
Oh okay lol, that makes perfect sense.
---
1am to 3am in Paris, France... youpi!
---
people take the path of least resistance, even if it leads to their demise
---
see climate change
---
I’ve been watching a lot of Venruki and it’s great to watch him rediscover how mage used to be I’ll see how xaryu is getting on too!
---
Paladin is more simple tbh :D
---
Rest assured that even some people active in vanilla didn't get invited (not yet personally, at least).
---
Honestly, I think it's just random, and it's just confirmation bias on here that leads people to believe you need to have played in vanilla to get invited. But I could be wrong, of course.
---
you also have the originals  [http://flintlocke.thecomicseries.com/](http://flintlocke.thecomicseries.com/)
---
mmmm delicious dkp
---
I was going to ask for proof that it was vanilla and not a private server, but then I saw all the night elves,  good shit man
---
guess we’ll all get the stress test though
---
I would play on an English region if I were you, since you already have a basic understanding of the language. Wow is going to take it much much further trust me.
---
But why not play on EU and get better ping? 90% of EU players speak English perfectly and it's not going to hinder your ability to learn.
---
I scrolled by kinda fast, and thought that was Rickety Cricket. 😂
---
have they said if the cap is staying at 30 on the beta or if they are going to raise it as the beta progresses?
---
1. Cry
---
2. Lie down in revovery position
---
3. Get ganked by an UD Rogue
---
Can Classic run in ultrawide 21:9 ? So far all the beta footage I've found on YT is on 16:9.
---
Oh i will use it. From starting out with nothing, to finding Thottbot and then, the entrance into AddOns...i know better now than back then.
---
This kind of post reminds me of this comic
---

---
The big bad BFA player versus the great and justified Classic player, on this glorious quest for the one true WoW 
---
/s
---
Tbh i doubt it'll happen, WoW still has millions of players worldwide, how many did Runescape had before OSRS was released ? Unlike most games WoW held millions of players for 15 years, and i don't think vanilla is the sole reason of it's success.
---
Time will tell i guess.
---
Should I sub just to get an invite? I got a 2005 character, can I still get an invite?
---
but they don't say they're against streamers. Linking shitty clips on reddit doesnt do anything good or relevant, esp when its like "wow he made it onto the zep"
---
&gt; My hope is that this article is being slightly disingenuous. Sure, you COULD use all of this if you were at the bleeding edge of progression raids, but an average group wouldn't demand this.
---
i doubt anyone will expect you to get all those buffs. hell, some of them won't be available on release either like the ZG buffs, or other miscellaenous buffs like the Darkmoon Faire, Warchief's Blessing (unless you're Horde), etc.
---
seriously, the "world buff meta" from private servers wasn't a thing in Vanilla WoW, unless you were going for server firsts. 
---
if you have a flask, the appropriate resistance potion and healing potions, you'll be good to go. you could throw in Fortitude/Armor Elixirs as well.
---
When I started to play I didn't use anything and it was fun.
---
But after several hundreds quests on more than one char, quest helper became very welcome.
---
I'll be using it on Classic but that doesn't mean I'll skip reading, I will read all quests text since I mostly don't remember it.
---
I speculated that a Discord bot or LFG website could easily do this a month or two ago and got shot down for the suggestion. Very clever on how you're doing it though, I didn't think to introduce hashes to a chat channel no user can easily read on their end. Are there plans to check for appropriate levels and classes? Else I could see trolling things happening like a rogue queuing as a healer for UBRS while he's level 20.
---
I want this: https://youtu.be/JNOxz9paA6E
---
Not only that, but it makes itself entirely avoidable. Get max level, do catch up mechanic, ignore everything else because it's pointless.
---
https://youtu.be/wQ2HvpPaF74?t=393

Warlock in early TBC banishing another hordes tapped mob repeatedly
---
Mrglmrglmrgl!
---
The player will always take the easiest route to their final destination. If there's a superior way of doing something, that's the way they'll always do it. I think there's a thing covering that idea in game theory, but I don't remember fornsure.
---
Either way, still, if people are gonna choose it, then it can't be all that bad.

AV is by **far** the most efficient if you get down to 8min games. That's why private server players play that much because AV is so good that it even provides higher honor/hour on a loss than any other BG.
---
It's so efficient that it massively increases the competition pool outside of small premade groups and results in having to play longer just to stay relevant.
---
i thought about this later and agree that for this particular example, the first mob i had tested it on may have been successful for that reason. i believe there may be some other inconsistencies with it still, but i will continue to test and report them

The firsts books you get are generally for buff like  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=17413](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17413)  making buffing a lot faster and easier.

Then you got AQ books that grant you new ranks for spell you already have like  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=21214](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21214)

All the spells/new ranks you learn from book are not learnable from trainer.

That was fun to read. Also funny how anyone would think this is serious. :'D

To each their own.  I’m probably not going to use them, because I never did.  But I will have the quest up on monitor #2.  So kinda?

I used Thottbot when I had to ... and am pretty sure I can remember most of the quests Horde side at least. Won't be using an addon.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
It definitely is, but they can afford to be when there's so much demand.
---
Servers were such a mess, at least in EU, when guilds pulled Vael or Thaddius
---
Not without breaking other addons.
---
Oh man, Joana, dude inspired me to roll a troll hunter after I grinded my first char - orc warlock - ignoring all the quests (came from Lineage 2 where quests were few and didn't give much exp).
---
Do they even have it ?
---
Iirc they said at Blizzcon they found the 1.12 source code &amp; DB on an old backup archive from BC, and they couldn't go back any further since they didn't have the data anymore.
---
I don't think they should remake the battleground out of Pserver, community websites and old videos.
---
I pitty the fool! :-)
---
I think at 5 it’s just based on how creative you can be.

I cannot point to specific quests but I do remember back in vanilla reading quests to find where I needed to go and following the quests directions only to discover on Thottbot after half an hours in-game searching that the quest text said West when they meant East. :P

---
Not to mention that if you're efficient at farming good you can essentially play the game for free.
---
Anything that can heal because nobody will have an interrupt
---
Thanks!
---
Does anyone know if Australian players are getting beta access I've not seen any of my friends get in.
---
I'll bring it up, but I expect it'll be something we just can't do because of the required time commitment. We *could* do a Photo Day Sticky for people to submit their own screenshots, but that's not remotely the same.
---
Maybe priest or warlock with a LMW
---
This example is so stupid, lol.
---
Are you EU or NA?
---
I’m playing on modern graphics with addons. I just want classic content but modernized tbh. I’m that guy
---
Fuck no. (Pardon the strong language.)
---
However if it is on *separate* serves, then carry on, I won't care. (Although it's complete pipe dream to expect any good "Vanilla like content". Almost all the original game designers have left. What you'd get is BfA 2.)
---
shamans have an interrupt
---
They honestly can't have the beta up for 3 months with people streaming it. It will do more harm than good IMO. Beta should only last a month at most IMO.
---
EU Day one account, got in yesterday. I only resubbed 4 days ago to give bfa another shot after 6 months. Guess i wont be playing bfa anymore now..
---
No it isn't. TBC will be separate servers unless Blizzard is completely brain dead.
---
Def not intended, good find!
---
The updated macro API could be changed to work, as it's literally just the target by name function which already exists as a feature. They just manually removed totem names to stop totem stomping from working.
---
And I believe focus macros aren't working anyway as that's a feature they removed from the macro system when they ported it to Classic, since focus wasn't a feature then
---
Grats, but I think most of the people here have been checking their bnet and email like a dozen times a day xD
---
So do taurens
---
Hi, /u/EarthBaker
---
I'd rather they break those addons than allow someone to break the spirit of Classic WoW, introducing a pseudo LFG system would go against the entire point of Classic which is to remove all the "quality of life" garbage that dumbed it down, made it faster and took the soul out of the game.
---
skinning + mining ( is missing in the poll :(   )
---
They already have plenty of beta tester.
---
&gt;Let's be honnest however, since Questies addons are coming we are all going to use them, aren't we ? I mean technically you CAN ignore to play with them but the temptation will be there and I think it will be hard to resist.
---
That's a bit generalising. I'm not going to use it and I have absolutely no temptation towards it.
---
By now of course I know how to do most quest in the zone I'll be going to, so of course I don't actually need it, but the way I've learned that is mostly just playing the game. I've leveled a lot in vanilla and TBC without quest helper without any problems.
---
Yes, of course I did use the occasional Thottbot, but that's not quite the same as having a permanent quest helper.
---
The code is just a copy paste of https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lookingforgroup which is just a reskin of the in game looking for group tool. It will not work since it relies on the looking for group tool existing.
---
Don't underestimate my ability to go through a day of work after a four hours sleep.
---
Do only active subscribtions a beta key? Or can you get one if you haven't played wow in like a year or so,...?
---
I agree with you that it probably does, but technically they're now into the realms of messing with class balance. Alliance warlocks already have a much tougher time than horde warlocks, and that's even with working totem stomp macros. Removing that functionality is tampering with the warlock vs shaman and hunter vs shaman matchups
---
Remember as a Night Elf going to IF through Wetlands and getting murdered by those crocs? 
---
Well I guess we remembered wrong lol...
---
Class design is the worst it's ever been. If you think it's ok that's fine, however I don't remember the last time when most of the classes felt like a trash to play. 
---
&gt;I didn't play in Legion.
---
I think there lies your problem. I'd say if you didn't play Legion at all, BfA isn't maybe that bad. However as someone who was subbed for the whole Legion because it was just so good, BfA feels like a worse version of Legion in the every goddamn aspect. I mean you said M+ is good in BfA, I'll tell you it's boring shit compared to Legion.
---
Hi, /u/cheezum5000
---
You and me both bud
---
EU
---
Where is the beta hidden inside the client? Not sure where I would have to check 
---
.
---
Yup. But watch those respawn times. Their unforgiving as fuck.
---
wait i'm confused, the blizzard CM posted confirming it's not a bug but how it works in 1.12.1, are you saying he's lying?
---
Yup, have to be in a major city though.
---
Hi, /u/mattz2023
---
Absolutely. I have no prejudices to either side.
---
Come one, he practically tells us this is satire. Just look at the whole section directly addressing the single most hated part of retail from Classic players as if it is something we all love. The use of emoticons, the over the top comments of how he basically saved our fun.
---
It's not even a subtle troll.
---
You got into the full beta then brother. You won't lose access. They sent out a bunch of invites for you guys in EU earlier today (maybe yesterday for you?)  
---
Congrats :)
---
Might be, but it was fairly hidden imo. Could be that more people have been as blind as I have.
---
MvP
---
&gt; Item level in classic is not going to be an indication of how good a piece is as there are a lot of items that are much better than ilvl would suggest. 
---
Did this stop all those 'But we need gearscore, to see if someone is good'-people in the past?
---
No, they do it because if they don't they get left behind not because it's healthy for the game or even fun, do you see anyone spamming trade or world chat in BFA? Do you see anyone talking regularly? It's a slope that would just make classic BFA-lite, at that point it's lost its purpose.
---
They already *have* a list like that. Blizzard literally released a list of common bug reports that are working as intended. Of course everything can't be on the list, but they have the most common false reports on a list.
---
Couldn't you do it the other way, then? Logout to be booted to the entrance, then reset?
---
Blizzard is already picking and choosing whether or not to use patch 1.12 for some things. Like the mount system, they specifically said in the irvine interview that they decided to use the patch 1.1 mount system instead of the one added in 1.12.1 because that's what people remember and that's how it was for most of vanilla.
---
OK, as long as you're not actually Rory McCann.
---
I will use Questy. I will also read quest text but I am using questy to make sure I do every quest in the zone before moving on. Questy will also help point me in the right direction incase I forgot some quests.
---
That would fall under the "two gathering professions" catagory
---
Imagine people paying you to have 10% chance to test the game you released 15 years ago
---
dont forget even if u have much better gear at the later contents, they released a patch where you could loot badge of justices from raid bosses. With every content new badge items were released. A karazhan was like 20-21 badge/run, and you could make a run in 1 hour (maximum 2) in proper gear = free loot.
---
But i have to admit that was one of my all time favourite raid, when you were farmin that with 3 groups and race to finish it first, was always fun :)
---
Crazy the money blizzard is making with this Beta... everyone pays Blizzard for not even playing.. just saying :D me2 of course. Didn't get one ..
---
everyone here is my friend! unless youre a filthy alliance player then i will gank you
---
They are there’s multiple clips here some where
---
He signed with an org as a pro, it was just a really shitty one
---
&gt;BfA is bad and in a bad place.(a lot of people who know Blizzard employees think it's deliberated so Classic can prosper)
---
Oh! Yes, please! My tinfoil ha has been getting dusty.
---
They want to make a stress test, not a server melt down
---
These are some incredible screenshots, thanks for sharing them here. I feel like I just took a peek into an awesome part of history
---
Should be in the drop-down above the Play button
---
[https://ibb.co/nD1qB7B](https://ibb.co/nD1qB7B)
---
Under "Region / Account" there is an option for "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic"
---
Both had active wow subs?
---
Been playing since end of vanilla and subbed more often than not. Fuck me right.
---
Maybe you should of made a bigger effort to be sociable, I made friends in classic that I still regularly talk to.
---
except everything we get is not in its final 1.12 version. Blizzard is already picking and choosing non 1.12.1 things to use or not. For example in one of the irvine interviews they stated they intend to use the patch 1.1.0 mount system as opposed to the one added in 1.12.1, which is way different. They said this is because the 1.1 system was there for most of vanilla and that's what people remember best.
---
This is a VERY accurate representation of Classic WoW :Thumbs Up:
---
I cannot remmeber playing wow without addons. I jad an ugly Xperl interface with an ugly titanpanel bar and some other ugly stuff. This time around Ill make a good looking interface.
---
Yeah vanilla weather is back. Have verified it personally.
---
Bro, are you from EU or NA? I'm looking for 1 partner at the start to help leveling. I'll be playing 24 hours straight after relase, and then 14 hours a day after the relase day. Also which faction?
---
Simple way to test would be to compare mob damage with and without the aura to see if the difference is here.
---
Unless you reach a certain point in gear where you play fury/prot, which dual wields to produce more aggro. Not viable in the early days I reckon, but it might be a thing again later on.
---
Remember that we play with 1.12 talents and spells. Thats the biggest factor for easy raiding
---
Classic streams are so fucking fun if most of the streamers are on the same server. A lot of server drama and world pvp between streamers. Cool imo.
---

You also need to be a healer or tank class to queue as a healer or tank, but we're only limiting queuing for talent specs for later instances.
---
We're also putting in ways to make sure at least one player can unlock doors and summon extra bosses (if you select these options before queuing) through attunments and quest items like the ZF Mallet. No more forgetting them in the bank because we'll be searching your bags for the item and reminding you!
---
And because there's still technically a way for someone to troll the hidden chat channel by sending their own hashes (though they'd have to read our code and do it manually), but once the queue pops, the other 4 players' addons will see this and re-queue.
---
Anyone that tries to break this will be put on a blacklist that gets periodically updated (assuming you enable that feature) between members. We're considering a way to manually add people to the blacklist, mainly ninja-looters, but we want to make sure it can't be abused first.
---
I doubt we've thought of everything, but we're trying. We hope to have a testable version soon, but will definitely have something by launch.
---
Why are you getting downvoted? People jelly coz they have real life obligations that they hate?
---
There's not going to be a way to disable them without breaking pretty much every addon.
---
OSRS is a complete new game, it has nothing to do with the base game. New content, constant updates, QOL, fixes.
---
Google RuneScape classic instead. That shit closed last year.
---
You want Classic to succeed, good, leave retail out of it.
---
If you want to kill retail, make sure people aren't already complaining after a week of beta.
---
From the look of it, even your so called oldschool hardcore gamer community is already complaining about lack of QOL stuff and reporting bugs that were just part of the archaic game that was vanilla wow.
---
Devilsaur mafia, premades 24/7, raid ganks in WPL/EPL, controlling the auction house amongst other things. It's just not a fun experience to be on the same server as them.
---
I had a friend back in TBC who hated his own character so much, you would never see him without a Savory Delight or Noggenfrogger on.
---
This all the way to level 60!
---
Shitpost remove and ban
---
Could you share the source with me? Would appreciate it &lt;3
---
Weak bait tbh
---
I was actually torn between playing a shaman or a warlock!
---
I will take a look once I get back home today.
---
Dont know with addons will be available from start but Ill just use everything I found usefull.
---
Well, first of all, if you have such a min/max mentality that kind of removes the choice of warlock for you, since WoTF will counter your fear. This leaves you healer or mage.
---
As for gnomes, well - personally I still prefer human as well, but I've honestly grown to love female gnomes too, at least compared to how I used to hate anything shorter than a dwarf. You might consider trying to read more about gnomes - they have some important lore figures too. You can also try to look at artwork of gnomes. I feel like part of the reason many don't like them is because honestly, there is not a lot to make them look cool. You can search for these kind of things yourself.
---
You might also look into whether it really is that strong of a race. Extra engineering doesn't really matter much, I mean - you will be at 300 engineering anyway, it won't increase your DPS or anything. As for more int and mana, you are literally looking at something like 2 extra DPS. That is basically within the margin of error from lag and the RNG realm. That leaves Escape Artist, to which I can't really justify anything against - it is a strong ability in PvP that humans don't have anything to compete with. I guess you *could* argue that humans have a racial against rogues,but then again Escape Artist is great to get out of Crippling Poison. 
---
I guess you need to decide, looking at a gnome for the amount of DPS that is offset by a single upgrade, or look at a human and basically see the same DPS. Maybe try to convince yourself how little of a difference it is?
---
gnome master race
---
Content right here, good job....
---
I really can't see why people like you are so damn grumpy.
---
Those streamers are marketing! As a company would you mind free marketing? I think not!
---
There are a lot of people who played vanilla and re-subbed just for the beta. That equals free money! As a Company would you mind free money? 
---
Also sure you "veteran" players have much (if not the most) insight on everything, but you are not the target of this marketing campaign. If you really love vanilla you will play it, no matter the beta. Other people who are undecisive may check the beta out because of their retail sub and maybe even recommend it for their friends.
---
Also the likeliness of you "veterans" remembering everything correct is also not that high, since most of people like you played private servers with "not the actual (but pretty close)" data, which makes things difficult.
---
Does this rag smell like chloroform to you?
---
I quit during Legion, now that Classic has a release date a friend of mine that I introduced to WoW during Pandaria that still plays is begging me to come back and play Classic with him.
---
I was still not sure if I really wanted to go back playing MMORPGs and we started to discuss WoW and how things changed and end up talking raids...and I told him that imo there are to many difficulty settings on retail, raid finder, normal, heroic and mythic...sure they are different but its the same boss, the same setting and the same lore figure it kills immersion. And he goes: "yeah thats probably to much...how many difficulty modes exist on classic, like 2?"
---
And I was like: "You know what? You convinced me, we are gonna play classic together! Its gonna be fun!
---
So be it, with an LFG system classic would lose its purpose and appeal to the people waiting for it, we wanted classic because it didn't have gear score or LFG systems. If it suddenly becomes BFA-lite I know personally I'd just go back to private servers and I won't be the only one.
---
Are you delusional? You think people like Asmon who have been playing since vanilla should struggle with low level dungeons?
---
And Preach did manage to wipe actually at SFK last boss.
---
I watched some Preach and Asmongold YT vids for classic WW.
---
They *really* hit the nostalgia buttons, I am really struggling not to re-sub and try and persuade the wife to join me for some classic adventuring.
---
Or rolling on chests and mines. Aah...
---
the blizzard CM said this is how polymorph worked on patch 1.12.1, that it's not bugged. Are you saying he is lying or what? I'm actually confused, are you just saying that it did work at one point (the majority?) of vanilla but got changed in late vanilla?
---
I think that's just a bug from the retail port. Thank you though, I'll ask Ayle when he's next online and report back here :)
---
I mean, I can see where you're coming from, but just imagining a single tank skinning his way through the entirety of Wailing Caverns makes me shudder. I imagine this would add up to 5-10 minutes easily (including moving from corpse to corpse, asking people to loot, etc).
---
I would say, if you're noticing the other players are waiting for you a lot, at least ask if they're okay with it. Skinning while mana breaks is perfectly fine of course.
---
Good news is, on classic everyone and their mother will have skinning, so this won't be a huge issue at all.
---
Too bad I dont have access to the beta :/
---
Stop that, it's new content because it's being reintroduced
---
Thank you!
---
It was satire.
---
Fantastic. Sorry I just couldn't find a concrete answer anywhere and I didn't want to sift through 30 hours of streamers going through zones. Especially when weather is dynamic.
---
&gt;It's not huge for mage or lock
---
Escape Artist is amazing for lock. It is the least mobile caster in the game, how can a mobility racial not be strong for them? *Especially* when you are an Alliance lock, you already have to combat WotF.
---
For mage it is less needed, but it still means you can unwind a fuckup.
---
&gt; Between questing, PvP, dungeons and finding BiS gear, even just at level 30 on just ONE character, it’s just such a huge game it’s mind blowing. 
---
Well thats all the stuff im doing at level 120... even more, we have achievements, pets, Moggsets to farm... I don't understand why you think it's something exclusive to classic wow...
---
"Achievments are useless"--- well farmin BiS gear with level 30 is useless too.
---
You can go straight into prowl from bear in classic beta only by making a macro to cancelform, /cast !Bear Form and /cast Prowl.
---
It is instant though.
---
Yes!! Just yes!!!!
---
Damn, I haven’t changed my wallpaper in ages, but I will now! Good work!
---
Ah. Old good STV. Your average life durotation is 3-4 min ))))
---
GODS THE GAMING EXPERIENCE WAS STRONG THEN!
---
Why would this thought even cross your mind? Are you retarded?
---
I have never played BFA so how does the state of that game effect my opinion making exactly?
---
As I said several times, I get the point. This beta is Marketing and nothing else. But that does not mean that I have to like it. 
---
I also get the point why I have to pay taxes, that does not mean I like to pay taxes. 
---
I say it honestly, I am pissed that I am not in the beta. I am pissed that this beta is 99,9% Marketing for streamers and youtubers. I am pissed that streamers Play this beta just to become rich as fuck with so many Viewers and dont give a single fuck about the game and classic itself.
---
I think human males are too muscular for mages and warlocks (and I dont like to play the opposite gender); thats why I chose Gnome for my alliance warlock on a pserver.
---
Hope they truly invite enough people to be sure of a heavy load on the server.
---
Wow perfect time just as i start ... work... sigh
---
I’m just shocked at this opinion. All of the raids and dungeons have been amazing. And *soulless*? Is the expac that gave us Freehold and Waycrest Manor?
---
*What!?*
---
You're comparing a game that closed in a 2018 and a rework with constant updates that struggles to keep 100.000 players worldwide to WoW ... you know, the biggest MMORPG ever, that still has millions of active subs at its worst.
---
Very robust, yeah. I can't think of any immediate holes to that spec, I'm looking forward to seeing the results of your work. Any Armory access/API, which Blizzard has stated they'd want to do eventually, would open the door to a Destiny 2 style LFG site or Discord bot in the midterm of Classic anyways, so putting it in-game doesn't strike me as off. We had oQueue in MoP which I remember using to great success. I think it was cross-server grouping and auto-porting that started to damage things, not the other aspects of Wrath, so I don't see the Classic ethos being violated here. Besides, if it is, surely the will of players will be strong enough to resist. Or sometimes players don't know what they really want til it's in front of them.
---
Twitch could be a huge accelerator for any fucking game, strawberry wow isn't a special case
---
Oh for sure, farming old content and 3rd or 4th tank, it's welcome, sometimes even required. I'd always rather take feral in these scenarios though, if there is any available :P
---
Who said it was shitty tho?
---
I really think you're overestimating the impact a LFG-lite system will have on the "spirit of Classic WoW".
---
I'm one of those that have never been tempted to use Questie, and I do not intend to start. IMO that makes the questing less interesting and more of a laundry list.
---
EU, 2005 account, no BFA, do have legion, no invite. Bollocks. :(
---
Never used one so I won’t use it.
---
I do have to plan out the dungeon items that worth getting for each level so I am will keep a cheat sheet
---
Yeah I kinda agree with this. I am a big fan of Asmon and Soda and they claim they will not accept any of this after launch and they only do it because it’s just beta and I hope that’s true. But Asmongold is already talking about how he plans to get every legendary in the game and that seems impossible without an army of loyal viewers.
---
Messing with class balance? Warlocks? What are you spouting?
---
Do you think auto-target macros are "class balance" and only affect Warlocks and Hunters?
---
Target and wand, chap. Every class has an autoattack cooldown. While Locks and Hunters can target a totem at RANGE, melee classes often can't.
---
That has little to do with class "balance" lmfao.
---
They were capped at 50 players tho iirc
---
I leveled a Warlock from 1-10 yesterday and I felt it was super easy compared to what I played on Nost and Ely. I died once from 4 Murlocs adding and once while killing a Level12 Rare and 2 other Gnolls added. 
---
Killed Hogger solo. In the first 7 Levels I did not need to eat or drink at all! Regen-Rates seemed off.
---
best time ever as lvl 60 rogue in STV!
---
Wait so for the stress test if you get in you only get 2 days and get kicked out?
---
agree, but we hadn't twitch when it came out 2004 :)
---
It’s actually 12am with British Summer Time ;)
---
One of the best pserver mages is kraun (the guys has tons of knowledge on vanilla pvp):
---

Really good hunter, but not sure if he's in the beta or streams:

---
yeah I still debating with myself should I go on these servers where the big streamers go or not. Could be fun though to go there and play with them and make these Open PVP events :)
---
enjoy your downvotes I guess
---
I'll try to take my time and not use a quest helper but I leveled so many times through Wrath my brain will be on autopilot.
---
Oh boy! Maybe they'll do a stress test for Europeans? (I don't believe that myself)
---
Well I always avoided the main road and had Aspect of the Beast/Track Humanoids or Hidden on therefore my average life duration increased by a few mins :)
---
yeah and water is wet.
---
what are you trying to say? how does this have any relevance to the given subject?
---
I got in yesterday, so who cares about the Stress-Tests :D
---
Level as shadow priest and fury warrior and do dungeons for quests. You can easily tank/heal dungeons up to brd.
---
Plenty of players who played vanilla back then have been given access. What you need to appreciate is the list of people still around who played back then is massive. It's not a small pool of people. Just because you've not been given access doesn't mean Blizzard are ignoring normal vanilla era players. I've seen plenty of them get in. Be patient.
---
PepeLaugh
---
Using unstuck without a hearthstone in your inventory kills your character without any durability loss.
---
Ah okay, that makes a lot more sense then. However it sounds extremely unlikely to happen on Classic, with how good tanks and tanking openings have become during pservers' lifetime. It would really only be possible for hunters to pull that off, if the tank would miss his first few attacks and if the boss was untauntable, as you proclaim.
---
So true, you see them in every twitch chat "you'll see, classic will kill retail like OSRS did"
---
They don't even know that runescape classic closed 1 year ago and OSRS has 100k players worldwide.
---
My first ever dungeon was wailing caverns. Coming from d2 LoD, community was full of scammers and egocentric bastards so I just thought it was normal to need on every items. Ppl called me ninja, I did not even know what that meant and continued to need everything until I eventually got kicked of the group. Good times :')
---
Hi, /u/teebonemahoney
---
I read the box in the toilet.
---
What’s with all these people complaining about 1.12 AV with no idea how 1.12 AV was like? It was still an epic battle that took hours and all the npc upgrades and summons are relevant. You seem to think it was closer to the meaningless zerg rush we have today but it wasn’t. AV has been repeatedly simplified over the years but most of it happened after vanilla. 1.12 was great, maybe you’d feel better if you learned more about the history and gradual changes that made AV the shitshow it is today.
---
I will, I want to read every quest plus I am not in a hurry.
---
&gt; but it will try to put a warlock in every group that can summon you.
---
I think this part gives it away....or maybe not since OP made this thread.
---
The stress test restrictions are only there from 4-6PM PST. 
---
The closed beta testers will be able to go back to the closed server. 
---
and I assume they will set the level cap for stress test server to 30 for the remaining time.
---
Hi, /u/jigge92
---
No, this is one of the first things we tested in Beta because we're using a custom chat channel to create a LFG addon. Maybe you're thinking of the limit to /who search results? That was capped at 50.
---
Yeah probably feels good to be able to actually kill a player 30 levels lower....
---
But that's tbc, not really relevant, no?
---
Desolace, Scarlet monastery and Badlands will be my friends, will leave STV for the braver folks. Maybe a little bit of Alterac and Arathi might come in handy.
---
That's honestly why I watch him. It's a calm vanilla stream with some mechanics discussion. Lots of other streamers are too shouty and hyperbolic for me.
---
Ofc not. The time is based on work hours in blizzards HQ so they can monitor it, while at work. Its not for the players, its a load test for the server. Its not supposed to be fun, its supposed to put the server systems to the absolute limit.
---
Not sure if you are trolling or just stupid
---
The [only screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RSOw4Ef.jpg) I still have from Vanilla, forgot to save them when doing a disk format years ago.
---
Not really, no.
---
I have nothing there. No region, no PTR ... nothing.
---
That drop down menu pop up automatically when i get access to the beta or do i have to atleast install the PTR?
---
Stress test only. Beta players have "Beta and Stress test" shown in the menu.
---
Yeah it was a stupid thought. As long as they get good results from the masses then everything should be nice and smooth at release.
---
where is the bot?
---
This is only the beginning!
---
Really, unless you’re absolutely min/maxing, just go with whatever you think looks best, the stat differences are negligible at 60.
---
Who is going to cry about it exactly?? 
---
Not the old school pvpers who want the original AV. 
---
I can't see anyone complaining saying no we don't want the original AV we want this revised version similar to retail.
---
Always does.

It's the middle of the night, not early morning.

Damn this is actually a an eye opener. i won't make the same mistake twice. I hope you all enjoy classic . I'll grind my IRL character. best of luck.

Cause the whiners and haters aren't getting in, oh no

Woooooooosh

did you miss the post about stoneskin totem? theres bugs idk why ppl are so quick to use that as a rationalization for any bugs... "its a 15 year old game u were just young these are not bugs" no motherfucker theres bugs LMAO
---
Personally I will not be using a questing addon because I've done all the quests multiple times. But even if you haven't it's not necessary at all. Asking in guild chat or general chat usually gets you the answers instantly, and someone might actually group up with you. Also the VanillaDB has all the info, just look at the comment section.
---
Reading quest texts to figure it out is a ton of fun too.
---
Lok'tar Ogar!

they are a small addition to an already large toolkit, they are almost neglible.

Quickly browsing through, few of them will work as they are, however most of them can be remade into a macro that does the exact same thing.

The only macro i noticed that isn't possible to remake is, so situational it's largely irrelevant.

No, I’m not actually. Like I said, unless you’re min/maxing, play what you want.

I’ve made plenty of character choices based on aesthetics/lore alone and done just fine in the game.

Been waiting for so many years now...3months is nothing.

I'm thinking about rolling mage, what do you actually do during frostbite, why was that nova shitty and what's a good nova?  Sry you seem knowledgeable haha

Stat differences, yeah, but the active racials are definitely not negligible. Escape artist can absolutely be the difference maker in whether you win a 1v1 or not.

Noone of the /scripts or /run parts will work. The functions are either protected or removed. You'll have to convert them to the new macro system.
---
It really would be nice if Blizzard oriented at least -some- favouring to EU players
---
I don’t believe we get completely forgotten but if the next stress test isn’t at EU favourable hours I will lose faith...
---
I would have thought we are a reasonable enough % if the player base to warrant an equal footing with the NA group
---
its completely relevant, the systems in late vanilla are the same as this era and for context this pvp video is from real tbc. I believe it was even in the first tbc patch 2.0
---
I posted the actual movie, may be the directors cut
---
No. It's literally to level 30 and waiting a little longer is of zero interest. I got the date, now I can relax and wait
---
The thing is you could leave the battle and take the honor points you accumulated so far with you. You could then wake up the next day and requeue and join the same battle and link up with the same comrades who have been battling out in a bloody war for the last 10 hours.
---
That's a stun, not an interrupt. Might seem pedantic but they're two entirely distinct things.
---
I wonder if they are even going to send invites to legion babies like me.

That's hirp dirp cuz

Lol "durotation"

Done the levelup so many times, experienced it fully on both sides, in each start zones... that i will use questie (because its been like 2 years since i did horde chars). So i just want to get into the endgame fast, ill do slower levelup on alts (that i will levelup for sure).
---
Is the dragon supposed to represent retail?
---
That also but i feel like i remember our guild havong multiple world channels cause they were capped
---
And in battlegrounds or wpvp they add maybe 2 extra seconds to your life. What’s your point? 
---
Escape Artist or not, you’re still gonna get wrecked by a competent player. That’s just me, I don’t hinge my characters on a single racial ability. 
---
I’ve never made a single undead character and I’ve done just fine in duels and ganking scenarios on my Rogue.
---
Racials matter not to me, but clearly they do to you.
---
Nelf with pet = stealth squad. Horde never can gank you.
---
It has been a thing since vanilla wow, warcraftmovies was a thing back then.
---
Escape artist is really strong for mages, though mostly in a 1v1 setting. There are several points in fights against X class where you need to trinket or EA a crippling or a wingclip, stomp on a frostnova or entangling roots. It's also on a 1 min or 1.5 min cooldown, can even be used twice in the same fight on rare occasions.

I think its not fair saying mythic and heroic/normal are the same boss

Can't you just install whatever version addons have for 7.3.5?
---
They already confirmed no cash shop or tokens in classic.
---
I can't speak to Vanilla, not because I didn't play it but because I don't know if I was ever in any 50+ global chat channels back then.
---
But I can tell you that it isn't the case in Retail and isn't the case in the Beta.
---
Considering that he hates classic and wants to roll a guild mainly to grief over players - I can see why he is upset.
---
I think there's some line of sight issues in the Deadmines around those tunnels, does anybody else remember this? Could explain that clip.
---
Can't Blizz just "disrupt" the specific chat channel? Or do what they done with the addon that was drawing on the ground for raid bosses damage zones - Back then they said the devs take down the addon themselves or Blizz will just break half the addons for everyone.
---
I think you need to close and re-open the client to get it to show, but yeah, it should just show on the list when you MANUALLY check for it. I dont have PTR listed because i dont have BFA.
---
Yeah that's what I wonder. Is it like they forgot to fix banish and made other spells not available or it's intended.
---
&gt;But I wish WCIII was a little more like SCII
---
A big reason for the success is probably that it is *not* like SCII. To me, WCIII is a very casual RTS. It is honestly quite easy and compared to most of the "legendary" RTS games it is a baby game with almost no units or tactics needed. This is a great strength because it somehow takes the RTS elements that are fun and makes them available for people that are not normally into RTS. It is kind of like how Hearthstone took the core elements of Magic: The Gathering, but made it way more simple and easy to just jump into for everyone.
---
Add to this that the simplicity of WCIII lent itself well to mods and how it eventually sparked MOBA. Sure SCII had a MOBA mod that was the basis for Defense of the Ancients, but WCIII had a casual playerbase to embrace it.
---
I am 100% sure they wouldn't fix it back to being able to cast these spells in TBC.
---
I have always loved gnome.

I dont know. It should tho, works on the modern client
---
I completely agree that EA is also great for mages, my previous comment was about the guy saying it was not huge for locks, and I'd argue that is one of the most important classes to have EA on - especially as an alliance lock. Compared to that, at least mages have some nice tricks to get away themselves, but obviously getting one more is always strong.

Also worked on the demo.

Ah well, I've always trusted to notice the change of the cursor rather than actually seeing what I'm about to pick up :D

What Exploration are you talking about ? Exploring a 14 year old Game that we all already played for hundreds or thousands of hours? Reading quests we did over and over again? There isn't much to explore left, and either its addonds or pages like thottbot etc. back in the day i just googled every quest on Map&amp;Guide just to see the dots on their map to know where i have to go.

no, not at all. I just prefer to stick to guild runs, with players who dont fight over loot, quit when it suits them and are selfish players.

You can stick with your pug runs.

I started from the very beginning. I ask blizzard via ticket
---
Bring your friends to Azeroth, but also go outside with them
---
Let's be completely honest, with all the pruning of retail it is a bit charming to see this overflow of shit all over the screen.
---
Hell yeh go POPs!
---
For me, its great, because in 18months - 2 yrs, progression isnt wiped clean with an expansion. Players can work on getting BiS, even if it takes 3-5yrs, then once there they can pvp with that Character. 
---
Also, being able to roll an alt and take time to get that alt to 60 and do it all again. 
---
I cant wait!
---
... I might have been checking about once an hour since the beta was released. Hard thing is not knowing at all if you stand a chance or not.. the wait is killing me!
---
PvP and PvE? Tanking and DPS?
---
You need to roll Orc.
---
Twich should separate Classic from BFA,same as WC3.
---
\^ This
---
I want to see rag down
---
Well lets hope they do that then! You will be the happy dev that screwed other addons :)
---
I wouldn't play a gnome ever, can't stand the look of them lol
---
Oh man. “Fall back” is so stupid. Why didn’t they just make DST last the whole year!?!?
---
Depends on what your priorities are, more pve focused? Human is the obvious choice if you're minmaxing, pvp focused humans are pretty mediocre where as gnomes are very strong, although if always advise playing what you think looks the coolest and makes you happy. I'm going gnome warrior but thats because gnomes are my favorite race and just looking at my character makes me happy, if I was human I wouldn't feel that joy or connection to my character.
---
Why did you break the youtube links? Please correct them because now it looks like spam / scam links.

Ah, the sweetness of gamer relationships. My bf on Dota2 and me on vanilla 😍

He's doing fine considering he only started live streaming since the beta launched. Before that his channel was just reruns of his 2006 speedrun VOD where he would hang around and chat while working on his leveling guides. I watch him because he's someone very knowledgeable about the game who happens to stream, rather than a pro streamer who happens to be playing a game he knows nothing about because it's the big thing right now, which covers about 90% of the other streamers that have hitched their wagons to Classic.
---
Anyway I guess my taste in streams is weird because I tend to "watch" mostly on my commute in my car, which means I'm streaming audio only 90% of the time. So I like streams that are more like podcasts where the person just makes on-topic comments about what they're doing. He talks enough without being overbearing, and he's always talking about the game and what's going on and working or not with the beta, not just going on stupid rants or reacting to viewers trolling all the time.
---
No, I'll use Quest helper as I did back in Vanilla. You can still read the quests and follow the instructions to go complete them without it hindering your gaming time.
---
You may be right about that sir, but what I do by myself with an axe, a dwarf, a bottle of lubricant, pair of maracas and a cape is my business ;)
---
Frostbite had already triggered from the Cone Of Cold, meaning the target was already CC'd, so using Frost Nova there was just a waste of that spell. You just want to cast a Frostbolt when Frostbite triggers, Shatter increases crit chance vs frozen targets.
---
One’s more popular than the other. Okay, doesn’t mean there can’t be parallels.
---
no.
---
@people were garbage, but "few pioneers advanced pvp" -- 
---
I'm sorry, but that's just not true. You would find dozens and dozens of such players, just needed to look on any good PvP server and go through the server top premade. 
---
They were minority for sure, since WoW was such a hit and attracted complete pvp newbies, but it's not like it was a first ever PvP game and experienced players (doesn't even need to be from MMORPGs, just needs to be from highly competitive games) find the ideal solutions pretty fast.
---
they better not mess with my furbolg rod
---
Blizzard working hours are Pacific, this is at the end of their working day...
---
My son, the moment you were born the very forests of azeroth whispered your name:
---
*Gnomekiller69*
---
I feel so vindicated. I said this was the case and that private servers especially had larger aggro radius than intended for gray mobs ESPECIALLY but was always ignored. I love this.
---
i think id go gnome and run to teldrassil to level there, a gnome over there is more special than a human. people /w you and ask what you do there, you have calss trainer there and can farm rep for the saber mounts. human would be easy mode because of the diplomacy racial.
---
I'm actually surprised how few abilities Priests have. I guess it makes sense since they are suppose to be the primary healers.
---
Do you know at what time that is?
---
Here is some reasons why you did it faster during Wrath (TBC Patch 2.3) :
---
* The amount of [experience](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Experience) needed to gain a level has been decreased between levels 20 and 60. In addition, the amount of experience granted by [quests](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest) has been increased between levels 30 and 60.
---
*  Level 1-60 dungeon quests have had their experience and faction rewards increased. 
---
*  Many elite creatures and quests in the level 1-60 experience have been changed to accommodate solo play. 
---
Maybe there is a WOTLK patch doing this too unfortunately...
---
Blizzard HQ working hours would be European evening, so our player base would actually be ideal for them in that perspective
---
Am quite disappointed at this...they’ve obviously bet that there’ll be a lot more NA players willing to stress test than EU
---
durotartion\*
---
Retail is about to get a new patch very soon (with a raid following a month later). Classic will be on the same sub, so they would want updates to happen while the other game has downtime. Therefor August is perfect for Classic.
---
Bobby B = rightful king of Azeroth
---
For some reason I think it would have been easier on me if I didn't know the release date for another 30-60 days, but it wouldn't matter. People would've just bitched about not knowing the release date. Now that we know the date, people are bitching about it not coming soon enough.
---
I think people just like to complain.
---
Might there be a case of elite mob damage being significantly lowered throughout the patches? Have elites that hit like wet noodles really, really takes away from the game.
---
Soooo server meltdown August 26th?
---
This is the happiest I've seen venruki while playing wow in a long time 
---
He always seems so burnt out and negative when playing bfa
---
I'm glad he embraces classic
---
I played on a PvE server on one of the biggest PServers and it was sooooo boring...
---
One of the first things I ever noticed playing a PServer was that aggro radius and especially leash distances were tiny compared to my memory of vanilla
---
The warrior and mage is mine, still have them.   The priest was the guild master i happened to have some of his screenshots.
---
The chat channel name we're using isn't hard-coded. It changes and is very random. So they'd have to constantly monitor what channel we're using and knock it out, but the moment the addon detects the chat channel isn't functioning, it just makes a new one.
---
And the specific addon you're talking about, AVR, used some API calls that weren't very common amongst other addons. Blizzard did not (and could not) specifically target the addon. [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20100522015732/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25002150557&amp;sid=1).
---
It's the same with the addon BabelFish, which allowed cross-faction communication. Blizzard couldn't simply ban the addon and the API call was using was too simple to remove because it would break so much else. So they made it a violation of the ToS and promised to suspend/ban anyone that used it. It still works today.
---
I highly doubt Blizzard is going to make using our addon against the ToS. First, they're not using separate ToS for Classic and Retail. Second, the language they use would have to be so non-specific that it would catch anyone on a Discord server and then Blizzard would have to suspend/ban them all.

It's incredibly ugly! But in wow classic... It's the most beautiful thing
---
Pretty much the reason why retail is the way it is, people can be quite vocal but never actually think throughly the things they say. That being said, i want 2.x druids in classic cause they were better than 1.12
---
Same!
---
Don't get me wrong! Raiding is (at least was until I quit on Legion) that I feel Blizzard still does Top Notch work...and I am not even saying that Classic raiding was harder than nowadays raids.
---
I wasn't even trying to go there.
---
What I was trying to say is back in the day, you either killed Ragnaros, C'thun, Nefarion, etc...or you didn't. There was no "kids version" Ragnaros, "family many" Ragnaros, "4 times a week Gym member very fit" Ragnaros and "super duper on steroids" Ragnaros for you to kill.
---
I totally agree that a Raid Finder and a Mythic version of the boss can not be compared, because its ludicrous but effectively they are the same figure...the same lore character inside the same raid and setting...and killing him again and again....by the time you get the Mythic kill you have seen him die at least a dozen times before...it is still rewarding but not as much! At least for me, maybe I just like the lore and I try to get some immersion feeling out of raids.
---
Let me try to give you my personal example here, the last progress worthy of mention that I did in WoW in recent years was Mythic Archimonde on Hellfire Citadel (ironically it was on my least favourite expansion), when I finally got the kill with the guild I was on it felt good and rewarding but I didn't screamed I didn't jump out of my chair it was just, "yes we fucking did it!" I have seen the cutscene dozens of times before, I have fought on that scenario over and over, I have seen Archimonde fall by our might hundreds of times...it was just not that version! Mythic usually have an extra phase and usually a tiny bit of extra lore attached to it, which is nice but not enough (again personal opionion).
---
Like what 14 years ago (?), I spent so much time on Nefarion back in classic, when we finally killed the bastard, the ventrilo EXPLODED for minutes!!! It was crazy, my heartbeat skyrocketed it was insane! It felt amazing and not just "Yes we fucking did it!"
---
Going back to Ironforge talking to people in front of the AH, talking about it, it felt great!
---
And its not even about how hard it is now and how hard it was then...because most of the mythic fights now are harder than raids back then. One can argue that back in the day we had other challanges like, addons were not as good, coordinating 40 people is harder than coordinating 25, resist gear, etc, etc...but I personally feel that over all raids are harder now(again only up to date till Legion).
---
Its about the feel, how immersive and rewarding it felt, raids and everything else.
---
Sorry for the wall of text btw, nostalgia hits hard.
---
Blizzard is simply not going to break addons like Recount and DBM. They were deemed so essential to Vanilla play that they were later added straight into the game in some fashion. We're not using any API calls that don't appear in both the 1.12 and Retail versions of these two addons.
---
Hah, this was one of the possibilities I suggested could be the cause. (Armour buffs not expiring)
---
1 - 3 am on Wednesday for Europe - great! -.-'
---
I wanted to have my Job until the 27th of August...
---
Boy is he gonna be surprised when phase 5 rolls around.
---
Is this the Stoneskin Totem bug Blizz already said they are working on where once buffed it's permanent even out of range of the totem?
---
Better than nothing dude
---
(i know its satire)  
---
I don't understand how you people are against the idea of an addon that lists group in its interface "Doing Zul'Farak need 1 healer", and then you whisper the leader.  
---
Absolutely 0 difference except you dont have to autisticaly stare at trade chat for 30 minutes and it would have search option.
---
Damn just checked on my account and nothing, assuming beta would show up there or just on the drop down on the launcher?
---
Yea its def not intended. 
---
I was watching Joana earlier this morning and he found and reported the same thing. He based it off a useless quest item that he always deleted during his quest guide, that he now noticed abandoned the quest as well.
---
I remember playing WC2 on MSDOS when I was around 9 years old and fucking loving every second of it. One of my first computer games, it had just come out.
---
Eventually beat the game and then somehow got my hands on WC1 and I just remember being horrified by the UI and graphics and gameplay, it felt so shitty compared to WC2 even though it was only a couple years old.
---
When WC3 came out when I was 14 or 15 it was such a glorious time, because I’d already been playing WC games for what felt like forever (note from adult self: five years is not forever) but it was just stunning to get a really modern version.
---
Games progressed so fast back then, and for the most part the newer games were really objectively better in every way.
---
It’s not like that at all anymore. Look at Classic WoW, about to take the world by storm because it’s objectively bis in its genre even though it’s 15 years old.
---
I'm not crying at all 😭😭💗💗💗
---
I think it had something to do with logging out then back in once arrived, but I'm not sure.
---
i think warlock, has two, three dots if you count imp as one, shadowbolt, shield, blood pact, +good pvp racials on every possible race
---
I dont onderstand that childish rivalry. I mean, its obvious the horde is better. Why bother?
---
Blizzard is not helping with thier Everything is working as intended attitude. Also all the guys saying memory, skill, knowledge, and gear explains it, well they are not helping either acting as if nothing like this could be wrong now that Blizzard has denied it. 
---
Where did Blizzard get thier OG 1.12 copy from anyway? That one might be acting up. Who the hell knows I just want Classic to be as good as Vanilla was.
---
How it is so hard to blacklist the communication similar to the inapropriate words?
---
I totally agree. You either kill the damn boss or you don't. I understand it would be more work but having easier bosses and harder bosses instead of difficulties on the same boss is more fun to me.
---
I don't expect classic to be as hard as mythic bosses mechanically but it might be a lot more rewarding to grind for and kill.
---
Yeah, but the aggro radius depends on your level compared to the enemy mob's, so, sure.
---
Would love to know this
---
My guess is it’s too early on the 21st for them to have sent the invites yet, but maybe I’m just blindly hoping because I don’t have one 😎
---
No, aggro range depends on the difference in level.
---
My account apparently got flagged for the beta somewhen in the last 12 hours and the entry already reads:
---
&gt; Classic WOW: Beta &amp; Stress Test
---
Not sure if it's gonna stick until after the stress test, but I assume. Haven't got an email yet.
---
Do what you want, hopefully blizz can prevent any sort of automation with add-ons.
---
What in the actual fuck I randomly clicked on this post literally 3 minutes after watching this scene . . .
---
Then again, I guess a lot of people are probably rewatching season 1.
---
Skeletal Miner, Undead Excavator, and Defias Overseer melee for ~ 113-135 damage (before armor).
---
*BEFORE ARMOR*
---
Add in mitigation, and what do you get? 
---
Also, are you comparing 1.12 vanilla to 1.12 classic? 
---
Also, are these horde with a shaman running these? There’s a confirmed bug with Stoneskin Totem permanently lowering damage done by mobs.
---
That shouldnt give so much armor that it almost halves the dmg
---
They also said cheap training and expensive mount better fit the RPG element of the game. The 1.12 mount system was changed back in the day to make way for the burning crusade’s mount system and looking back didn’t best reflect classic. Thus they’re going with the 1.1 mount system
---
There are still gamebreaking bugs and you want to go as soon as possible ? Classic WoW isn't running on a stable client on which things got added. It works way different than any other Expansion would in a developer sense. And even with normal Expansions we still experience tons of bugs.
---
Let them figure it out. This is the first time they are doing this and they need to build a solid foundation. Not every bug is going to be fixed in 3 months, in fact I think we will have quite a few. But hopefully not gamebreaking ones
---
laughs in casual
---
I almost cried when he sold some of his trash items and realized he could afford the white vendor gear in the starting area 😭 he literally went "I'm rich! I can buy all of it" and then proceeded to count how much his total armor increased by every white item he put on. He was absolutely ecstatic!
---
I tried explaining to him that he'd get better gear from questing and might need his money for learning new abilities, but he was having none of that!
---
Its needed so People can move their vacation, kick out the kids and spouse or built up to a major sick leave without making it suspicious.
---
Damn, he is pretty cringe. But love wow and it's content though &lt;3
---
These are my favorite types of posts in this subreddit
---
\*God's work :)
---
Lame.
---
This is why I’m going horde. Gnomes are too good not to play and escape artist is arguably one of the best racials in the game and only on a 1 min cooldown.    Unfortunately gnomes are unplayable so it’s an undead mage for me and you know I’m gonna cannibalise every gnome I kill
---
I remember what to do in every single quests so I don't need it. 😊
---
Yeah, it's fucking annoying not knowing exactly what it comes down to. Like I have an account from 2012 that has had another account from 2005 sort of grafted to it after I recovered my original one. Does this count as a vanilla account or not? And what happens when you get an invite, will the taskbar icon blink or do you have to check continuously all day? Do you get an email or not? I keep hearing conflicting answers to these things and I'd love to not feel compelled to constantly restart the launcher and check the drop-down menu for a new Classic option.
---
It shouldn't be in retail either but ever since Gearscore became a thing 10 years ago it's here and it'll definitely be in Classic one way or another. It's a shame but unfortunately that's how the community works.
---
Easy, pick a server where a big streamer plays, play the opposite faction. There, you have tons of targets to kill on a big pop server.
---
LOL
---
ahahahahahah &lt;3
---
Gods the writing was strong then
---
Wall jump is not in beta though and will not come back
---
To anyone who is dismissive of these posts:
---
It's important to report this stuff, even if it might not be a bug. Blizzard could have all the numbers right, but maybe something else is broken, and they need to look into it.
---
Keep reporting anything that doesn't seem right.
---
Haha. Ahh they joy of being able to play the game just the way you like it. 💗 I remember being a total noob in vanilla, it took me ages to get to 60 cause it was so fun exploring the world instead!
---
But having bigger muscles or more money IRL wont increase my dps ingame.
---
If there are problems with elite damage values, it would appear that it is also happening with alliance characters. If it is a bug it is bigger than just Stoneskin Totem.
---
Laughs in EU
---
All 3 links are from an alliance PoV
---
Because the "communication" our addon is using between players is a seemingly random sequence of characters. Even if they dove into our code, pulled the hashing algorithm, and blacklisted it, we would just change the method we're using to communicate to code words that are common English. 
---
"13 fish 47 UBRS 12 stab 92 chocolate 41 mike" would let our addon know there's a level 59 shaman looking to heal in an UBRS run and has the key to open it. So now EVERY player can't say fish or UBRS or stab or chocolate or mike? No, that won't work.
---
Actually it is permanently reducing mob damage by a fairly significant amount, from what I’m hearing.
---
I got one. Perth here.
---
But being fit will engage your brain and therefore make you work better in all aspects. Hence being fit IRL will help with DPS.
---
Its not about stability, its the bugs they need to find and fix.
---
From their archives. It’s not like they just downloaded it off the internet. Really?
---
Yeah but shamans are only on Horde and the examples I've seen from Deadmines were Alliance players:) And doesnt Stoneskin give armor?
---
This is what I suspect. Im confident Blizzard’s numbers *are* correct, just that there are bugs with how those numbers are applied, or that there might be issues with how mitigation is computed. Especially considering it’s drastically different in the modern client.
---
I really hope Blizzard tries, but I don't see how they will. We're not using any API calls that both 1.12 and Retail versions of Recount and DBM don't also use. To break us would break addons deemed so crucial to the Vanilla experience that they were later added into the base game in some fashion later on.
---
I'm not upset about it. It's boring content. Hes replaying someone elses content and giving pointless feedback no one asked for. I dont watch his stuff anymore so it doesnt really matter.
---
I say this as someone who played all of Vanilla WoW from launch, I don't want an automated dungeon finder tool, but it would be nice to have something similar to the group finder tool though where it shows people that are looking for group members and let's you send an them IM. So you'd just see something like "LF1M Scholo DPS" next to a name and you could right click and send them a message. This would still facilitate talking to people, there'd be no apply button or auto accept, you'd still want to build relationships with good/trust worthy players and add them to your friends list, but it's better than spamming "/2 LFM UBRS no rouges"
---
Thank you.
---
But thats what i mean. Right now i cant expand anything because there is nothing.
---
On every other game, Hots Overwatch etc i can expand a menu and change the region. At the WoW Tab  there is nothing... :-)
---
If you're serious about PvP it's gnome.
---
I never even got to 60! I was a kid so playing wow was more like playing with toys to me
---
I'm very excited to maybe try my hand out at the endgame raiding this time around! And being able to get a 100% mount. There's still stuff for me to explore in classic and I can't wait!
---
This scenario seems more and more likely.
---
Okay so how does 135 damage fo down to 20-30 damage? I can totally understand why you'd say I am wrong because they have more resources, but the numbers are clearly off.
---
Around what time did you get the invite?
---
Ya honestly it’s a pretty selfish thing to just assume everyone is gonna be ok with you forcing them to wait.  You’re in a dungeon to kill the mobs and do the quests, not so you can get a personal skinning crew  At the very least you could DPS to give them the option of still pulling. 
---
There’s a difference between going slow and wasting other peoples’ time because you can’t be arsed to go grind mobs solo.
---
Pet talents were in wotlk too
---
Damn he's getting dps'ed down hard
---
Exactly what I thought, haha
---
People are extremely toxic and elitist to the point where they set high bars based on IO score because they want to be carried. You can't get into M+ because your low arbitrary score but you can't increase your made up bullshit score because no one will invite you. Basically you are fucked and have to make your own groups or get a guild if you want to pad your IO score, which ironically almost defeats the purpose of the party finder.
---
Well, there was posts about bug that was already found. Damage reduction of a shaman totem stayed on the char even when the shaman wasnt in the group anymore. Could explain example this too. Maybe all possible buffs you gathered in your gaming session kept on showing on your char. So you had like druid buff (even if no druid), shaman/paladin damage reduction etc...
---
Because a warrior can easily have 30-50% armor reduction, add some bugged damage reduction and then you will see these kind of numbers. 
---
It doesnt mean that the boss damage values are wrong, there are loads of things happening after that that can cause what was explained here.
---
Furthermore, even if it did give an insane amount of armor, the amount of damage the NPC's are doing exceeds even that level of reduction because there is a % cap on how much damage armor can reduce.
---
Thank you, so sorry.
---
It amazes me how people will try to ease peoples excitement and justify why streamers get special access to practice when they get to play literally all day and do little to no actual testing.
---
exe. OP is a Streamer White Knight.
---
Next thread: Level 5 BiS gear guide
---
Tell that to the spergs that minmax 20 hours a day and havnt left there basement in 8 years.
---
I dont think so because I have seen videos from future expansions where they still did more than 20-30 damage. It was triple that at least.
---
Well, if shaman totem buffs stay on a char, that might be the case with paladin auras too.
---
Heads in the sand til someone tanks nefarian in DPS gear without a shield because elites do 30% of their intended damage.
---
Done
---
Yeah I can't wait either. It is such a great feeling. Can't believe they actually are launching it again. 😍 Good luck on your journey 😁 may Elune be with you 😁
---
Dont go gnome then? Playing a race you actually like beats racials, it's not THAT big of a deal. Perception can be nice in some situations too.
---
They said they were gonna keep some things that led to the same end result. The example they used was the "open all" feature for mailboxes. That's going to stay because it probably doesn't have a great impact. Maybe this is one of those things, or maybe it slipped their minds.
---
I assume it's so that they have time to do any last minute setup and fixes more than anything. And potentially be able to get people that arrive home from work
---
You can do all of that now in BFA. And progression will be "wiped" since there are expansions planned.
---
Yeah! I am actually super pumped for the 0.5 set. Just going to take my time and try to get BiS for lvl 20,30,40 by doing all leveling dungeons etc... then ending with the 0.5 grind... I haven't been this exited for a game since... probably 2004
---
Have you the wallpaper without the pictures?
---
Play on the opposite faction of a streamer?
---
Wow, you are a special kind of stupid.
---
Hello,   
---
whats the name of the addon on the second screenshot which shows the HP and Manabars around the character? I used this some time ago but I dont remeber the name.
---
Faster corpse runs are also a nice perk for a new explorer.
---
just play pserver until there, can do more than what the beta can and with 100x the amount of people, certain ones are straight popping off right now, fun as fuck.
---
I don't hate BfA, but it's truly mind-boggling to me how something like this can make it to live.  
---
During developement, or at least testing, someone had to say "wow, this isn't fun at all, we should rework it or do something else".
---
Their reasoning behind this is that the 1.12.1 change was basically a tbc prepatch. But you are right, there are exceptions.
---
Oh fuck I have an old WoW Classic Atlas at home.
---
Its a beta. Report it.
---
&gt; Skeletal Miner, Undead Excavator, and Defias Overseer melee for ~ 113-135 damage (before armor).
---
&gt; BEFORE ARMOR
---
&gt; Add in mitigation, and what do you get?
---
Given that the druid has 1428 armour you'd get 67-81 from their ~41% damage mitigation, whereas the video is showing 23-30
---
Asmongold and Sodapoopin hit 30 in 2 days. The f\*\*k are you talking about?
---
I never played WOW before. I've always played Lineage 2 since C3 era (arround 2005-2006) but some days ago i've enteren on that wow vanilla 1.12 patch and i think its an OK game, way better than any modern MMO. But since i came after those 14 years of playing Lineage 2, i can see clearly that some things are way better in l2 and some are better in wow.
---
Not being able to pvp anyone in wow from lvl 1 is kinda weird since people dont help each other in questing even if they are in the same faction.
---
Jumping is retarded. I understand that being a hunter you cant just shoot arrows to hit closer targets (this simulates reality) but really... jumping? Thats what i do for a living, fighting with my fists on the street and jumping like a retard.
---
horde = orc, alliance = gnome, quite simple. pvp &gt; pve for racials, pve is faceroll anyway.
---
And they have even shown what they do after. Nothing, because there is not hing else. Realism bro
---
I never vouched for streamers, and I never stated that you shouldn't be excited. 
---
What I said is why waste 3 months doing nothing but sat refreshing Reddit and Emails. Why not be productive IRL, gain a high energy and improve your life as a whole. 
---
It amazes me how little you must have read of my post to assume that I thought streamers should have gotten the Beta Keys. Which in no way was stated that I believed that.
---
Kraun is a great mage, he plays with APES.

A lot of the clips in the APES video is from his PoV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjG4UpuL84M
---
Most likely a bug, it’s possible that Defense Aura is having a similar effect to Stoneskin Totem.
---
I would wonder if all of the flat damage reduction buffs are acting this way.
---
Most likely a bug regardless. I’m still confident the numbers are correct and it’s a mitigation issue.
---
If I’m proven wrong, I’ll gladly admit it.
---
Alt +F4, then log into another toon before switching to your dead toon sometimes worked.
---
But usually if you logged out, the game would still reset your spirit form to the graveyard you were sent to when you first died.
---
You ok there bud?
---
Ah oki. If it worked on the demo, the final release should work also. Cheers !
---
I thought that Stoneskin gave armor, too. That doesn't explain an 80% reduced damage output. At any rate, my point is that the damage that players are taking from Elites is off by a massive amount. Whether or not they're damage values for each mob is correct or incorrect, I don't know.
---
Lv8 twinking is a thing.  It's a really great thing :)
---
"Clearly", as in "[classicdb.com](https://classicdb.com)" is the nostalrius data, aka the private server everyone compares stuff to. This is not the real data.

---
This is a level 22 mage getting hit by the elite goblins before the shredder boss. They hit him, a cloth class, for 40-50 damage. 
---
[https://youtu.be/zPSDVj0mNcY?t=2454](https://youtu.be/zPSDVj0mNcY?t=2454)
---
Asmongold gets hit by this dudes, as a tank, for 20-30 damage. That seems correct to me.
---
I used the goblins because I can't find old footage of other deadmine mobs :/
---
Stoneskin reduces damage taken, which is still a form of mitigation, the big with the Totem though is that the effect would stay on the player continuously.
---
Playing PvE server takes like 80% of the fun out of vanilla tho
---
No, but seriously don't nerf them :(
---
I did hear something about asmon and soda playing on the same server on different factions but it was just a passing comment asmon responded to on stream.
---
Plenty to play against but almost none to play with. Sounds like a good idea.
---
Imagine having a horrible economy and terrible end game because you couldn't deal with getting ganked.
---
Well, you gotta engage with people if you want help with quests! Sometimes people randomly invite you, but sometimes you gotta ask them if they want to work together.
---
Classic is all about bringing people together and engaging interactions!
---
EU here. I've been subbed since DAY ONE and no invite...
---
Even if it's paladin aura, it's still way too much mitigation unless it's stacking with itself?
---
Usually early morning pst so like 8-9am pst
---
I've been waiting 10 years for a return. Three months is nothing, only 2.5% of the time I've already waited.
---
It says on the beta sign up page at the bottom
---
And the armor displayed would surely account for any bugged buffs that never left the character, I imagine?
---
You whiteknighted for streamers and are emploring people forget about what Blizzard should be doing; testing the servers without the lens through the streamers.
---
Noap! I guess I'll just forget what we all fought for the past 5 years and tell Blizzard, "Noap, its okay you are failing to test realistic server load, I understand its just one big advertisement; we will all be bettering our lives and Classic will be ready and waiting for the average gamer in 3 months right?"
---
Wrong.
---
I have no clue, it was many years ago.
---
I would assume it was ArcHud (Based of Titanpanel on the bottom right side)
---
&gt;Just like if I'm forming up a group with pugs in classic and invite someone to realize they're in terrible gear for what we're about to do, I'm going to kick them. They haven't put in the time and effort yet.
---
"I'm going to kick this person trying to put in time and effort because they haven't put in any time and effort yet." 
---
Assuming we're talking about dungeons, I hope your personality is this transparent in Classic so the community quickly knows you as a dirtbag. For dungeons at 60 you better expect a lot of green gear.
---
Sit crits proccing talents like Enrage is working in Classic Beta right now. Esfand and others have been able to reproduce it consistently.
---
Blizzard should force them to play on certain servers, charge the children that want to play with them extra for a sub that let's you make toons on content creator servers. Enough would pay an extra 3 or 5 a month to play near soda
---
I would remove the anecdotal commentary from your post and add it to the bug report thread, I think there is already discussion on it, but more light shed doesn’t hurt.
---
Genuinely interested in seeing if current faction imbalance in retail will affect classic.
---
Calling classic god's work is a bit insulting to classic, dontcha think
---
Same. Made my account on day 1 of EU and no beta.
---
Okay. But many of the streams and videos I've seen were just Alliance.  Paladino bluffs are not like Stoneskin.
---
It's a TV show, not a movie. A movie I could see because of limited seats and piracy is shit quality. But not a TV show.
---
I can't wait for Asmongold to babyrage because he didn't get an item he wants, Rage Quits, and the server dies.
---
I think most of Asmongold’s viewers are EU,he did a poll before - his stream times line up better with EU.
---
ill survive, 3 months is enough time to maybe teach myself how to be patient over something I am absolutely SO HAPPY FOR. EZ goal, challenge accepted self reflecting thoughts
---
I'm in the same boat. I plan to roll rogue again and wanted to do so on alliance, but I can't bring myself to accept the +25% stun resist that every Orc is going to have against me.
---
Where you sign up for the various franchises betas? Ok will check when I’m home, thanks
---
Bette than classic. Summon everyone, give everyone healthstones, press 1 until the boss is dead, you don’t get gear, come back next week or you’re never going to.
---
Must not have much faith in their hardware when they don't run it on a weekend.
---
There was a delay or internal cd when switching forms that didnt allow this in the past. Thats missing.
---
I can respect your feel on that. But the goblins were still elite. They used to hit clothiers for around or more than 100 damage IIRC.
---
Vs a lock why wasn't trigger happy nova just irrelevant though, why would that decide the duel right there
---
But everything WAS Working as intended with creature damage, it was a totem bug.
---
Gnomes were created for the Horde to punt and cannibalize. They also make great scouts for the Alliance due to the important races not giving a shit if the return home alive from said scouting missions.
---
Idk i wouldnt put it past him but at the same time i dont think he'd just quit imo he's the type of retard to probably push hard to do naxx 40 when it eventually rolls around
---
No I'm not. That would mean I have to agree with Streamers getting the Beta, I couldn't care less who gets the beta imo, it's to level 30, is a time sink and just a tide over for the hype of a game that'll be coming out in a fraction of time anyway. 
---
Forcing your opinion on someone because it fits your butt hurt state of mind is hilarious. 
---
- They have a Stress Test incoming X3
---
- There are a large amount of Non-Streamers in the Beta, I fact there is a MAJORITY of Non-Streamers on the beta. 
---
Your anger stems from YOU not getting the beta and is a result of some unrealistic sense of self importance. 
---
Yes Streamers got the Beta. Even those like Towliee who to my knowledge was totally against Classic? I don't agree with this because they didn't do the hard work to get here. Regardless, them bringing in viewers is in part, a good thing. 
---
Keep looking at the negatives though dude. I'm not going to sit and stroke your misplaced ego.
---
But he just showed evidence where that isn’t the case. Not to come down on you, but a lot of us remember things differently.
---
Oh my god shut up, no they didn’t. Stop repeating what every “influencer” is saying about the show and form an opinion on your own. The finale was great.
---
My main language is German but I will set my client to Englisch to increase my language skills.  
---
Usually understanding the quest is not a problem but if I really have no clue what to do I will activate Questie.
---
It never was though
---
How? There is so much to do?
---
Are you US horde? Add me if you want to play!
---
Remarkable, you interpret my criticism as anger; laughable.
---
Level 30 isn't just a "Time Sink", the yare literally able to practice 1-30 over and over and over with the new mechanics. 
---
Streamer White Knight.
---
Asmon confirmed he's going to PvE, he went full casual after being destroyed yesterday and today trying to get his Axe. He was playing offstream today with the "bests" Ally by his side just for that Axe when Sony had 2 Full raids vs Staysafe. That was fun to watch, best PvP so far in the beta.
---
I don't watch the streams for the same reason. I have seen a few clips here and there, though.
---
Bring back the first super long AV with korrak, scraps, collecting items from corpses, mines on the ground. That was the best version of av.
---
HQ is in california, thats 9 hours difference to CET. And they are posting the local times its from 4 to 6pm. It needs to be late in US to get as much ppl in it as possible, but not too late... if you know what i mean.
---
I think it was around 10-11am Perth time. The confirmation email didn’t come until a day after.
---
Don't get me wrong, if that is how someone wants to live and that's what they get joy from then all the power to them! There are just many many arguments FOR fitness and it's correlation to good old brain function :)
---
&gt;That being said, BFA is a much worse game than classic.
---
Right now, Classic and Retail are so different that it's hard to make a comparison. 
---
Classic is an RPG first, and an MMO second.
---
Retail is an MMO first, and an RPG second.
---
Retail has focused on making it easy for many players to play together, and the RPG aspects have been simplified.
---
Classic is an RPG where the players have to create the MMO aspects themselves. There is a framework there to use, but it's up to the players to connect with each other.
---
The MMO aspects in classic are more natural, while they are more procedural in Retail.
---
It's a matter of perspective which of them is best at the moment. 
---
If you want a traditional MMORPG experience, Classic is definitely the best option.
---
Retail is almost closer to the Looter Shooters or Diablo than a MMO RPG, and if you are looking for that kind of experience it's good. 
---
I remember watching the Anthem disaster, and thinking that most of the loot issues could probably be solved by taking some ideas from wow (Dungeon specific loot to get players to run more varied dungeons, Affixes for higher difficulties to make high level play more interesting/varied and less reliant on just pumping up the numbers, Being able to select the spec you get loot for, ....). This was when I realized Retail is closer to a great Looter Shooter than to a good MMORPG.
---
I think it was around 20-21.00 CEST. Making it around 11-12am in Blizz hq.
---
Yeah sounds about right with when NA get their invites as well, guess I only need to check once a day
---
Yeah I get your points, but isn't as soon as possible defined as when they fix the game breaking bugs and check the stability?
---
Hahaha this is probably fairly accurate
---
I mean I know nothing of game development, but making vanilla in the legion client was supposedly so difficult they claimed they couldn’t do it (until ofcourse our hero did a prototype at home In his spare time &lt;.&lt; bloody corporates). With that being the case it seems plausible that unforeseen issues would mess with damage numbers for a vast amount of random reasons.
---
I totally forgot about mages making portals for easy access to other cities!!
---
Dungeons yes, raids no.
---
You can heal any dungeon as any spec assuming you have some healing gear to use.
---
Have you been playing wow in the interim?
---
Because I'm tired of them being all over this subreddit. That being said I'm kind of regretting saying anything now. This topic is pretty polarizing people either HATE streamers and there crowds out right, or refuse to see any negative consequences of having this game swarmed with streamers and there followers and upvote them blindly.
---
W/e I just hope we can get back to how it was before all the streamers had beta once live comes around
---
&gt; lso why bring 5 people to a dungeon when you can bring less for more chances at loot and more xp?
---
Because bringing an extra person is a 40-50% increase in speed at only a 25% xp/loot cost?
---
Something these streamers likely were not doing is banking rage from one fight to the next, and if your healer needs to drink, pop blood rage between fights. Once you get Anger Management, you almost always start fights in dungeons with a decent amount of rage.
---
In the early game, you’ll have a difficult time of it. I’d say there will be a couple dungeons that will be beyond your reach. That is until everyone has much better gear and can just faceroll the content.
---
But try it. If you’re constantly OOM and your friends are dying, you’ll have your answer.
---
May someone pls explain me why this is an issue? 
---
It was not in classic is not an issue for me btw.
---
I always found wow pvp pretty boring to watch, its fun to play but if im watching someone id rather watch them push high end raids and shit.
---
It’s because he’s legitamently wrong.
---
OSRS and runescape in 2007 are two completely separate games. Classic Runescape died like 3 years ago.
---
Iirc it just states a flat number reduction, not a + armour value. Neither explains it either way tho.
---
Please keep me updated when you are able to test
---
&gt; Because I'm tired of them being all over this subreddit.
---
Well it seems like you then **do** care about it.
---
It is anger.
---
- Name Calling
---
- Being totally unreasonable
---
- Refusing to see a point of view other than the one you seek to impose on others. 
---
There are hundreds more people in the beta than just streamers. I just hope that they are interested in testing the game.
---
You are simply angry you are not one of them. 
---
Keep salty though, maybe use the next 3 months to humble yourself and get a better attitude! I'm not going to reply after this though, I think it's clear where your head is at and I'm not a welfare centre.
---
wow was an extremely early contender in the market of mmos
---
true there were games like eq, daoc, asherons call, ultima etc but people were bad at them too
---
it wasn't really until high speed internet started becoming ubiquitous that people started becoming genuinely good at mmos, video tutorials and in depth imagery explaining complicated mechanics weren't a thing when people were playing wow on their 128k isdn or 1m cable
---
go back and rewatch some vanilla pvp videos, half the "goats" were keyboard turning ability clickers
---
Can you tell me what lines you add to autoexec.bat and config.sys to make it fun better?
---
Horde scum, you life will drain on the end of my blade.
---
Same bus. My irk character sucks and I played wow pretty much nonstop from bc to now
---
I'm calling you a Streamer White Knight, thats a "Name call" to you?
---
LOL. Ok, Go back to Twitch chat.
---
With gear it’s possible, but it will be slower since you need to drink more and probably some mana pots too. Last time a leveled on a pserver it gas fine to heal as shadow until BRD. Went OOM on emperor. You probably will need to be holy/disc for a while if you want to heal 60 dungeons before you have good healing gear.
---
You misunderstood my meaning, so when you shift from human to bear form I *think* you get an hp boost? Google says 25% bonus stamina. Second assumption is that when you shapeshift in and out your **current** hp stays the same. It would look like this.
---
human form 50/100 hp
---
shifts into dire bear: 62.5/125 hp
---
So while you still gained 25% stamina or 25% more total and current hp, you remained at 50% hp the entire time. This is a HUGE mechanic in DOTA so I'd recognize it in any other game. (treads swapping, dropping items during heals)
---
Potions heal a flat number, you want to reduce your total hp pool to as small as possible (in other words human form) so that the potion heals a higher **percentage** of your total hp, which in turn increases how much hp you have when you shift and reapply the 25% multiplier.
---
But seeing as how they apparently can't drink potions in animal form this "clever use of mechanics" was mandatory so dang.
---
Best season
---
I spent most of time as a 19 twinked rogue trying to break my level of highest level character killed in a duel.
---
I think my record was a lvl 42 rogue.
---
The WoW Classic population at launch is not going to be a good metric for a month out, 3 months out, 6 months out, etc. Realm populations changed drastically over the years in Vanilla WoW.
---
Nice, fake percentages lol. I love when people pull random percents out of their ass and use them as facts.
---
The streamers are kinda playing in a controlled environment right now. Once they are let loose on real servers I think it is likely that slot of streamers who roll PVP will get really sour about that choice real fast.
---
If only it was just "influencers"...
---
Have you ever actually played WoW on that account? Do you own WoW?
---
I should get a bit more zen! Honestly I just really excited and that addicted side of my personality that saw me go full days with out food or toilet breaks just wants to play!
---
I've really missed wow since I stopped playing in 2009, but could never justify getting back into it as the expansions rolled out. The removal of one of my extremely rare pets (Rak'Shiri) was the cherry on top after Cataclysm. Weeks waiting for him to spawn, took him on so many adventures only for him to be turned into a standard white tiger...
---
After i watched one of the streamers tank RFK with a two hander and even doing big pulls i knew somthing was off. ...
---
No, it wasn't. Last episode was good but there were major problems with whole 8th season. If you say otherwise, you are either fool or ignorant. I don't know which is worse.
---
Streamer White Night is what you are calling me. A name which is not mine. 
---
Hence it is name calling. Is it hurtful, negative. Is it funny. Possibly. 
---
But it's alllll from your saltyness. 
---
Stay mad.
---
Yes I have the blender backgrounds without the picture frames.
---
&gt;BUT FEAR NOT, I, InsaneKane
---
&gt;have used my beta access to create an addon that works in the classic beta already and will only be better and more used by launch !
---
&gt;It allows you to queue with the press of and button and be matched with the perfect members for your group IN MOMENTS
---
&gt;no more waiting for a healer in ironforge or being depressed by how sad orgrimmar looks in classic, noone exlcuding you because your gear isnt good enough, no more boredom wishing you had back pet battles, noone ragging on you because you ninjaloot all the damn time.
---
How can he not pick that up as satire? It's hilarious how he is getting the exact reaction he sat out to get. Call me an optimist, but I would have said people wouldn't fall for this if they actually read it, but here we are.
---
Also deleting quest removing quest item, was not a vanilla server but I saw it happen on stream.
---
less time playing wow, more time doing things that suck, no thx
---
straight to 60 for me. enjoy your increased while health while I'm already level 60 in full tier 1 :)
---
The issue is as Horde I feel no faction pride because we have Garrosh all over again except with necromancy and even more moustache twirling, and as Alliance I feel no pride because everything we do is in reaction to what the Horde does or otherwise is just an extension of the Horde story.
---
The situation in vanilla was more akin to a cold war, neither side actually wanted war but quietly supported subfactions that pursued it. Thrall even outright wanted peace.
---
I think the biggest difference though is there's minimal actual story revolving the conflict, which keeps it generally light-hearted and more community driven. In BfA after about ten expansions of working together to fight a bigger threat it seems forced as hell to make us have an entire expansion about the war. That and as well as being forced it's unnecessarily extreme and a weak attempt at making it "serious" by having a genocide right at the start,which both came off as very forced and now Blizzard are rapidly trying to brush the burning of Teldrassil under the rug like it never happened.
---
So the Horde feel shitty because not only did we do this back in MoP, we also get made into villains again (which we haven't been since Warcraft 2). Alliance feel shitty because they sit and watch our plot unfold while getting no story of their own.
---
I'm just excited for it, and I can see a lot of my friends getting excited to. But I know that in three months they will be over it, and won't jump in.
---
In Tirisfall yesterday, the rain was so heavy it really did restrict what I could see. It was amazing!
---
I leveled a priest in tbc and it was pretty much identical, except a bit faster.
---
On the top left there is a "get new reddit" link that undoes the setting.
---
Probably the best solution!
---
Jon having internal conflict and trying to find good in Dany before killing her, knowing that the one who will be hurt the most is him was great too.

Wow lost its sparkle to me in 2009 bro, that's a decade
---
whatever dude
---
To explain it from my PoV. Many people see the older game as being the pinnacle of WoW. Specifically up to Wotlk and more specifically with the end of Ulduar. There has been a lot added and taken away from the game over the years. What most people agree on is, Wow lost it's soul at the end of WoTLK. Something that once made people feel a sense of achievement was replaced with participation trophies. Many people just want to see what WoW would have become w/o the features that made it a casual game... Most players disagree about when the point of no return was but we all agree, if they were to ever start over (new content old expansion) it would be most ideal to happen around classic. The changes toward casual came in during BC but didn't "break wow" until late WotLK.
---
I will not use one. Getting immersed while leveling is a big part of what made me enjoy the leveling journey back in the day.
---
Seeing markers on my map exactly where a quest pickup or objective is, or some big waypoint in the middle of the screen will drag me straight out of that immersion. 
---
I'm not diving back into one of my favorite game experiences just to auto-pilot through a big part of that experience.
---
This is just my personal opinion of course :)
---
I started streaming just for the opportunity to stream classic for years people have told me I should stream. I never wanted too cause I couldn't stream private servers on twitch, I'm so excited to take my small community with me on a journey of a game I'm super passionate about. I'm so hyped for the chance to grow my community and show them everything I've learned being in the private server and retail scene since 2005.
---
This is exactly what no one wants. Perfect realm to me would be no less than a 40% bias
---
I used Thottbot a lot, I even had an addon that displayed the comments for quests in game. I don't see much difference.
---
Your evidence for Rhahk’zor is a comment, which you dont know is true, there is no idea of his gear nor talents? 
---
Great evidence mate.
---
I honestly think elite damage is correct BUT this is the important part. That there's some bug reducing it that no one has figured out.      
---
The only reason I say it is because it'd be weird for some elites to be major differences for some people (or all) but another chunk of them are completely fine.       
---
Like the elite panther in 1k needles in the cage seems to be pretty close or spot on compared from old vanilla footage to someone on beta
---
I'm almost certain it was flat physical damage reduction instead of armor. It was calculated before armor I think, so if your totem gave you 10 reduced damage taken, and you had 50% reduction from armor, you would end up with 5 less damage taken.
---
Keep the warning ongoing forever. This could just start from the very start maybe? 
---
I know there is wow census but if it was done internally we could get more accurate numbers as well
---
no one cares "what" the issue is as long as it's fixed, when all we have are videos to comb through it doesn't benefit anyone to get pedantic about where the issue is, you're speculating like everyone else
---
There will be VERY limited spots in the raid for affliction warlocks, I promise.
---
This is exactly what the speedrunning guild &lt;Onslaught&gt; does, even with harder numbers. They clear MC is 17.5 minutes and have a 16 second Vael kill. Their MT is Fury spec for the extra damage and threat generation. Healers just have to push harder.
---
This game is easy!
---
*In Nashkel Mines with Protagonist wearing Ankheg plate and dual-wielding Drizzt's Scimitars, at a total stat roll of 103
---
Sorry man but I think you're just getting old. Streaming has been massive for years now. It's massive world wide.
---
I guess priest with a wand.
---
Since none of us actually has access to the numbers Blizzard has, we are *all* speculating and using anecdotal evidence. 
---
What’s your point?
---
I am inclined to play Druid!
---
I want to heal as I always did from Classic to Legion and then quit, but to be completely honest one of the things I don't miss from Classic is priest gameplay...I mostly play it because, well it was the "healer" class. Paladins and Shamans were buffs and utility "mules" which was ok (different time right?) but I really wanted to heal so I gravitated towards priest.
---
I remember having a druid on my guild that pulled really good numbers when we got the addon to measure healing and DPS...but I also remember, that back then Rejuv and Regrowth didn't stack between druids...so we could only use one. This was the same with priests' renew but it wasn't that impactful.
---
If my memory serves me well, HoT mechanics were only changed on TBC right?
---
I am not even sure I will have enough time to reach raiding or if I even want to go back at raiding again. But if I do and I end up playing Druid I am afraid I will have an hard time finding a guild if HoTs doesn't stack.
---
An1 care to pinch in on this?
---
I always read it in Spongebobs voice
---
My wife would call you out too boy
---
august 27th can't come soon enough.
---
"Fake percentages" lmao... okay
---
A dungeon group of 4 has 2 dpsers, do we agree on this? If we assume the tank and healer contribute 20% and the dps between the dds is equal, you're going from 100% dps to 140% dps.... a 40% increase.
---
And this is of course ignoring the fact that adding more dps reduces downtime on top of killing faster.
---
How is that pulled out of my ass?
---
Now, you have 100% xp/loot shared 4 ways, that means you're getting 25% of it, add another player and you're only getting 20%, that's only a 20% decrease.
---
And this is of course ignoring you're getting a higher group bonus to XP
---
I love when people who can't do simple math accuse others of pulling numbers out of their ass.
---
I think private servers had the damage wrong. I leveled a mage in nostalrius to 60 and did some low level dungeon farming. In Stockades, if I didnt had the Ice Barrier on, mobs would kill me in few seconds... 
---
This is definitely not what I remember... I remember pulling half the stockades and aoe it down without much trouble. That said, I am not saying I wasnt able to clear stockades or scarlet, but it sure felt more difficult than how I remember it.
---
&gt; A rather more fitting comparisson would be Runescape: Classic, which was the vanilla game unchanged from it's original form
---
Blizzard itself stated that they are open for discussion what happens after 1-2 years and classic is still successful. There are a lot of players who are open for discussion too: re-releasing BC or releasing new content packs or whatever. The "no changes" screamers are only a (small) part of those who are interested in classic and if its really still successful why not introduce something new in classic.
---
We pay in tears everytime we remove a repost of Esfand killing a non-elite Murloc.
---
good find
---
I don't understand people's issues with quest add-ons so much that they refuse to even think of letting other people use them lol. (Was in vanilla btw) also this topics been reposted 10+ times now
---
Wow, I liked the season more than most but the finale was ass.
---
&gt;no one cares "what" the issue is as long as it's fixed, when all we have are videos to comb through it doesn't benefit anyone to get pedantic about where the issue is, you're speculating like everyone else
---
I honestly can't fathom which part of that is confusing you so if you need me to explain my point let me know where you're getting caught up.
---
The information is still out there. Disable quest addons and people are gonna go to Wowhead instead. When Blizzard talk about breaking addons I think they're more referring to addons that are more or less exploiting the client. Let's say there was an addon that lets you see what breaths Chromaggus has this ID without even starting the encounter.
---
190 days played on my warrior alone in vanilla. Mobs are hitting like wet noodles.
---
No, it was trash. Everything from episode 3 onwards was the lazily written garbage I’ve ever seen.
---
How fucking condescending could you be. Stop repeating what every mindless fanboy is saying about the show and form an opinion on your own.
---
If they didn't do it like that and send invites to unsubbed accounts, then they would have probably dead accounts or not enough active accounts in the beta, so no way for stress testing.
---
I feel like if they let you use the add-on in vanilla, they should probably just let you  use it Classic if you want.
---
If you make a pop up that constantly reminds a player they’re on the smaller faction, it’s just going to exasperate the problem.
---
I only played Warcraft 3 and that was more than enough to get me into vanilla :P. Also I had great respect for Blizzard since diablo 2.
---
Glad he got an invite. Even if he took my spot ;P
---
I Think having a an LFG tool (like you described) is worse.
---
A lfg took where you lidt yourself to W/E dungeon would be fine, I strongly feel an automated/rating system LFG tool will massively change/interfer with the Classic feel. I can just hope I am not alone :)
---
By typing this very title in the search bar, you would've find 100 similar topic
---
You know what. This is a good idea. I'm going to do the same. Brush up on some lore, and play the old titles again.
---
Imagine not being able to do anything because you end up on a 80/20 server.
---
Have fun though. :)
---
(none of us got invited sadly! I just joined a private server emulating the same patch that classic will launch with. Still waiting for our invite tho!)
---
I cant wait man
---
I hope he's got Cold Snap off cooldown.
---
As shadow, you're going to run oom a lot. It can be done but you have to pull carefully.
---
I once quit wow for 6 months. Was hyped to start playing again. Logged in. Was on my main in the main city on my mount. Jumped around a bit while finnishing the youtube vid I was watching. Watched another one and another one. After being afk for 2 hours I quit the game again for months. 
---
But if you feel like playing go for it.
---
The game had and has a dynamic addon system. There’s no way to limit that addon system to completely remove functionality of what people have thought of today.
---
A LFG addon is going to exist and it’s going to be wonderful.
---
I wasnt expecting you here u/Re1nForce :D
---
I'm not
---
I think this is a pretty terrible idea. Revealing that a server is unbalanced is basically a death sentence to the server, because new players will want to avoid it, and thus prevent the server from recovering.
---
Possibly I could get behind showing which faction is more populous (average concurrent player count over the last week, maybe), but not showing anything relating to magnitude. But this assumes that people are biased towards joining the less populous faction, which I'm not convinced is the case. As far as I can see, there are no significant incentives in game to play the less populous faction. (If we didn't have cross-realm BGs, BG queue time would matter, but aside from that, the only thing I can think of is "less competition", where you might as well be on a low pop realm.)
---
I'll never understand this toxicity towards people who've played on pservers. Of course, numbers and systems on pservers might've been off compared to the original, we know that. But pservers also run on the original client rather than the modern client, so it's probably not a bad idea to cross-reference them.
---
Regardless, isn't it a good thing if Blizzard is made to look into these sort of reports anyway? isn't that the point of the Beta?
---
One tanked RFK with a 2H *without* a healer until halfway in.
---
This is the only model i'll agree to have on TBC version, nothing else. Poor blood elf...
---
I love Druids, but I'm not excited about those first 10-20 levels.
---
I tought they tested it on beta and it worked? I've no source tho its been told to me.
---
Agreed, the point is that WoW Classic can have great success in the coming months if the interest stays high. Also if the streamers find entertaining stuff todo.
---
I can't post there because I don't have the beta
---
Not attend, available on. More information on this can be found at https://www.senilechieftains.com/guild-info#section-Attendancy
---
No fucking way. 
---
Link? 
---
Not that I dont believe you just if that's true then something is way off. Even on private servers a tank with the dungeon being green to him still had to pay attention
---
It doesn't really matter, though - does it? It's up to Blizzard to determine what's wrong and what isn't. If something feels off it needs to be reported and whether we believe it to be a false positive or not makes no difference.
---
You should try again, the world PvP is awesome and the dungeons/raids are so much fun!
---
Human if you're a min/max special boy
---
Dwarf if your tough as nails
---
I have nothing against private servers, and yes it's good for Blizzard to have to verify things are correct. Not really trying to be toxic against people that played on them (I did), it's just funny when people try to make it a fact something behaved a certain way because private servers had it, or that they're sure it had it (but then they played on private servers constantly skewing their memory)
---
Oi bro, wanna see a cool trick?
---
*...takes out a huge magnet from his pocket...*
---
I can't even fathom what poor taste you have if that is what you consider greatness.
---
Chinglish is aussie, he has beta been watching him while i wait for my beta invite.. he's got about 210ms.
---
thats the point, I dont want all the work wiped. I want to play with the level cap at 60. I was a hardcore raider from 2005 to 2012, and quit when Cata was released. Couldnt keep up due to job/wife/family. 
---
I've no interest at all in BfA, but classic excites me to get back playing the game I loved.
---
Played 3 days w/o sleep on Nostalrius launch, will do it in classic retail again &lt;3
---
This is the dream, i can finally be a shaman tank
---
WoW isn't out.
---
You have 3 months. 
---
Being fit doesn't suck, it improves everything, including your ability to keep awake. Also gives you some good basis to be able to do some huge sleepless stints, which I think puts me far ahead of the average stereotypical mess of a human.
---
Again though! Each to their own.
---
Not everyone can watch at work, bud.
---
If you lose interest in the next 100 days, then you definitely wouldn't keep interest in this game for long. This doesn't even make sense.
---
Also... launching with a terribly buggy experience would be WAY worse than launching early while "the iron is hot" ... sorry, this is just not at all a smart post.
---
I do got G'huun cutting edge but cba to invest so much time into raiding again. Wpvp feels meeningless since you do kill people... but you dont really "conquer" any land. 
---
I do like rbg's tho. But Ill just wait for classic.
---
So let’s say your percentages are correct this still won’t matter in MC and Onyxia. The average raiding guild sets 2-4 hours to raid on a raid night. That being said, bosses on [Popular private server] were buffed to compensate for 1.12 talents. Bosses were dying in our raid guild in 2-3 minutes and that’s not even when we got to BWL/AQ patch. Not to mention we were doing 15man Ony splits for more loot for the guild. If MC is as big of a joke as dungeons are so far then less people will be brought for more loot and you will still clear before raid ends. That also means less hybrid or meme specs.
---
For the alliance, brate!
---
I will probably say something retarded but since as my understanding classic is running on a modified BFA , could it be possible that those damages issues are caused by the last leveling patch ?  
---
They patched monsters to have reduced life and damages some month ago I dont remember the numbers but maybe it still exist in the classic build ?
---
The finale was not great.
---
I'm not quite sure why you felt it was necessary to embolden your truth like that, but we all do remember things a little bit differently. I'm not saying that my thoughts on the matter are in fallible by any means. I could be very wrong. But it does feel wrong, and there are certainly some things I've seen in streams that I know for a fact would not have happened in 2005 to 2006. Or even afterwards for that matter.
---
I'm not too pleased with the release date as July would have been better. "Classic Summer" with less than a month of total summer left is a joke. It is what it is...the only thing I truly don't like about it is that now I'm anxiously waiting for the 26th of August and hoping the summer goes by quickly. But, I don't want summer to go by quickly due to having an absolutely miserable winter and spring season thus far.
---
/spit ...you are a filthy carebear which deserves even less Respect than a 15$ whore at the main station
---
i don't need a fit body to stay up. i use my willpower and mountain dew. 
---
for every hour you waste at the gym, im gonna be surpassing in what actually matters. WoW. enjoy your squats, i've got work to do :)
---
Me too
---
Back than beta tester plus day 1 player on EU
---
also got no email
---
Well duh, new thing is the shit you'll stream to get muney, especially when this new thing is also exclusive...
---
&gt;Look at Classic WoW, about to take the world by storm because it’s objectively bis in its genre even though it’s 15 years old.
---
AoE2 is another example. 20 years old and still the best one in the series.
---
Esfand play alliance, so he couldn't have suffered from that bug himself. Personally, I played Vanilla in 2004, I play the beta since the second wave. Went trough VC and Stockades, solo quested on a hunter and a mage, two characters I played back then, and the experience is pretty much the same. Damage seems right, it feels easier because I'm not a stupid, ignorant child anymore. I was just soloing some elite blackrock orcs yesterday in Redridge, and things felt pretty much exactly the same as I remember. What changed is that Ive learned to play my class and play smart around the AI
---
I can't say I disagree with you there. But there is a wide spectrum of expansions between BFA and classic, and I'm one of those that think that that particular part of the class design peaked a long time ago and has been going downhill. In the name of pruning and class balance, most classes have been homogenized to make it easier for the developers, and if you strip away the pretty lights they mostly follow the same pattern (hence my joke post). There are some exceptions like sub rogue from what I hear though.
---
In classic the class balance is dogshit. And in pve most damaging rotations are very simple (pvp is different), but each class have a certain identity that sets it apart from the others. It's that feeling that a lot of people seek to rediscover with classic.
---
Hi, /u/Mataroxd
---
There isn't any high end raids to push and thus to watch on classic though, not like on live.
---
I firmly believe a lot of people will jump on the hype trian now, soak up loads of streamer content, and by the time release comes along, will simply not be as hyped and will consider not getting a sub.
---
That's actually brilliant. I don't know if it is the reason or not, I'm really not qualified to say. But it makes plenty of sense to me. Maybe? Shrug.
---
I am thinking of tanking dungeons, and maybe offtank molten core. (my goal is to clear BWL one day)
---
Dude, it is a beta server, no one actually cares. They wouldn't do it in actual classic.
---
Crazy how all these people who will never raid for server first think about the 0,1% added value of a racial
---
You do realize this is a beta right and that precious blue cloak is going to be deleted.
---
No need for me. Got most in muscle memory.
---
What a useful comment, it doesn't even say what you are saying "no" to.
---
They are going to raise it. We don’t know when
---
i don't need quest helper, quests are very easy on their own... just spent 3 sec reading
---
I just want to say thank you to everyone involved in the beta who is putting in the work to check all these things.
---
Wish I was in the beta to check these things. I'm not going to claim I can recall numerical/data values from so long ago, but if my lock can draintank one of those elite orcs in redridge while keeping another chain feared, I'll know something isn't right. If on other hand I have to keep it feared with dots, sbolts and more fears, then bail if his buddy comes along to help, then I'll keep my faith with blizz, although either way I do suspect people are finding plenty of legitimate bugs.
---
yup :)
---
5 mans, yes no probs, but not raids. Just get some healing gear and you'll be fine.
---
The answer would be never, or when memeing around
---
I think this is the best argument against something like this.
---
I guess server forums will pretty much say most of this after the layers peel off and we come down to a stable server. 
---
I just thought it might help the choice at the start and for the first few months. But can also see how it could actually be worse for the server
---
It was damage done.
---
on private servers i tanked with a 2h all the way up to ST/mara. it is very possible as long as u keep yourself geared.
---
At work atm so i dont got the time to look for it sadly. XD
---
Actually I thought most people would get the joke and shower me with that sweet karma.
---
I think you are wrong on pretty much everything here. Best leveling spec in vanilla is affliction, there is very much merit in going for imp voidwalker early but you will still mainly be affliction and the alternative to imp. VW affliction spec is pure affliction. The two best pve specs fow warlocks are 30/0/21 and 7/21/23 where the demonic sacrifice spec comes out slightly ahead on singletarget but the difference is small and in 5 mans I would definitely go with Shadow Mastery instead. But yes it is good in pvp, not as good for hord as it is for Aliance due to paladins so deep destro is more reliable, also you have the 1v1 monster spec SL for PvP but that is also kinda memey.
---
Nice thank you!
---
Hi, /u/KiwiInAust
---
Take it easy bro. Smile :)
---
Yeah, i probably wasnt gonna bother watching classic content til naxx once the beta ends anyways to be fair since its all im really interested in.
---
Easy there cowboy, a no stays a no.
---
Private servers usually actually screw elites completely up. Elites tend to be ridiculous on private servers while they were mostly just much beefier in vanilla.
---
I am already going dwarf warrior so you can only go human i'm afraid, sorry.
---
Night shift feels ya man
---
&gt; It's up to Blizzard to determine what's wrong and what isn't.
---
They dont have to determine anything, just login to their internal original 1.12 server and recreate the situation and verify it. But yea, the point is to report anything thats seems like a bug.
---
They will then filter the "actual vanilla vs private server" non-issues out of that list.
---
"your truth" was not going only to you, but all the commenters. It was plural. To be honest I have no evidence to prove one side wrong or not. I just comparing my private server experience with what I remember from my vanilla days. I surely felt getting much more damage from dungeon elites on private.
---
Anyway, I really wish Blizzard boost the mobs. We were all noobs back then, now we all know the game and would be bad if mobs were easy, especially dungeons mobs. If I hate one thing, is to read a month after release that some guilds got to 60 and cleared MC... it will ruin my immersion :P
---
What are the classes you are still looking for?
---
I think it’s more about me not wanting to waste someone else’s time by killing them, and not wanting my time wasted either. I say waste because it’s never equal fighting, it’s always a massive level difference to the point that one person is weaker than a pve mob to the aggressor. PvE is chill, and you mean quite a few nice people in the midst of it!
---
Well, eventually willpower isn't enough because your body will shut down. 
---
If you consider two people with equal willpower except one is a mess who is drinking mountain dew and hot pockets, then other is in a decent shape, has prepped meals to eat on FPs and has a good balanced diet throughout. 
---
The latter will pull ahead. 
---
See you at 60
---
A little late but, if you're good enough you wont need wotf sound silly. If you think an Spriest or warlock (especialy SL specs) will die in the stuns you're crazy, the fights are incredibly hard for rogues. Now i'm not saying this is the only reason to take undead, just trying to correct.
---
For maximum immersion you need to play this and wait 10 years before playing wow classic.
---
Fair enough friend! I just see people discount the WPvP in BFA. The war mode option really helped a lot, and while it’s not at the Vanilla/Bc levels it’s still much improved from where it has been and I’ve had a ton of fun.
---
But yeah mythic + is really fun if you can find a group of people that fits your schedule, all you need is to hook up a few hours a week and the challenge is there.
---
It just saddens me that people think retail is all bad, there are small bright spots that I believe are great building blocks and at the very least can be a nice side game until classic.
---
TBC wasn't that good.
---
*xGnomekiller69x*
---
Yeah, this. I can understand it can turn someone off.
---
Maybe just a one time pop up first time they create a character? But yeah can see how this is a problem, though I also see this just becoming a forums issue and people will know with a little research which servers are imbalance after a few months.
---
Hopefully the average player doesn’t go looking for that info
---
Ya I understand that but if a streamer really used a 2 hander ? That wont really work even in retail, atleast that well.
---
&gt; Well, eventually willpower isn't enough because your body will shut down.
---
thats what the mountain dew is for, pushes me through my natural limitations
---
the ladder doesn't pull ahead because he's wasting his time at the gym instead of getting into the grind. 
---
i'll already be at 60 by the time you get out of Elwynn Forest
---
woosh
---
I'm not the population. I don't watch that bullshit. I'd like to see how many of a so called big streamer's fans will even make it to Sithilus
---
How playable is that? Considering rolling on NA from UK due to working hours meaning I'll pretty much always miss EU peak time.
---
they just copy private server data and make it easier so people play the game, then claim privates are off and theirs is correct because archives. blizzdrones will buy about anything blizz puts out without questioning it once.
---
I've taken short breaks here and there for a couple months, but overall I've been playing consistently. Been playing since 2006, have max level of every race and class in the game (24?). So the tism is high.
---
When someone says difficult like that, they generally mean not financially viable.
---
But yes its always possible that unforeseen things could cause their numbers to be wrong even if the original data base was used.
---
It’s honestly been fine tbh! Nothing majorly noticeable
---
Flasks and such won't be needed as much, people will do way more damage and healing now, and take much less damage.
---
On my last pserver I grinded from lvl18 to 60 and I plan to do the same so... Yes
---
Grid? Grid was BC, it wasn't an "everyone used it"-addon in vanilla. It's been backported to vanilla on private servers though. You're thinking of the CT raid frames or Xperl.
---
They should just call it a different timeline and start over.
---
Personally, I already had aDSL 512k by WoW and I'm not even from one of the more developed countries, so the people that liked multiplayer games had some kind of broadband for sure.
---
If you think that vanilla pvp videos were all top pvpers you are just wrong and if you think all of past pvpers didn't know they can bind keys, create macros or not turn on keyboard then I don't know what to say, that is just hilarious. 
---
I'm not sure if EU scene was different, but I guarantee that no one in a premade worth it's salt would keyboard turn or something similar to that. I also never heard of any of the names of those players mentioned.
---
Last point, you dont need experience in mmorpgs to be a good (pvp) player.
---
Yes. Playing WoW since Day 2 of EU Release, subscription on and off the last expansions and actually subscripted to BFA.
---
Never ever got a beta invite to one of the blizzard games, all check marked since battle.net release and updated as well for the classic beta.
---
But i never installed a PTR Account.
---
People that played on both vanilla and private servers are saying that private servers got some stuff wrong, and guess what, what they said was wrong on private servers is correct on classic wow.
---
Nothing formal yet however character name reservation will be available 12 August so we should know before then!
---
Correct, but we still need to push back against any sort of item lvl and lfg and similar mechanics.
---
Lovely stuff!
---
I mean, nobody is forcing you to comment on the thread before you are even able to properly view the original post either...
---
Modern wow has it up's. But its just a diffrent style of mmo. Im a fan of conquering areas. If Im farming IM farming there. Meaning I kill everyone that is trying to farm there aswell. Thats what I like in an mmo, having a real presence. I did some M+ in legion and got around 4k score wich was decent enough imo. Raiding in modern wow is good. 
---
I'm just not a fan of Mount of Transmogcraft. I care to little about cosmetics to enjoy modern wow.
---
Also pvp is to balanced wich ruins a bit of the fun. Sounds weird to complain about something being to balanced.
---
I think Classic WoW is pretty great! 
---
Uh oh...!
---
Thanks for being vigilant m8.
---
Edgy/10
---
I got into the beta - must have just been in the last day or two though at most. I'm currently playing on one of the "normal" beta realms, so I'm not sure if I actually just got in, or if I'm only in the stress test. Didn't get any email. My option says Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic. 
---
I assume if it was only stress test, I'd not be able to see these realms, but I'm not sure.
---
Im so happy that i still have mine. Was showing it to my friends yesterday after watching GOT season final. The book was more intresting then whole S8 heuheu. Legit love how good and detailed the guide is.
---
I can drink (and upvote) to that friend.
---
Sadly corpses (skeletons) don't pile up like that on Classic Beta right now. They disappear within a short period of time compared to vanilla, so I hope Blizzard look into this as being a bug since it adds to immersion, especially on PvP realms where you'd see a bunch of player skeletons around an area and know that a recent battle has been fought.
---
70 years old, retired.
---
Can play classic wow all day long, with multiple toons.
---
Your dad is crushing life right now.
---
Yeah, though even Naxx is just going to get steamrolled honestly.
---
Could you explain why? All I ever see is people saying how bad it was but no one cares to explain themselves. 
---
How would you have liked it to end? What would each character be doing as the story concludes?
---
Blizzard has already said such addons will be broken.
---
I agree. Ive seen lvl 58 mages who ran me through Deadmines basically get wrecked from like 10-15 mobs. It shouldnt be that way at all, near 60 mages were aoeing through Deadmines like a joke
---
I didn't got any email, just checked in the launcher and it was there.
---
How would you have liked it to end?
---
Not ALL.... 
---
/excellent
---
People who hate on gnomes are man-children.
---
We need to find somebody who has been in a coma for the last 15 years to check if the damage is accurate
---
Are you referring to the first clip in this? 
---
https://youtu.be/XKRkNkyIpcQ
---
I’m pretty sure that he ninjad it as a joke
---
I'm in. Account from first day of vanilla. Also participated in the closed beta testing of vanilla
---
Agreed but the understanding I got was more than just financial issues at work. A while ago tho so could easily be misremembering.
---
They “combined” the server type, but have a war mode that basically recreates the functionality; so now any server can be pvp or pve, it’s pretty good actually!
---
Hard to feel rivalry when you see an ally fighting for the horde.
---
Player's corpses (skeletons) are not staying on the ground for as long as they did back in Vanilla.
---
I think they have the same time frame as Retail/BFA, which obviously isn't Vanilla. Having player's skeletons show on the ground is a good indicator of recent battles fought, whether that's a world boss or an area that had PvP. It adds to the immersion a lot, and hopefully this is recognised as a bug/to be fixed.
---
nuhuuh!! Blizzard is never wrong! THEY HAVE THE SOURCE!!!
---
Aww, it's trying to be clever.
---
"If you have an opinion different than me it's just bandwagoning!"
---
Ooooooooor maybe he just personally thought it was bad. Yikers.
---
Meeting stones did exactly this in vanilla wow so hard to see how this is against what classic is supposed to be. Or at least the looking for dungeon part. This might be a joke but there probably will be some sort of LFG addon created after launch.
---
That's impressive! I started around then too, but only had one main at max level and a few ALTs I was working on. I was playing 8-10 hours a day during BC, it was great but ultimately frustrating trying to get people organized for the 20 man raids at the time. 
---
I'm excited for the larger vanilla raids now though as I think discord has made that kind of interaction so much easier. Faster internet speeds help too.
---
on private servers i tanked with a 2h all the way up to ST/mara. it is very possible as long as u keep yourself geared. shield armor doesnt really even get good until 40ish. the dragons in ST hit incredibly hard on private servers, will be interesting to see if that is the case on the beta eventaully.
---
asmongold is also in like full greens at level 19, i dont even recognize that shield, this is where people forget that most people were wearing whites mixed with greens for DM, most people didnt have shoulders at 19, i think we are seeing the 14 year learning curve.
---
Lol, what are you trying to get at. I can be annoyed by something. When a new fad that you done care about gets shoved in your face it can get annoying, normally if it's a subreddit I just block it and go on my way, but in this case it's a subreddit I really like but it's being gradually overran and streamer based which bums me out.
---
Star shards is better damage per mana than mind flay, if you are out of shadowform. (I think)
---
So it’s useful for holy/disc priests in pvp? 
---
Never used it myself but that seems like all It could be useful for
---
Downvote me to hell, but I keep growl on my bear in Deadmines if the tank is a paladin.  I'll turn it off for a warrior or druid though.
---
Anything after that and growl goes off.  Pallies dont have the wherewithall to tank reliably that early.
---
I loved it. Was my favorite period of WoW. I'm more excited for TBC Classic than I am vanilla
---
You guys sound like you would be a nice fit for me. I am planning on playing Priest right now. The only thing that would make a difference would be if the raid times end up being to late in the night for me.
---
that's why you don't play alliance :)
---
Unfortunatly.  NE priests have useless "priest racials" you wont use them, even the  NE racial is bad as a priest.   
---
They are the worst class/race combo ingame.
---
Thats not very casual
---
Jesus christ its just a beta
---
Most priest will not be shadow. Will of the forsaken is over rated, but much less so than shadow guard by those that think that is a better PvP racial.
---
My experience having played both as a troll and undead priest, is that undead racial spells and abilities are by far more beneficial in most actual PvP situations.
---
I've recently learnt that in the TBC prepatch, they nerfed damage in dungeons, I really hope they aren't using those damage values.
---
You're excited for something that isn't happening?
---
Yikes. You're being aggressively defensive in these comments man lol. No one's going to actually have a discussion with you when you're talking to us like this and being so accusatory.
---
They're harder I feel too but the diffculty partly switched, before you had to have the right gear in a sense or composition mattered while now you just need the item level and any class is good which I think is a shame.
---
Bosses do more stuff and feel more like bosses but player control of the fight difficulty has been a bit lost aside from the strategy you use, you can't make a fight easier but longer by having a more defensive build or allowing your dps less resist gear thanks to bringing an extra paladin with resistance aura and his buffs for example.
---
Balance sometimes also is all over the place which is a fault of flex raiding. I love flex as you're no longer blocked by low attendance but the balancing is all over the place which is why blizz reintroduced mythic difficulty at a static number of people for fine tuning.
---
&gt;by the time you get the Mythic kill you have seen him die at least a dozen times before...it is still rewarding but not as much!
---
I've not really been bothered by that aspect because it was the same back then, how much did you kill baron geddon and garr for thunderfury ? Ragnaros for Sulfuras ? You probably do them less in a week but overrall I feel like it evens out, especially dungeons.
---
Mythic feels like the true boss to me and there should be less difficulties and more drive to experience mythic. Some bosses become entirely different in mythic and some have hidden a supplementary last phase like Gul'dan in Nighthold (and a secret boss with no tactics explained in the dungeon journal like they did for Ra'den in MoP should be more of a thing).
---
I just want some more of the rpg elements classic had in its raiding with the top notch mechanics and bringing some more thought into raiding other than the tactic (which in normal and heroic is generally just soak the swirly, group up, split, repeat) and accomodating your rotation.
---
It might not be an issue for you, but it's an issue for everyone else.
---
People drop quests and keep interesting quest items, like Dartol's Rod of Transformation.  Losing the item with the quest is stupid and not Vanilla.
---
I don’t think you get the point, of course everything from the beta is going to be deleted. 
---
Just don’t ninja for fun, because this isn’t fun.. I guess :) He wants to warn people, be kind and selfless.
---
You could just use the bestiary to compare the damage values with what is on beta.
---
It might be usable during levelling. If you get a new rank of star shard at a level and have to wait a few more for your next fireball etc. Just a Guess, I havent checked. Arcane missiles can be somewhat usable at certain levels because of this.
---
Wont quest there at all, fuck that. Rather take the slower routes in Dustwallow and elsewhere
---
Here's a video of a level 60 pally with full plate/shield tanking deadmines 12 years ago:

---
Eu day shift ! Heh id quit my job if i had to work nights :)
---
I tend to multi-task while im playing WoW. Study, browse, eat, watch tv, etc. 
---
Trying to find quest givers or where/how to complete quest requires attention that drains me pretty fast so quest helpers help alleviate that.
---
I remember when in-game addon quest helpers first appeared in Vanilla and people were screaming on the WoW forums calling it cheating.Times have definitely changed.
---
Anything after midnight is early morning.
---
Played both. Name was Robotussin/Toborussin/Wildcat
---
lets say, for the arguments sake, that they are done fixing everything in 2 months and everything is working perfectly (which it wont).
---
It still doesnt make sense to release Classic from a marketing perspective. Theres a reason publishers always announce the release date months before the actual release.
---
People take vacations, pre-order and time for a bunch of marketing stuff you and I know nothing about.
---
A good tip in general is to always assume that the people that study certain things (like marketing etc.) know what they are doing. They didn't choose that release date randomly. People that get payed more than you and me together decide those things
---
Yeah I remember rolling for it and then the rogue unlocking it.
---
The idea being that the group cant access the chest without the rogue, but the rogue cant access the chest without the group.
---
I agree, just saying that private servers are by no mean a good reference there - especially when it comes to rare / elite mobs. I remember on retail being able to solo green rares and most private servers made them extremely imbalanced.
---
Realistically when it comes to something like this is that any/all issues can be solved given enough financial investment/time.
---
:) thanks buddy! Lets all hope for the best!
---
I hope they fix it. Makes me cringe seeing Asmongold facetank 6 elites without dropping below 80% hp. And then he goes on a rant saying how easy vanilla is lmao.
---
This is more accurate I think
---
https://imgur.com/a/8SwkvyE
---
That footage is from TBC, though... I really hope they aren't using nerfed instance mob damage that was apparently implemented in the TBC pre-patch.
---
After having spent years on forums, trying to make current WoW players realize that many of the QoL changes have negative side effects I'm not convinced anymore that "democratic" decisions are good for the quality of the game. Most people only consider their own immediate benefits and not the effects from a game design perspective. They truly seem to be unable to see them. On the other hand, it's not clear-cut  if Blizzard's game designers can be trusted with these decisions anymore either, having seen the direction they took with current WoW...
---
Although I'm all up for development of good, new content, I can understand where the nochange crowd is coming from. However, there are many improvements that can be done, without hurting the spirit of vanilla in the long run. I'm still having some hope with the new classic team understanding what the true pitfalls of current WoW are and trying to continue the game in a good direction. Years ago, I would definitely have approved of community votes. Over time I pretty much lost my trust.
---
This guy gets it.
---
DONT HAVE FUN WITH FRIENDS.
---
NO FUN ALLOWED.
---
&lt;FUN DETECTED&gt;
---
Somehow being on the 80% pop side is fun for you? Do you also like playing sports against 8 year olds? Wtf
---
Is there another wave of invites happening soon?
---
Every single tank is fury spec but they all use a shield.
---
Where can I find said bestiary??
---
Right!?  Only 32 here.... &gt;.&gt;
---
If someone on blizzard is able to create a 60 pally with full plate and check if the mobs are doing the same dmg as this guy it should be confirmed kinda.
---
oh nice, didnt know that. How many silver do you have after the run?
---
Did you even read the post you dunce?
---
Seconded -- this was not a rule on: Archimonde, Aerie Peak, or Spirestone.
---
No disagreement, MoP era warlock was amazing. 
---
I’m a fan of mythic plus and thus not a fan of class specific buffs at least not the current iteration, and I don’t think giving every class 10% more whatever is good design either. The line between balanced and different from everything else is a lot finer than most people give credit. MoP era lock had a talent that let you move and cast incinerate. It was brokenly overpowered and made melee classes worthless. So I do feel for the designers. 
---
It doesn’t help that raids are designed around people playing really really well, at least mythic prog raiding is, and if one class is 10% better people will play it more. 
---
Unless you have some mad super genius doing number tuning homogenization will always be the only path towards perfect balance, but blizzard has also been amazing at asymmetrical balance, no one else made 3 different RTS with near perfect balance and 3-4 different races.
---
I can say that those quillboars used to hit like trucks and you had to cc one in one of those bigger groups. I lvld 3 chars up to 60 and some things i can remember well whilst some are long forgotten. For example hunter Feign Death used to make you immune to damage( not sure if it was both physical and magic or just one of em)  once used and you could purge it as a shaman , that was early vanilla and was fixed later on.
---
I like it because it's the only true hybrid build in the game. You can buff and heal allies from the backlines, and when the enemy overextends you can delete them with your lightning. Very dynamic class, but makes it a bit more difficult since you have more choices.
---
or pallytank even!
---
This is why hunter is the best gatherer...
---
Heh... Hunter-gatherer.
---
Real talk, why is it fun? To me its like playing basketball against my cousin in 6th grade, theres _literally_ nothing he can do
---
Could it possibly be an issue with stats/gear scaling with level?
---
I don't want to be that private server guy, but i did a small amount of testing and found instance mobs are consistently doing 50% less damage on classic beta then they do on private servers.
---
I'm fully aware that private server is absolutely not fully accurate. Looking out open world standard mob damage, it lines up pretty much perfectly with values on private servers. 
---
I get that private servers can't be 100% on point but, one set of damage values being pretty much identical and another set being doubled, doesn't really make sense. 
---
I'm not saying private servers are right or wrong, i'm just saying the values are so extremely far off that it raises eyebrows.
---
Exactly, we have new souls that will flood the gates of WoW Classic on release and we need our community to show them the way. We are the guardians that will help shape how this game will feel for avarage Joe.
---
If private servers are overtuned and still easy, then I don’t want to see how easy Classic raiding will be. On private servers people pug BWL and AQ40. Are we going to pug Naxx in Classic??
---
Yeap exactly what i remember too..
---
Thanks for bringing this up
---
I think preraid-geared warriors are very good already. But you're right about green warriors.
---
I admit it might've been overestimation  (although you do so too - why ever 5 mainspec tanks? Nothing requires that much except 4HM and pre-Cthun trash). I was also wrong about warriors wanting leather in raids. It's mostly the case preraid  (Truestrike shoulders for example).
---
Exact numbers aside, there's going to be a lot of rogues, warriors and mages. Rogues compete with each other for set pieces (and afaik they want 5p T1 and 8p T2 later), *and* with warriors/hunters/odd feral for rings/weapons etc. 
---
Meanwhile, mages compete with each other for set and with warlocks/odd shp for non-set. Already way less competition.
---
Warlocks are better because there're less of them than mages, but not by much because their set is trash. 
---
Overall I think warlocks are the answer. Or maybe druids if there're less healers.
---
If yoy are invited for the stress test can you play on the Beta server after or do you lose access and have to wait for another invite?
---
Just wait til the streamer is getting less views than desired, then he starts ranting and raving about the game and eventually leaves it. This means hundreds if not thousands of players leave that server, destabilizing its population and economy.
---
Then when the hype dies down and the game's viewership goes down, people on Twitch can proclaim it "ded game omegalul", suddenly the hype is reversed, and the game is no longer "cool", just look at Apex Legends now, all because a select few people got bored.
---
This in addition to polluting the game's community chat channels with Twitch memes. As well as polluting Classic communities with streamer clips (see r/classicwow).
---
I dont think its wise to trust the game's reputation in the hands of people whose only real metric of judging a game, is solely based on their own viewership. Vast majority of streamers would stream anything as long as it gave them views, but it goes the way as well, they would stop streaming anything as long as it gave them less than decent views.
---

Pro-tip: If your friend get mad at you because of pixels then that friend ain't no friend.
---
I'll ninja the shit out of my friends, and they all will do the same between us, and we will still have fun.
---
only time its really OP is the damage on trash in BWL that are vulnerable to arcane damage. But then again, changing to an arcane wand does almost the same
---
Escape artist is a broken racial for pvp. Human is nice for minmaxers but useless in pvp. 
---
You decide what you care more for.
---
2h tanking at that level matches my recollection.  When I leveled my first warrior during patch 1.6, I remember stripping down my armor to get more rage so I could dish out more damage.  Sweeping strikes was super imba at the time and let you put out ridiculous damage (like 65% of the group's total).
---
I specifically recall how I wore that black cloth robe that drops from the first boss of RFK.  When I asked if anyone minded if I needed on a cloth robe the healer replied, take whatever your need, you're singlehandedly carrying this group.  That response left me grinning the whole run.
---
This about sums it up, people are quick jump on me but don't bother to actually read what I wrote.
---
On PvP servers you quickly learn to hate the other faction.
---
I’m fairly sure my autism still has most of this stuff archived in the back of my brain somewhere.
---
I am not above consulting thottbot if I get completely stumped, though.
---
Youre doing that in a dungeon with a group?  Good luck getting invites.
---
The iphoneX is like many times stronger than the servers they had in 04 lol. Its insane
---
No there wasn't.  You could spam shape shift and non GCD abilities as fast as you could.
---
There was a small chance you might get hit in caster form but that mechanic should still be there since they are using vanilla spell batching.
---
It's actually extremely easy, you weight the stats. The only things that need to be individually done are any special abilities tied to an item
---
Now get rid of any quest helpers!
---
All Linkin park songs from meteora album.
---
So you went through my comment history (exaggerated what I said) and then waited to take a shot at me?
---
Yes, they are separate.
---
sniping mobs with spirit tap is key if you wanna keep your mana pool, even while healing in dungeons. You have to practice and be very aware of it tho
---
Lets hope Blizzard will adress this soon. Thanks for reporting it ;)
---
Oh, I always thought fun was subjective
---
There exists a program for WC1 that makes mouse clicks context sensitive, so you dont have to press a hotkey before moving/attacking/selecting multiple units. Google for wc1 mouse helper or something like that....
---
Can ya'll chill with the streamer obsession? Its just some guy making his money by playing to a tiiiiny percentage of the playerbase. Stop making a big deal out of it, WoW isnt like other games, we have millions of players. Even that asmondgold guy don't mean shit.
---
This is probably the case indeed, and I think it applies to all mobs and not just elites. It would explain the damage difference [with the panthers in Echo Isles](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5rxj/can_someone_explain_this_discrepancy_in_mob/), and it would explain why other times the damage is [demonstratably correct](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq6mdt/difficulty_of_dungeons_on_the_classic_beta_vs/).
---
I have absolutely no idea what the cause exactly could be, but it seems to be something transient that's related to your character resisting more damage than it should, rather than the mobs themselves having wrong damage.
---
&gt; Collect every hunter pet
---
You know the stable on vanilla has only 2 slots right?
---
you have no reason to suggest there's a bug except how people feel, despite the fact numerous private servers have since their inception tuned up difficulty in Vanilla generally to maintain that conception of difficulty.
---
like tipsout said, there is more complexity in other ways: like the infamous tanaris baby dragon farm spot for mages that you can't actually farm in classic, as he saw so in the test he did in irvine.
---
but there isn't an issue this way
---
Pink\_Flash, shouldn't you be posting on Starbucks fan pages?
---
You are appreciated
---
Mikepreachs run of Ragefire chasms seems to have correct damage values aswell. It seems quite random indeed.
---
People downvote him because the first line - rogues mostly compete with rogues - is wrong. "*Everyone* competes for trinkets" is also wrong. There will most likely be way more competition for DFT than for Neltharion's tear.
---
Layering is literally "channels" on every other mmo but I'm guessing each channel will have its own physical server to relief stress (?)
---
Yeah a few people in the whirlpool forum have said they got beta invites
---
Honestly it’s fun but the gameplay is only a few levels. I got to 30 on two characters and the world PvP is kinda fun, but it’s just not that interesting right now.
---
It's past midnight in central Europe then, not great either if you have a job in the morning, but seeing as there are mainly US players invited to the beta it's no wonder they chose even worse times for the rest of the non-NA players than they do with PTR raid tests.
---
We really need to find some more footage from *actual* Vanilla 2004-2006 that showcases the damage of elites on appropriate level players. That way we can know for sure if the numbers on the live beta are off.
---
Uninformed as fuck downvoting for no reason. Classic.
---
Take a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYepdsfid4w) before making baseless comments and downvoting people for not being informed.
---
Remember my close friends knew this other guy who stayed in the dorms played wow. We're never really that close.  
---
Got together to hang out one summer before a party, went to his house to pick him up and while we're there "hey show us your character!"  
---
He logs on, we ask about addons and he's like "what's that?" He goes onto play with the arrow keys and clicking spells, as a Mage.  
---
That's right, he was a *clicker*.  
---
We never saw him the same way...
---
Dude, beta testing isn't for you.
---
Hey!  I work 3rd shift and it's great!
---
The more effort people put in the easier it is for Blizzard to make the game as good as it can be.
---
Not sure I follow your reasoning
---
Well done, you found a bug.
---
Now press that bug button and write up a report.
---
Congratulations you are participating in a BETA test.
---
he still does shadow damage, just less iirc
---
xp bar, because i needed several of those on the screen at once apparently
---
I dont think this is the case, but what if any armor/resistance buffs are sticking? What if Esfand partied with a paladin with Devotion aura?
---
:)
---
And we all have 1.12 talents and revamped items, so that ups the damage output quite a lot too.
---
The big issue will be that the great majority of players will choose their server within the first two weeks of release. And the expected big drop in population won't be over until then.
---
So you could only see a long-term imbalance growing maybe four weeks in at best. At that time, a warning can't really fix things, since very few new people will be looking for a server to join by then.
---
I recall many of the top rated comments being "Imagine paying x amount to play a x year old game."
---
Rogues are cutting onions here.
---
I'm happy for you and your dad! &lt;3

---
Experience Scepter of the Shifting Sands chain.
---
It's like staring out the helmet of an Ironman suit at that point.
---
Huh, how did I miss that. Seems like my search was too far, sorry for that. There isn't much footage of deadmines back then and there's nothing else I could find.
---
Have there actually been any mob damage nerfs in the TBC pre-patch? I can't remember if there was anything but the patch notes also don't show any indication of that.
---
So sad :(
---
Not me. I dont have an active sub so no beta for me ever =[
---
You'd think Classic would appear under "WoW" and BFA would appear under "Makeup Tutorials".
---
Race doesn't really matter that much for exploration. Class does.
---
Maybe a dwarf hunter would be your best shot. Hunters have a lot of "exploration abilities" and have a way to speed up their run speed. Dwarfs are also the only race that have treasure finding for their mini map.
---
Hunters are the easiest race to level and overall best solo play class.
---
Regarding your Rhahk'Zor story, here is a video of a level 18 warlock solo'ing Rhahk,Zor in Vanilla, with his Voidwalker taking 40-70 hits (although with Curse of Weakness on the boss). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO4RrBNhYfs
---
Not all mobs, very very few actually.
---
You tanked 2handed those monks and myrmidons in sm as well? Equal level and lets say decent gear, i find that hard to believe. Memory might be screweing with me tho.

Can you Share it please? :)

I don't have evidence, but I was told by someone more knowledgeable than myself that dungeons were nerfed in TBC prepatch, so maybe bestiary isn't the best for evaluating dungeon damage.
---
Bear form was still just a flat +HP bonus in 1.12.  Wasn't changed to a +HP% until 2.0 and that was quickly nerfed to a +stam%
---
Upboats for the most wholesome post on r/classic in weeks
---
Depends if players play it old school or how its been played on private servers for years now. Even servers that implemented the 1.8 version rarely has AV's lasting more than 15 minutes. Both factions ignore each other while focusing the opposing teams PvE boss, alliance sticks to the west side of the map while horde sticks to the left side, running past each other making it a DPS race of who can kill the opposing boss the fastest.
---
AV is terrible for honor, people don't even queue for it outside of AV weekends on private servers. If your team is losing its better to lose fast since you get more honor for a few fast losses compared to one slow win.
---
My guess is that at first classic AV will be all about the old school feel. Within a couple of months the private server mentality of efficiency first will rule.
---
I wonder if they even have the map file
---
Looks nice. Do you have these images separately too? Id like to try the NE one by itself.
---
This is correct sir. Gnomes are kill on sight and we won't stop until every Gnome head is mounted on a pike!!
---
No they sucked too. Missing major areas of the map.
---
I'm weak.
---
Sir I’m sorry sir thank you
---
On Beta, I was completing the “Finding an Antidote” quest in Durotar. It’s a timed quest and the guide I was following didn’t have me complete it right away as you can gather the items while it’s considered “Failed”, abandon, then accept and turn it in right away.
---
After abandoning the quest, it deleted the antidote which made me have to go back to orgrimmar for the 2nd part of the quest, then back to durotar for 4 more scorpion venom sacks, then back to org for the antidote, then back to quest turn in. It added another 25 minutes of game play lol.
---
Yes, I already reported it too.
---
"I should be fine here"
---
"Hmmm two misses in a row, might be tight"
---
"Oh a party, I see... better pot"
---
"Awww another miss, *hamstring and bail*
---
Bank all your armor, then go running for flight points.
---
Still learning something new every day.
---
Pictures or it didn’t happen
---
Same. Played a lot in vanilla( too much, just graduated with no job) and did all there was to do including the R14 grind as warrior. Beta damage is somehow being calculated much much lower than it should. Something is breaking down or not being multiplied correctly. Watching these 'tanks' with two handers is ludicrous.
---
And clothies soloing elites in dungeons 2 levels higher than them and face tanking it is just wrong.
---
I think you will be fine playing any healing class. You'll find a spot. But  if you wanna be extra sure roll a dwarf priest or a paladin. Druids arent needed as much, so there might be less demand for them.
---
Which is a confirmed bug btw.
---
I heard you crying
---
Yeah I think that would make sense, I feel like you could systemically test it if you had a few people on beta. I don't see how else it's possible to figure out apart from a lucky coincidence considering it's an issue on both factions?
---
Casual spotted
---
Nice
---
Not subscribed due to state of the game so won't get the chance to help flush these bugs out. While 'no stats' on starter gear is being submitted...
---
I know you don't. This beta test is for the producers, product owners, project managers, and developers working on this project in order to ensure them that their project is a success. The core team exists in NA. 
---
In the end the beta test is for you, but not in the way that you want.
---
I think you jus might be a “fucknut” for labeling players that enjoy speed running as “fucknuts.” Why does it matter how they play the game? Just because you feel emasculates because someone might be perceived as “better” than you in a video game?
---
Grow up man.
---
People need to stop this scare mongering. There is no evidence in this post; you can't be using private server values from classicdb.ch as something meaningful.
---
I checked up and one thing I do know is that the vancleefs guards do 36-42 dmg per hit on level 18-19 rogues (2 different videos). If anyone is able to try get aggro on one of those guards as a rogue this would pretty much tell us if it's accurate or not.
---
Check with your friends/beta friends if anyone is 18-19 rogue doing deadmines as this took me over 1 hour of searching for old videos as all of the videos are level 60's oneshotting deadmines and for some bizzare reason there's not a SINGLE video of a 5 man with visible levels ranging from the levels 17-22 doing deadmines. 
---
Almost feels like a conspiracy at this point blizz removing all other content except speedruns/aoe runs I'm not even joking this is unreal that there's not a single person uploading their Deadmines run except for a ton of oneshots/aoe pulls
---
I love big things scared of little things
---
I like kicking my sons butt in sports. I tell him it builds character
---
Starshards is absolutely fantastic if you happen to be Tyrande Whisperwind. Otherwise it sucks hardcore.
---
Turns out it did. In 1.12.1, which is pretty late in vanilla, basically TBC but still vanilla
---
On the plus side, Shaman Tanks just became more than viable!
---
(No but seriously, keep reporting these issues if it feels off just so people keep their eyes on this. Could be a slew of indirect causes.)
---
I check then i refuse so I reboot client and check :(
---
Power fantasy etc
---
This classic+ server talk is the dumbest shit. 
---
Just give the option for TBC.  It’s an easy win.
---
&gt;We understand things happen sometimes but just don’t make it a habit.
---
This is my problem with most guilds. Why must almost every guild on here require attendance to a raid multiple times a week? It's a game, guys. I plan on having no life but I still can't promise I can be available at any hour.
---
Have you tried punching him in the face and kicking his shins too? The fun usually picks up with that.
---
This!!!!
---
I played wow as well thanks to my dad. He also quit around MOP, I hope I can convince him to play Classic with me again... it were 2 years of my childhood with him and I know it wont be the same experience as back then since I’m and “adult” now but just the memories about those days give me a smile 😁
---
See you all in classic!
---
Every healer is needed for their buffs and utility, but Priests will outnumber the others in most raid comps so it's probably your safest bet.
---
It's 95% hype and will fall off. In addition to that Noone can play by himself so ppl watch some streams, me including. I've never watched a stream longer then 5 min before and as soon as I can log in, I won't do it again I guess.
---
But I actually like it how it is and really hope classic can really compete with retail or at least have an impact on the devs.
---
The only contribution I can make is this image taken sometime after the AQ gates had opened on our server.:
---
https://imgur.com/mrstzBy ( I took the picture because I was proud of my big full rage execute)
---
I was clearing deadmines at level 55 for a friends alt. Wearing full imperial plate armor set as a fury spec warrior with Deathwish and Berserker stance, Sneed hit me for 26.
---
You'd have to do some serious reverse mathing to get an accurate guess on what sneed's base damage is supposed to be from that, but if you have the equations its possible.
---
&gt; you have no reason to suggest there's a bug except how people feel 
---
Except that this is a valid reason to suggest there might be a bug in plaz.
---
But...but...Innervate! :(

Pics or it didn’t happen
---
Honestly Ill be devastated if my pvp server is lopsided.
---
Having volly back as a hunter will bring back so many memories can’t wait!
---
I definitely tanked a wing or two of SM with a 2h'er, but my recollection of it is a little fuzzy because it was a good 14 years ago and I was drinking at the time
---
I bought one few days ago from ebay. I loved it
---
He's actually not retired! He is extremely healthy and is still working full time.
---
Oh no there is a nightelf priest in the image but /r/classicwow told me ONLY dawrf priests are taken to raids !  ^/s
---
I think hunter will be very popular, it’s such a fun class, weaving abilities between autoshots, kiting and choosing a pet. People have been deciding what class to play very analytically and I don’t think their decisions will necessarily hold up. Personally I had decided on playing priest and I was level 12 when I saw a dwarf hunter run past me and I had to reroll. So much of vanilla is open world content and leveling and thats where hubters excel and fee the best
---
That's a change I would love down the line. Feel like a pretty weak Hunter being able to only have two pets.
---
Yeah, I mean ppl here like to shit on private servers nowadays but over the span of more than a decade a tremendous amount of work went into figuring out how much damage mobs are supposed to make etc. It would be weird if there were off by THAT MUCH.
---
From what I've heard there was a "hidden" nerf to instanced mob damage, but I haven't been able to confirm it so it's just speculation at this point.
---
I just hope Blizz is investigating it!
---
Not fair :'( gratz you got in :)
---
Not sure how all that means EU (or other region) players might be less useful in helping ensure the project is a success
---
Also you forgot to include streamers in your list
---
If you’re tanking then be a nightelf for dodge chance bonus
---
I remember dying plenty in mines, but it was probably just because I was bad at the game
---
thanks for the detailed answer. That's exactly the reason why I wrote "thoughts".
---
I agree with most of your points and it will become like that most probably.
---
I played Apex Legends also from start and experienced the same as you described it. It's crazy how they killed Apex in a heartbeat after hyping it to the glory it had. I played it 6 hours a day and I also got bored I have to say. Before that I got bored of Fortnite... but Apex was also a big mistake by the Game Developers bringing out a Battlepass that doesn't give you anything good. I even bought that shit and played maybe to level 15 or so.
---
I still think the current hype and subscriptions (you need to subscribe to get into the Beta) is made by the Twitch community (they did a good job), I am super hyped and checking daily if I get a Beta key which is totally stupid if you think clearly.
---
Healers will be dropping out always, so I can't imagine you will have a very hard time finding a guild with a slot to fill.
---
That said, this is easier for classes with more raid slots in the first place. Druids especially feel like a bad pick compared to other healers regarding this, because there will be many people leveling one compared to how many a raid actually wants to bring.
---
I would assume Resto Shaman for Horde or Dwarf Priests for Alliance are your best bet for finding an easy raid slot.
---
that's the biggest point, we need entertaining stuff todo in the WoW world then the viewership will stay interested.
---
And god forbid you're stealthed and a Tigger turns around 360-noscope-aggro style, triggering the other two mobs nearby to bum rush ya.
---
It's true indeed, the damage feels way too low.
---
I want no changes but... it would piss of retail so much to have high elfs on alliance XD
---
I tanked Sunken Temple as a shaman in Vanilla. People are overestimating how "hard" instances were back then.
---
Some instance boss hit hard, but most of the instances were pretty easy now that people know how to focus priority targets, properly use their skils and kite.
---
Me and my partner are almost 30 from EU and watch most of the Classic clips of Asmongold that a few channels compile. For sure, 30 isn’t exactly old but I don’t identify with anyone in school or undergrads anymore.
---
That's banish. This interaction was removed in 2.3.0

What? I was talking about [your comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqo8pi/seeing_some_of_these_bug_reports/eo7jvy3/). I don't give a damn about your comment history.
---
It's been shown that elites deal correct damage. I already linked the relevant thread to you. It's also been shown that sometimes all mobs, not just elites, deal too little damage, but this isn't consistent and the same mobs can deal the right amount of damage at a different time.
---
Therefore I think there must be a bug where sometimes, under some unknown conditions, your character gains extra damage resistance that should not be there. It seems nobody has figured out when this happens yet. My hunch is that this has something to do with grouping, or certain buffs lingering longer than they should, but I really have no clue.
---
I have that opinion and i don't listen to any influencers.
---
Is autochess any good?
---
I admire your bravery bringing up a topic that isn't "100% no changes".
---
I never played a gnome but am now on a private server as a mage gnome. I hated it at first. But i invested so much time and effort in her that i startes to like her and now she has grown on me
---
It should have ended in a way that made sense.
---
Probably Blizzard wants to make Classic more casual than it used to be.
---
I'd love to get ahold of beta just to test. I would love to find bugs for this game. But I don't want to sub up for a chance for a beta inv.
---
Well that'll happen for sure. 😁
---
Druid no aqua form?
---
Also just stops at level 50
---
Yup, it's as u/Gerzy_CZ wrote:
---
&gt; You're right. The content is there. It's gameplay that's fucking trash and sucks.
---
Meanwhile in Legion, there was even a bit more content **and** the gameplay wasn't as bad. In addition, almost all the 120 content you did was meaningful to an extent unlike the BFA content.
---
It's so weird how BFA (currently) and WOD are considered the worst expansions and both of them lack(ed) what the other bad exapansion has.
---
Meanwhile, MoPs biggest enemy was the theme.
---
Yaas boi, be chad

ClassicDb and related sites are just replicating old Wowhead data (we would hope) - Wowhead data is 3rd-party data collected from an add-on that people installed - in other words, it's anecdotal. In a lot of cases, the numbers reported there are straightforward, but when hundreds of thousands are uploading data, the database simply cannot capture all the nuances &amp; possible differences in each individual situation. So anything reflected in the database is skewed by all of the differences that the data does not capture.
---
I don't want to suggest that we dismiss the databases entirely, since they're one of the few tools the community has to re-create the Vanilla version of the game. But let's not treat it as the authoritative source when Blizzard is the one with an actual 1.12.1 prototype they can test against. If we provide them with as much information as possible, it will be a great help for them to determine if something is broken, or just working as intended.
---
Careful gypsy this guy is very smart
---
Using ClassicDB values is a fundamentally flawed approach, u/Ratcher. The database is pooled from a variety of MaNGOS projects, so even though it is server agnostic, it is *not* by any means more reliable than other Vanilla databases - it's all based on years of aggregated private server data. I believe some of their content is literally ripped from Wowhead, and done so without permission from Wowhead.
---
So, that's a very, very incorrect approach to take as an example. I'll give you that comments from that era might have some use, but even then, a single comment of "hitting for like 141 damage" isn't exactly a scientific approach to measuring damage.
---
I'm not saying that values aren't wrong - I'm just saying, the evidence provided in this post isn't concrete by any means, and it's important to recognize the limitations of your dataset.
---
People laughed when I got one for my bday back in 07. They won't be laughing when I get to the rarespawns before them...
---
I'm glad I found this comment. I found it on Abandonware after watching a sketchy YouTube video linking me to it. I decided to stay away.

Mine is still wrapped in foil :-)

Such as? Again, literally no one has explained themselves as to how they would have liked it to end instead.

---
These guys arent playing an esport. You wouldnt sit and watch randos at the park play
---
I don't think you are realising, that this is a Pre-WoW classic thing. 3 months of getting healthy will improve what your doing in the week after launch.
---
Armor has a cap on reduction and some of the reported numbers are a lot lower even considering the cap. I suppose that's why it's hard for it being the core issue. Stoneskin directly adds additional physical reduction, rather than adding armor.
---
That is one well-endowed Gnome!
---
I’ve insulted no one lol. The worst thing I’ve said here was “shut up.” Check out some of the replies to me to see people **really** being aggressive.
---
What is pog? I see that all the time in the comments on these videos
---
The point I was making is that people claim that  level 30 isn’t even the halfway point of the leveling process (no raids, no honor rewards) and yet here we have potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay. 
---
Also note that these hundreds of hours are spent on a single character and many people,myself included, plan on leveling alts and playing multiple roles.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/bqruni/spoilers_extended_things_that_dont_make_any_sense/
---
It would mean fixing all of these.
---
It's a beta with a lot of bugs.  Stop downplaying this shit.
---
Elite mob damage was high in instances. I bet everything that blizzard fucked its own data by overriding some of it. Those people even had problems finding the sourcefiles for fuck's sake. I wouldn't be surprised if they just lied about even having them anymore, at least not the complete sourcefiles.
---
Private servers would have had to change the damage on every mob in every instance, which no blizzlike private server would have ever done. It's hardcoded. You know how they made servers harder? By nerfing the player, like less xp, shitty droprates, decreased damage.  They might have fucked with raidboss values, but not on blizzlike servers, because they're &gt;blizzlike&lt;, trying to get as close as possible to the original. You are clueless, like every other zealot, shitting on private servers. They're only off by a few numbers, which isn't a big deal, since there's been countless buffs and nerfs to everything over the years.
---
More complexity: a few mobs using abilities, because they weren't functioning correctly in on private.
---
Fuck your tipshit.
---
Sorry dude eu alliance
---
If you came to that conclusion on your own then you must have also formed your own opinions as to how the ending could have been better, right? How would you have liked it to end?
---
hmm what could go wrong with the mentality "we'll change it to make it easier"
---
I laugh when I see the WoW community think WoW was a hard MMO.. it was easy in classic and is why the MMO genre is dead today. Come talk to me when you played a game like FFXI or EQ
---
I'd totally ninja a level 20 item from a friend for the fun of it, and would expect them to do the same to me.  That shit will be replaced in a few levels.
---
It might even be that the original game was bugged.
---
Now you just made me wanna see this cus ppl are so creative
---
Not a huge fan due to the restricting of the positive side of same faction sheeping, but I do understand the logic. Being griefed by an enemy is one thing, you (or a group) can resolve the issue without problem through PVP.. but when it's your own team member doing it, there is no resolution to it. Sure people can gain a negative rep on a server but in the mean time, what, you're just fucked and unable to play? No, not worth the trade off in Blizzards eyes.
---
There won't be reinforcements at least, right? It isn't ideal, but I still loved the later Vanilla version, so trying to stay positive.

I HATE STREAMERS! THEY THINK THE WORLD REVOLVES AROUND THEM AND THEY ARE RUINING THIS SUB/GAME! I VOTE STREAMERS SHOULD BE LOCKED INTO A SEPARATE REALM.
---
I might not be the best person to ask because I'm a dota player and we tend to only play dota and nothing else... meaning I haven't played auto chess.
---
What I can tell you is that a lot of people enjoy auto chess and it's wildly popular right now.
---
If it's something you think you might enjoy, why not try it out? It's completely free.
---
That's awesome, please please please don't stray into contested territory with him though! Private servers are so toxic it's unreal.
---
Gonna be even more disappointed when i dont get an invite to that either lol
---
talking about world mobs i entirely agree with the issue re. elite mobs
---
i have enjoyed private servers and im not hating on them, i don't care if you use them, im just telling you the circumstances
---
&gt;Old school RuneScape continued to iterate on the original game. I see no problem with them continuing to release level 60 content to keep people playing classic. With that being a proven model employed by literally the most played MMO in the world right now, seems like the obvious way to go.
---
I would hardly call it a proven model just because it has been done successfully in other games. There are examples of re-released games with additional content that have backlashed too.
---
One thing I'm certain of if they were to release more vanilla content is that it wouldn't feel like vanilla. I don't believe any current developer is able to replicate what made vanilla good in the first place. Not in the sense that they're incompetent in any way, but unless they rehire the majority of the original team I don't think they have a clue why things are the way they are.
---
Just look at Kevin Jordans stream for a couple of minutes when he talks about the design of vanilla. There are very few black and white aspects to vanilla, it's all carefully thought out and surgically performed. The apple reward from durotar starting zone is not just an item rewarded for the sake of having a reward to the quest, it's a strategically placed item that serves a purpose greater than a simple quest reward. I'm not saying they didn't throw any wildcards or strongarm anything ever, but the core aspects of vanilla cannot be all be contributet to luck.
---
Think about questing in BfA compared to vanilla. The mechanic is identical to vanilla, but yet it feels totally different. I got more satisfaction out of durotar 1-10 than I ever got on retail Legion 100-110. Why is that? Is it because vanilla is harder? No, a good portion of the quests are easy. Maybe it's because they're slower? No, you can speed through a number of quests in no time at all. Is it a combination of multiple factors? Possibly, but you're not going to replicate it and make it feel the same unless you know what made it good in the first place and what concious design choices they operated under. Maybe you can come up with a hard-edged reason why questing is different, but who's to say that's the defining factor?
---
Anyone can spend a lifetime studying to paint similar to Picasso, but it's never going to be a Picasso. 
---
&gt;I understand people wanting them to release TBC ect. However, they'll lose people every time they "release" a new expansion if they force it on people. The other option is to maintain servers for the old expansion every time they release one. That just doesn't seem practical from cost/corporate perspective. So I really don't see them doing that.
---
If we go by [this](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/wtpch4mdygg42n5jzxc0.png) your statement holds true, but you failed to consider any potential new players, especially the first few expansions. Any change means losing players, but it also means gaining new players. Additional content is a wild card, you have no idea how many players will leave, join or stick around.
---
We could argue the meaning of the numbers in the graph above for days without drawing a conclusion. Sub count does not directly translate to quality of an expansion and neither does growth. If vanilla was the ultimate era of the game you'd see a much greater downwards trend towards the end of vanilla and middle of TBC, but you don't. It's the same upwards trend from mid vanilla towards the end of TBC. Can we credit the popularity of TBC and WotLK to just riding the wave of vanilla? I don't think we can. I'd expect to see a slower growth with a greater downwards curve. Is the abrupt end to subscriber growth in WotLK generated by a bad expansion or is it market saturation? Maybe there were so many changes to the game that it appealed to an equal portion of new planers, but also caused more of the old players to leave. Hell, maybe it's because another game entirely entered the scene that scratched the same itch for people. I don't know what conclusion to draw from WotLK subcount. An extended period without growth or decline seems weird. Maybe it's a solid expansion for current players but not a perticularly good expansion for new players?
---
Every media centered around classic is an ecochamber of people praising vanilla and that is not surprising to anyone. Classic is confirmed and it is coming so naturally it will generate a lot of hype, but that does not mean it's the best wow era or the only era worth development time. There is no reliable source confirming that classic is more favored than any of the other expansions.
---
After watching streams the past few days, classic is not even the concensus of most favorite era among the top streamers. Cdew mentioned that he as a arena player is more looking forward to TBC, which makes sense for many arena players. 
---
Just because vanilla is your favorite wow era doesn't make it better or more favoured than the others, and actively debating for vanilla to be the only portion of the game other than retail to see development is exactly the same as retail players, who favours the current expansion, to debate for retail to be the only portion to see any development.
---
It would make sense if we could prove that a much greater number favours vanilla, but there is no such proof outside classic centered ecochambers. Again, we got our favorite expansion, stop trying to prevent other people to have theirs. It's just as valid for them to want their favourite expansion as it was for us to get it, especially now that we know it's a possibility. Your stance is just entitled and shitty.
---
Personally, I will play Classic from release to WotLK if released. Vanilla is my favorite era, so if it ends with that I'm fine with it. I would, however, not play any extra content after Naxx.
---
I love the weather effects in classic! 
---
You can activate it in retail aswell use the developer console /console WeatherDensity 0 (Turns weather effects off.). Google for more commands.

If I'm sitting at a park and there is someone playing something nearby, I am absolutely going to watch that.

And fuck esports. If I enjoy other games, I'll watch people play those other games. What you're saying is akin to going "chess isn't a sport". Yes it is and it has spectators. Any game where there can be conflict and opposing sides is a sport.

Yea that streamer is a straight clown. Couldn't believe my eyes when i seen that clip. What a tool. Good thing this beta is all about advertisement and not actual testing.

I would support this addition simply for that.

I believe Ion said absolutely no name changes.

a lot of people don't understand that private servers like LH refused to implement things that weren't proven with evidence. a lot of the stats of mobs are taken from Joana's old videos.
---
THIS!
---
Nice one buddy :p
---
A lot of people just don't seem to understand basic math and think that because armor values may be 1-2% off that explains mobs doing _double_ damage.
---
That’s a really nitpicky list, but most of them can be explained by using some critical thinking about the show. Instead people need to be spoon fed the information in order for it to make sense.
---
There is a thread on here where only 34252345 people got in...

Chess is a sport but you wouldnt pay to watch your nephew Timmy and his neighbor Sam play since they’re fucking terrible at it. I never once said they arent sports, what the fuck are you reading?

Just /forfeit?

So you could have it appear in your launcher, get really excited, then find out that you're actually only in the stress test?
---
That seems pretty shitty.

u/Ratcher, as a follow-up to my other comment, I recommend you use the Wayback machine when possible to find old Thottbot or Allakhazam databases. The oldest I can find for Rhakh'Zor is from fall 2007 (after TBC's launch), but you can see a lot of older comments that give a better sense of what Rhakh'Zor can do.

Take a look. Lots of discussion about X class at Y level being able to solo (or not solo) him.
---
I've tried so many console commands to get it back and it never works. They took the effects out of the game when they redid the world. You might be able to adjust the new ones but they're so shallow compared to the classic effects.
---
Man thats some good quality vidya right there. Lol. Brings me back. Wayyyy back. To when i played on an actual toaster with people yelling at me to shut up cause my mic sucked and my balls hadnt dropped yet.

And BRez. Also tank/heal on the spot if one of the tank/healers go down.

Yeah it's a bit brutal, but hey it gives people something more to do, I'll level more than one hunter just to have more pets lol.

I am a Paladin and for the sake of the holy light you are my friend too... until we met in battleground you sonofawitch !

For Azeroth !
---
If you think TBC aint happening you're a fool
---
There are plenty of instances of DW fury tanking at the highest level, look up Skarm’s videos on the subject. This stuff already happens. The important point is it’s usually when the healers and tank are mega-geared.
---
Clearly Battle for Azeroth is the correct version of vanilla wow.
---
I know there's multiple ways to tell these are legit, but what really solidifes it for me is screenshot 25, in the chatlog someone is called 'stacysmom' haha

No, because that would mean there's tons of rivalry on bfa.

The best part. Being a casual you still have tons of things to do and it's okay. Min maxing is just  boring

Can you provide evidence with that statement. That they actually screw up elites deliberately. As far as i recall elites used to be HARD.  Rare elites are different then dungeon elites.

&gt;super easy compared to what I played on Nost and Ely
---
Careful comparing classic to private servers
---
I leveled a warrior on a private server to 17, and basically the whole time I was thinking to myself, "I don't remember it being this fucking dreadful"
---
My first two 60s in retail were Rogue and Warrior, and if they were as hard to level as they tend to be on private servers, I would have rerolled to hunter or mage before I ever saw sunken temple

What is [Toxin Injector](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Toxin_Injector)?
---
Most definitely SM Armory and Cathedral.  Shaman finally get WF totem by that level making a 2H warrior an absolute wrecking ball.  
---
I wouldn't say it was the norm though, this wasn't my first 60 so I knew how to gear my warrior well, knew how to carefully and efficiently pull, and it takes an alert and capable healer.

&gt;  The more effort people put in the easier it is for Blizzard to make the game as good as it can be.
---
As a sysadmin, I must now officially state, in accordance with holy IT text everywhere: "You are a good person and you should go to IT heaven"
---
I agree that they made design choices in later expansions that didn't perticularly fit the game I want to play, but it was certainly the right call for many players.
---
I'm okay with any expansion, but the second LFG is intruduced I'm out. One of my best friends liked that feature to the point that anything before it is just an annoiance.
---
Nobody remembers
---
Mhh didn’t play for a few years :) I think i’ve used them back in wotlk.
---
The only way to ensure faction balance is for everyone to be kept in the dark. At launch, everything will be balanced because everyone will pretty much choose randomly. Server imbalance happens years later when sites like realmpop reveal the population of both factions. Nobody wants to join a server where they are the minority so they join a server where their faction has more players, which amplifies the imbalance. In a perfect world, Blizzard would prevent such sites from existing because while they are made with the good intention of helping you choose a server, they are responsible for faction imbalance.
---
Someone mentioned that Blizzard could just say which faction has the most players. This is a bad idea for the same reason.
---
AH farming.
---
The answer is yes. Most retail players will smoke all these raids. Why you ask? Because back in the day you only had a handful of mechanics to worry about. These days you have more mechanics to worry about. Things are more intense these days for raiding. Sure itll be a major pain to get 40 people who arent brainded.
---
You'll get a proper wash after my frostbolts melt off your rotting corpse.
---
Dunno what influencers are saying specifically, but my own opinion is that the last 2 or 3 seasons have been speeding up, they're skipping time and accelerating plots. They know the points they want to hit and are just beelining from one to the next. It leads to a lot of jarring cuts and character changes that may be a fine idea, but feel really sudden as a result having had no time to properly develop.
---
No one in this subreddit can be a Chad casual
---
The etiquette will form by itself... what we can do is to give example. No reddit/forum post will form it.
---
The new classic will probably form it's own "rules" as going on and I will be surprised if it will be much different from the old one... but it will differ. We are now different players, even if many of us played Vanilla - we changed - not sure if for better. 
---
Beginning of classic will be interesting... :)
---
You are what you eat, I guess?
---
Also they're manlets so can go undetected easier
---
Games will still take forever. I promise you they will be much longer. Even in retail you'll sometikes get 30-45 minute AVs if your team fucks up. Imagine vanilla
---
That is the cleanest vanilla-era raiding UI I've ever seen. Kudos.

---
Thank god.
---
Classic is a forked build of 7.3.5, which is Legion.
---
Yes they would. These streamers personality have always been like this. They are just now playing a game that's in a controversial stage
---
That wasn't epic..at all.
---
HoT didn’t stack indeed, having multiple Resto Druids isn’t preferred therefore.
---
BUT
---
If you plan on playing a healer, I guarantee you you won’t have trouble finding groups or raid guilds.
---
1. Druid will be the least played class, the chance that there will be a healer druid is slim.
---
2. As a healer, you’ll be in the highest demand, don’t worry about not finding groups
---
3. It’s really not what Vanilla was about, play whatever you want your character to represent in the world
---
Have fun!
---
6+ hours later sometimes
---
As a Druid player I disapprove of this message.
---
Me and my rogue/druid mates ran SM as a group back in the day. We stealthed, sapped, and generally just outdpsed everything. Evasion, sprint, vanish. Herod was not easy in that group haha.
---
nost pve economy was fine
---
There was like no dwarf priest on our server maybe 1 or 2.  I had to stance dance for fear most of the time.
---
This is what private servers have done to recreate the values they didn't know.
---
orc hunter sounds pretty hardcore tho
---
Could you level on a PVE server then transfer to a PVP server for the upcoming Classic? Has Blizzard stated anything about realm transfers?
---
Im lost where did I say it was epic?
---
End game when you got a lot of gear? Yes because pets attack dont scale with gear, so you'll have to rely on your bow doing most of the damage at that point. 
---
And I'm taking about strictly pvp, I'm not a pver. 
---
For pvp BM is very beneficial because of intimidation stun and the beastial wrath which makes crowd control on your pet pretty much nonexistant and its a low second cooldown so you can use it a lot of times. You can just kite away and spam viper sting after that. You'll win nearly 90% of all battles if you kite.
---
Hi, /u/kevinhill92
---
Yeah me too, then I got 5 downvotes feelsbadman, guess my opinion isn't subjective
---
If blizzard does classic + there should never be more classes or races. You have to balance extra classes plus the feel of having more races will make it feel like bfa really quick. So no.
---
hahahahahaha
---
Theres enough elves on retail as it is.
---
Trust me the Horde will know my pain.
---
Wow, hard man.  Good to see the Horde insecurity complex still goes. Did the rivalry ever go away though?
---
The only dungeon I ever did with a non-standard group (me and another rogue only) was BRD - barman shanker, get! hand of justice, get!
---
If you're trispec it's a fairly good spell in PvP against some classes.  Druids usually try to OOM you, but bubbling and using star shards has great mana efficiency and if you get charged then you just pick shadow or holy.  Same with counter spell if your shadow tree gets locked out.
---
There's a very good guide for mana efficiency star shards build that can be used for never ending grinding and dungeon healing with efficient dps.  Unfortunately I can't link it here because it's from pservers.  DM me if you want it.
---
Personally my guilty pleasure is totally destroying horde in WSG on a compeltely unfairly overgeared twink character. They’re generally less casual and have a sense of being better than alliance in pvp, which makes the reactions all the better
---
Yeah makes a lot of sense to make questing harder than dungeons for the casuals.
---
Just explaining what pog is ;)
---
Of course not,  but to replicate Vanilla you also need to replicate the bugs.
---
nothing like treating games like math problems, then wondering why it isn't fun anymore
---
I don’t particularly care about the issue, but I always found the «it’s just a prank bro» defence to be infuriating.
---
did blizz every say why they removed them?
---
To me at least that obviously means stuff like enemy cast bars and health won't be included, because that was one of the major limitations of the classic API from a general UI perspective.
---
I don't think it's possible either. Any change they make and line they draw will end up alienating someone from a feature that they enjoy, and anything they keep in it will similarly end up being an issue for someone else. 
---
Take away flying mounts and certain players will enjoy it less, keep it in and certain other players will enjoy it less. I don't think there's a winning strategy no matter which way they go.
---
Releasing Classic vanilla makes me want to play a game I haven't perticularly enjoyed for 8 years or so, but similarly it might do nothing for a player playing mainly arenas who haven't enjoyed the game in a long time.
---
I thought i was the only one in support of the efforts of all those people who poured hours upon hours of there spare time into recreating the one true vanilla. Good to know i'm not alone
---
Yes. If you were good you had difficult to obtain gear. Player and guild reputation on a server mattered far more than it does now, you'd know someone was decent just because they raided in such and such a guild or had items from some dungeon or raid.
---
I played a Warrior too and Nost and Ely and it was a huge pain, thats one reason I think its too easy. But I'm 15 now and its starting to get tougher, but mostly because Westfall is a terrible Zone and you have to kill Mobs a few Levels above you and the Defias run away and add stuff.
---
If that's how you really feel... then I'm going Boomkin and bring an additional +5 mood buff.
---
I can guarantee you that there will be guilds clearing MC 2-3 weeks after launch.
---
But that doesn't take away that it's going to be easy :) Some guys just have got it figured all out and have practiced this for years on end.
---
what if you like math
---
This thread reassures my choice of Orc Warlock, I like it!
---
Well, I knew about watching interesting clips and fun game videos, bug reports, strategy videos. I knew about esports. I just didn't know that people enjoy watching someone else simply just playing a game, instead of playing it themselves. Ok I get it, it's beta and all - but I honestly never knew that watching streamers is a thing before joining this sub. (Not trying to troll)
---
As a 55 warrior you'd have armor cap relative to Sneed. Therefore you should be taking 104 damage with 0 armour. However, you also have deathwish and berserker stance meaning you take 15% more. .85 of 104 is 88 base damage. If you assume a 35% armor reduction we have a damage of 57ish.
---
Sneed by that logic should hit a level appropriate prot warrior for 50-58. Sounds about right to me. I played a hunter in Vanilla and remember elites hitting me for around 70 damage in deadlines. Crits in the mid 100s.
---
I haven't looked at any of the deadlines recordings to double check, but someone else can do the last of the legwork
---
they had to grind boars to get to max level in order to kill him
---
lol yeah agreed
---
Think it was something about the old weather effects not working with the redone Azeroth and instead of fixing it they just scrapped it(seems familiar huh). 
---
Hard to find a concrete answer but that's what I've gathered.
---
And people like you need to stop telling people not to report things that they think might be wrong with the beta. That's the point of the beta.
---
Also, the post does have evidence.
---
Legion was what happens when you try and make modern WoW a good game. BfA seems to be the opposite in so many ways. Modern WoW will never be similar to Classic again, but it can be good in different ways as shown by Legion.
---
Me too.
---
Warlock has pet and wand at 5
---
1 week early other late
---
What's wrong with that? I like earning my gear. Hard content will make those items more exclusive.
---
Seen a video the other day with someone in the beta...the rain was much different than what it was back then and on private servers. The rain looked much more plentiful than previously.
---
Damn accurate. Knowing that I'm going to play with people as damaged as me feels good. Happy Alfa- family &lt;3
---
A well skilled druid can save a group from wiping in most situations.
---
They use the same build, but it's not like a patch on BFA is going to be applied on the classic branch aswell. That seems ridiculous to me. Also haven't read anything bout reduced hp on classic yet so to me this looks like a different reason.
---
THANK YOU.  I noticed this too.  I've been looking around to see if it was a bug and glad someone can confirm it.  It depends on the distance of the camera to the mob in question.  At max distance, the damage numbers are itty bitty, but if you zoom into first person and melee them, the numbers are huge.  A crit in first person in melee range is almost as tall as the chat box.  The purple xp gain scales according to distance too.  This is def not a vanilla feature.
---
Well they are releasing AQ at some point.
---
I never said they do that deliberately. Also I didn't play on *many* private servers, I just played on several Polish ones. What evidence can I bring? I'd have to have any private server videos and obviously I don't have those. Just from experience what I can say is that the rare mobs you find outdoors in Undead starting areas (Tirisfal and Silverpine) were tuned up on the private servers I checked out. I remember being able to kill them on retail when I gained 2-3 level advantage and used potions and private servers I tried made them do some hilarious amounts of damage. I never noticed the health being off in any way but the damage definitely was.
---
Also please note I'm not saying that current elite damage on beta is fine - I still believe it isn't but I don't believe it's a problem with the damage itself, I think there's something wrong with mitigation and end damage calculation - the problem looks to be there, just that people are blowing it out of proportion.
---
How hard is it for anyone to post screenshots showing damage?
---
Mines on the way from amazon!
---
Sick meaning thrilling, not fucking best players in the world play against each other perfectly
---
Any particular reason why hunter is the best? 
---
It's the class i plan on rolling!
---
It’s not my defence, I think they literally staged that. It doesn’t look genuine
---
I literally downloaded peggle yesterday as an addon on BFA. I'll just pretend I'm playing burning crusade instead of BFA through peggle until august.
---
I'm trying to teach my fiancée WoW on a pserver right now, so that she can join me for classic.  She "went shopping!" at level 5 because "we're leaving and we might not come back here!" and kitted herself out in full white vendor gear... I just kept my mouth shut :) Like you say, it's great watching people play the game in their own way &amp; having fun with it.
---
Are there people that don't like math?
---
I mean the specific endings for most characters come straight from GRRM and they do make sense. What makes less sense is how we got here during season 8, which was incredibly rushed unfortunately.
---
your father buys vendor gear?
---
im sorry to be the one to say it, but your father was a noob back then and still is O\_o wtf
---
\*\* Good work :)
---
I mean that's just your interpretation. Cast bars existed in vanilla, not sure why they'd be missing in Classic
---
Blizzard already came out and confirmed the aggro ranges are working correctly at all levels.
---
You might check out Shedo for druids as well. He is bananas at feral.
---
Skinning Tailoring to start
---
Are you honestly arguing that the game being easier leaves room for fewer shit specs?
---
&gt; What? I was talking about [your comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqo8pi/seeing_some_of_these_bug_reports/eo7jvy3/). I don't give a damn about your comment history.   
---
&gt; I'm just tired of people saying **"ZOMG the elites do like no damege!!"**  with absolutely no proof whatsoever, like the person I was originally  replying to did.  
---
Yet you reference elites when the tigers clearly aren't.
---
&gt; It's been shown that elites deal correct damage 
---
Some, or all? Do you have proof?
---
&gt;  I already linked the relevant thread to you. It's also been shown that  sometimes all mobs, not just elites, deal too little damage, but this  isn't consistent and the same mobs can deal the right amount of damage  at a different time. 
---
You linked a thread talking about specific inconsistencies. Not all of them. To say that accounts for everything is a lie.
---
&gt; Therefore I think  a bug where sometimes, under some unknown conditions, your character  gains extra damage resistance that should not be there. It seems nobody  has figured out when this happens yet. My hunch is that this has  something to do with grouping, or certain buffs lingering longer than  they should, but I really have no clue. 
---
So, essentially, what you think (conjecture) has more validity?
---
There has yet to be a single report of elite mob damage being of that can actually be confirmed and not dismissed with vanilla footage from 2004-2006. I have read like 10 different claims that elites in X, Y and Z deal not enough damage and every time someone actually posts a video from 2005 and it turns out they really did do that damage. People playing the beta generally know what to do and they are quite well geared so the creatures seem weaker than they are for others. At this point I believe it's extremely unlikely that individual creatures do not deal enough damage since it's quite clear that they used the old vanilla files and transfered them into a modern file which clearly seems to work in just about every case so I see no reason on why it would suddenly bug for other creatures (unless perhaps they have really speciffic spells where the translation of code might've had an issue). Stuff like melee damage however clearly works as intended and as I said, there has not been a single report that actually shows proof that the elite mob damage is false. 
---
The only report I know that is a bit odd is the Joana tiger clip but as far as I know it was also confirmed that the average damage is still the same, the tiger in the Joana clip simply attacked quicker with less damage but the overall DPS was the same.
---
Sadly, most of you wont even reach 60
---
That's incredibly precious!! I hope you guys have a lot of fun when classic launches :D
---
I think there’s a rule where if the person doesn’t skin the mob within 5 seconds then anyone can get it?  So a mafia could just let the guy kill it and then sap him/kill him and take the devilsuar leather?
---
Oh sure, I don’t really follow their anticd much. I just felt the need to whinge about the argument itself.
---
Maybe the person you replied to works in one of those online influencer factories in Russia or China? Obviously.
---
Yep! But being a noob doesn't mean you can't enjoy the game
---
Some bodies and skeletons were glitched and stayed until Tuesday resets. Until Cata maybe.
---
Problem being that this sounds more like a rant than a bug report. Also, it's the wrong place to post this.
---
&gt;And lastly, this season, especially the second half of it, has sucked. Spoilers can't really ruin something that's already shit.
---
Sure they can. The very nature of it being ''shit'' is subjective and someone who gets spoiled could've very well liked it.
---
Dwarf&gt;Human
---
You think you want it but....
---
Hey you DO want it! 😁
---
You dont need **. If it's God's work, it it self underdtably good. The question is if it's really God's work. I'm kidding, take it easy.
---
Doesn't seem like that is very unique though.  Current experience would be similar.  Part of "emergent gameplay" is the player making their own fun, after all.
---
I once got tricked into buying a Plain Letter from the auction house because the guy selling them told people in trade chat that there is a chance of them containing recipes.
---
You could do this in vanilla...
---
Ah so you are a fool LULW
---
that's just world pvp
---
I was really certain mob damage was too low but there are too many examples of people confirming the elite damage is correct.  I've been watching old vanilla dungeon videos from 2006 and the game really does looks way easier than I remembered.   I genuinely suspect our collective memory of hard dungeons comes from the higher level dungeons.  I imagine this specific example has some sort of unique explanation behind it.
---
With that said, it does seem weird that elites do very similar damage to non elites.  If you pull 8 elites, I don't ever remember it being a similar level of danger to pulling 8 non elites.  Perhaps there is something else going on that isn't exactly the mob damage, but is leading to the players still dying slower.
---
That's a video from TBC, not vanilla. Can't use it as evidence either.
---
I heard about that too and feel like this might be the solution, however I cant find any evidence in patch logs about it.
---
Hi, /u/GalwayHousingHelp
---
GO FIND THE AGGRO RANGE STRERCHER!
---
FOV.
---
I mean yes and no, you'd have to join a more casual ish guild that would be fine with you being gone every other week in a sense. Which is possible, it's just there's going to be limitations to how far you can progress I think
---
And there are people that do? Point being, people like to do there own shit, so let them do what they want instead of applying there doing it wrong cause you don't like the way they do it lel.
---
No it’s world PvP + skinning
---
totaly true, thats the beauty of classic, it literaly is for absolutly everyone
---
I don’t think that works for the opposing faction.
---
Iirc, nothing stacks with pursuit of justice.
---
I was once told that we'd be finished BRD in an hour or so.  Think it took us 6.
---
It’s a really good point, that we need entertaining stuff todo in the WoW world then the viewership will stay interested.
---
Excuse me? 16 sec Vael kill? Do you have link for a video because I couldn't find it
---
You would be a lousy historian. "So, you say that someone who lived 50 years later described the person as tall? Well that means we know NOthing about the person since we can't trust them"  
---
You know how you make good estimations and deductions(technically inductions)? You take datapoints and see what they trend toward and keep finding datapoints until you feel you have some degree of certainty.  
---
One comment isn't an argument, that's why the post is full of several different datapoints from different sources in differen circumstances.
---
But the issue with Poly was more of “same faction” griefing
---
It was undocumented. I know it's not much to go off, but it is a plausible explanation.
---
Ahh, thanks a lot for this great example, now I see the point of this Problem!
---
So you're telling me I can get a raid invite and only be expected to cast Innervate and I can just collect sweet gear :D
---
The Druid life is for me
---
Oh yeah I know, I was just under the assumption that a proper mafia is cross faction colluding
---
How we got there is part of the ending.
---
As soon as a mob is looted, anyone can skin it
---
Where can I get a rundown on the different versions of AV?
---
Back in the day the idea of a huge living battleground with PvP &amp; PvE elements sounded like the coolest thing to me. I don't care about how long it can take or farming honour or whatvever, I just want the feeling of being part of this larger ongoing battle.
---
Yes. That is a bug. And hopefully they fix it.
---
Then why are we using a BC pre patch as a guide?
---
that s a classic
---
Yeah, you can make them, but ElvUI doesn't necessarily have to make them since they are not included in the default UI and you would have to use different workarounds to get it working. There's a difference between blocking certain API functions and something being impossible to create. They are almost certainly removing whatever addon-creators use on retail to incorporate cast bars in their addons. If ElvUI want to still include it in their UI they would have to figure out a different way to do it.
---
Does anyone know where we can find patchnotes for something like that?
---
imo individual players were rarely well known, but guilds were. Guilds that allowed ninja looting or general asshattery got a shady reputation. The trustworthy guilds, you knew you could give your expensive mats to their crafters without worry of theft.
---
My server had a bit of drama when someone from a reputable guild stole crafting mats, and that player was /gkicked and the guild compensated the victim from the guild bank.
---
I can only think of a small handful of individual players who were blacklisted, and most of them weren't known serverwide. It was just the raiding guilds that knew to stay away from them.
---
I know, I remember that being a topic on a popuiar vanilla private server some years back.
---
The same applies to retail as well tho? You can level to 30 and do all those things and more (battle pets for example).
---
Seriously this community has been living in such a bubble.
---
I would rather like people try and mix-max this.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygHlCOQ3nE
---
I just want people to stop wasting time reporting nonsense, like this post. Reporting classicdb values is not "evidence".
---
Alliance pigs
---
Its 6 hours a week on two set nights after a lot of peoples 9-5 jobs. Its a commitment but its not a massive one. Even still people are welcome to join socially and fill in as needed. But we are trying to coordinate 40 people for a raid. With that many people you need structure or you will find yourself trying to pug many players come raid night which will result in a messy run or worse you not being able to even go because not enough people showed up which wastes the time of all the people who did show up. Those people will get fed up with the poor attendance and go somewhere else ruining the guild. So if you want to do the pug life feel free but I, and many others, do not want to waste our time. Its not a problem. It is a solution to a problem.
---
Sounds good - I saw you joined our Discord.  Feel free to apply when you are ready.
---
As long as they put those old wow logo/watermarks on them I'm in.
---
If anybody knows when the TBC nerf patch happened this video might be viable. We need some hardcore Vanilla gear export to diffuse this.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVsgi1LF7Ho
---
And also we need some CSI pixel enhancement, but this video might be useful.
---
I got baited into subbing again, #pray.
---
Quit your job and find one that works with your raid schedule..
---
You're aware that they already solved why the panthers were doing reduced damage right?
---
Holy fcking shit i got in!!!!! Praise rng jesus!!!
---
Can be a free stealth breaker if you use rank 1, and if Shadow Word: Pain is too costly to cast.
---
It’s really niche though.
---
Tell him he needs to save up for that all important level 40 mount!
---
I get waves of nostalgia washing over me with OG wow. It was my first and only MMO I stuck with for years until Cata destroyed the world I loved so much, just the music alone gets to me every time LOL. Dammit I swore I would never give Blizz or anyone else a sub again and yet I know I cannot resist classic wow when it comes back!
---
And then there will be a shitstorm from retail players saying how easy is vanilla etc..
---
Ya'll bout to catch me like this in DM in phase 2
---
Well when you say the ending ''doesn't make sense'' then I assume you mean that you think where the characters end up doesn't make sense. But that does make sense for the most part, it just happened in a really jarringly rushed manner.
---
I did not think about that, now I see the point of it, thanks.
---
"Dude, it is leveling gear, no one actually cares. They wouldn't do it in actual endgame dungeons."
---
"Dude, it is dungeon gear, no one actually cares. They wouldn't do it in actual raids."
---
That's awesome. And yeah i would say he's a pretty big deal. Won Blizzcon, Competes in the Mythic world first race, and also competes in the Mythic plus dungeon tournament. Dudes a wow god. Awesome to hear hes still a normal dude after all of that.
---
True. They also get dismounted and drown in literal puddles.
---
Here we go again
---
Caster, tanky dps and a hybrid/healer would be my suggestion.
---
you better have your bubble hearth macro ready &gt;:(
---
&gt; Yet you reference elites when the tigers clearly aren't.
---
There were two links in that thread. One of them is about the tigers, the other is about SFK and WC.
---
&gt;So, essentially, what you think (conjecture) has more validity?
---
It doesn't matter what I think. The fact is that there is no categorical issue with mob damage, be that for elites or non-elites, in the beta. This is evident from video comparisons where both elite and non-elite mobs deal the correct amount of damage. The only logical conclusion one can draw from this is that there's a bug that *sometimes* causes mobs to deal incorrect damage.
---
Maybe let's talk about the future of Classic WoW once it even has its present? That would make much more sense IMO.
---
I'd disagree with blizzard. I've watched a few Deadmines runs and MANY of the mobs are not aggroing as they had.
---
play it cool and say yeah maybe a bit, then only give them the name of your alt, which naturally will probably outlevel their main.
---
source: long time veteran of hiding the stealth main from friends
---
They won’t make new content for classic. ion has said it twice on record now. If anything they will make a BC server. I don’t know how this is still a hot topic. The game developer is on record twice saying new content for classic is out of the question.
---
That makes sense. And it doesn't make sense that the damage numbers from pservers are *double* what they are on the Beta. I could totally see there being a discrepancy, but **double**?
---
I think the most probable cause rn is that Blizz is using nerfed mob damage from TBC.
---
Except you know its dead mines. Pretty much everyone running them is alliance and alliance do not have shamans. \*facepalm\*
---
Unfortunately not.
---
Guild mate of mine managed to get in with the latest wave.
---
He played a bit of BfA, but hasn't been subbed for a few months. His account was originally created on EU launch of the game on February 11 2005.
---
Subbed again in hopes of getting a key (as did a few other people in the guild) and got in.
---
Maybe Ion said that, but they said we didnt want classic. Not saying its for sure, but at this point I wouldnt take a blizz statement like that for sure.
---
Anyone I’ve seen is an OG 2004/2005 player make of that what you will
---
Hear hear! An actual source with verifiable information!
---
get lost there are at least 273659259837 other threads like this
---
I will not allow it.
---
No confirmed sources of unsubbed people receiving invite to beta but there are some blue posts with people claiming you need to be subbed in order to get an invite to the beta so I assume you indeed need to be subbed.
---
Going to copy and paste.
---
&gt; I recall many of the top rated comments being "Imagine paying x amount  to play a x year old game." when it was announced at Blizzcon. There  were plenty of people throwing shade around. Not agreeing you with and  pointing out the fact there is negativity that comes from either [/r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow),  mmo champ, youtube content creators or retail players on the official  forums is not a victim complex, that's you trying to dismiss it.   
---
&gt; He never said the majority of [r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow) members are haters, he just said the demo announcement made a lot of them come out of the woodwork.   
---
&gt; This about sums it up, people are quick jump on me but don't bother to actually read what I wrote.
---
same, and then being mad i couldnt be the nelf with the cool armor and wield a warglaive
---
That’s how you know Vanilla is for the casual noobs, in Retail there is just so much more to do that it’s overwhelming. I keep saying that and people give me shit that Vanilla was so much better, it wasn’t.
---
Retail is way way WAY better for a skilled gamer. Competitive Arena PvP, more items, more classes, more races, more zones and more boss encounters which require skill. It was a simpler game for simpler times, so fucking stop saying Vanilla was better, it was the best for the time. If you were back in time and both games were presented to you, you would have picked the game with better graphics, more classes and more of a skill ceiling.
---
Hey u/ElementalThreat ! I empathize with what you’re feeling, and I’ve felt that way before about different shows. Still, I’ll do my best to explain what everyone is upset about rather than just saying you’re wrong.
---
The biggest thing to understand is that the finale of Game of Thrones isn’t just the finale of the characters in the show, but the finale of the world they live in. That world had been developed over many many hours and years. It was a very complicated, generally logically sound, living and breathing world. It had rules, norms and patterns that were as interesting as they were consistent.
---
At least... until the later seasons. In the later seasons, the show slowly stopped being about the world and the characters, and instead entirely about the characters. Still, the world was there though, it was just getting routinely validated through illogical causes and effects. I’ll give you some examples from the finale:
---
1.	Dany’s army has been extremely autonomous: When they captured Jon Snow, why would they not just resolve his fate amongst themselves? Why call... all the rulers of the seven kingdoms?
---
2.	Why would there be a vote for the new king? Why would Tyrion, the prisoner, be allowed to initiate this anyways?
---
3.	When Sansa declared the North independent, why did Dorne (a historically almost entirely independent nation) and the Iron Islands (similarly independent) not follow suit?
---
Let me tell you there are a LOT more issues, but the point is this: the finale of the characters of Game of Thrones may have been good, but the finale of the world of Westeros was the very last remaining logic of the world being destroyed.
---

In a way where there was buildup to what happened.  The ending isn't too farfetched but we got the fucking cliff notes instead of a full show.

The writing was the trope-iest shit that I've seen.  &gt;!Euron swims miles and miles and happens to swim to the same part of the shore at the same time as jaime and is ready for a fight?

Why did grey worm let Tyrion and Jon walk?  He is slaughtering captured prisoners in the street but Jon kills their queen and they let him walk?   He literally starts that scene off by saying "you're not here to talk" to Tyrion and then let's Tyrion name Bran as king, gets himself named the hand, and gets Jon a pardon to the north?  Did greyworm forget how angry he was or that he was demanding justice 5 minutes earlier?  And not to forget the plastic water bottles in the scene. 
---
If nothing else, why are the unsullied sailing to an island that is going to kill them?  What happened to the dothraki?!&lt;
---
&gt; Some, or all? Do you have proof they all do?
---
Yeah you will get people like me and zauru193 REEEEEEEEing with that mentality
---
I wouldn't call that a glitch though since it was the norm in Vanilla, TBC, WotLK. I think it was intentionally changed in Cata, but I could be wrong. Either way, leaving skeletons on the ground until reset was awesome!
---
1% dodge is so marginal that it's completely useless.
---
The increased sword skill from the human racial is beast for tanking because of the increased threat.
---
They will likely handle it as they did in Vanilla, where transfers were only possible from ( PvE -&gt; PvE ) , ( PvP -&gt;  PvP ) , ( PvP - &gt; PvE ).  PvP servers were harder to level in, and they didn't wan't to short cut that experience back then.

Whatever you want and like.

Do not choose what is best to play, but choose what you want to play.

I saw two videos of two level 18/19 rogues getting hit for the same amount from the vancleef guards from 2004-2006. It was 36-42 dmg they both got so we just need a lvl 18/19 rogue try it out.
---
Bc comes out and all your effort and gear goes down the toilet

It’s up to the streamers to do this.

Humans have better racials.

So what’s another 97 days?
---
they have an exact 1.12.1 vanilla as it was reference client running internally, they have checked and confirmed it is working identically in the beta as it did in patch 1.12.1.

I played Vanilla, I remember. I would bet any amount of money that the damage is off and it’s not even close, honestly. Private Servers will have the better product unless Blizz fixes this. They will have a more challenging &amp; rewarding game, and one without sharding &amp; layering. Plus you can play for free.
---
I've assembled spreadsheet demonstrating the damage disparity between 2 kills [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br9mn1/irrefutable_proof_of_damage_disparity_between/)
---
Is 13 days alright?
---
Generally it was just perceived as a right of passage back then.  If you wanted to play on a PvP server, you got to deal with every aspect.  People wanting "Honorable" PvP encounters only, would always complain.  But you would also see 4-5 man vs 1 ganks, high levels vs low levels ganks, its just part of the experience.
---
Go on, please explain them then
---
Because at that point you aren’t asking for Classic, you’re asking for a modified “hard mode” that never existed
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br9mn1/irrefutable_proof_of_damage_disparity_between/) is however
---
This was solved. It was due a stoneskin bug where even after the player leaves the party with the shaman, it was still "up"
---
I also believe beyond that, they found out stoneskin values are not correct as well.
---
I think this was a myth perpetuated on my server as well.
---
I believe it will res you in the zone you die in regardless of which spirit healer you use.
---
Someone made a gearscore addon for private servers. It was pretty useless because gearscore makes no sense in the context of vanilla, it was just for fun.
---
Are we talking about the 29 druid? Isn’t the armour value for %reduction vs lvl 29 mobs?
---
Horseshit options, what the fuck.
---
I think vanilla has room for both casuals and hard core gamers! But go off i guess
---
TBC pre-patch is 2.0.1. How could they possibly have backported all of the 2.0.1 values into 1.12? That requires deliberate effort on Blizzard's end. A very unlikely chain of events.
---
I'd agree with this statement too.
---
I truly hope Blizzard's internal data isn't a mess. With how many iterations there are in game files, combined with the fact that this engine has been revamped, Blizz could be confusing *their own* internal data
---
They said they've checked the numbers, it's quoted. I believe that. I still don't think its right. They can check the numbers and still have a bunch of code not doing what it's supposed to. Checking numbers is much different then client side testing. I could be wrong as well but on this issue, I really doubt it. I give it two weeks before we get another reply about this.
---
Wasn't this question here yesterday? Anyway the answer is, you get ressurected at the spirit healer closest to your corpse, i.e. where you appeared as ghost no matter to which spirit healer you talk to. This would be have been found out long time ago if it wasn't the case.
---
Nah they are wrong his feels are correct
---
Not the one you replied to, but I sometimes kill lower level to try and bait out their guild mates or maybe make them log their main. Basically using it as a way to start some wPvP.
---
If it doesn't work I won't corpse camp, though - as you say, it is not really fun to just one shot someone, but I don't think I'm alone in using this as a way to bait out other level 60s.
---
Uhh yeah that's what I want. I see that as an absolute win that would improve the gameplay.
---
&gt; There were two links in that comment. One of them is about the tigers, the other is about SFK and WC.

I remember watching my dad play and begging to take a turn. When he let me play I made a gnome warrior but I wanted to leave the snowy area of dun morough and go to elwynn so I could be with my dad. He told me the only way to get there was to walk. So as a lvl 1 gnome I spent all my time trying to climb up these hills to try and get to elwynn

"MOAGGHDB"
---
this could be the same bug that caused joana to get hit by a certain number and others to be hit by less damage
---
it seems to apply almost randomly
---
Ya of course. Why would you bring a ret pally to a group with less people when you wouldn’t want to in a 40 man.
---
Can we talk about this thing thousands of others have posted already and had long discussions about?
---
I'm diving head first into STV. How else are you going to compile a gank-on-site list for the rest of your WoW playtime?
---
Yeah you got a good point
---
Pointless discussion now although I understand the motive, theorycrafting is always at its worst prior to any release.

How are you cool with playing with another guy that’s banging your wife
---
I think they patched this after some trolling in vanilla towards the end.
---
Not true, TBC prepatch is 2.0.0 which was applied to the vanilla client.
---
exactly.
---
whether you like private servers or not, they spent decades pouring over data to make sure they got it right.
---
NOT using them as a resource would be stupid
---
I appreciate an actual reply with real criticism. I do agree with your points. It’s pretty noticeable when the writers ran out of source material from the books. That being said I still think they did a pretty good job delivering on a satisfying story.
---
That was me entering Razor Hill for the first time - "This is GREAT! I wonder if there are any other towns this big."
---
Depending on how popular classic is, this argument might not be accurate from the perspective of blizzivision.
---
As a company, they are basically trying to satisfy the greatest number of players and entice them into paying for their product.
---
As illustrated by the falling sub numbers post wrath, many of the features that seem to entice people have actually, at the very least, diminished interest in the game.
---
Some might argue that the falling sub numbers are due to other causes, such as people just losing interest in a ten+ year old game.
---
This assumption however, still results in the fact that the new features failed to captivate a significant enough portion of the population to keep them paying for the product.
---
My biggest grief with retail was the constant resets that occurred starting with tbc (which is a really overrated expansion).  
---
Without these resets and retools of the game, I could forgive a lot of the features people claim were destructive (such as flying/xmog/ shitty lore) and would arguably still be playing today.
---
I was hoping they'd start with cheap training and switch it, my friend got his mount cheap back in the day because he bought training when he first hit 40 but couldnt afford the mount
---
I’m about to drive to work, but when I get there I’ll edit this comment with the answers
---
Can't be unseen now
---
There’s a really big group of people I’ve seen get in since they applied and have a 10 year old account
---
A chart that could have been filled with made up numbers isn’t really irrefutable proof to be fair.
---
If you had video proof on the other hand...
---
I hope so. It's not exactly fun gameplay, imo.
---
What you described right there is probably what is possible , what people are talking about and what can be seen on streams is worlds apart . Pretty sure theres more posts about this and a lot of people agree that the damage is off .
---
The guy literally never played Vanilla, it was the title of the stream. 
---
Everyone is so hostile on this sub, chill out we are actually getting *Classic WoW*
---
I can't believe Blizzlord released the game in such a state to such a large audience. Noob friendly, sharding, locked behind a paywall, level cap not like Vanilla.
---
Good jeb Bilzerd.
---
I used to lead content exactly like this before streaming ever mattered, and it was allowed to happen because of the social aspect of the game. Old WoW supports social play.
---
Well, he's also banging her
---
This was massively toned down by the time wrath hit. I was in a 10 man heroic guild, best 10 man on the server. We were well known, but LFR/G cut out the importance of community.
---
I suppose the most cucked thing to do would be to play a melee hunter?
---
Yep, diminishing returns were added in the beta, prior to launch.
---
There was a short time when paladins could chaincast Turn Undead and perma-fear Undead players in PvP. Polymorph didn't have the healing effect yet, either, so you could just chain poly and whittle a player down.
---
There were a *lot* of major changes late beta and the first year of vanilla. Even later in vanilla, major meta-altering changes were a lot more common than in TBC and forward.
---
a 47 rogue ran me through deadmines last night and he breezed through it
---
Nost's data carried through to the current largest pserver today so I can't really find evidence of what you saying is correct. Pservers put a ton of work into verifying damage values
---
Moreover, Beta has loads of bugs where the same mobs apply diff damage to diff people at diff times
---
At this point Pservers appear to have better damage numbers
---
I pugged Naxx in Vanilla for the first few bosses. Let's just admit - Vanilla raiding was not difficult.
---
Yeah that's just such cash grab garbage . Launch day accounts that we're recently active, or just battlenet active should have gotten sent. Nostalgia aside the feel of the game is important and often something has to be played to see if it feels right.
---
New players offer prospective also but especially in this case of trying to accurately recreate the past it should weigh heavier on the veterans side
---
Come to dungeons and raids prepared. If you are under geared and need potions bring them. Always repair!! You can not simply ask someone to get on their repair mount.
---
Ok so it sounds like you’re better suited to private servers that tweak the game in ways that blizzard did not. Classic is about making vanilla playable again, not about artificially twisting vanilla into a version that never existed so it can feel harder than it was
---
Best name for a frost mage.
---
it's not as bad as it sounds, shes okay with me donating to streamers and getting premium snapchats
---
1) Warrior/Druid for tanking
---
2) Mage/Hunter for DPS and CC
---
3) Resto Paladin/Priest for heals

[This video came out in Vanilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWMz7-7SGlo)   
---
See how many places that were already started before BC even was a thing.
---
I am now. Perhaps similar issues remain with other spells, or perhaps it's another issue entirely. Would have to find a couple of more recordings from Deadmines from the beta to have a better idea of what's going on.
---
We can still get up to lvl 5 in the stress test ...
---
I think people need to give Pservers more credit.
---
There has been a decades long, community driven effort to use actual Classic videos as evidence for getting proper damage values.
---
Yet people here are so quick to say "pserver? lol no they're wrong"
---
What if Rahk’Zor crit the druid for 187? and he sort of exaggerated things on his post
---
I still believe there’s no reason not to investigate the damage numbers, and I’m suspicious myself, but it’s not the greatest evidence in the world.
---
The best comparative evidence I had seen up til this point was Joana against those tigers. Blizz did address that specific case as it was the stoneskin totem bug. 
---
I will point out they were already stating the values were correct before that point, and a lot of people in the original Joana thread were using the same reasons to believe everything was fine as people in this thread are using.
---
The test was made using a Night Elf. Shamans can't be alliance in vanilla.
---
What's that have to do with anything? Am I missing something?
---
Hope you casuals roll on my PVP realm. Can’t wait to camp you guys as I have played retail and am used to tougher mechanics than you.
---
Alliance dogs. The only good thing about them is their weak bodies make excellent soil at my Goretusk farm. 
---
Lok’tar.
---
2hander tanking while leveling isn't uncommon even on private servers where damage is significantly higher. 
---
The issue is he didn't even need a dedicated healer, they were clearing the instance easily with esfand offhealing as ret before the healer got there.
---
Cuddly-wuddly crit chicken &lt;3
---
Maybe other armour buffs have a similar bug to them. Mark of the Wild or Devotion Aura, for example.
---
Agree. Especially in a party of three they'll face-roll pretty much everything. And if they can include a tank or healer they'll be set for 5-mans.
---
Minor thing, did you include the ap debuff the druid was putting up?         
---
I doubt it's a 20 to 30% difference, but it'd make up a part of it
---
Love the fact that the super min/maxer is someone who never played classic. Feels super accurate 😂.
---
The video is literally an example of large world pvp and one player coming up with a clever play and outsmarting the opponents. What we see in the video is absolutely sport.  
---
Granted, it's not curated content and watching the streamers all the time will be wasted for most of it. But there will be the few gems of awesome. That's what you stick around for. You know, kind of like in american football most of it is commercial and replays and what have you and only some ridiculously small percentage is the actual playtime. I'd watch someone play WoW over american football any day.
---
"Can we talk about..." that thing that's been discussed endlessly over the last week?
---
They're just spamming RFK and SMGY 50 times a day. Don't see how this is any different than M+10.
---
pservers damage values are the result of decades long community effort to find correct data *using actual videos and verifiable data*.
---
I don't think you can dismiss pserver numbers that easily. They're a great resource.
---
Honestly, I agree, but it's worth consideration IMO.
---
You have a level 60 character and a level 19 character.
---
1 is a Rogue, 1 is a Druid.
---
Because you do not know what happens in the actual code in the background this is not irrefutable proof since you have variables you cannot account for.
---
I am not saying that there is no damage disparity, I do not have the required data to draw a conclusion but you have most certainly not produced irrefutable proof.
---
There is no mail it just appears in your client
---
Thottbot haha. You brought back some memories!

Mostly DPS and Healers. I think we are good on tanks.
---
no, lets not talk about it, the game is not even out yet, enjoy that for over a year.

*What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch priest? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Caster DPS group, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Ahn'Qiraj, and I have over 300 confirmed moonfire hits. I am trained in feral warfare and I'm the top caster in the entire US realm. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with hit percentage the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret guild of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Hurricane (Rank 3) , priest. The Hurricane (Rank 3) that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, priest. I can be anything, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare claws. Not only am I extensively trained in claw combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of balance spells and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what natures retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit Wrath all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*
---
Please do not say that ULTRAWIDE works. OVERWATCH featured perfect ultrawide native at its running beta, It got recalled once the game released. Blizzard could do what Blizzard has done in the past. But it works in wow bfa you say...yes but its all worth nothing until the  very classic release day.
---
I agree. And you're right. Remastered is the word I was looking for.
---
That video is from TBC.  Look at the rest of the comments in this chain.
---
Give OP credit, he's bringing awareness to an actual major issue here probably the biggest issue in the entire beta
---
It's what we call Dunning-Kruger.
---
sorry no fun allowed in blizzard games
---
and still some people are pissed that high elfs are not in alliance

I can't believe ~~Blizzlord~~  Activision.

Vanilla Blizzard is long gone :P

I'm not saying he's lying. I'm saying that he's wrong.

Now that's irony, coming from priest who is doomed to be healbot for the rest of his days :) I'm sticking to feral and I will do my hardest to create as many bearlievers as possible.

pally tanks are pretty good in dungeons after a certain point. They have pretty solid aoe threat generation, which is really what you care about there.
---
Im just waiting to hear something about combat text.
---
Yeah battle rez can be accepted after the mob resets
---
Except he watches videos his subs/followers link him. There’s clearly plenty (thousands) of people asking for it, regardless of your view toward it. And I highly doubt the entirety of his stream is just watching others’ video, I’m sure there was plenty streamtime of him doing his own thing.
---
they unlock a lot of their key spells early, they’re not gear dependant and their pet is basically a warrior that runs fast
---
It’s on Monkeynews stream from yesterday. Healer didn’t get there before they killed the Corpsemaker boss.
---
I'd replace the Mage/Hunter with a Warlock.

A Warlock that can lifetap away outshines Mages and Hunters by a mile, plus you have CC with the succ.

Imagine a wow vanilla player with eidetic memory could tell the exact numbers
---
Really? Where do you get that 3:1 ratio from?  My estimates are coming up with at least 2:5 in favour of classic.
---
With my very much so missed Quel'serrar on my side
---
This makes me wonder, are they not just copy pasting the old wow coding into the servers or are they doing the whole thing from scratch?
---
As one who’s aoe leveled 3 mages in my life, yes.
---
Meant the beta that's currently up.
---
Hahahaha Faxanadu, I remember farming raptor meat for days and days and handing it to you for AQ gate opening in hopes of getting a warrior trial spot in Immortality, but all the warrior spots were full. My brother was a paladin in Immo so I at least got to watch him raid. I recognized the Tabard right away.
---
I'm going to save this and post it whenever I find the need to
---
You can do this on any priest, beeing NE wont give an advantage, since when you start casting it breaks stealth.
---
i did it 1-60 and it was very easy, just grab mage water and rank your spells and you'll be fine, also shadow damage gear later won't do any good for you though and you need to have backup
---
Discussed endlessly since the announcement of Classic in 2017.
---
Nice try, Jay. But no matter how sweet the memes we will never forgive you for “ You think you do, but you don’t.”
---
Westfall may be aesthetically pleasing but the quest density is terrible...
---
I know right. If only they would've done some period of play testing, where they let players check out the game and report any issues they find. Probably not have it be the final state, but an intermediary test version. Maybe run it for a few months and invite only some couple thousand of people. Make sure they get all the kinks out and only THEN actually release the game. If only they did that.  
---
Oh wait.
---
I am getting married about a month after vanilla hits. I am sort of tempted to virgin min-max the first month so that by the time I come back from my honeymoon I will be around the same level as my IRL friends and I can go back to being casual chad :')
---
++ To the point of this post though. It's fine to do research but make sure you don't skip quests that send you across the continent. You never know who you'll meet or what you'll find on your way there.
---
There are many leather pieces that are a pre-bis for hunters and fury warriors, so if I will be playing a hunter I will certainly need on them, cause mail pieces are just worse
---
&gt;Yes I know it's beta but there are new players watching the streams and getting bad impressions.
---
So? How about they just think for themselves. It's not rocketscience that you don't just ninja from other people, you don't need to know some special WoW code, it is quite intuitive.
---
And if someone really starts to ninja left and right because they saw a stream do it, so what? It will be a minority and they will get a bad rep and then it's their own problem.
---
Great answer!
---
It's irrefutable proof that there's something wrong with damage from what we know about armor and damage calculation. 
---
I'm not saying it has to be elite damage, it could also be how armor works, or how damage on higher/lower level mobs works, but either way, this spreadsheet proves there's something wrong.
---
I will both allow it and not allow it. Schroedinger's admittance.
---
Joana is the man
---
but you know blizzard has an exact 1.12.1 reference client running internally that they use to confirm this stuff. I don't think it's very likely they could check this bug and be wrong? couldn't it be that it was working differently at earlier vanilla than 1.12.1 and that's what you're remembering?
---
The finale was satisfying. But the last 2 seasons leading up to it felt extremely rushed and incomplete.
---
What is it making easier though? You're still only able to have one pet at a time, and still need to level every pet up. All it's doing is allowing you to feel more like a Hunter.
---
Its not random at all. Preach is actually a correct level rather than 5 levels above the mobs like half the shit that's getting posted, and he is geared like your average player rather than most of the tanks who have been fed gear by their stream viewers.
---
It's really kind of sad, because BfA for all the shitty problems and kind of debatable quality of the story was a great idea. An expansion focused on the faction war is awesome, but it's just a little too late for it to work.
---
If you have a pulse you’ve realized they, at bare minimum, rushed the ending to its detriment. 6 episodes to wrap up that story was woefully inadequate.
---
Then there are the inconsistencies in character behavior, plot holes, egregious temporal/spatial/set inconsistencies, and overall decreased quality of characters’ individual lines. Tyrion less clever, Jon less sage, Jaime less thoughtful.
---
It was bad. Practically anyone who has any understanding of basic filmmaking (or simply watches tv critically) can cite decreases of quality throughout the series. You can enjoy it, and many did including myself, but to be deeply disappointed by the final season isn’t merely parroting some “influencer”. It’s plain as day the series fell off a cliff.

BOW YOU SHITS!
---
I heard the devs want to allow us to stay in vanilla permanently. I hate tbc onwards
---
Dude. Chill. Classic isn't even put yet and you're trying to run some sort of damage control.
---
Let people discuss what they want to.
---
You and everyone else who thinks something like WoW 2 would ever happen are delusional af. It would never in a million years be beneficial to Blizzard creating such a project.
---
Hmm, I searched the subreddit and couldn't find any. Are they just being removed now?
---
They said stoneskin buff is permanent atm so the numbers are off possibly theres a similar bug on alliance
---
FYI classic db is based off of the same databases used on private servers and as such is not a reliable source for what vanilla was actually like.
---
Comments can be genuine but the data itself is not necessarily accurate.
---
I actually don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with getting into the beta. I mean, if it was a new game, sure - you might want to test out what classes feels like and such things, but honestly most people already know what all classes feels like to play. To be beta is just a way to burn out before Classic even launches, why would I want that?
---
Possible theres a similar bug on alliance
---
Looks polished, nice job.
---
But the level 60 is the one being hit harder. The level difference shouldn’t matter. 
---
The key variable I’m aware of that affects physical auto attacks and crit damage received is armour, which is very well accounted for in the spreadsheet. 
---
The only other possibilities are attack power reducing buffs and defensive buffs (mostly affecting armour via flat bonus or agi stats, think devo aura or motw). None of those are enough to account for the damage difference.
---
What’s being counted are attacks landed on both characters by Rahk’Zor. Even after mathematically accounting for the dmg reduction from armour, he is hitting the lvl 60 for significantly higher damage.
---
Meh, they drink too much. Any gains from easier pull size is easily negated by additional downtime. They drink way more than healers and dps.
---
It’s funny that people are like “wHaT hApPeNs aFtEr nAxX?” when you could play classic all your life
---
It's not about remembering it's about having seen actual vanilla footage of it. 
---
I know that they have a reference client, I am simply suggesting that there was some error on the CM's side. Like for example:
---
Sheeping others mobs was possible, but blizzard decided to not allow this in classic because of griefing, so CM gets told that: "Oh yeah it's intended on the beta that you cannot sheep others mobs", and he miss understands this as sheeping others mobs was never possible in vanilla.
---
Armor DR cap is 75% though isn't it? That's still a big chunk out of the damage.
---
I'm pretty sure Polymorph is the exception here because it heals the target.

I didn't realise this was a heavily spammed topic, apparently Reddit's search is not that great.
---
nope, there's enough players for both, and there will be overlap for both. I know I want to play both vanilla and tbc
---
and I gave up on blizzard's ability to make a good game, wow 2 will be crap - pay to win and micro transactions
---
Yep, your best bet would be to try dying in one zone close to the other zone's spirit healer to skip some of the running.
---
Rofl this is the biggest bullshit I’ve ever read. As if you “meta gamed” patch 1.6 with sweeping strikes that ignored armor and knew all this while leveling up, even pushing 2H tanking and “carrying groups”. Good attempt though.
---
After you take the boot you can swim south and drown yourself on the westcoast of Dun Morogh ( misspelled, I know ) you will spawn in the small city south of Ironforge.
---
Sure. Just thought we have a lot of time at the moment.
---
The only thing the spreadsheet proofs is that there are different damage numbers between the 2 video's. That is all it proofs.
---
If you want to proof something irrefutable you need a controlled environment, this is not that environment.
---
O how i wish there could be peggle in classic
---
OH MY GOD YES!!! This is whatever the opposite of `I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas!!` is...
---
-----
---
&gt; Fix it. It doesn't work.
---
What doesn't work?
---
&gt; It doesn't work, and I need you to fix it, this is critical!
---
You still haven't told me what is broken.
---
&gt; My computer doesn't work, why else would I bother talking to you.
---
Okay, what isn't your computer doing.
---
&gt; I just told you it doesn't work.
---
BUT I CAN SEE THAT IT IS CLEARLY ON AND FUNCTIONING!!! **WHAT. IS. IT. NOT. DOING?!?!** 
---
&gt; I don't know, it just doesn't work right.
---
Okay, let me ask this a different way, what were you doing when it didn't do whatever it is, that you think it's supposed to do better...
---
And this is why we drink. :D
---
Ah yeah, maybe.
---
Not in Vanilla - pally tanks only started  appearing in TBC.
---
In vanilla pally was a buffbot/healer 99% of the time - even as far as taking the leather and cloth items for the better caster stats.
---
Hence the quotation marks.
---
Welcome to the real world, kid.
---
I'm racist against warriors that won't tank.
---
It's amazing to relive the time when you can click your abilities, keyboard turn and still have a blast. I remember there were so many of us migrating from Counter Strike at the time, meaning we had above average movement skills and awareness of our surroundings in-game. It still boggled my mind to see the game speeding up by each expansions and playing it like a pianist becoming the norm. Just look at where retail has got. It plays like a freakin' Call of Duty but oh boi... Sure all are going to be playing Classic tranquil, happy and not giving a damn about anything hurrying. God. #&amp;@!ing. Thanks.
---
mining + engi
---
tons of herb/alch on beta atm, thinking it'll be popular going into live
---
You’re kind of a moron huh
---

This is how it's gonna go, Orc scum!
---
Holy shit peggle
---
I love the fact that you've highlighted you don't intend to say the values are correct but just that it's not up to us to say "Classic is wrong". No, we feel it's incorrect so we reported that - now it's on Blizzard's side to go and check whether the values actually are true to the source.
---
We can investigate all we want but it's actually Blizzard that is the most reliable source.
---
That's not the same thing as doing it without a healer though, which is what one of them were doing.
---
And if that is the case, Blizzard should definitely be made aware.
---
vanilla
---
129.5 average damage with 11.8% armor reduction equals to
---
146.8 average damage with 0% armor reduction
---
beta
---
68.0 average damage with 41.6% armor reduction equals to
---
116.4 average damage with 0% armor reduction
---
in beta mobs deal around 20% less damage.
---
I'm gonna get an oomkin with sulfuras.
---
Could potentially fly if you're reserving things like an ironfoe?     
---
But the way you're saying, that you decide who to give it to sure won't. Because saying z person needs it more doesn't really matter with pugs. Else why would they run it, and why would they not just equip literal garbage to slow down the run more for them to get the item
---
Yeah I play since Vanilla and had great fun with Legion.
---
&gt;you need a controlled environment, this is not that environment.
---
But it is.
---
I did tank undead strath one night on my shaman.... you just need to have a solid group, and a lot of heals. 
---
:D
---
Earth shock, rockbiter weapon, stoneskin totem, and a group that ONLY attacks whatever you are currently attacking.
---
Where are the others?
---
I'm kinda in a similar boat. My friends are gonna play with me, but neither of them played vanilla. One played heavily in TBC and Wrath, and then quit in WoD. The other is his wife who has only briefly played a bit of the last few expansions. They are not prepared. 
---
I just wonder if they will remotely stick with it. I may outpace one or both of them and then feel alone in the world.
---
Not like there is a higher population of folks with autism on an MMORPG sub that might miss the sarcasm.
---
Thanks- always feels good to have somenoe agree
---
"what's that guy doing?"
---
"His best"
---
no, if the server isn't at leat 45-55 it feels like a waste of time for me
---
Wasn't trying to theorycraft, just wanted to know others opinions on it
---
Chain mail it looks like
---
Oooh, edgy.
---
I mean it would be have been super easy for them to differentiate between people getting invited to the beta and getting invited to the stress test, they just didn't choose to. It really has nothing to do with "the real world".
---
Swipe all day every day bro
---
I mean up to aq40 people are going to roll raids. You'll be able to pug raids whenever you want. So up to aq40 you could possibly pug shit. Classic raiding isn't hard, it's more time consuming until you hit naxx. But even then, people are rolling Naxx within the first few hours.
---
Fine by me! I do remember though when I got a group of like 8 friends to play Nost with me, and they all stopped at around level 30.
---
None is arguging that classicCB is accurate in the damage numbers.
---
Also you have completely failed to account for armor, you know what armor does?
---
Stun lock- hunter dead.
---
Got a link to any of that footage? 
---
&gt;CM gets told that: "Oh yeah it's intended on the beta that you cannot sheep others mobs", and he miss understands this as sheeping others mobs was never possible in vanilla.
---
could be possible yes
---
Oh yea thats it. I remeber this name.  
---
Thank you and have a nice day. =)
---
Rofl apparently automod is just straight removing these posts now, fair enough
---
Twas a joke! I jest! Yeah, I am hoping they do the smart thing and send an email BEFORE people get the stress test invite that clarifies it. Otherwise seeing that popup in your launcher would get you hyped! You log in on Thursday to play since the stress test is over and...nada. It would be quite the deflating feeling.
---
You wouldn't, but if you wouldn't bring one to a 40 man anyway, that's not less room for them.
---
every day for as long as we can remember
---
I’m convinced either OP is a complete retard - or is actually also trolling by pushing this blatantly irrelevant add on as being real lol
---
Either way...why
---
Practice how you perform. If they can do it here they will justify it later
---
Yeah, in case you didn't know - the Thottbot owner bought Wowhead and merged them, so basically Wowhead is now Thottbot. The cool thin is Wowhead have made a Classic section of their site and this section allows for a custom theme that looks like Thottbot. It will still say Wowhead in the top, but it will be blue with the gold elite dragon around the o and be white and all that.
---
Then their reference client is wrong.
---
Asmongold literlly admitted several times he was a ninja in vanilla...
---
Yeah like as much as I do or don't think values are right, it's something Blizzard themselves needs to do apart from the community and say "hey this is right, or no the values not right and we're looking into it".      
---
All it'd take is equivalent characters on each server to check dmg taken and voila
---
overreacting, don’t ya think?
---
That has absolutely nothing to do with threat
---
they are.
---
ah ya that makes more sense. I never did it I just remember someone vaguely mentioning you can do it via that AH.
---
Yes, this was possible back in classic!  So long as you log out and back in at some point while you’re a ghost.  (This also assumes the bug gets recreated - I’m gonna try to test it out if I get into the stress test.)
---
The other commenters are right about what happens if they fix the bug/you don’t relog.
---
But that's not an indication something needs fixed, it's just an indication that his stream persona is kind of an asshole.  Hey, I'll admit I enjoy watching sometimes, but the "Classic is Easy" shtick is a bit tiring.  Because if you pay attention in those videos, he definitely drops below 80% health when there's six Elites, and the only reason he's not dying to 3-4 Elites is because his healer's doing a hell of a job, which pisses me off when he claims you shouldn't stop for mana (while in a pre-beta video he talks about how he preferred old dungeon design because it wasn't made for speed-running... just pick a philosophy and stick with it, man!).  The healer's mana is often pretty low because they're pulling everything from their bag of tricks, and you can see Asmon's health yoyoing like crazy.
---
He's gotten overconfident and led to wipes, even discounting that time he didn't know/remember what happens when you light the braziers in Blackfathom Deeps, lit all four, and the party got curbstomped by a swarm of mobs.  But hell, they wiped earlier in that run to just three Elites (granted, I believe they were spellcasters).
---
His runs aren't evidence of Classic being easy, he just keeps saying it because it'll stir people up, and that gets more attention for him, which gets more views, and more views is more money.  The guy will claim things are "easy" while getting his ass kicked.
---
Objectively, though... Classic/Vanilla *will* be easier when it launches, compared to what it was.  Back then, everyone was a "noob" and didn't know gearing strategies, rotations, how many mobs to pull, etc.  Boss mechanics were a lot simpler (but they still existed... as evidenced when Asmon didn't think to turn a boss away from the party and they sprayed the party for heavy damage).  People have more experience and knowledge now, so we'll know how to get things done better.  You can't recreate the actual "vanilla" experience without getting a bunch of random people who've never played an MMO to come in and see how they do when leveling and doing dungeons together, with limited resources to look up information.
---
bruh on a private server me and 2 friends did every instance up to and including some of BRD with rogue/mage/warlock
---
not sure which as it was a few years ago but it was blizzlike
---
O i'm chillen like a villain. Its just a major slap in the face to most of the fan base that only content creators got in. Then to have videos coming out of tools like that guy who report low level quest gear as a bug cause no stats. Its embarrassing for Blizzard.  If I was blizzard I would have done the same thing tbh. Doesn't mean I have to like it though.
---
I don't think people are down for being denied upgrades just because somebody else needs it more. Not in random groups anyways, in guild groups it makes sense so future runs go more smoothly.
---
For you a hunter, for you and your wife 2 hunters, and for you your wife plus her boyfriend 3 hunters
---
Not in PvP
---
I understand the joy of minmaxing as much as I do playing casually. Really, there are many ways to get enjoyment out of WoW. The only problem I see is forcing others to play how you do (unless you're a minmaxing guild, obviously). 
---
I do think that I have seen a LOT of minmaxing guides recently, but I more suppose that's due to sheer hype and an extremely dedicated early playerbase than anything. I'm excited to see more from the chads of classic when launch comes, because the mixed bag of dedicated and casual players really creates an awesome playerbase.
---
Will it be in classic?
---
Great list, thank you.
---
it can't be wrong, it's literally an actual client from back in the day that is working exactly as it did then. No differences.
---

---
Maybe this will help: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm0akw/please_help_me_get_excited_about_playing_horde/emstcpl/
---
This happened to me, but in reverse, on the 60 Quilboar tusk quest. I had about 40-50 tusk and my quest log was full, I thought I could just abandon the quest real quick so I could accept and complete another easy quest from an item in my inventory. I figured I could just re-accept the Quilboar tusk quest afterwards and just pick up where I left off. 
---
However, it deleted all my tusk when I abandon the quest which set me back a lot. I don't remember this happening in vanilla and I know it doesn't happen on pservers.
---
No, you're just wrong. [Patch 2.0.1](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1), "Before the Storm" is the TBC pre-patch.
---
2.0.0 doesn't exist, it never existed which is why you can't find patch notes for it.
---
I cant even get stat weights to work on classic wowhead
---
Other than ruining a lot of character progression and 7 seasons of build up, some characters not following the exact logic they acted on earlier in the episode, sure it was pretty and epic and some characters ended the way they should have but it objectively was poorly written compared to the previous seven season.
---
If it didn’t destroy every other precedent of the show i might be inclined to agree
---
I have started playing WoW Vanilla when i was 10 years old.
---
I'm European so most challenging part was the fact that i had zero English knowledge.
---
I remember calling my older brother every 5 minutes asking him translation of certain words until he told me to get/use a dictionary. 
---
Took me literally more than a year to get max level because i was incredibly busy pvp'ing everyone on sight.
---
BTW i learned English playing this game. Later on Cataclysm(if i remember correctly) i was leading 2.2k+ rating RBG groups on voice chat.
---
I'm incredibly excited to experience nostalgia of pure WoW with all the social interactions everywhere on the map!
---
Red ~~wedding~~ ending.
---
i didn't see any competition while stomping everyone with lvl 40 spriest, shit was so fun that i actually was doing this for 3+ days and didn't lvl further
---
It is also a bit misleading right now. Classic has the hype going and many streamers will jump on Classic if nothing else just to get views - it is literally money for them.
---
I won't get into an argument about whether Classic will be bigger than retail, but at least right now you can't judge anything simply because Classic is new and everyone wants to try a piece of it.
---
Ya this. Res will be seen as acceptable more often than not but being a PUG guild master will not.
---
thank you, but i should probably fix those stretched textures on top :P
---
This is the onky answer. Build your life around wow
---
This is the top post but when tipsout reports a boss for doing too much damage, the sub goes ballistic.
---
I am aware of this, the problem is not with the findings (I am not disputing the numbers) it is with the label as irrefutable proof, it is not because it is not a controlled environment.
---
There is demo roar, there are level differences, there are class differences and the unknown code in the background. 
---
Call it 'findings that show a disaprity' for all I care, or 'potential proof', but calling it 'irrefutable proof' is a showstopper when it comes to have a dialogue about it.
---
DING!
---
Pretty much. You get one noob doing analysis without comparing apples to apples and you get a mindless mob freaking out over nothing
---
stress test goes on until Thursday - they are just monitoring it during that time as its work hours for US (where the beta servers are located)
---
There was an exploit in scholomance at some point where you could get in craft an item or dissenchant one and get out right away and keep the mats and the item you crafted or dissenchanted. ( dont remember for sure how it was exactly achieved )  The day after it got fixed couple of my friends shared the info with one of our more casual mates . He had a mage half MC epix on him and half blues , he went in DE'd his entire gear in hopes of profit and getting one step closer to epix mount just to get out to a  realization that he lost it all ....
---
honestly if you want to reserve items just run with in game friends 
---
like pugging runs and reserving gear will take a lot longer if there are other people recruiting with no reserve
---
I won't be joining any groups that reserve items. Horrible concept by low-life human beings. Hopefully others will try to shame such crap.
---
I think they're referring to the old book called the WoW Bestiary, had all kinds of info on mobs in the game.  Probably can find a copy somewhere online (heck, you can probably find a scanned copy to download).  I'm a bit annoyed I don't have one yet, was trying to collect all the old guides even before Classic was announced as a thing, just because it's cool to look through them and see old strategies for dungeons and stuff.
---
That said, it's worth noting the numbers could be off, because the books were published at certain times, and patches would change abilities, damage and health numbers, all kinds of stuff.  Which means the guides aren't perfect for comparing specific numbers, they're better as just general guides.
---
Guys, im only stealing some digital artwork. Its like......pixels. Dont get upset. This logic is so scuffed man.
---
Not even vanilla, I'm pretty sure It was that way in wotlk as well.
---
Yeah, right - the pally on his vids rocks a 2h so he is literally incapable of reachign 60% phys mitigation at his level and that would have to be the case to get from 450 damage to 150.
---
I think you don't know what the armor does.
---
As long as you buff everyone that passes you, including mind controlling horde to buff them.
---
But a druid in the vid without a helmet in NE form is being hit by 66, no way he got 50% armor. So comparing your values to the videos shows mobs are doing at least 40% less dmg.
---
It really does. I used to camp Duskwood on my undead mage, and I have never felt bad about it. If it's red it's dead. And camped. Because fun is subjective.
---
Jeah im not arguing with you just pointing to a possible reason
---
And those pservers seems to be more accurate on this issue
---
it should be obtainable when naxxramas releases ^^
---
Yeah that is correct, though think bear form gives a flat hp bonus and heart of the wild gives an additional 20% stamina. And the potion swap should work as a free use of a game mechanics if your hp stays at the same percentage before and after swap. I don't know if this is actually the case or not but should be easy to test
---
Or practise your leveling routes for 3 months and rinse the gym chads in stv while your 60 on your epic mount ;)
---
Yesterday I killed Maggots Eye outside Brill, solo at level 8 without breaking a sweat. I'm sure that was next to impossible back in vanilla. I face tanked him as a priest and I had 85% hp by the time he died, without healing...
---
All right thanks for all answers another one do you have some tips how to get there fastest ?
---
Demo Roar rank 1, -30ap. That’s not it.
---
So what? WoW is complete crap as a competitive game. It tries to be one and fails miserably. There are much better games for that. Besides the World First race, which ends quickly, nothing is really interesting.
---
It WAS a masterpiece of a social game though, and that is what we are getting back and want.
---

Bah dum tssssssssss
---
There are definitely classic peggle addons.
---
&gt;Let people discuss what they want to.
---
ironic. You're shutting down a pretty damn valid conversation starter. By telling him to stop trying to shut conversation starters. Splitting up the population servers with addons and DLC has killed many a game over the last 15 years.
---
Yeah i'm also glad about being EU. What's up with this NA steamer adoration ? They're just regular guys. Never understood why you would want to follow them like a dog.
---
Stream yourself, create your own community, dont be a tool.
---
I feel for him. I hate kids too.
---
Question about number 5 - 
---
&gt; 5 - If you're going to run a dungeon, take initiative and run there while getting a group together so you're not waiting on someone for very long.
---
How is the person who's forming the group able to start journeying to the dungeon before it's full?  The only way to find group members that aren't on your friends list or in your guild is to ask in trade, right?
---
That was always the toughest part for me - "you're just hanging out in Feralas, what do you mean you can't run me through ZF for the 100th time?" 
---
"Bro I'm farming for raid, gimme an hour I can get on my alt"
---
Felt like I was only wanted for my Tier2 gear and carrying abilities sometimes... life of a raider :(
---
A man can hope. With the new client addon API, maybe someone will make peggle. Should be possible I think!
---
Exactly, no one is accounting for asmon having sick greens for his level due to people just trading him stuff.
---
Don't forget that we aren't getting the vanilla wow that most of us leveled in.. we're getting 1.12 which was much later.  Things like warrior 2h tanking leveling dungeons wasn't really all that rare in 1.12.. At least I remember some of my guild mates leveling warriors trying it out.
---
I actually don't quite understand it. Like, I have nothing directly against the dude, but no idea why he became that big. I keep getting video recommendations of him reacting to Bellular. I tried to watch one and it was just half an hour of Asmongold nodding and agreeing with everything (obviously, because Bellular buts a lot of work into his videos and Asmongold is just sitting there randomly reacting).
---
It just seems like a cheap way to get views, reacting to content other people spend really long time making and then you just sit there talking randomly over it and grab views.
---
I don't know how his streams are otherwise, maybe they are fun - I might just be biased because I think the reaction video spree is a bit of a douche move.
---
I know I've seen it, but it's a lot of gameplay to go through, so I'm still looking.
---
But on the other hand, it's just as likely that someone has footage of you know, not being able to sheep others mobs.
---
My second wallpaper has more Horde.
---
Just wondering, does anyone think there is a realistic chance of us EU plebs getting into the beta (while having a 2005 account), during the stress tests or otherwise? I am aware of the fact that the servers are based in the California headquarters exclusively, but I have seen EU streamers getting messages from fans (french) in game, so I guess there might be a small chance.
---
\&gt; EDIT : wanted to add this in: I almost cried when he sold some of his  trash items and realized he could afford the white vendor gear in the  starting area. he literally went "I'm rich! I can buy all of it" and  then proceeded to count how much his total armor increased by every  white item he put on. He was absolutely ecstatic!   
---
Well, I always buy the first white 2H weapon as a warrior. It's such a boost :D
---
Rank 1 gives 4 damage reduction, 2 is 7, 3 is 11.
---
3 is learned at 24, 4 is learned at 34, so 3 is as high as anyone on the beta gets.
---
11 damage doesn't explain 30 damage gaps. It does explain durotar tiger stuff tho, with joana.
---
As far as I know this won't break sap/poly.   
---
At least not in Vanilla. I remember people using Havoc (during Cata) to kill people this way.   
---
They'd cast Havoc on the opponent and /forfeit just before the killing blow. Then they'd attack a nearby mob and actually kill the opponent (out of duel) because of Havoc.   
---
I might be wrong though (not about the Havoc thing, that happened for sure, and might still be possible, I have no idea, haven't touched retail in years).
---
Is it worth it to do this? Or if I'm trying to just get level faster is it best to stay in the NE zone?
---
The trek is quite a time investment
---
Immortality, damn you were an absolute hardcore raider. I remember the old website, was one of the best looking guild sites back then. Weren't you guys first / super early on Thunderfury?
---
As I said above, 2.0.1 is the patch that was carried out on the TBC discs. However 2.0.0 was the actual pre patch that was applied to the Vanilla realms before that.
---
http://mmorpgexposed.com/worldofwarcraft/42/wow-patch-200-before-the-storm
---
I always play tank and never would i think about ml there. Same as id never ever join a group whod use that
---
&gt;but they might keep them together to get WoW as high as possible
---
Why would they want that anyway? I mean sure, if Blizzard owned Twitch, but they don't. What benefit would Twitch really get from it?
---
100% for the warlock, mage will be oom with costly aoe spells. Tank pulls big mob groups and the warlock can dot everything. VW off tank and fear makes up for loss of sheep cc
---
Exdee
---
It is not, do you know the talents of the druid?
---
Elitist Jerks priest theorycrafting forum brought me so much. Didn't know they were toxic on live.
---
Ok, so you say night elf for increased dodge for tanking, and that  sword skill has nothing to do with  threat. Ok then, I'll leave this conversation right now.
---
Yep, warrior definitely does have a harder time than some other classes leveling at certain points, but the difficulty has almost certainly been overstated heavily due to how they are on private servers
---
It was good I enjoyed it, I'm definitely confused about a few things though.
---
Warrior, Rogue, Pally
---
I’ve explained why level differences don’t account for it, since that doesn’t affect a hit’s damage after it lands on its own. Same with class. It’s not an unknowable thing.
---
I think it’s fair to say “irrefutable” is a stretch.
---
Can sort of guarantee who's going to get the first set of Bindings... for example..
---
Mage/lock, druid/priest, rogue/warrior
---
Any mix of that and you'll be fine. But shoot 3 of you? Should roll on a PVP server since you'll have a tab more fun.
---
I don't agree. Bronn made no sense at all.
---
&gt;and that would have to be the case to get from 450 damage to 150.
---
Like I said, I'm not saying classic CB is accurate. I'm just saying that if you don't account armor then it's kinda pointless.
---
I replica of the Dark Portal with a transparent OLED which could show the shimmer and dramatic effects as the portal event horizon spins. Would be awesome!
---
Sans plot holes

---
Exactly but threads with the title "Elite damage is way off  (Evidence)" only seek to rile up the community. 
---
There is evidence for and against it being wrong and good feedback has triggered the resolution of one bug, but using sources like classicDB does not help. Find actual comparisons, screenshots of videos otherwise what good is the feeback? Its like reviewing an iphone based of a chinese knockoff, close, but nothing you say will be 100% right.
---
First, I won't be doing a dungeon with a tank using masterloot except if he has a very good reason like he said during the recruitment that it's a reserved run or smthg.
---
Second, if I run a dungeon it's to get an upgrade. If a piece of gear drops and it's a small increase for me and a big increase for another, it's my choice to decide if I want to roll on it or not, not yours. Generally if the other player did well in the dungeon and was nice I'll let it to him but by no mean will I let the tank, or anyone else for the matter, decides for me. If you do so, you're the ninja.
---
Heads up, my post just got removed for talking about the future of WoW, not allowed
---
There's still going to be raid logs though.  People will be able to easily look you up and see how garbage you are.. sorry man, I feel your pain!
---
PVE SERVER LOL
---
ALLIANCE LOL
---
CUCKOLD LOL
---
Possible that there is a bugged interaction with mark of the wild? It shouldnt be providing anywhere near this much reduction at low ranks but I have seen similar instances of druids taking very little damage on streams.
---
We can only hope!
---
That’s a pserver rule.
---
They are indeed twinked beyond what should be possible and that is also due to 30 level cap (normally if they had the gear they do and with how they acquired it they would easily be around level 35 yet and there would be no discussion as to why they're mitigating as much damage as they do).
---
Having said that I still believe the elite damage is somewhat off but I'm leaning towards believing that there are some mitigation errors which were already proved to be the case with a Stoneskin Totem earlier.
---
I definitely remember people tanking low level dungeons with two handers in Vanilla but I don't remember it being a breeze. My memory can fail me here of course.
---
Well, the streamers that interact a lot are usually those trying to profit from it. Especially those big enough to make a living out of it does that by being active with the community, since no one wants to donate or sub to a guy that ignores the chat (then you could just as well watch a youtube video, after all). The interaction is what makes the live aspect appealing to a lot of people.
---
With all that being said, it does somewhat tell you what to look for - smaller channels. Avoid big streamers and look through the less viewed until you find one that you like.
---
it was all based on server population since u battled against everyone on your server. for some people you could grind 15 hours a day and not get it, other servers you could play a few hours a day and get it. the highest i got was field marshall but i played bgs for around 8 hours a day on a medium pop server
---
Plenty of people min-max and get more enjoyment out of it. It can be fun to plan something out and then go through with it.
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
it’s not favored to old accounts, besides streamers it’s 100% RNG
---
Me too. I feel ya.
---
Okay, thanks for clarifying
---
An addon that you could set a level range and have it whisper all the warriors in that level range "Hey want to tank SM cath?  We have a group and can summon" would be great tbh
---
Further to that, I just made a post asking opinions for the future of classic and was shut down instantly, mods even removed the post.
---
Straight pug? no. If I've played with the master looter before then yeah sure.
---
Actually I think the culture clash will be in *their* favor - and not our's.  There will be a significant amount more new people than vets, especially at first.  So if we don't/can't guide the culture of the game against things like ninja looting then guess what, it'll be a mainstay problem in the game and it'll end up frustrating the vets and the vets will all end up quitting, leaving a culture on Classic that's very similar to the one on Current.  
---
Additionally, if people think it's okay to ninja in low level dungeons with the excuse of "you won't be wearing this at 60 anyways" then it goes to reason that that same people will also ninja at like... fucking level 57, or some shit.  
---
You have to stop it as soon as you see it, every time.
---
I reckon for the stress tests they're going to be prioritising people with active subs to make sure people actually log in, but for the beta so far they have prioritised original vanilla accounts mostly from 2004 in NA, and i have seen some 2005 EU accounts say they have gotten in. But i have no idea what the split is between the 2 regions, does seem to be mostly favouring NA accounts so far.
---
Call me crazy but if there is evidence and in fact what you are saying is correct, then Blizzard will fix it. I do have confidence in the Classic team. They want it just as much as we do. It's honestly just super tough to tell without having the back end data like Blizzard would. They would know if it was off or not and so far they haven't said anything. Here's to hoping it gets squared away.
---
That is disingenuous. The OP partook in a logical fallacy. Legend that should be met with a genuine response is either unintentionally uninformed or intentionally misleading.
---
Most people uploaded to google videos back then, not youtube. Google videos was shut down a few years ago.
---
No offense, but who are you to decide the fate of every role in the group? 
---
People are not entitled to roll because they would benefit the most, they're entitled to roll because they are in the group and the item is an upgrade at all. 
---
I wouldn't join. I would see you as a control freak. Plus its not a raid so who cares?
---
No thread on the subject has accounted for armour - they all take raw values and say "armour cant possibly account for X reduction". The paladin in the video was not wearing a shield, he could not have reached 60% + mitigation.
---
In a way, this is what happened to retail - listening to the minority has sorta ruined the game.
---
Evidence? Most people have left by now.
---
Have him play a Warrior, your "wife" play a DPS, and you play Paladin and just continue to give them your blessings.
---
Jokes on you I haven't liked the show since Season 4.
---
I don't think it is, i played only in TBC but I am almost sure this was a thing back then
---
those hypebeast streamers need it more than you
---
No joke. One of the most infamous WoW stories.
---
You're absolutely right, I forgot about demoralising roar
---
Most cuck thing to do is to play Paladin and just bless them while you watch them go hard at the grind
---
They confirmed armour some armour buffs persist permanently. The example given was Stoneskin Totem. It may be possible other buffs have the same issue.
---
Thx for the info! 👍
---
Beta is the perfect time to be stirring this pot. Let the community try to make addons that break the game. It's better to get this sorted now than after launch.
---
Maybe with paladins it was their only role but in horde I remember druids playing a very significant role. Our MT always wanted the druid class officer to heal him too because of their insane healing on time effects. Both regrowth and rejuvenation were bliss as a mage, you never felt in danger anymore as soon as you got any of these heals. I remember druids mostly raid heal however and we stacked a lot in BWL for combat res and whatnot while the raid people learnt how not to die to flaming stacks, etc. I loved the droods as a mage, they were broz.
---
you should roll a mage and pick whichever race you want. subjectively, i think alliance has better looking zones. i love undead but they start in a very dreary environment and the next popular zone, the barrens, is exactly that. i suggest mages because they are easy to level and gain access to teleport to different zones at a higher level which makes transportation easier and quicker, rather than having to find a boat/zepplin to get around quickly
---
I hate casuals, they ruins retail and I will do everything I can to make their time miserable in vanilla.
---
No - i would leave the group
---
How anyone knows on what channel to listen for that uncracable code? Didn't you say it is no random channel?
---
Agreed, it's worse when it's said as a general thing (when it isn't)
---
For OP and anyone else considering using ClassicDB as a reference for damage values (or drop rates, or quest experience, or anything at all, really) - 
---
**ClassicDB is not a vanilla reference.**  ClassicDB is formerly the vanillagaming.org database from a long-dead private server that was notoriously incorrect on basically everything.  You can verify this by looking at any of its quest experience values (wildly incorrect) or, for example, see how they list the crusader recipe dropping from a Tyr's Hand mob, when it only ever dropped at the WPL tower.
---
The Allakhazam comment is more interesting, but is still only a _single comment_. Its poster could have been exaggerating or be referring to a crit, e.g., and it would need more information/evidence to even be considered a valid datapoint...
---
The Bradygames Bestiary from TBC lists Rhahk'zor's damage range at 119-158 (with his slam doing 64-86).  It lists Skeletal Miner as doing 25-35 (with strike doing wpn dmg + 29-30).  With tanks having roughly 35-40% mitigation at this level, these bestiary damage ranges are within the null hypothesis for what we are seeing in the beta videos, _sans-demo shout/roar_.
---
The more interesting question might be how is demo shout/roar supposed to affect mobs at this level and how is it working on the beta?
---
Name change is not important....
---
I cant imagine the sound of all those streamers talking at the same time :D
---
Lol can’t wait to camp him at RR when his bubble is only 6s.
---
i have literally tanked all dungeons in a private server as a paladin.
---
i am fully aware that they were by and large buffbots and healers, but  saying thats the case and so they are not tanks, is just untrue.
---
The drinking after a couple packs sucks, but its completely doable, and actually not bad. 
---
Yes they became more popular in tbc, but that doesn't mean they couldn't in vanilla, just that people hated all hybrids and made them all heal in vanilla.
---
Yeah me too haha

She gets to bang a hot Chad
---
I get to pine over streamers while I toss money at them
---
These two things seem of equal value
---
Oh it already started, a thread about mobs low damage on mmo champion for example reached 20 pages of retail players shitting on classic because it was easy (and all of them said as evidence that they played vanilla and tanked boss 10lvl higher than them with a war without a shield). Quite sad to watch.
---
Honestly my favourite streamer ever. I would happily give my prime to him if he would stream at least once or twice per month.
---
Its the long con until your character dies and comes back in deathknell.
---
90% of these streamers will actually leave the game, Classic will bring a new gen of hardcore players. When the beta hype will be gone, they will mostly switch to the next big thing, gotta keep these subs active when you live from the income.
---
Watching classic isnt exactly the most funny thing long term, and playing it requires resilience. If you cross these two factors, you can already guess that most "big streamers" will leave.
---
Less than have of the classes have access to a reliable stun through talents. Without talents even less. 25% to resist a stun is nice but its still a gamble for something thats not as common as you and many others make it seem like. Warstomp is very much underrated as a shaman in pvp. Esp elemental.
---
You're ridiculous. You just brought up OP's point while at the same time claiming you're disagreeing with them.
---
The post above was literally made to say that classicdb is a bad source and should not be used as such - look up other posts appearing in /new, people compare values in classic beta directly to what's in classicdb. If you don't think classicdb is a good source then you are not the person OP was trying to address.

benediction: 12/06/17
---
nice account purchase there m8 lol
---
As someone for this model, lets stfu about it until the game actually becomes stale. Until then lets just enjoy it for what it is
---
Private servers are an unrealizable reference. I have no idea why people even bring them up.
---
Amazing. 
---
Would it be possible to make one like this where the picture on the upper left was exchanged for something with smaller characters? Maybe Westfall for a yellow-red-green-blue theme around the edges? Just a thought. It looks great regardless.
---
Hey you found the picture why I'm staying to play dps-only classes
---
So, you don't have proof every elite is functioning correctly, just those examples?
---
You’re a casual.
---
I mostly agree, but aoe threat gen is really nice. T-clap was limited to 4 targets. Swipe to 3. Consecration was really nice for the "small health pool mob" huge aoe pulls amid the dungeons.
---
You also bring tons of utility. It's not for everyone, but it definitely wasn't terrible.
---
The gear you get from a five man usually wouldn't be worth worrying about as far as a ninja is concerned. I would also say I've never seen anyone run a five man using master loot.
---
"Horrible concept by low-life human beings."
---
A very reasonable reaction to a minor thing.
---
I reckon a big chunk of EU kids like you and I first learned English because of wow.
---
I remember I even had a private tutor the summer before I started playing; couldn't be arsed. Soon as I got a wow sub, I started making progress lmao.
---
I still don't know if I won't play on english server just to be paired with more people than on french servs.  
---
Might be a good idea. On retail, for a long time, english servers were the place to be if you were a top PVP player. And kind of too for PVE even though there were some top guilds in other countries too.  
---
Your comment made me think of that, I'll have to chose carefully.
---
There are going to be guilds that run at different times throughout the day and different days of the week. Some may run 3 days, some 2, some 1. There will be shit ton of guilds, you will be find one that you can fit the runs into your schedule. WoW isn't and was never that hardcore that you HAVE to alter your life around it.
---
OOF , if they did this on purpose it is legit reason for ending a friendship
---
I've seen and personally experienced some really epic last-moment boat catches. I guess I'm just desensitized, but this seemed like a not-that-close of a call jump.
---
I think there was a really amazing one by StaySafe the other day, can't find the clip now, but *that* was honestly impressive.
---
Hurrah!
---
This one is amazing
---
dont make me get my main bro  :P   lol
---
https://youtu.be/mHJe2HpX3g4?t=238 
---
He tanks several level appropiate mobs with a 2h without dropping too much in hp - bu there are so many confounding factors we cant take this as being correct either.
---
Same account since vanilla feb 2005, every expac bought , every blizz game owned, achievements also show I played vanilla to wrath mostly. Active account. No invite. Whatever. Can optimize my run on p servers but it’s disappointing for sure.
---
The way you describe, no, it will absolutely not be accepted. You have zero right to decide who needs or deserves an item more than someone else.
---
Are you telling me Blizzard employees, who have notoriously done nought but fuck up and drive away every competent passionate employee for the last half a decade, are infallible? 
---
And no, it is not an actual client and server from back in the day working exactly as it did then.
---
Best bet is to submit this to Blizzard and let them verify it.
---
&lt; sad european noises &gt;
---
Good luck on your ventures lol
---
In that case the boss was doing correct damage though.
---
Horde scum. /spit
---
Looking at Sneed's Shredder, the damage the naked rogue takes are: 90, 98, 95, 108. Average mitigated: 98, average unmitigated: 111 (12% DR)
---
The druid takes: 71, 72, 63, 70, 77, 65, 68 (demo roar goes up at this point so I stopped counting). Average mitigated: 69, average unmitigated: 118 (42% DR). No issues here.
---
I think you are right. A lot of people remember doing this, but not exactly when. I never played a Pserver, so I know I was able to grief people with this at some point on the live servers. It would make sense if it was allowed early on and then changed, thus explaining why people remember it one way or the other.
---
you act like because they didnt have internal data its all wrong. 
---
pservers have the numbers better than actual beta right now. give credit where it's due
---
Report everything, bug or not.
---
All you have to do is pay the one month sub to be included in the beta pool. All you need is a starter account and the sub.
---
Ha ha.... friends...ha
---
“Spends his time fishing or on bank roof”
---
I have no idea what he means 👀
---
Legion was decent. Just stop changing meta every month/season and it would’ve been fine.
---
This will be a challenge for sure.
---
Thank you Im doing it now haha
---
We know, but...
---
LET ME IIIIIN !
---
I'm a small streamer and actually just want to play the game with my old friends with a new look, since I dont want to compete anymore, just run stuff and have fun. At 30+ (the age you have if you played Vanilla), It's sad if you care about playing with some Internet celebrity.
---
&gt;And no, it is not an actual client and server from back in the day working exactly as it did then.
---
it literally is, they've said it is. unless your argument is that they're just straight up lying about shit
---
Are you sure?
---
All you talk about is e-celebs and influencers
---
Sure, just make that up front before the Dungeon even starts. “BTW, I’m rolling on Truestrike Shoulder” is a perfectly acceptable thing to say when a Rogue joins the group.
---
I don't see why not as long as you specify it will be ML and whatever rules on loot when 'LFM' - This way anyone who would potentially have an issue with it will not want to join. This will mean taking longer to set up groups.
---
The far more clever way of doing it, is to just not invite classes who could potentially roll on any gear you may want...
---
Don't bring hunters &amp; shamans to SM Armory runs
---
Don't bring rogue's or hunters to Princess runs
---
Don't bring paladins at all (helps if you roll Horde)
---
Yep. Where there is a will, there is a way.
---
Some LFG option will exist, either an in-game addon, an external website, or a discord server. Out of the three, I'd rather it be an addon.
---
How essential are soul shards for locks in PvP. If you get caught out in the open world and you happen to not have any are you totally screwed?
---
Or just wait 3 months, properly prepare for classic and screw the beta? Yep, sounds way more reasonable to me than this absolutely overhyped beta trara
---
cool ,thank you
---
Point is: If tagged, it's the players own fault... If the mobs are aggroed by group mechanic or while to close, sheep right away. 😊
---
Can't wait to PoM Pyro Horde and do the Gnome laugh and dance on their corpse's. Getting blown up by a Gnome is the biggest L.
---
Stoneskin totem isn't an armor buff though, it's a flat damage reduction. The only similar mechanic that comes to mind is Blessing of Sanctuary for alliance, which has a level requirement of 30 in a niche spec
---
ur retarded. the achievement didn't even come out until legion. this account doesn't even have a character past 85 fool. cataclysm is the last expac i bought
---
Wtf is that guy a wow streamer even, he looks and acts like these pauls
---
I agree, I don't think the level matters but that is irrelevant because when you talk about 'irrefutable proof' you need to eliminate that discrepancy, if you can't eliminate it then you will have to reword it into something a little bit less absolute.
---
Your wording;
---
&gt;Respectful critique of your critique: The level 60 is the one being hit harder. The level difference shouldn’t matter.  
---
Shows the uncertainty in that variable (shouldn't vs. doesn't), we all agree it probably does not and should not but we can't with 100% certainty say does not.
---
So although it appears to a lot people seem to think that I have issues with the numbers I do not and encourage these type of efforts for purpose of information finding and fixing of potential discrepancies between Classic and Vanilla, I do however have a problem with labeling as 'irrefutable' but I think we both agree on that part as well.
---
Ive been reading through it in prep for classic and found this dark portal arkwork. Anybody know who that is supposed to be or if its just some placeholder art they put out before they knew what they where going to do with the dark portal.
---
No you ovbiously did lol, The buffs outclass both, and been backed up by legacy data for years... Shammy totems can be removed by any damange, so any class... thats way worse than just 1 calss being able to remove them... did you even think before you wrote that?
---
At least I maximize my time investment am better than 95% of other players. 
---
I actually played vanilla when I was in high school, and have been playing since.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI8q\_wcSzhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI8q_wcSzhM) 
---
Ferhago was my idle back then after seeing this video.
---
Yeah I know! I played vanilla pretty much since release, my issue was more that I am now a "filthy casual" because well adult life sucks xD! So I didn't want to reach 60 that will take me quite some time to begin with, only to find out that I should have gone Priest again so I could  have an easier time finding a guild.
---
Either way I guess I am going Druid regardless of all that...
---
Btw, why do you think Druid will be the least played class?
---
Good fucking thing you did read the reply ... oh wait. /ignore.
---
I think TrinityCore is the only private server that even has the correct damage formula for mobs, and even they have only gotten it relatively recently. And TrinityCore is a WotLK emulator.
---
Hi thanks for the hard work you've been doing. I have a few questions.  
---
I noticed that for tanks, Cloak of Warding is listed in phase 1 but the recipe to craft it comes from Dire Maul, which won't be released until phase 2.  
---
I'm also planning ahead our legendaries with the officers in my soon to be classic guild. I don't see Sulfuras mentioned anywhere in the gear list, is it not viable? I seem to remember 2h Fury being a thing in classic.  
---
I'm also having the same issues as some other people in this thread, I can't seem to click the class avatar image on top of the gear lists to view more alternatives. I'm on google chrome atm.
---
Tell that the Rank 14 people which will be plenty this time around.
---
Jokes aside, you are right, if you want to accomplish realistic goals you will not have to build you life around wow
---
can share the general strategy you're using? 1-10 in 30 minutes sounds very impressive.
---
The North remembers.
---
no more fucking elves, they already killed the horde on retail
---
Ya there was this little shit horde troll hunter in the abbey yesterday named Wind who controlled a lv 1 wolf and got noobs to flag themselves and murdered them. I watched it over and over and over. I sees you man. I sees you.
---
i don't want to reserve items per se, it's just about figuring out who needs what before we go. if 2 people or more need an item they will still roll on it. 
---
As for being the Pug GM, i would just make sure nobody is ninjaing or rolling for an offspec stat stick over someone who actually needs that thing.
---
I quit my job to practice my 1-60 routes on all my planned characters. Get on my level, you need BIG dick NEET energy to be get the most out of this game.
---
Jk I never had a job
---
Hour and 30
---
This isn't evidence of classic damage being "way off", this just half arsed proves that the classicdb damage is inaccurate.
---
Let's see how tough you are when you are getting blown up by a 3 foot Gnome. I mean, what kind of faction loses to Gnomes? Horde - thats who.
---
not a chance someone would watch random guy's impression for 50!? minutes
---
Yes it is reasonable
---
You look jelly as fuck, haha.
---
and that's a good thing
---
This is vitally important because a general statement can be dismissed, specific instances with proof cant be.
---
That's great. What are your testing credentials? I was a professional QA tester for Activision for about a year and I wasn't invited. OH NO!
---
August will be here in no time, friend. Hang in there!
---
That picture is basically the "Why wasn't I invited to the beta?" starter pack.
---
Reading is hard. Still impressive!
---
I think everything else is out. No name change, race change, faction change, model change, etc.
---
I think it's just realm transfer.
---
It's a good story, but WoW wasn't out in 1999 it was out in 2004/2005!
---
Aw, I'm sorry I said some bad words about your shepherd.
---
&gt;The far more clever way of doing it, is to just not invite classes who could potentially roll on any gear you may want...
---
Yeah, not going at all or waiting 3x as long forming a group is much better. God forbid someone might roll on a item that wont drop anyways.
---
What Blizzard needs to do is run that 1.12 client of theirs and check things out. 
---
From what I saw so far, solo content seems to be done well but when we get to group content, it's completely untested. If it's left like this then well, we will get retail dungeons where everything is pulled and AOE without any need to communicate with other players or form strategies.
---
&gt; i have literally tanked all dungeons in a private server
---
I was talking about commercial release
---
&gt; but saying thats the case and so they are not tanks, is just untrue.
---
Oh I am aware that it is possible to tank some content as a paladin, my meaning was that, in 99% of cases, paladins were only accepted as healers.
---
I guess we'll just have to keep our fingers crossed then, hopefully as the beta progresses and server capacities are pushed to their limits more and more accounts from EU will be flagged.
---
Listening to Jack Johnson's "Banana Pancakes"  while questing on my level 38 Shaman in STV... its a thick nostalgia memory for me.
---
Very little bwl gear for sure.
---
Thats kind that whole point of the thread - that we cant know by using classicDB data if the damage is too low or high - no where do i say that damage is too low.
---
#$* merde, scheisse, vaffanculo satan perkele
---
The problem is sharding again, in vanilla you have no escape from your enemies and have to fight them, in bfa you can just shard out and avoid them
---
Thank you for the suggestion. Will see, needs research.
---
2.0.1 was the prepatch. It was included on the disks, yes, but it wasn't what increased the level cap or opened up Outlands. 2.0.3 is the actual first TBC patch, but even that didn't actually immediately open the portal, it just started the opening event for it. The actual dark portal opening happened a few days after the patch.
---
Thats so annoying when You do those emissaries and never get what you need...
---
I see what you did there 😂
---
This ladies and gentlemen is called “denial”.
---
Spend an inordinate time complainig about the other under both?
---
Ty, I don’t watch tv so I miss out on things.
---
I know this is supposed to be some low IQ bait but as someone who raided resto from the very start of mc all the way to killing KT I can confidently say that a good resto is at the very least on par if not better than a holy priest when it comes to healing. Innervate is good but druids also bring :
---
* The best consistent reactive healing in the game : swiftmend every 15 sec and NSHT every 3 min both instant and both amazing at saving people during spikes especially melee dps eating cleaves.
---
* The absolute best balls to the wall healing output with the crit natures grace regrowth build giving you 80% chance to crit with regrowth on a below GCD 1.4 sec cast time.
---
* Hibernate for BWL and other beast trash.
---
* Battleres.
---
* MoTW.
---
* Abolish poison, a naxx boss even revolves around it being up during stun phase.
---
* Decurse, relevant in every raid phase.
---
On top of just being very good healers. Every good raid must have at least one good resto druid, ideally 2.
---
What about this Soda fight when he was soling a boss at 30? Is this how vanilla worked? https://streamable.com/erqbx
---
Same thing for warlocks in raids, what is my purpose?
---
You cast shadow bolt
---
So... EvE then lol
---
From what I remember the early raid spec was something like 46 points in resto, but once you had some gear you had a little more flexibility. Our druid was always specced for PvP while raiding in BWL, which was some weird like 15/15/21 or something ridiculous like that from what I remember.
---
I didn't main druid though, I mained a Shaman, so this is all based on memories of our healerchat.
---
Also check YouTube for your class race combo and there’s likely a 1-10 vanilla speedrun demonstration for it. Its about planning and knowing how to walk to certain groups of quests at the right time and how to properly max range enemies if you can and playing it safe to never die. Will help you a lot. Joanas guide is great for quest batching efficiency because it’s hard to memorize that for every zone to 60 . Biggest tip is play safe and avoid stupid deaths and always grab instance quests in major cities when it’s convenient , avoid unnecessary continent hopping if you can .
---
I was legit jealous as fuck, he earned it though.
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOO. 
---
Lol Ric Flair!
---
we need a PSA for being a decent human being? what is the world coming to these days
---
I hope we get Kara with Crypts. I dont care if its added to BC or Classic+ I just want some Crypts.
---
Though I'd prefer Classic+
---
do you understand the difference between proving that classicdb is inaccurate and proving that classic is accurate?
---
If you're only trying to prove classicdb is wrong you shouldn't have titled your thread "classic damage is not way off"
---
Noiiiice, saving this for the summer
---
I'm not saying that people who got in have any testing credentials, but I definnitely would prefer to see people who at least understand that's the purpose of beta get in than people who are just trying to optimize their personal speedrunning strategy.
---
Dude dafuq. You trade watchinflg porn for letting your wife lose.
---
Ah well no judgement here. If you 3 are happy so an I.
---
The WoW community isn't nearly as cool as the OSRS community though. Retail boys would probably sabotage it too. I'd be ok with them just expanding wow and trying to keep the feel of the original game but make the choices themselves and not screw it up this time.
---
I'm spending these months practicing my 1-60 routes so i can be the very best. I dont need to deadlift 3 plates, I just need to be able to carry noobs through MC lol
---
Don’t take yourself too serious and see the race choice as a joke. Go all out with female + pink pigtails... embrace it
---
Sysadmins are the IT world's janitors.
---
Vanilla player and yes Ill play with them or look up on Firefox if im stuck. It depends about what you care about. I'm more into gameplay/theorycrafting and pure grinding than searching for the right stuff at the right spot.
---
To each its own.

&gt; you only produced one example in the old days. It's far far w

Hi fellow  Sporeggar-EU  player :)

- [/r/wow] [xpost from \/r\/classicwow Don't ninja items from your friends - streamers are giving a bad example!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bra8wq/xpost_from_rclassicwow_dont_ninja_items_from_your/)
---
Isn’t it 2-4 pm PDT, so 10 pm to midnight GB and 11 pm-1am other European countries?
---
&gt; Novelty characters e.g dress up a level 30 like a guard and go and “live” in Stromguard keep and fight levellers 
---
That sounds so freaking amazing.
---
Damn
---
In the post he even mentions the fact that some of the ninjaing is for fun/jokes. The intention doesn’t make it any better if you’re taking items you don’t need from players who can really benefit.
---
There should be guidelines about clips, but no straight ban.
---
Totem stomping macros were huge, Hunter pets often just became a vehicle for running around and sniping totems. And it's easy to say that everyone should "git gud" and just target totems to snipe them, totem stomping macros used to automate the process by just putting them in front your pet attack macro. Especially considering that the general player base is going to be better this time around, I don't think it's far fetched to believe this will either make shaman's better or worse depending on whether these macros are allowed.
---
No I meant as in the clip was staged to make funny content. I even think he traded the cloak afterwards
---
I resubbed to see if I could get a key.
---
\- My account is an original Vanilla account with characters still there from then - Jan 2005
---
\- Didn't resub til after beta invites went out
---
\- Sub was inactive previously for about 9 months
---
\-  Yes I played Vanilla heavily from MC to Naxx 40
---
I am not expecting a beta invite after already missing the original invites. Who knows, maybe I will get a pleasant surprise.
---
I disagree entirely that it's a minor thing. Reserving items are done by morons, solely.
---
Yes it is..
---
Good for you, make your own groups and use whatever rules you want.
---
If you play a tank, you got leverage, and people will join regardless if you reserve anything or not.
---
You would be stupid not to reserve an item then.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1FuMa3OyiM this video is from June 19th 2006, which is the launch day of Patch 1.11 (so it could be recorded in 1.10 too), and the mobs in it are dealing the same amount of damage as SFK mobs are dealing in the beta.
---
OP failed to mention the mailbox strippers.
---
I thought it was on there! I'll get it added.
---
June 2006
---
The first few bosses in Naxx are very easy. Naxx Construct is actually difficult and not pugable on Pservers. It would be a shame if it will be in Classic.
---
Yes they were posted above
---
I think he's a little angry since he wiped in there like 10 times yesterday and finally had to log off.
---
omegalul, seems out of context though
---
Bow! Bow before your guild master you shits!
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding how damage reduction from armor works I think your math is wrong. My understanding is that it's a percentage reduction in the damage received.
---
If you're hit for 79 with 41.6% mitigated by armor then the unmitigated damage would be 79 / (1 - 41.6%) = 135. You're calculating 79 * (1 + 41.6%) = 112.
---
Using that formula I get average unmitigated damage of 126 from the Vanilla video and 124 from the Beta video. It seems likely that this is well within the margin of error given that one of the samples is six swings.
---
WoW ... AMAAAAAAAZING Streamer ....
---
Wow thats rude. So because i found the quality of the series to diminish over the last seasons with the climax of crap in season 8 im somehow just listening to other people?  I dont care what others say about it, this is how i feel after watching all 8 seasons of this.
---
Blizzard are of course, absolutely liars. They've demonstrably lied about several things up to this point. What I'm asserting however, is that they might *believe* they have it functioning fully, when in reality something has been fucked up in the process of restoring it. Likely, they have post-WoTLK nerf values, not actual Vanilla values.
---
Just pick a good name from the start
---
Might seem pedantic but... 
---
Does the stun interrupt casts?
---
I'm not sure if it counts, but I used to sneak into the opposing faction starter area on a rogue with engineering and get new players to hit my explosive sheep.
---
Do you have to log out of the launcher or did it suddenly appear in your selection while logged in?
---
Only speculation ofc but many spell effects do the same dmg as 4-5 auto attacks from an elite mob. like auto attack for 25 and spell hit for 125. It might just be the way it was or something might be wrong with armor or attack power calculation.
---
Top kek
---
Played from late BC until recently .. cant get an Invite cuz I dont enjoy BFA sad
---
Never had to wait to skin a mob on retail like I do pservers.
---
Opinions? Report it, nothing else really to talk about.
---
It's just a faster way of saying "no more [class]."
---
You want Ironfoe in BRD? Do you reserve it or do you keep telling warriors and rogues to shoo until you find  a class that can't use it?
---
You seem to be lacking a bit of perspective. Low-life humans and morons by making everyone's life a bit easier? Rough.
---
Thinking about it, the best place for horde vs alliance to meet would probably be the bridge between Duskwood and Stranglethorn Vale. No mobs at that bridge, its sadly close to Rebel Camp but that shouldn't be a problem at all. In addition the NPCs up at the crossroad to the north in duskwood don't attack Horde, so you'll only have to worry about the level 20 wolves.
---
Did you people even read the description? Jebaited hard
---
You do realize that once you hit 60 your pre-bis will be better right? You do realize once you start raiding raid gear will be better right? You do realize once vanilla is over with your gear won’t matter right? Under your logic what’s the point of even playing the game if Blizzard is eventually going to shut the servers down? They still might be using a blue cloak from a dungeon for the next 2-3 months over the course of beta, just because it’s going to be deleted eventually shouldn’t matter.
---
&gt;Keep reporting anything that doesn't seem right
---
He reported something that didn't seem right. There's no harm in it.
---
&gt;Likely, they have post-WoTLK nerf values, not actual Vanilla values.
---
No, because they've checked the 1.12 reference client. There is no possibility that their 1.12 reference client has post wotlk values.
---
One time in one SM run, an epic BoE dropped and I won it on a greed roll. I don't remember what it was but I was so excited at the idea of being rich after selling it on the AH. The warrior tank named Mario told me to equip it because it was actually really good for warriors and if I wanted to I could sell it later. I didn't really know about soulbound stuff as this was probably the first BoE I had ever gotten that I wanted to sell on the AH.
---
Well...obviously it became soulbound and I was literally crushed, near tears (I was about 13 or so) that I wasn't going to be rich and that I would never be able to afford a mount. To this day I remember that run pretty clearly and I'll never forget that stupid motherfucker named Mario. Fuck you, Mario.
---
This is the real answer. People ganking lowbies are rarely having fun with it, mostly it is trying to bait the 60s that will come to the defense.
---
You actually need to kill 5000 gnolls, not 500.
---
Try again, once Classic is out.
---
[cant wait to go back to the 'core](https://i.imgur.com/upRG8nL.jpg)
---
Rogue should know it’s fair game for the hunter.... it’s vanilla and this is common knowledge
---
&gt;Some guys just have got it figured all out and have practiced this for years on end.
---
That, plus the fact that there's actual money to be made from streaming World First Classic Rag kill. Back then you couldn't make a living off streaming WoW. A mortgage = tons of motivation!
---
Nah no thanks fam, lots of people hated AV at launch and asked Blizzard to change it with good reason.
---
Maybe if that thread didn't pop 30 times a day, it wouldn't have been removed.
---
i believe its active subs in the US
---
If its for the run in general, probably not.  If you're reserving a specific item off of one boss, you might be OK.  That said, you will eventually find people who like that style and they will probably come with you regardless.
---
Dude it’s just corrupted ashbringer, it’s only vanilla, they won’t do the same on Warglaives !
---
I really really really hope I'll find people who will want to run Deadmines as level 18-20 Hordies. It'd be so much fun
---
God I hope not. Transferring to a PvP at 60 should be considered a war crime. If you didn't level there, you shouldn't be able to gank there.
---
Where? I can't seem to find them.
---
Cataclysm was my favorite PvP expansion but after that its been a huge nope. And PvP was my focus on WoW from vanilla til then.
---
The only reservations I'm down with will be when I run 5mans with 4 friends, not in pugs
---
Weird concept: people also like people watching sports instead of playing it themselves. It really doesnt seem so weird when you actually think about it.
---
I am one of those that love the pauses for drinking, skinning, chatting!!
---
I'll be a min-maxing dwarf priest who barely played in vanilla but has spent ages playing on private servers. The spreadsheet part is pretty accurate but I love that kind of stuff. It's fun applying theorycrafting to the game for me. 
---
I don't get the streamer part though. From what I've seen they aren't exactly min-maxing or even playing the game that well. There's so many reasons why a hardcore min-maxer wouldn't want to be in a guild with streamers.
---
As for the addons part, most healers playing on private servers use addons such as Luna Unit frames. DPSmate is the preferred meter addon.
---
I want changes to vanilla because I'm not playing it for nostalgia but because I like the kind of game that is classic. Looking at the beta I hope they buff the dmg even more than on private servers.
---
Prove it
---
My taughts aswell. Def stance gives 10% reduction and Zerk stance gives 10% DMG taken.
---
Don't additions and reductions to attack power effect mobs to a much greater degree than players?
---
defensive stance springs to mind too
---
Would be great to add talented spells into this list too!
---
I think Blizzard knows that when they invite people to betas only about 10 - 20% of players are deliberately testing things and submitting bugs and that 80 - 90% just want to play the game for funsies (made up numbers here, but Blizzard would have the actual data). And they invite people accordingly.
---
The problem with these types of posts from the "played since launch, no invite" people is that they assume that they are better testers based on nothing... and most of them don't care to test; they just want to play the game and are pointing to their long-standing history with WoW as if some injustice has been done to them... 
---
And they  also fail to understand that within the first few months of launch, WoW had like a million and a half players! Let's say closed beta is 5,000 players (no idea what real numbers are). If just 2% of the players who subbed in the first 4 months after the game launched opted into the beta, that is still 30,000 people. You still only have a 1 in 6 chance of getting in... and that's assuming they only invite the oldest of old school players.
---
Long story short. Hang in there! August will be here before you know it.
---
Ok and what is your thought one the Nature grasp talent ? Mandatory or not ?
---
I know you didn't mained druid back then but you could have an opinion on this no ? :P
---
True. The funny thing is that they are looking for more because they can't do it themselves, yet somehow feel they are better than someone else and more entitled to loot hm.
---
I mentioned the title is tongue in cheek, I know disproving one does not prove the other, and that old videos can't possibly do that because there is confounding variables.
---
I wanted to make the point that taking classic beta videos and comparing them to classicdb values is just as stupid as me saying "look at this old vid with lower values than classic dB therefore classic is right" I even say in my post that this isn't proof of classic beta being correct.
---
You're one among many others with classic account who didn't get an invite yet. Welcome to the club -_-
---
New era, who cares. Stream sniping is what makes the game fun. If you dont like it, close your stream or git gud
---
Oh man, I really hope some of my viewers actually play classic. I like most of my regulars heaps and I'd really enjoy it.
---
&gt;Minor thing, did you include the ap debuff the druid was putting up?  
---
&gt;I doubt it's a 20 to 30% difference, but it'd make up a part of it.  
---
&gt;Edit: checked the druid video and he's got 1 point in the talent that increases the amount of ap reduction it does as well
---

---
Not really my last few comments have been involved with it since that's all that floats around
---
"Irrefutable proof" btw, yikes.
---
I made this: stianhoiland.com/demo.htm
---
I mean, aren't those values before armor mitigation?
---
, scrub.
---
I am not the tank, I would not roll on tank item. But why would I trust you if you can't trust me ?
---
I know but you’re joking, but fun on expenses of others is not okay.
---
Yep, frame it as a positive for taking a break vs a punishment for not taking a break. People don't like being punished, but often you can reframe a punishment into a reward, at which point people are totally fine, even though the end result is exactly the same.
---
Where is his shadow underneath? And on the char? I smell fishy PS
---
Of course I don't have comparative video evidence of every single elite in the game doing correct damage. It's practically impossible to collect such evidence.
---
I agree that there's nothing wrong with pointing out what you feel is incorrect, but asserting that *all* elites in the beta do too little damage is just noise. Either way we now know that there indeed is a bug (or multiple bugs) that can cause mobs to deal too little damage, and we also know that they don't always deal too little damage, so hopefully that'll get cleared up by Blizzard soon.
---
I will in classic don’t worry.
---
By the way my posts have had the /s marker...
---
And my name in WoW is Nacilep
---
You make valid points, but this stuff happens in all kinds of games these days. Not much you can do to stop it
---
Oh yeah, that makes more sense. It’s much more harmless when it’s a BoE drop if you still intend to give it to the person in need.
---
It's independent of Modern Wow (as in you don't need BFA installed), but of course one has parts of the other. They share an engine, BFA still has models from Classic etc.
---
I spent a week skinning and vendoring leather scraps as a low lvl nightelf druid in Teldrassil. All started when i saw another nightelf - a hunter - running past me with a pet in Darnassus. So i skinned the shit out of those prowlers until i had 65s, enough to buy a companion from one of those companion vendors in Darnassus. 
---
I had no fucking idea why that god damn owl didnt attack my targets.
---
No more slipping into Warmode Off without slipping out of the PvP server altogether.
---
I haven’t watched much other than beta impressions. I just want 8/26/19 to hurry up. I have 7 days straight off.
---
&gt; Spamming RFK is a loot hunt that is not tied to the rates of WF or TF. You know that that boss after the next few mobs has a chance to drop Corpsemaker. In Retail, you know the instance drops the visual you want or any activity has a chance at giving you gear in the slot/s you need, and a smaller chance of that gear actually being useful.
---
&gt; I'd take the chance farming an instance for an item I know is good for a slot I need any day over the chance of the right piece dropping with a smaller chance of that piece being the upgrade I need.
---
Does everybody have a short memory? Feels like it.
---
We had that system from vanilla to WoD ( well, Cata if you go pre-titanforging).
---
What happens after you got the item you want from X Y and Z dungeon/raid? nothing. You have no reason to visit them ever again. And this is exactly what happened back in the days , with people logging on reset day, clearing the most recent raid, then logging off for the rest of the week.
---
Eventually people started loosing interest during farm raid : sure, I'm missing 2-3 piece... but we already killed big_bad_boss 5 times already, it's not like new gear will change anything.
---
wether you like the M+ system or not , you have to concede one thing : people keep playing. Legion was the first expansion where my guild was actually active outside of reset day
---
Wasn't aware it was, even did a search for it before hand, no recent discussions. Asked people to provide the other threads and no one could. Even then, I didn't realise it was against the rules.
---
You act like wishing that pservers had accurate numbers makes it true. Facts don't rely on your feelings and really hoping the pservers are right isn't going to magically make that the case.
---
I love how all these people continue to post "urgh *cry* but I've played since forever" as if that would grant you any form of entitlement.
---
Safe to say that whining players will still be present in Classic, lol
---
I fucking love peggle and now I love you OP
---
In vanilla I made a night elf hunter as my alt character.
---
I didn't like the darkshore area for levelling so I decided to transport him to Stormwind.
---
Doing that was quite a well know "suicide run" through the wetlands as a level 10 (I think mobs in vanilla wetlands were lvl 30ish?) so due to relative levels, they would aggro from quite a long way off.
---
How do u check exactly when u want to see if u have beta key? Click the region dropdown and wait till it magically appears, or can i download Classic somewhere? 
---
Btw can i sign to stresstest somewhere?
---
It's completely 100% impossible to do WC with that retarded combo due to Veridan hitting like a damn freight train, on both vanilla and TBC private servers.
---
Thank you for doing this :)
---
&gt;That is disingenuous. The OP partook in a logical fallacy.
---
which is what? To think having blizzard open TBC only servers would split the player base that loves vanilla, but wants to play pally or shaman on opposing faction. best ratio for debate is 50/50. Would splitting 50% of the player base before the game is even released be a smart move? No. But nothing wrong talking about it. If people are allowed to talk about wanting pre-bfa servers that include more than launch wow. Then the opposite conversation has to happen for it be an actual conversation and not just a statement of opinion.
---
I tanked The Stockades as a 2H Warrior in the EU open Beta. There may an issue with the damage reduction, but it's not like tanking two-handed was impossible. At least not for the low level dungeons.
---
I watched it before it was live, in my head, in a dream. So yeah, I was first and I'm the best.
---
If that's all that matters to you then sure. There are plenty of ways to improve yourself, if 1-60 routes are all that are worth your time then ✌️
---
Great guide to live by... not set in stone, fellow newb's. 😉
---
I went with a Wrath one last night because its the oldest i could find that was even close to 4k.  :(
---
I kinda hope blizz releases some new ones at high res for classic.
---
I think some of the "no changes" people just want to make sure Classic feels like the real deal. After the game is launched and people have lived the 1-60 OG vanilla experience, I think some of the player base would be open to new 60 content.
---
Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing some of the content that Blizzard talked about for vanilla but never launched. Emerald Dream, player housing, Karazhan. That Emerald Dream tech demo looked awesome.
---
Dude! Whatever your first character was, the first time you reenter ”your” starting zone, if you make a nostalgia copy, and hear the music and see the first buildings and try to jump and autoattack... it will be simply magical!
---
Glhf
---
Fair enough, though I think anyone who considers themselves an actual tester and not just a source of free Twitch PR should at least go through the bare minimum effort to verify that what they witnessed was actually a bug.
---
In this case TipsOut could have looked at Wowhead and read the dozens of comments on the mob that say that it hits like a truck. Or just asked his stream and they would have done that for him.
---
So people that dislike the show are all following influencers and everyone downvoting you is overflowing with hate? Damn thats quite the ego.
---
[Source](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-weapon-skills)  the racial bonus given to swords is so minute less than .3% that there is less than a .7% variable in damage output or sustainability. Therefore 1% dodge has a larger impact that a shitty weapon skill boost. Mic drop go back to raidfinder.
---
No. It causes loss of control of your character.
---
You can trinket a stun, you can't trinket a spell lock caused by an interrupt.
---
What does this sentence even mean? I work as a lawyer and spend plenty of time looking at convoluted sentences but this one has be confused. Are they trying to say that "aggro radii are correct"?
---
I’m the warrior!!! (In the back)
---
&gt;At the very least I will probably be naming my hunter pet the same as my character though.
---
Why ?
---
One of my fondest memories was questing in Ashenvale on my hunter. Saw there was a road leading north that took me to some new zone so I thought I'd have a look at it. I take a few steps into this place called Felwood before this skull-level Murderbear decided my face would be his next meal from what seemed like miles away. I did everything I possibly could to slow him down and in my ignorance, try to kill this complete alpha of a specimen before my resources were exhausted and he had his way with my corpse. 
---
My stubbornness to live taught me how to kite before I even understood was kiting was.
---
fair enough, I Just remembered about this example might have been helpful
---
OHMYGOD I feel this in my soul. 
---
“Hair on fire flipping out holy crap fix it it’s broken omg” 
---
“ok tell me about the problem” 
---
—silence— 
---
Ten minutes later
---
“WHY ISN’T THIS FIXED YET?!”
---
Right, I hope Blizzard posts about it. They've said that character services will be available but we don't know if the old limitations will still be in play.
---
Age of streamers - make stupid ppl famous and create twitch culture.
---
You again... Have made the mistake of thinking the guys who are spending 3 months doing useful stuff then jumping in for a heavy week are going to be behind. They are just going to be in a healthier or more accomplished state
---
I doubt I because who the hell streams DBZ Dokkan Battle?
---
Back in Vanilla the end game motto was "Invest in the guild and the guild will invest in you.
---
Level 62 NOT VANILLA U FAKER.
---
(Jk, it's cool.)
---
you vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
---
It’s Thanos.
---
demo roar doesn't give 30% difference, the point is still valid.
---
I'd edit this down to about 15-20min tops with your "best / worst" impressions. 50min is way to long.
---
&gt;he could not have reached 60% + mitigation.
---
For the last fucking time. The classic CB values are not accurate. None is claiming that they are. I'm not trying to argue that they are correct. I'm just saying that if you DON'T include precise armor values, then the footage is completely useless and cannot be used for anything.
---
At 200k we unlock Demon Hunters in Classic, gogo!
---
Sounds like you need to calm down there bud
---
Put sunder on everything
---
Retail isn't an MMO either. A static server and community is an essential part of an MMO. Retails sharding has cast it into a category way closer to Destiny than it is to an MMO, like some sort of large-scale multiplayer action game. 
---
Classic is both more MMO AND more RPG than retail these days.
---
My concern can really be broken down into two parts.
---
1) will safespotting be allowed in classic? It is blizzlike after all and I favor no changes.
---
2) is "safespotting" even a glitch?
---
I think it is working as intended. If you stand on the net as a level 60 you are far from the guards and they still turn aggressive towards you properly, they just don't get close enough to aggro.
---
If you stand in the same exact location as a level 40 ranged character, the guards will turn aggressive and they will be close enough to aggro. Then the guards will attack the lower level player. If I recall correctly they would use the ability to make the player fall.
---
&gt;The post above was literally made to say that classicdb is a bad source and should not be used as such - look up other posts appearing in /new, people compare values in classic beta directly to what's in classicdb
---
No they are not.
---
That's not reserving anything? You're just letting your friends know what you need, which they can tell you they won't accept or will accept.
---
Of course. It's not like people didn't alt-tab and thottbot/allakazam back in the day.
---
Having an add on just adds a QOL improvement
---
Where is my invite? 🙁
---
Pathetic.
---
Revenge is *the* aggro generator
---
True, but still
---
Same for me, bt that is how it goes.
---
&gt; Orc hunter
---
&gt; Plays Peggle during boss pulls
---
You member that 90% of vanilla hunter rotation is auto-shot, right? I member.
---
with that logic we'll never be able to prove any bugs of this sort, might as well just pack up the beta and hope blizzard gets it right in that case
---
?
---
No it's not. Plenty of groups that "reserve" items take all classes and often don't let you know before the group is assembled. So often I've run UBRS/LBRS and the leader goes "Oh yeah, this item is reserved" and 2-3 ppl leaves and the group needs to reform.
---
I can understand stating "Full on mages" for example, if you got 2 mages, but reserving items is just stupid. If you can't deal with the roll system, get a guildie-group going.
---
The creator got a job at blizzard to work with WoW and now works with hearthstone.

Given that out of all of the replies to my comment only like 3 people were able to articulate their complaints with the show... yes.
---
Loved this series back in the day. Made me a roll a Female Tauren Druid alt.
---
I bet anti-pserver folks will somehow dismiss these facts and still bash pserver players anyway lmao.
---
Delusions from hunter players aside, it's the worst class in classic by some stretch barring major changes to it. Hunter had a grand total of zero specs throughout vanilla that were considered useful; of the three, beast mastery was used in PvP which actually gave hunters a 15 second window every 3 minutes to be 'good' by activating Beastial Wrath.
---
With regards to other classes, all classes that *can* heal are healers. Exclusively. There are no tanks other than warriors, but they can switch to arms and pvp. Fury's a joke. Warlocks are the "I solo everyone in pvp" class but only one of 40 raiders will be allowed to be a warlock, and literally just to help mages deal more damage.
---
Classic is REALLY imbalanced as far as classes (and even worse, talents) go. Hunter is the biggest victim of that by a considerable distance. They became a meme in the community and the playerbase itself basically considered playing a hunter equivalent to being an idiot, so the player behind the class was also unwanted. 
---
Having said all that, I do not know the extent of the changes they'll be making for classic - but without major reforms for hunter, it would be advisable to pick *anything* else.
---
Unfortunately xfac collusion is unavoidable.
---
It happened in vanilla, sure, but now it's going to be ubiquitous and omnipresent. 
---
Just hope the streamers pile on one server so we can avoid it

It might also be good to link the list of "Not A Bug" reports that Blizzard is updating:

Garrisons were a cool idea that had some problems and was vastly improved in class halls in Legion. I think that they could redo garrisons better in a future expansion.
---
No, that is a skill. There is a talent for example that affects the effectiveness of that skill.
---
Demoralizing Roar - skill
---
Feral Aggression - talent
---
Not really because you can do it on same faction too.
---
This was a huge problem on a pserver recently, that's why they introduced a 3sec "skin secure" to the group of players that killed the mob. Without it, you can go up to an ally killing a devilsaur and just spam rightclick, and the person with lowest MS gets the skin. This is not fair, and should be fixed. 
---
As for opposite faction, it's completely fine, and with the 3 seconds secure it's still easily possible to sap and steal the skin.
---
I personally think it feels off, definitely from level 10+ mobs. Maybe I am just mistaken but it feels off by more than a bit.
---
Revenge is great but sunder armor is your bread and butter for warrior tanking.

How you feeling now?
---
I literally just found my old account over the weekend.  It’s weird to see all the time I spent into my characters and it all means nothing now haha.  It was connected to an email I never remember making lol, but it has been close to 10 years.  My pally still has all his gear from vanilla but was leveled to 80 in wotlk :(
---
Take a chill pill, bro.

&gt; Stream sniping is what makes the game fun.
---
And I thought it was because vanilla was superior.
---
Some of the blue replies seem to come with a tinge of bitterness to them, it's almost like they would refuse to believe the community and are falling on the sword of that 1.12 internal client.  But if things like this are correct it would be a shame to have it forced through to the final version.
---
I don't know, My guild leader took the pic.
---
You can kite people forever. You can even be outside their range and let your pet kill them. If they start attacking your pet, move barely in range and attack. This is extremly cheesy and OP.
---
Nice try fellas.
---
Peggle, Tetris, a ‘bejeweled’ style game and frogger addons were a legit thing in vanilla marketed as something to do in between pulls and during pulls for blessbot palas
---
Yeah, but he’s be peeved if the tank rolled. But pay point is that the Rogue will only be upset if he feels blindsided. If you let him know in advance, he has like 20 minutes to accept it before you fight the boss.
---
i honestly dont understand why are people freaking out about it lol  
---
its just an interface option in game, addon doesnt magically teleport you to dungeon or mutes you so you cant talk to people  
---
i dont consider spamming trade chat for hours to be a very good "social experience"
---
Rather than that, find actual vanilla footage showing the players armor and how much damage they take. That's the proof we need.
---
How hard is it to understand that people may enjoy something that you don't?
---
The values are not fine, sorry.
---
Just heal on pvp spec , won’t make much difference unless you go hardcore or past bwl
---
I've been icy
---
Maybe he used the Sword of a Thousand Truths.
---
Yeah it's disappointing. I had a Ragnarok Online account from before Juno was implemented on te servers I play (2005) - I was there before the first lvl 99 made it to the news!
---
How *dare* Blizzard disregards my achievements too. Such defiance. You know how many of those red tree things I killed near Payon with blue-frosty arrows? *Too many.*
---
You'll probably have trouble forming groups if you want to reserve everything. Save that for when you make your friends and are doing 5 mans / 10 mans with your core friends.
---
Wait what? Every ending, save for maybe Arya and Bran, made complete sense and was honest to the character and character's development. How we got to said ending was a bit of a cliffnotes version of the actual journey, which is disappointing, but the ending itself was good. GRRM had a good vision.
---
where is said "proof"
---
Where is the evidence?
---
What do you say now?
---
Unless you are rage and I am mistaken, that's not possible.
---
For now it will show up as Stress Test and Beta: WoW Classic if you're selected to participate.
---
I don’t recall the last time I’ve done this many downvotes on one post. Seems like being a decent person and a good friend is extremely out of fashion. Is it all about watching streamers be assholes on twitch and replicating their shitty morales? Count me out.
---
Well, i just not join the stress test. I will wait for a real invite.
---
The other part of it I don’t see being discussed much is that patch level. Those of us that remember leveling up in the very beginning were playing on a much earlier patch than 1.12, and while I don’t have an encyclopedic memory about everything that changed over time, I am certain that there were numerous overhauls of classes and systems that changed the game quite a bit. 
---
I actually think a lot of people accustomed to playing modern wow will be pretty noobish coming in though. I see a lot of “CLASSIC TOO EZ” sentiment on the wow subreddit, and they are in for a rude awakening when they get curb stomped by lv1 mobs because they pulled more than a couple...
---
Natures grasp AND feral charge are very much needed in PvP.
---
Yes it would appear above your regular account as "WoW Classic Beta". You would also have to restart your bnet client for it to show if it's added.
---
We had a warrior/priest/rogue comp and it worked well. Almost zero downtime. Warrior/priest/hunter might be even better.
---
We tried warrior/druid/mage and did more damage, but had to stop and drink a lot, so it was slower overall.
---
Mage/mage/paladin is also super fast for AoE farming.
---
2 mages and priest or pally.
---
The testing is on US time for US servers. They may look to test EU servers at a later date.
---
Here you go love.
---
This is my struggle. Love the Dwarves but don’t want to roll a race/class combo that’s too popular...
---
I didn't say anything about the same faction, I just said it's a part of world pvp if an enemy wants to sap him and steal the leather (in other words, it would not be griefing as poly would be)
---
You may not be as interested in classic as you think if you're already bitching about ganks by high levels without having played at all.
---
this should be stickied
---
There's around 1.5M people still playing retail. Those people are enjoying the game as it exists now. It's built for them. Most of them have no real intention of switching. My estimate for people wanting to actually play classic is around 500K based on the viewers here and the numbers watching the streams.
---
- The people who are happy with retail are just playing. They're not bitching about it on reddit. So those numbers are under-counted.
---
- The people who are looking to play Classic are very pumped for it. Those numbers are overrepresented.
---
- Like most MMORPG releases we can expect an initial wave of players when Classic releases then the numbers will likely drop quickly.
---
You guys know gearscore started as an add-on right... It's not a Blizzard feature, it was an add-on in Burning Crusade or WotLK I want to say. It got implemented because heroic and raid groups demanded it for members.
---
Braving the mines does not mean I soloed the mines without an issue... also where is the video?
---
This isn't something you can't control.
---
People are having fun because it's the beta.
---
This shit use to happen all the time in classic as well with WPVP.
---
You and a million other people lol
---
Yeh in TBC i really liked how warriors were a beast single target tanks, druids were really good for those slow hard hitting bosses and paladins were best at aoe tanking. Every tank had a niche and it was fun. 
---
Overall i think TBC has fixed alot of vanilla issues while not changing the game too much
---
Unlike Scarab Lord
---
Maybe the rude awakening every one has been warning pserver people about wasn't that Classic was gonna be way harder, it's that it's gonna be faceroll easy.
---
I don't disagree, but in vanilla and TBC it was very much as I described.
---
Same here, started in 2005 when I was 10 :) Also a gnome rogue, lol, never leveled to 60. Played with some online friends, coming over from Habbo back in the day (they were in their early 20s, though). Continued in Wrath till 80, and took a break again till just three months ago.
---
Sadly, I can't get my account back. No idea what happened to it; I remember that I got hacked once, but it should still exist.. somewhere :)
---
yes they are
---
Front page, 500+ upvotes

Compared directly to classicDB values as its main source and does not mention anywhere in the main body that classicDB values could be wrong.
---
Streamer loot != normal player loot.
---
If you need to be told this in 2019, you fail to understand how streamer perks work. 
---
Also, if you think you're going to be a ret pally and get a first dibs on Ashkandi, you're going to get laughed straight out of the guild.
---
This is most likely the correct answer. It's possible that the damage calculations could be off since we're running old data on the modern engine.
---
Oh, whats that? More druid loot? ...and I'm the only druid in the raid? Well, if I must.
---
Nono, sorry, i was saying that your title should have been « I’m the warrior! (... the one in the back...) »
---
I think we generally agree but this seems productive so I’ll go on
---
I use “shouldn’t” and other noncommittal words because I concede there are gaps in my own knowledge and I’m open to being corrected on any matter of fact. 
---
Just because I don’t know it, though, doesn’t mean it’s unknowable or unknown. I guarantee there are people out there who have an understanding of every factor that could be at play here in determining the damage dealt. 
---
If there is a factor in the code totally unknown to theorycrafters or databases that is heavily reducing mob damage in the druid example, that sounds likely to be a bug to me.
---
Orcish Hordes! On an open field!!
---
same. i never played where you just assume the rog/eng gets to keep the loot because they can open it
---
I'll agree with that. But for the main characters it made sense for the most part (apart from Brann but that was because of the way it was presented)
---
If this was sarcasm or a joke you should have probably tagged it as humor

Logging in to my google account and force refreshing the sheet seems to have solved my issue with the links not showing up.
---
This is why devs listening to the community is a bad thing. They should only consider the community's ideas.
---
A few streamers have already reported the issue and have said that somewhere throughout vanilla's lifecycle damager for mobs under a certain level was reduced.
---
Don't know if they got this from blizzard staff, but it's an explanation going around.
---
Revenge has the highest threat/ragecost ratio. And he’s asking about dungeon tanking. I’d consider it bad advise to just go sunder spamming in dungeons where mobs will die in about 10-20 seconds.
---
Only if you play female.
---
Those goblins stun and hit hard. The ones in the foundry are the worst with their little robots.
---
I played affliction with IMP on passive in vanilla and was doing very good actually to level up. Had no downtime whatsoever.
---
Why do you care? It doesn't matter.
---
Could just be that “permanent” buffs (indefinite time limit buffs, such as stoneskin) that only require you to be near its “source” are not canceling or getting removed correctly. This could affect auras too
---
What's confusing about this statement? They have additional context to clarify that all aggro range values are correct, including the numbers that are based on relative levels (a level 10 player to a level 15 mob or vice versa). The value goes up and down based on your level compared to the enemy NPC.
---
Source?
---
Cross faction communication happened in vanilla too. It just happened on vent or irc instead of discord.
---
I read it as harry potters voice yelling at dumbledore
---
I don’t know. Hopefully someone who does can elaborate on that.
---
How much did this account cost you on eBay?
---
Anyone with the IQ of a doorknob and a grain of classic experience can look at streams and know for a fact elite mobs should be hitting a little harder it's not a mystery that really needs proof imo
---
I made a video comparing private and classic damage values using beast lore. Clear example of why this post is correct and we shouldn’t compare to private server databases.

---
Why did you make this post?
---
One could argue the exact same way in favor of the original AV
---
I agree. Vanilla wow appeals to a small fraction of the wow community. It’s for people who like to grind and feel rewarded when they accomplish an in game task. I’ve had a ton of fun re grinding to 60 on multiple “fresh” realms and raiding through out the servers “life”. Blizzards servers give us a stable environment to play vanilla without having to worry. I don’t expect everyone to play vanilla but I’d imagine a lot of people will try it out.
---
Oh wow that's tiny in comparison to 60g Retail then, may even have room for it on my SSD! :D Thanks!
---
lol no way that is right
---
\&gt;zoomer rage intensifies
---
That's a very hot take, friend.
---
ahhhhhh lol
---
Classic isn't even out yet. We have 3 months. We don't even know how long the hype will last for. Let's see how it starts. We have easily a year before we even *get* to Naxx most likely, so it's fine discussing now but st the same time it's a tad too early to try and stop people from talking about it. Right now, it just sounds like people are running around trying to enact some sort of damage control when nothing has even happened. Like some sort of helicopter parent.
---
Also add-ons were a core part of classic wow, I don't know how you even got the idea that add-ons killed or split the population?
---
There is a big difference between going "Hey guys I don't believe we have should after naxx or any other tbc or wotlk servers because of reasons" and spamming threads constantly about "STOP talking about extra dlcs or you will ruin EVERYTHING. blizzard listened before and it ruined classic so don't anything out of line or they will ruin it again."
---
Discussion is fine. Acting paranoid and trying to shut everyone down is not fine.
---
Also, classic will thrive. And it will thrive alongside bfa. They will be two different games, and the fact is of modern wow dies for whatever reason, classic will also suffer from it. So the best idea is to hit both audiences and let both flourish.
---
Should have been focused around a primitive uninhabited land where you could build structures similar to Ark and Conan Exiles and have players fight over resources and such.
---
/r/woosh
---
I think lag is also a reason leveling has been less painful so far. I used to get caught by pats, not just while I was fighting but when I was stuck in a loot-lag scenario. The smoother gameplay is making it much easier for me to avoid adds.
---
Yeah, the deep affliction imp battery spec is absolutely legit leveling spec. I can't say for sure what is the best but it is at the very least one of the best options.
---
Using beta for testing the game in 2019?
---
This seems so off.
---
Server stability was by far the biggest complaint in Vanilla.
---
&gt;irrefutable
---
A good idea, but it would be difficult to replicate a character as most old videos won't show talent tree details or the exact gear.  You can't see from the outside if somebody wears  &lt;Random Chestpiece of the Monkey&gt; or &lt;Random Chestpiece of  the Eagle&gt; as they would look the same from the outside
---
Still worth trying of course.
---
watching some dude's stream for 4 hours straight is better? :&gt;
---
I guess, you straight replied to someone who said they tanked dungeons as a pally with "Not in Vanilla". About as close to saying "pallies can't tank" as you can get.
---
MrMeaches, don't take your anger out on me! MrMeaches, NOOOOOOO!
---
I mained hunter in vanilla and had a lot of fun on a pvp server.
---
Rogues are always going to be the biggest threat on a pvp server while leveling up and a hunter's track hidden gives you a window of warning if they get too close.
---
Leveling is much easier with your pet.
---
Raiding, on the other hand, is boring aside from certain boss fights whose mechanics require a hunter (like Anub in Naxx). I mean, you're usually responsible for pulling trash to the tanks, but in actual boss fights, it's put your pet away, aimed shot, auto shot, and don't stand in bad stuff.
---
I imagine it's not that easy, especially considering most videos taken back then of actual gameplay have all of 3 pixels, or don't exist anymore.  Plus it's not like they were showing us their exact gear and armor values.
---
easy, buddy.
---
Kinda same situation here. Had a C in English when I started playing, 7-8 months later I had an A+
---
If the group assembler doesn't include the message in his LFM, then he's an idiot.

I remember it. In fact I feel like I remember what it was like before that rule was made, because I think I used to be one of those mages messing with people.
---
Can you add twitch.tv/Shikayami to the list?
---
I said proof, as in math.
---
no one aside from this massively upvoted front page post ?
---
Pop culture is a bigger market than niches. Don't mistake the fact that millions of idiots like eating shit for the opinion of a niche community such as classic.
---
Market players will always aim for an as big as possible target audience so they can sell their shit. The bigger the target audience, the more watered down the product (biggest common denominator).
---
I remember doing every dungeon in a three man group with a shaman/druid/warrior group all the way to the level 60 dungeons and they were pretty easy. I think a lot of people just remember being bad at the game, not the game being hard.
---
God damn, you're a real eye opener.
---
You have successfully stopped each and every one of those people from posting their account info and such.
---
Nobody listen to this comment about classes. It is incorrect. For example, fury warriors are the best dps pve for quite some time. Mages won’t come close.
---
Oh no, i was just giving a reference for later.
---
On? EU servers comment is my own conjecture.
---
Dont care about streamers, let them and their zombie followers grief each other all they want. Also there was always talk between factions. I recall guilds on opposite factions that would coordinate for world boss attempts or whatnot. Couldn't avoid it then, just easier now. Not going to likely impact my play sessions very often.
---
FYI information there's no improved sunder armor per se it's just a rage cost reduction.
---
Maybe you're thinking of Improved Expose Armor for rogues ?
---
My brother just got in today, so they're still inviting.
---
I'm not gatekeeping those who watch streamers. Theres something for everyone. I'll tell you this, though. Some of these streamer communities are the definition of no life neck beards, so dont sleep on them too hard lol.
---
What a bitch. It's an mmo and i'll ninja whatever I please and face the consequences ;)
---
No, not 2 days. just 26 hours. Lvl cap is 5
---
That's your opinion, and that doesn't answer the question. No one wanted sharding because it was obviously going to destroy server communities. Which it didn't.
---
It happened because the game lost players and faction/realm balance got screwed. Direct result of the game's evolution.
---
Next time you see the typical "Please classc+, TBC and WotLK", you will know why it could happen again. Developers must sometimes protect players from themselves. Yet they did 180 degree turn on their design, midway through WotLK and the game started going downhill since.
---
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Because the beta is for hype generation hence why they have access to people like Towlie
---
You act like because they all don’t write out essays each time they say they didn’t like the show, that they don’t have opinions on their own? Even if the show wasn’t rushed, sloppy and felt like we were watching imitations of characters (which granted is unavoidable going from the actual author to directors writing), people are going to dislike stuff sometimes. Ever experience your type of dismissive comment from people who still like BfA? It’s unfortunately common for most things when someone is widely disliked to always get those responses rather then just acknowledging that something isn’t well liked, because that’s okay.
---
Funny because I’ve grouped which a Shaman tank while leveling in private servers recently, although we were level 16-17 doing RFC. We had a Shaman tank, Shaman healer, two rogues, and a warlock lol
---
TBC sucks
---
While possibly true, just because the classes are similar in utility and function between factions, does not mean that they share code in the server.
---
That's like saying because a gold vein is bugged in Kalimdor, all Goldthorn is too.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.1
---
Finding patch notes is pretty easy, they're all archived on Wowpedia. /u/nigmastolemybike is right, 2.0.1 was the TBC prepatch. It was included on the discs too, though. 2.0.3 is the patch that started the Dark Portal opening event. There were a couple of minor bugfix patches before the Dark Portal opened a few days later and the expansion fully launched.
---
There is no way to stop a lfg tool of some sort. Automation is the future and addons will be made to make it easy for players. Even if its scanning text chat or doing a connection to a separate server like TSM does.
---
Someone add the AFK screen that pans around your character when you go AFK that’s pretty neat.
---
I don't see the point of your post tbh. If you're crying because classic won't have any of those features then fucking play retail and quit your bitchaxing.
---
Any group with 1 Rez(priest/paladin/shaman) and 1 good cc (mage/rogue/hunter) and a tank (Warrior/Druid/Paladin). Put each in order of best for the role.

"The customer is always right"

Except when they're wrong, which is actually quite often. When you own a product, if you give too much direction to the consumer (player) it can go bad - fast.

Boohoo, ninja loot all you want guys
---
Trolololooolooooooo
---
It's so wonderful to see a community really doing their best to help Blizzard roll out the perfect example of WoW Classic.  This entire sub is awesome.
---
What do you mean? Im talking about whether something is a sport or not. I enjoy some streamer content too, wtf? Watching Preach go through WC was enjoyable..doesnt mean he just participated in an esport..
---
10% chance on the spell cast I think
---
I did something similar with IRL friends, but on Blizz servers in like 2006. We did every dungeon up to ZF with a mage/warlock/shadow priest setup. I was playing the SP, and I told them not to expect heals, but I obviously healed in some cruicial situations.
---
I was raiding Naxx at the time on my main, and it wasn't the pre-TBC patch yet, so i'm pretty sure it was 1.12 at the time.
---
Also the three of us were playing next to each other in our netcafe, pretty good times...
---
So i'm just saying something similar was definitely possible even on retail vanilla.
---
There was a bug with Stoneskin totem too, so that may have caused some of the reports.
---
If it's vanilla wow appeals to a small fraction of the wow community, why were there 8 million subscribers at the end of classic/release of TBC and BFA launched with 3.2 million (and has surely plummeted since then since it was a disastrous expansion)? Retail WoW is a small fraction of the WoW community.
---
Wpvp was most definitely a thing on my server. From start to finish.
---
Happened in vanilla too constantly.
---
Welcome to Classic.
---
My wife is subbed, I’m not... so i got to check her battle net...

What blue replies?
---
I'm going to be a casual chad Tauren Shaman and no one can stop me
---
I contacted customer support with the Character Names that I knew I had leveled to 60. 
---
As well as my Address at the Time.
---
I had forgotten my account name.
---
I had the idea a bit too late though, only today i added the account, after the beta wave left without me.
---
It would be nice if I were in to try out a few classes that I may be interested in playing tbh.
---
i feel like this a good point that people who never played vanilla need to know. there is no easy "i'll repair when i get there" situation, you have to show up well prepped!
---
BRD is a full day affair every time
---
He is becoming one of my favorite streamers for Classic.
---
&gt;fury warriors are the best dps pve for quite some time. Mages won’t come close.
---
When is that time, exactly? After they get decked out in BWL gear and their chance to hit nears 17%? You can say the same for mages, which is true with regards to fire spec, but the first two raids and top tier instances are all fire based which heavily benefits their frost DPS (lowered or no resistances).
---
My comment is pretty accurate. There are like 4 classes that have fleshed out talent trees, 3 that have one good talent tree, with warlocks being kinda up in the air, and then there's hunters who are  nothing more than a "trap class" because everything about them is an atrocity.
---
But hey, ignore the guy who's warning you about some of the less-than-positive aspects of class balance in a detailed post, and instead listen to the feel good guy who says "DONT LOOK!" but provides no reason. Up to you.
---
Holy fuck thank you for saving everybodys day. I thought people were just eager to play the game and disappointment for not getting to Beta is normal. Glad you clarified that people just want to be entitled.
---
I am wondering if that darkmoon card twisting nether is still working in bfa :D
---
Remember this when you'll try to kill a devilsaur and a fellow mage won't be able to deny you the kill by chain sheeping it.
---
In WOW and in life in general good people pay for the actions of the dicks.
---
My biggest complaint about retail is how much shit is in the game that ruins immersion. I think this might be the slippery slope fallacy in action, but I do kind of agree that just because 5 High elf npcs exist doesn’t validate thousands of high elf toons running around. 
---
On the other hand I kind of wish the draenei looked like the Draenei before their burning crusade rework and would like to see the ugly version join the game. 
---
I remember in vanilla hoping the rumors of furbolgs and naga were true. 
---
I remember also hoping worgen would happen, but I regret that. 
---
In summary, no changes just to be safe :)
---
Level 70 Elite Human Father
---
That is exactly what retail WoW does? Everything scales to you. Some zones won't scale until you reach 30 or 40 or whatever but once you do its completely irrelevant what level you are... it is really, really awful. You just don't ever feel like you are getting any stronger.
---
Where exactly do you see classic CB in that post? Nowhere.
---
Have you heard of the high elves?
---
The reason LFR exists is because Blizzard is well known for making great raid content. The raids are like the one thing people like about BFA. They absolutely suck at making casual content. They took the feature they are known for in the MMO space and made it into the casual content because they did not know what else to do.
---
HAd alot of fun on my warlock in that bracket in vanilla. HAd like 100 fire damage on my gear, wasnt too twinked to be honest but those soul fire one shots were definitely fun \^\^ :D
---
By them I mean blizzard, since I think blizzard has a say in if they should be split up
---
If blizzard doesn’t have a say in it, then sure, twitch can do whatever they want
---
Some people are idiots.
---
Yes, because some account that started in WOD or later should be given access so they can test Vanilla/Classic to make sure it is up to par with what they remember.
---
Let’s make all those that played/started in Vanilla sit on the sidelines and watch as those players come in and want transmog, LFG, lower mount training etc...in a Beta because that’s what they remember.
---
Who is Blizzard really promoting Classic to? More younger kids to hook them into the game and convert them over to Retail or the older players who left because the QOL features took out the LIFE(Community) part of the game.
---
If you really think this is aimed at those older players then why haven’t we seen older accounts (from Vanilla) with emails from Blizzard prompting Classic to them? Emails getting them into the Beta to help get the game back to how it was?
---
I tried to do that on a private server and it wouldn't let me  :(
---
It's definitely not per target hit. The only question is whether the buff gets removed on spell release or spell hit (can you get Fireball /Fireblast free if you cast the latter when the former hits)
---
The tone of your original post and replies showed otherwise. If you really need this spelled out then no, not all streaming content is eSports. It's entertainment.
---
That's it man good job, it's appreciated. We need those things reported asap if we want the game in the best state possible.
---
It's years of completely different peoples version of WOW that eroded away its fundamentals.  You can no longer play what you played back then.  Its actually kind of cool in that way.  I want to play classic/tbc again but I don't think it'll be the exact same experience.  If they remade WOW every expansion I doubt WOW would have ballooned into such a phenomenal success.  Would have pissed people off tremendously starting over.  The solution in my mind would have been setting down fundamental ground rules for further content.  I do admit it would have been really difficult to grow the playerbase if vanilla leveling+expansion leveling was that difficult, but, you would have definitely cut out the players not that committed to play long term. Graphic updates and behind the scenes stuff wouldn't put a bad taste in everyones mouth if they got the same style of game today that they did in vanilla/tbc/wrath sort of. It would have just been new content with the same game experience.  Your character a few expansions in would be so valuable to you the amount of time you put into it. I have characters with years played on them and with the option to buy a max character now it physically makes me ill thinking that time I put into it is the equivalent to 60 fucking dollars.  Seriously fuck activision, but, that's another post.  Also years of content is completely trivial now and it just produces people that don't know how to play and based on sub count I'd guess they don't stick around either.  That's just how I feel about it I guess, classic should be fun, see yall there!
---
Your link is busted, friend. Here: http://www.stianhoiland.com/demo.htm
---
They obviously were trying to sweep it under the rug. The only reason they ever attempted Classic servers is because the Community demanded it.
---
No you are right. you could create channels back then, which also were global, but, as you said, had a 50 player limit.
---
I get the joke. But the image quality is kind of poop.
---
I disagree. It should be designated to players who played vanilla, and trust me you want it to be that way. People play back then, will preserve the game that was so great. Allow you to see why it was so great.
---
Can you elaborate? As a newer player I'm curious what makes you say that
---
That's very shaky evidence. Even if you can argue that "most people left" it doesn't really indicate any objective failure for the game. They still have plenty of players. Not to say I don't agree with the assertion about player feedback possibly leading to bad outcomes for the game (in my own opinion) but I don't think you presented good 'evidence.'
---
It actually freaks me out how much I relate to The Chad Casual holy shit
---
 [Flurry Axe](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=871)  and  [Axe of the Deep Woods](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=811), if you plan on 2H fury then  [Arcanite Reaper](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12784)
---
I support this
---
Thats the thing. You could do that back then aswell, but back then there was a 50ppl limit on those channels.
---
On Nostalrius you could skin the Blood Elf chicks in BWL.
---
I never said we wanted sharding.
---
I was there, he’ll you can use the way back machine and see that most negative threads were due to stability/queues for server.
---
Sharding sucks, I’m just saying the communities complaints did lead to blizzard creating sharding technology for smooth launches and servers.
---
I recommend a mouse. Absolutely gamechanging. Here's how to edit your startup after you install the driver. 
---
**AUTOEXEC.BAT**
---
    LH C:\Windows\MOUSE.COM
---
**CONFIG.SYS**
---
    DEVICE=C:\Windows\MOUSE.SYS
---
Maybe it's because no one in the beta is just a simple geologist.
---
&gt; Just because I don’t know it, though, doesn’t mean it’s unknowable or  unknown. I guarantee there are people out there who have an  understanding of every factor that could be at play here in determining  the damage dealt. 
---
You are absolutely correct, there will be someone who can confirm this, I mean, we know at the very least Blizzard has a native Vanilla system running so they can confirm this.
---
However, when it comes to proving this is not enough because you cannot (the presentee of said proof) account for this without getting this confirmation from the person who can actually proof this. Until that is a confirmed fact it is an uncertainty which cannot be dismissed by stating that 'someone somewhere knows the answer'.
---
 If anything, Blizzard has already shown us that we know a lot but not everything.
---
And what happen after you got your items, and there's nothing else left to get in dungeon/raid?
---
start over on an alt?
---
It feel like people don't remember why blizzard put those changes in the first place : people didn't had a reason to log in after having recleared wathever raid was most recent. the game would be a ghost town on weekend...
---
love it or hate it, ever since they implemented the M+ system in legion, PvE-side activity has skyrocketed.
---
Original link works for me, but changed it to yours.
---
I'm not sure if it's just nonsense I heard while playing on pservers, but that was part of the reason you had to be careful with something like Curse of Recklessness.  
---
CoR increases melee attack power by 90 and reduces the target's armor by 640.  The AP boost seems like nothing, but our tanks were adamant that Demo Shout was kept up at all time to negate the damage buff effects CoR would add to the boss.
---
&gt;Also, if I understood correctly, they are merging the battle net drop down menu item
---
This is true, but this really only affects people who are already in the beta. The name of the "region" in the drop-down menu changed from "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic" to "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic". This makes it a bit more confusing as to whether you got in the full beta or just the Stress Test, but as a rule of thumb I'd say: **if you get an invite between now and the beginning of the Stress Test, just assume it's Stress Test only.**
---
&gt;and I understood people don’t get email confirmation of the beta
---
Not true. I got an email informing me I was in the beta, but it didn't come until *a full day* after the beta appeared in my launcher. So you should still get an email, but checking the launcher is definitely faster.
---
&gt;which means checking if you got in beta got more complicated as you have to try to log in (and likely fail) versus just checking the drop down.
---
The "beta/stress test" option won't appear in the drop-down at all if you aren't in the beta. If it's there, that means you got in.
---
&gt; to make sure it is up to par with what they remember.
---
I mean...lol?
---
The people right now are showing just how skeewed peoples' memories are, especially because private server values were 100% off and thats what a lot of them now remember.
---
&gt;Who is Blizzard really promoting Classic to? More younger kids to hook them into the game and convert them over to Retail or the older players who left because the QOL features took out the LIFE(Community) part of the game.
---
Again...lol?
---
Theres plenty of people that started in Classic that are younger than others who started playing in BC/Wrath (or even later)
---
Not everyone can get in. O well :)
---
I hope not. Imagine the whining that will ensue when people realize their 18 year old account couldn't even get invited to a 1-day stress test.
---
The general agreement here is that it’s a joke but the idea that someone could actually make something like this is a real one. Kind of worrying especially given the whole cross real BNet phasing they said will happen if you party with a friend
---
Hi, /u/longoverdue83
---
It's not always that simple; like the recently discovered bug where the damage reduction from stoneskin totem would persist. Some people may get the appropriate damage, others might not, and the reason would really not be easy to ascertain.
---
Welcome to r/Classicwow. "Proof" has littered the frontpage considerably the last few days and it's becoming problematic. Luckily this sub is so small in the grand scheme of things that none of the sentiments shared here will affect the game.
---
Well they don't even have taunt so...
---
I believe it was in the reddit thread where the customer service response was posted. Someone else asked for and got a more clear response from another CS rep that said basically you just have to be subbed before the invite wave goes out to have a chance, you don't have to have subbed before the first one. I can't find that thread now though, so I can't give you a link, sorry.
---
Two reasons: 
---
1: I had to kill the rogue who was ganking me before I could fight you, which is what theat cast order was for
---
2: Lifetap - Few people are both decent and shitty enough to attempt a gank while the victim is at full health/mana.
---
I thought everyone is able to be part of the Stress Test. I can be wrong but there should not be any invite at all
---
You will get enough discovery XP along the way that you would be level 3 by the time you get there.
---
He had more DKP.
---
Wish I had nothing to do on a weekday but refresh the blizzard launcher, shit.
---
How did you come to the conclusion that no latam folk have got in? Because no latam streamers?
---
What's the joke?
---
At lower levels (really any below 60) healers don't really have any +healing generally, and the difference between healing as ret or holy is practically insignificant (some 12% bonus healing for a full holy spec). So the fact that a ret paladin healed through half of an instance isn't evidence of anything being broken, I've healed entire instances as ret no problem.
---
This. I tried druid for the first time on a private server a while back but only made it half-way through BWL before the server died. Very often in MC, Onyxia, ZG and in BWL I was topping the meters with my resto druid. The class is so fun to play, and me being 1 of 2 druids, I got geared really fast as a result. 10/10 would play resto druid again.
---
They Said, they invite in bluepost.
---
These aren’t part of Phase 1 right? Aren’t these the .5 sets?
---
I used to play on Aerie Peak. What up server family.
---
Still my best memory from my time in Vanilla. 
---
This alone makes me wanna roll priest again but shaman looks so tempting :(
---
You still get murdered. I did the run at level 5 and the aggro radius was just as big as I remember, I died 3 times.
---
I also noticed this while watching asmongold level. 
---
I leveled a warrior in vanilla and it was a struggle and a half. 
---
I see asmongold 2 or 3 shotting mobs and he regains full hp before the next pull. That's not how it was back in vanilla. 
---
I would legit have to sit and eat after every single pull. Leveling as a warrior was the actual worst.
---
Well he does have a T2 helmet on
---
This video is really important amidst the huge, on-going discussion about Classic Beta mob stats versus private server (and/or Vanilla) mom stats. Classic Winds compares health/damage for 25 open-world mobs and scores them as one of four categories: 1) Higher in Classic, 2) Higher in Private, 3) Same, and 4) Just Wrong.
---
Please take a look, it's a very interesting ~5:00 minute video.
---
&gt; but stream sniping for griefing purposes
---
If you stream a competitive multiplayer game you are going to get sniped.
---
Why would anyone need birth control on the classic wow subreddit? No one here is having sex.
---
Don't call it retail, call it "modern". Classic will be a retail game too.
---
Why make a straw poll with predefined options, wtf dude
---
Of course i would specify that during forming the group, the whole point here is to prevent loot dramas and break ups in the middle of the dungeon. But if nobody would be up for a ML run in the first place, i just won't bother. And yeah I will cherry pick classes.
---
The thing is, if i did use ML i would have no problems bringing hunters so long as they concede they are second in the line to roll on melee weapons, or cloth (later leather) items. In group loot i just won't bring them since they will roll on EVERYTHING.
---
As is i guess i'll just try picking 4x casters whenever possible, which will suck for them. But hey, if ML is soo horrible, don't blame me.
---
What epic it was?
---
Weapon skill makes more of a difference in PvE than escape artist does in PvP.
---
&gt; Since the same client is used for both our stress test users and our normal beta users, the name in the Battle.net 367 App has changed to “Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic . ” If you’ve been selected to participate in the stress test, you’ll see this option appear in the Region/Account drop down menu so you can download and install the WoW Classic client in advance, but you’ll only be able to see the stress test realm when it becomes available.
---
Hence why I lead by example and say these are guidelines and not law. Follow these or a variant will keep that vanilla flavor.
---
More like the holy binity.
---
Really good find, props.
---
I'll add this to the list once I get some breakfast.
---
For phase 1-3, Hunter is going to very strong. Yeah, they slip after BWL. So what, always making an impact in PvP and Tranq is needed for PvE....play what you like, do your best, and you'll be fine. Every class/spec has negative aspects to it.
---
.....................................................except for frost mage.
---
figured it'd be easier to piggy back off your comment, but I found another video that I think? looks to be from classic, although it was reuploaded 2 years ago. https://youtu.be/CdDlrNTZeW8?t=268        
---
level 19 warrior that's getting hit pretty damn close to what the druid was, although he didn't use demo shout at all.
---
Thanks captain obvious. Now fuck yourself.
---
I did ask the same question time ago, while also being one of my last chances to get on my old tbc-wotlk class choices (I started @ BT patch, left early Cata after heroics nerf), namely being ele/enh shaman, both feral variants and shocka. 
---
Gearing is quite hard and most of the good pieces come quite late (T2, D2, AQ40 set...) and even then, people will still prefer a pure healer. And, worst   of all, shock has double the cooldown and there is no talent boosting your damage (unlike tbc's Holy Guidance, +35%INT boost to damage and healing). 
---
So, in the end, it is hard to even just pull it successfully while being quite pale to the powerhouse it was during tbc. A well-geared ret is reasonably good, but people will still be bitter about being something else than holy.
---
I reported this as soon as i found it on my first char....
---
Your whole reply...I mean lol?
---
There’s more to just testing DPS which is what people are complaining about yet failing to see how groups are actually using CC and proper class mechanics or actually gearing to stats and not just armor type...which is what everyone did back then.
---
There’s also areas that allowed players to farm cash faster (Linen to bandages which sold for good Silver) exploitable areas for fast mob farming and so forth.
---
Here is a video showing a goblin woodcutter (in the room just after Rhahk’zor) hitting a 2hd paladin tank for 20-ish a hit
---
https://youtu.be/hdcWmvxGvoY?t=205
---
Video footage is best, yes, but more people should be aware of wayback machine.  We are seeing too many posts linking to private server sources.
---
Same. I remember in vanilla if a mob was grey you'd have to literally walk through its hitbox for it to aggro you, it was always too high on pservers.
---
I play a lot of old school 75 cap FFXI as well and have recently been using the wayback machine over wiki historical pages and it's been a goldmine.  You can access sites that aren't even around anymore.  It's great!
---
Good stuff, but [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ea1g/virgin_vs_chad/) one is still my favourite.
---
Sometimes developers must protect players from themselves. Blizzard attempt to make everyone happy backfired over time. Mid WotLK was the beginning of the downhill. Once all the QoL featuers accumulated up to LFG tool, it was over.
---
Remember ToC and IC dungeons and badge gear that made 80% of the previous content useless? Well, that's how they turned the design approach which led us to BFA. More QoL= less RPG, less RPG= less replayability= catch up mechanics and free gear, resulting in the single player game with mythics we have today in Retail. Sharding eventually happened, making players careless about their attitude, which led to that boring pointless solo leveling which teaches players nothing, while showering them with gear, yes... thats how Raider IO was born.
---
Got an elite world Q? Simple, click the addon, get ported in a party, kill, leave. Not even "hi" is needed.
---
As long as your game grows while you follow a set path, its never a good idea to try and fix it. And that's what blizzard did mid WoTLK. Sometimes the customer isn't always right.
---
Because it’s the jack of all trades - master of none.
---
It’s not as good of a healer as a priest.
---
It’s not as good of a tank as a warrior.
---
Not as good of a DPS a mage, rogue...
---
It’s a great class for a ‘casual’ though!
---
You’ll be able to do all 3 roles in dungeons and in case you decide you DO want to raid, will surely find a healer spot.
---
Pog ez clap
---
You could always try a different, albeit not optimal, leveling route to see something newish
---
Imagine being so dense you don’t realize they do this for content
---
 If you used real information, usually sending a pic of your ID will allow them to look up any account with your name on it.
---
You aren’t wrong.  It’s main sin was pacing, not the resolution.
---
The night king arc and Kings landing arc should have had their own seasons a piece, that’s about it.
---
Thanks, I hate it!
---
LOL, orc stun resist, SS, FD, trap, distance, mark, aimed shot, auto, multi, dot, pet, gg.
---
I'd agree with this. While i'm naturally sceptical, things appear to be going well.
---
In the interview they said Grid when justifying BFA raid frames, so I'm not thinking about anything other than the interview.
---
Trimming armor here! 1k gold!
---
So 4/5 on HOTW is the right choice for still be able to heal in raid ?
---
Zug zug
---
You could be in trade, or in general of the zone the dungeon is in. This is more towards, if you only need 1 more to run WC, and you're over Bloodhoof doing god knows what.
---
Ahhhhhhhhhh. I see now lol.
---
pretty much this, that's the reason i like vanilla - no shamans to deal with
---
You'd better be ready for a Rogue to jump out of stealth to his aid, honorless Horde!
---
This is pretty big even outside of devilsaurs. It's really common for people to just chain polymorph mobs you're fighting even while leveling for no real reason other than to be an asshole. Maybe the private servers are extra toxic and it would be less prevalent in classic, but I'm just glad that it's not going to be a thing.
---
Next up: can mobs that you've tagged by mind controlled by people outside of your group? That was another common grief tactic on private servers.
---
But how else will people circlejerk on r/ClassicWow if they all get in?
---
Question; is there any RNG involved or do mobs have flat stats in wow? Does every spotted boar have the same stats, or can each individual mob have slightly different health/damage?  I never really thought about it, however it is kind of important to know for something like that.
---
Wish he had checked elite mobs...
---
Careful. A horde of Blizzard zealots will accuse you of comparing your values to private servers now.
---
said noone ever.
---
At that point you can juat as easily run with a fury tank, tbh.
---
This is great. I'd like to see his values for elites too.
---
Upvoted. This has been on my mind as private servers have never gotten it right. I think it will be a key factor in how raids will feel different from what we've grown used to!
---
&gt; You are unable to Polymorph enemy targets that are tapped by players with whom you are not grouped.
---
I'm assuming they mean only same faction right? A mage of the opposite faction should be able to polly your targets, that's just world PvP in my book.
---
Hi, /u/usainta
---
No these are the normal sets. 0.5 sets have different color. Paladin is purple, warrior set has more blue, Rogue is black with bright blue details etc.
---
It was all a meme to hate McCool. He brings up good points and discussions. If you see this keep doing you McConnel.
---
Not what he said though
---
As others have said, I would most definately go dwarf hunter.  
---
Just look at the intro cinematic, if that is not an explorer then I dont know what is.
---
Dude just relax OP, people are excited to play the game, wtf is wrong with you.
---
I feel like a ton of people who no lifed in vanilla don't have that kind of time anymore. I was 22 when wow originally released. Now I have a family and don't have the time 5o play a fraction of how much I used to
---
McCool guy. Brings good points to discussions. Pretty funny as well.
---
Impossible? No. But the healers had to pick up that slack. Current beta doesn't seem to have that stress shifted to anyone
---
It seems like a lot of the flight paths are not pathing properly. I hope they change this. The flight paths were so immersive and made travelling for point A to point B more than just a delay of time.
---
If you cant ninja each other and laugh about it 
---
pre-60 then you're not real friends.
---
I got in as well. Account created Feb 2005.
---
But I mean, why would Blizzard have a say in it? Twitch and Blizzard are two completely different companies. Twitch have no obligations to make Blizzard look good - quite the contrary, by keeping them as one Twitch directly make their *own* platform worse.
---
Its really simple as well, can take few mobs at once too. ALl i did was dot up &gt; wand. LAter on it was dot up &gt; life tap &gt; drain life. Same playstyle as in tbc pretty much
---
That aint gonna happen. I do not see any current retail heroic quality guild steamrolling anything past MC.
---
Remember that mythic raiders are not the majority of players. For average raider like me who has been playing for a while but finds mythic too intense, vanilla raid difficulty is perfect. (yes i cleared all raids on pserver, was engaging)
---
I really hope to see someone step up to remake cartographer what it was in Vanilla, it was always great seeing where your guildies were in the map if they also had the addon
---
Really cool - excellent resource. Thanks!
---
Lok'tar
---
Not gonna get close to that priest, if I see him standing there. There's a route down, where you don't die.
---
I kinda think its selfish to ask someone to skip all of the potential skinning they could be getting, and just leave it on the floor just so you can shave 5minutes off your Wailing Caverns time. If you want to speedrun, make a group explicitly with other people who are there to blitz it.
---
Seems like blizzard failed to do even this with their retail. You make a game for given group of people and stick with them. They tried to make everyone happy and failed miserably. You may (assuming here) call CS, DOTA, LoL, CoD, Fortnite and PUBG trash games, but they follow a set pattern and grow or atleast retain players. Some of these are near 15 years+ old. You target an audience with new game, you don't change your design midway. Which is what blizzard did with WoW and it lost it's appeal.
---
I agree with you there, at the very least they could have thrown in another 2-4 episodes to round things out more. I love this world so much I’d sit and watch a season of just Tyrion and the boys sit at a table and talk politics in the King Bran era
---
Then I guess raise the bar to 5k. Didn't realize wow streams were doing that well. Exceptions is if you are on a server with a raiding guild like method or vodka
---
Kings honor, friend.
---
That he is!
---
Yes, the 1.12 reference client that was **recreated**. All the original vanilla servers were overwritten during TBC and WotLk, you moron.
---
Hunters and warriors can both need leather please stop spreading misinformation.
---
Who’s up to raid Hogger?
---
In my experience PUGs are much more pleasant in vanilla than later expansions. If you spend 2 hours getting a group together and running to the dungeon, you're less likely to fuck it all up by being dicks to one another.
---
Watching this video has served to be a major boost to my morale
---
+35

Chad warrior Vs virgin warrior
---
Actual paladin UI:
---
[https://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k102/raamoz/PaladinUI.jpg](https://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k102/raamoz/PaladinUI.jpg)
---
That link has all the math you need.
---
I'm nor sure if I follow how you just estimated the armor of the warrior in this clip. What do you mean by "you'd have armor cap relative to Sneed"?
---
Anyhow, I looked at the Asmongold clear of Deadmines and Sneed was hitting him (as a 19 warrior with MotW) between 56-71.
---
To be fair the OP claim is that hunter is the best class for *low level world pvp* and you start talking about raid dps. You're both right because you're talking about different things. Level 30 hunters smash other classes if they start the fight at max range, this is independent of their usefulness in level 60 pve encounters.
---
I think it's this. They said they had problems grafting the data to the modern game engine. The engine would look for data in places but not find anything because it's in the old location, not the current location. There is a chance that Elite mobs use the normal mob data as a base, then lookup and apply the elite data such as HP and damage from somewhere else. So without finding the elite damage value stays as the default normal damage. It's something easy to miss in internal testing because the quests and dungeon mechanics all still work fine.
---
Implying you know what drops every where.  I'm not that nerdy.
---
The 2.01 patch had a ton of engine changes that would be very noticeable. Things like how dots and channels calculate spell damage, de-buff limits, what weapon skill does. You would be able to test pretty easily if this was the case.
---
Not entirely. It also became the way it did because the people who designed it left. These were the people with roots in D&amp;D and it definitely shows when you play Classic.
---
Those people were replaced with people with their roots in WoW and little by little important design philosophies were being removed by people who didn't understand why they were important in the first place.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. They have an exact backup that nothing was overwritten on. Source code, database, everything.
---
ItS JuSt a StOneSkIn BuGg 🤪
---
Nope. Some quests just aren't worded in a helpful, concise manner.
---
They are all wrath babies or later
---
Question, if the damage values are off, could that be because they fixed a bug they missed? e.g. I think remember they say that in some cases of high damage from mobs reason was a bug.
---
I did make friends and was very social, especially for raiding. Dungeons were just dungeons though. Got random people together just to run clear them real fast. The LFG did nothing but speed up that process for me. Still hate LFR to this day though.
---
Nature's grasp was pretty great in pvp as a talent, from what I remember. 1 point in it surely wouldn't be missed over the rest of a build if your focus is on PVE content, and a small focus on PVP.
---
As far as mandatory, I don't know if I can speak to that lol
---
&gt; Yeah, they slip after BWL.
---
Lol, I guess I must have imagined all those BWL/MC runs where everyone literally refused to run more than 2 (and hated having to bring even that many) because literally their only use was Tranq shot. It wasn't until fights in BWL, and later AQ/Naxx, started making use of their utility in kiting that Hunters gained a meaningful role. 
---
Denial on this sub runs deep. More xXLegolaS99Xx players around here than I would have thought. Surprising, and yet a good reminder that much of the classic nostalgia today is in players who are still under &lt;30, and were therefore under &lt;15 during classic. Oh well.
---
Yea I kind of just want the RPG experience and take my time. If I do raid at all at max it won't be hardcore or anything.
---
&lt;3
---
Oh I'm stealing this shit, making my own for my class.
---
What if they ask you why you aren't accepting their BattleTag?
---
Classicdb.ch is a private server db btw, to keep in line with the sub's rules let's just say it belonged to VG.
---
I don't have any statistics, but from what I clearly remember (played a lot in vanilla, also a lot of private servers) it was usual for the mobs' spell damage to be much higher than auto attacks. Mobs that did spell damage was in most cases tougher.
---
Not OP, but i found said [“proof”](https://youtu.be/gWxLanshXw4)
---
No joke this was my actual UI right before TBC pre-event began. I was one of those who didnt use addons much. :P

Your dad sounds awesome. I hope you both have lots of fun when Classic fully releases!
---
T2 Helmet is from Onyxia, which is before BWL.
---
Not OP, but i found the [evidence](https://youtu.be/gWxLanshXw4)
---
...do you think all janitors are volunteers or something?
---
This honestly looks in line with the values on Beta. Still worth some looking at by Blizz, I'd say.
---
Not OP, but i found the [video](https://youtu.be/gWxLanshXw4)
---
Release the damn game before I piss myself!
---
Most classes have a distinct role in classic. You still heal or dps but you also are incredibly useful because of one or two major things.
---
Paladins for blessings.
---
Shamans for wind fury totem and wipe recovery.
---
Druids for battle Rez and innervate.
---
Warlocks for summon.
---
Mages for food and drink.
---
Hunters for Tranq.
---
Etc.
---
It’s funny that People forgot the South Park episode.
---
Have fun going against rogues
---
Don't forget that cross faction collusion is bannable on retail.
---
I mean being one shot by a player who's so much higher you can't even tell their level isn't exactly something to get excited about
---
[What do you think about this?](https://youtu.be/WtR0fT3Hz3M)
---
Allow me to see why it was so great? I played in vanilla, I know what the game was like before, during, and after it changed over the past 15 years. 
---
You disagree? With what exactly? You think everyone with a 2004/2005 account deserves beta access right this minute? They are testing the game. You can't have millions of accounts all thrown in at once on what they currently have set up.
---
Definitely plan to run 1H, thanks ill look into them!
---
Not OP, but i found said [proof](https://youtu.be/gWxLanshXw4)
---
2.0.0 was the pre-download for TBC. 2.0.1 was the pre-patch, meaning that's when the servers as well as our clients were updated with the new TBC changes.
---
No, Classic is forked from the last Legion build not BFA build. So it is very unlikely.
---
Thanks for the comment. So, given if I pull a group and am blocking hits from a pull regularly, revenge will be frequently available? Sorry if it sounds daft.
---
ITT, yep
---
If they solely communicate on discord though, it will be very tough to prove wouldn’t it?
---
Why would a Druid healer compete with Rogues?
---
Man these comments are depressing. Up until all the streamers got beta keys and this subreddit become flooded with all there fans everyone seemed pretty chill and altruistic, wanting to have fun. 
---
Where as now alot these comments are "idgaf I need what I want, me and my toxic friends dont give a frick #edge" and "hey guys let's lay off the streamers, they make funny jokes when they ninja and are assholes so its okay" 
---
Hopefully these guys are just the vocal minority...
---
This is just a result of the odd way abilities are unlocked as you level, and how hunter does better the less it (and its' opponent) can actually do. It's not a positive comment. For example, the real god of solo pvp isn't hunter - it's warlock - but that doesn't kick in until they're a bit higher level. Rogues are the king of world PvP until 60 though, and I don't think there's any real contest. There is a huge lack of anti-stealth tools.
---
Maybe we should poll it to death like class selection.
---
Oh? Is this what you would call bitching. I was merely pointing out the level of skill and fun a player can have 1 shotting a level 30. 
---
If that was there BEST time ever in WoW Vanilla then I would argue that they are the ones who are fairly uninterested in what Classic has to offer. 
---
Good try though! Your tunnel visioned salt was worth a read.
---
my account isn't that old but i'm still gonna cry. not salty crying just pure sadness
---
Yeah I think I'll add them later today!
---
I stopped at "here me out".
---
Woah, that's some 3019 shit right there
---
nothing is dorkier than horde players and their zug zug
---
Being nostalgic, I was even worse than him when I've got mine back then:

Recorded by a gnome guildie, one of the good tanks in my tanks team, to whom I gladly passed on that epic MC shield while I still rocked the good ol' blue "Draconian Deflector" :D
---
*grabs pitchfork*
---
Long time alliance player here. Also long time anti gnome. That said, I've decided to playa a gnome for classic
---
Every year a particular server has a gnome run from starting area to booty bay for charity. I finally agreed to do it with him this last go around.  Loathing gnomes I made one ahead of time to level a bit. And as I played that little gnome, I realized that it wasn't too bad. 
---
They appear to run faster because they are so small. They are one of the few races who don't take themselves too seriously. (Night elves are way too cool for school). Their casting animations are pretty cool. Plus their lore is kinda interesting. 
---
And since so many people don't like them and won't play them, your toon will automatically be more unique than the optimized "beautiful" races.
---
And their racials are freaking awesome.
---
I really like Age of Empires 2, and I'm happy to see that it still gets so much love\~
---
Might be a toxicity thing, one thing I noted when playing on Nostalrius PvE was the much lower rate of toxicity compared to the PvP server.
---
I used babelfish back in BC and Wrath to talk to horde all the time so this is nothing new.
---
*starts to sweat*
---
I really like AV aswell. But if people talk about AVs that lasted several days they rarely mention that AVs only lasted that long when way to few players are in the AV. What usually happens is, you join the AV, 20 mins later you realize it is impossible to make any progress with only 15 players and /afk out. On the other hand there are AVs where 40 players rush to the enemy base without any pvp interaction and kill van/drek after 20 mins. But the few AVs that last a few hours and you slowly make progress after turtling in your base for an hour are indeed epic.
---
Technically it was still Vanilla then.
---
this is wholesome. i am so excited we all can experience things like this soon!
---
You just tell everyone to stack in melee and chain battle shout/demo shout while dishing on the main target. T-clap is waste.
---
Going to main a Warlock but most likely will level all of the caster classes at some point.
---
I wish I could say.  Too many things are going on here.  
---
1. He has been grinding some pretty good gear.  BIS stuff for PVP.
---
2. His Mark of the Wild makes it hard tell if the damage is right.  This boss may be doing less because of elemental resist? 
---
3. This was never really a "hard" boss in this dungeon.  I remember fighting him and many of the lurkers around him at the same time with little problem.
---
It is really frustrating because I feel like if I had beta, I would could test elite damage so much better than any of these streamers are bothering to do.  
---
Test with/without buffs.  Gear on/off.  Below level/matching level/higher level than the elites...
---
2 handers were fine till lvl 30, and even later. 
---
I remember only putting on a shield for last boss in Wailing Caverns. 
---
Problem usually was really shit dps and fights taking way too long and then healers being oom due to some patrol coming.
---
Now I want to see an older version of the DH. The modern Era DH feels way too hack &amp; slashy and not really like a wow class.
---
i will be trying night elf druid, mostly because at the long term they save hours of walking and swimming from place to place and also walking to resurect 
---
is there a special fashion item to get for druid? rogues for example have red defias mask, whats the equivalent for druids?
---
Lmao bro.  This one got me.
---
I still remember the asshole who stole [embrace of the lycan](https://www.wowhead.com/item=9479/embrace-of-the-lycan) from me 13 years ago. Never saw it again.

---
Any cloakerz???
---
Follow on question: does Demo Shout do any threat?
---
It's possible that he is remembering aggro ranges before they may have been adjusted in patches prior to 1.12.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
No.
---
Amen!
---
This, don't just blanket state that leather is for rogues and so on, some items are bis even though its not the classes main armor type.
---
I don't see why this needs a post other than to just hate on streamers like 50% of this sub does. Obviously it isn't something that normal people would do. Streamers just provide entertainment for the viewers.
---
I think you’re inventing an argument here - there’s limited hunter spots, I get it. You’re also assuming a hardcore min/max guild. Depending on the guild and a player’s goals, I might not disagree with you. There is a gray area here though and you’re conveniently ignoring it...or trolling. Maybe 5% of guilds will be hardcore, tryhards where everyone is a mage, fury warrior, and teal dress wearing paladin healer.
---
Spent most of my classic playtime at a buddies internet cafe, so I had ragnarok online alt tabbed lol
---
I honestly don't think people realize that Vanilla had addons sometimes.
---
Are you planning on putting this on soundcloud? And podcast apps?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq6mdt/difficulty_of_dungeons_on_the_classic_beta_vs/ it's from this thread.
---
Play it again
---
&gt;Oh? Is this what you would call bitching.
---
Yeah.
---
&gt;Good try though! Your tunnel visioned salt was worth a read.
---
.....lol
---
Agreed. Vanilla, TBC, and the rest.
---
Oh fuck that's bad.  59/60 quillboar tusks \*loots\* 61/60 quillboar tusks. \*destroys extra single for bag space\* 0/60 quillboar tusks
---
What about during the pull? Any AoE?
---
There was one guy on my server named Newlord(we all called him newblord) that was a lvl 60 paladin that just ganked in STV and did nothing else. He was on everyone's gank-on-site list, not just Horde either. This guy would go into the arena and kill any low level horde or alliance the second they entered and anytime he actually had a lvl 60 come to fight him he would just bubble hearth out. Everyone on the server knew and hated the guy, he even made his own guild since no one wanted him.
---
Never got bamboozled in WoW cause it wasn't my first game, but boooooooooooy did I fall for so many "FREE SOJ" scams in Diablo II
---
You only have cleave really
---
Yeh all spells having actual impact makes pvp really fun. I still play on wotlk private server aside to retail for the pvp
---
Yeah this is the correct take. I did all I needed to do back in the day. This time around I'm here for the ride. 🤘
---
Yes, i enabled again like 3 mns to ask in general chat on retail but no one said something like they got it. Its not just for saying like no streamers no latam betas, its more like asking if they gave LATAM players betas and if they dont then when. Just a thought, but i wanted to put it for more information :)
---
They made a brand new beta opt-in category the week before the closed beta came out, actually. They'd be aware of accounts being active despite not being currently subscribed to WoW.
---
Because magnets!
---
They're actual hugely influential in how the game is received by the public as well as what changes are sometimes made to games. I'm not really a huge fan of any particular streamers, but this is Vanilla in the modern age. It's totally different, and I you are wrong if you think that streamers only influence a tiiiiiny percentage of players man.
---
Peggle addon was in wrath...
---
you dont know how that shit works bro, you're just a casual wow player, how could you be expected to learn such a sophisticated method of friend adding
---
why sunglasses?
---
Great video mate. Would be good to get some elite mob #'s if you can.
---
Also, you can get a white polar bear at lvl 11-13, in the start zone. Like the dwarf in the cinematic :)
---
Pretty sure you can poly anything, there was no restrictions based on what I remember but this is a huge topic if thats the case. I'm going to ask my mage friend who played a ton of vanilla mage.
---
Lol. Never met a Chad that was successful so idn :P
---
PvP is life.
---
Pvp servers are way more fun. World pvp events and taking over others cities is just something you can’t get out of any other game
---
Don't be a coward, roll PvP and fight back if someone ganks you
---
Didnt think about  that, but thats not a bad idea at all, I'll  get it uploaded tonight after work
---
Samophlange manual?
---
How do they even work?
---
Just chiming in that I too would like to know what to expect. Macros are the 'egalitarian tool', EVERYONE can use them (vs devs for addons) I'm looking forward to just simple things:
---
* Always using the highest rank spell (avoids bar juggling every time I buy new spells)
---
* Using shift on previous macro to downrank
---
* Using @mousecursor for healer macros/decurse
---
* Using /cast !shoot for my wanding
---
* etc
---
However, ALL of these things are fairly recent additions to wow macros so it's not clear we'll get them
---
If alliance gets high/blood elfs. What does horde get? Goblins/pandaren or maybe tuskars?
---
cool story
---
Predictable. Hence the need for the sentence to begin with.   
---
Thanks for coming :D
---
Never mind that’s Hunter loot
---
All classes have access to engi thus to grenades.
---
The attitude of that boy is way off man... Why did he get a beta invite??
---
You're welcome

---
Nyuk nyuk nyuk
---
so classic had more hp but no armor
---
it did seem stupid for naked beasts to have that
---
Why would that be confined to panthers only? Wouldn't it have reduced all damage?
---
Pserver data is based on videos from actual classic wow
---
current beta data is full of bugs, glitches, and devs aren't even 100% certain about internal numbers sometimes because of the new engine. 
---
so yeah, pserver values are closer to the truth than beta's are right now. 
---
you personally hating pservers doesn't make their values and the community's hard work any less accurate
---
Hunters in classic are a beautiful class. Lots of utility and last-second moves you can make in sticky situations
---
also 'haha nolifer idiot crying about pixels in a 15 yo game get over yourself noob'
---
Pvp because its the full experience, if you go PVE u will get bored
---
stoneskin reduces melee damage taken
---
PvE servers are pretty boring at 60, you can’t just go out and look for fights or help lowbies being attacked, pretty lame
---
Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted ‘KEK, KEK'
---
if you wanna pug a dungeon its really not fair to use ML. everyone should a fair shot at gear. if there's something you're specifically looking for you can tell people in the beginning, and hope no one else needs it, but honestly ML is a bit much. if you want to guarantee your loot run with friends.
---
Gets TF, goes to do ZG like a boss after that, nice!
---
You've done the maths wrong, if he has 41% armour, you need to times by 1.712 to get the unmitigated amount.
---
Right, adding this restriction is not in line with nochanges...  Vanilla was good because of how raw and unfair it was.
---
Blizzard said they were fine with warlocks summoning infernals on lvl5 noobs or releasing enslaved demons in goldshire. They're okay with greifing if that's what players want to do. Hell they even said cross faction collusion is fine...
---
any offspec healer can heal as their dps spec. 
---
I 100% plan on speccing enhance and healing dungeons to roll on healer gear. It's my belief that enhance with INT/SPIR is better than STR/AGI just because the amount of time saved via healing and mana management outweighs that of killing mobs faster and having to drink.
---
Proper hardcore raiders already existed in classic too. Nihilum did clear Naxxramas and got many world firsts... i dont know what happened to the other guilds they were competing against but maybe some of them merged or created a new guild in tbc or something.  
---
Nihilum just is the most famous one of that time.
---
And if you guys are talking about nolifers clearing all the content in months... remember they are a minority and a very clear one at that.
---
Like 95% of all players will never do that, or even try, so even if there is a handful of players who have completed all of classic and tbc in less than a year, that wont make any kind of a difference in the lifespan of the game.
---
Just like its been on retail the entire time... only a small minority of raiders are actually taking part in the world first race. Everyone else are just raiding at their own leasure while still keeping a high standard when it comes to performance, so they do clear the hardest content in the game but just not in 24 hours. (they actually value their real life health :P)
---
In the end those who hardcore an mmo will only make it bad for themselves and run out of content too fast. The problem with retail isnt them but the way the game is designed, you dont even need to be hardcore in BFA to be able to complete everything in a week excluding raids. And that makes the game boring until raid time... and eventually people stop raiding too since logging in 3 times a week isnt worth it anymore.
---
I quit raiding in legion and my guild quit raiding only a month ago, and they literally quit because of this... the game is boring except during raids, and thats 3 times a week for 3 hours. So its not easy to have motivation to keep that going.
---
I had a hard time managing the long HT cast time and rejuv battle with other druids or just flat out getting heal sniped. Any advice? Druid is sooooooo fun, would like to reconsider
---
Wasn’t it reported that stress test participants are more likely to receive beta access in future waves?
---
Imagine voluntarily playing the bad guys of the series
---
LaughingGirls.jpg
---
I trust blizzard has done extensive testing and research on this already, and any lingering issues will be identified and tested again during/after beta. It's still early days yet and it's okay if things are a little off for the time being. Blizzard will take care of it.
---
Blizzard listened to the majority who wanted everything to be easier and more on demand. Tell me it was only a minority that wanted that lmfao
---
He didn't "heal", he simply topped him off after a few fights. They cleaved down two of the Commander Quilboars (lvl 26) without Monkeynews needing a single heal.
---
Hopefully the data will be correct by release. I can see  L8s of certain classes soloing a normal L10 1v1. But exception, not as rule.

Yep I remember when this clicked for me when ulduar a brilliant raid was made pretty much obsolete so fast. Pretty said how they did that place dirty. So many people missed out on it.
---
Ohhh okay, thank you for that! I remember those colors just thought they were non set items. Thank you!
---
All these values are coming from this sacred backup they found, in a backup folder named backup (or something like that), right? I wonder if maybe that backup had 2.0 changes applied to it already. It's not always a case of "This backup has a date from before TBC, so it must be Vanilla values." The backup they used could have been from their master branch while they were building TBC. It could have been from Vanilla, but if they are using some sort of schema management, which they probably are, the changes could have been applied on the database from their working branch and not necessarily a true "1.12 release branch" backup. I would imagine they have better systems in place to avoid things like this, but who knows? It was the wild wild west back then and I still run into issues like this at work in 2019.
---
In that Deadmines video with the level 60 Dwarf Paladin, he seems to be getting hit for 55 by Rhahk'zor at [1:10](https://youtu.be/Y1_jBM9Jkpk?t=69). If he's at DR cap (75%) then that would be a 220 hit without any mitigation... so I'm not sure if he's actually at DR cap.
---
Largely agree with what you're saying but this what's important to me.
---
&gt; Of course I don't have comparative video evidence of every single elite in the game doing correct damage. It's practically impossible to collect  such evidence. 
---
Earlier on you made this statement.
---
&gt; The fact is that there is no categorical issue with mob damage, be that for elites or non-elites, in the beta.
---
So which is it?
---
&gt;but asserting that *all* elites in the beta do too little damage is just adding to the noise. 
---
That's the entire point of the beta. If they can't polish and appropriately check the values for a 15 year old game they shouldn't have bothered at all.
---
When are we going to stop comparing classic wow to classic wow private servers
---
I also have completed 1-10 on a warlock and I had an opposite experience. Everything seemed comparable to previous experiences on both pservers and vanilla proper. I had a few instances of mobs getting stuck in trees, or soul shard related complications, but nothing related to aggro radius or enemy difficulty.
---
Murlocs ran away for me, right into more murlocs.
---
Thankyou
---
Dude even in TBC. Didn’t know about the portal from Silvermoon to UC. Ran through eastern plaguelands even through stealth aggroing mobs a million miles away.
---
Are there any other equivalents to Devilsaur armor for other professions? Kinda sucks that a large group can just lock them down :/
---
You spam it when innervate is on CD I think
---
I always thought brez was overated when I played druid on a few private servers. The person comes back with low mana/health and the worst part is, they don't come back with any buffs.
---
thanks, will check out
---
If this is 1.12 then I don't want it. The mobs do fuck all, you simply need to try in order to fail, where's the fun in that?
---
The point of this test is not to leave it up to veteran players to determine if the game is up to par with what they remember. Look at all the talk going around about the bugs people are reporting that aren't actually bugs. Memories of something that ended about 13 year ago are bound to be flawed.
---
I played in vanilla and a long time after, too. I recognize that there is some advantage in a veteran player seeing this stuff again and providing feedback, but what they really need, as shown by recent blue posts and such, is a group of people who are interested in actually testing the game.
---
Honestly, I do want people who never played vanilla to experience classic. And if some new players get to test it, it might be nice to have a fresh set of eyes on some potential bugs. Yes, I really, really want to play it too, but without a bunch of other players out there all exploring and trying to have a good time, it won't be the same.
---
Yeah this is why I'm doing the orc campaign in beta right now. I'm saving the feeling of the UD campaign for retail when I main my UD Warlock.
---
The problem with resto druids are that only one druid can have Hots up on a target at once. Which means the main druid will get all the gear and do all the healing keeping the important people hotted. This is why you see some druids do massive competitive HPS on fights while the rest do less than half of that. So unless you're that druid you'll just cast Innervate and down-ranked healing touch and wait for the main druid to pass on items.
---
best answer lol
---
PvP!
---
You need NG, as soon as you start playing with it you will see how strong it is.  That being said, I forget the spec exactly, so I forget where the point was taken for NG, but it is needed.  This has definitely been discussed before so I think if you dig in a little you will find plenty of sources with much more experienced Druid’s/players than myself.  I’ve been switching back and forth between Druid and troll/ud priest.  I can’t make up my damn mind lol good luck!

I played pretty hardcore back from Beta 2004 till 2006ish, was in the Guild Ascension which was Horde’s best guild at the time on Destromath. If you remember me, would love to connect. LF Guild for myself (rolling Rogue) and my girlfriend (rolling Priest) (she’s never played, coaching her for release in Aug). Looking to reexperience the awesome fun it was to be in a high tier guild, building and helping each other out, the late night raiding fun of MC/Ony/BWL etc. Looking to kick it outside Orgrimmar dueling the guild homies and other guys practicing/polishing up on my PvP. Looking to cheer and get excited for all of the raid gear drops that me and my fellow guildies get. Looking for serious but fun times to be had in this realm. Also, looking for the guildies I used to play with!
---
PST (aka Please Send Tell)

PS - Hope everyone is hyped and enjoys themselves with WoW Classic :)
---
Both? There can not be a categorical issue with mob damage, because some mobs are demonstratably dealing correct damage.
---
That's gonna be a no for me dog, rather finally have ogres, and I'm an alliance guy.
---
And spotify playlists!
---
No one used to spec as a dedicated healer while leveling. I healed every dungeon as a shadow priest just fine.
---
Don’t be so sensitive baby boo.
---
That was a crime indeed.
---
That bfa player get prio to classic players.
---
It wasn't confined to panthers. Nobody said it was. Go read up on what happened instead of pestering me.
---
I really don't understand why people beloeve retail is better for casual players.
---
Dont think so.
---
When is Vanilla played out?
---
Is there any PvP going on here? Either world or BGs
---
You make it sound like doing what the majority wants is always a good thing. But a vocal minority shouldn't hold any power - that's fair to *you*. 
---
Blacks in America
---
&gt;  they're weird and fuggly
---
But the only time you're looking at your character is 3 seconds during character select...
---
Exactly! Game development is expensive AF and no genre is more expensive than an MMO.
---
Blizzard sees players complaining about not seeing Naxx in Vanilla or Sunwell/Illidan in TBC, so they create multiple tiers of raids in Wrath so 'casuals' can see Icecrown.
---
Now people are seeing endgame content, but they are complaining because they get the story later than the more dedicated raiders. Blizzard sees the masses complain and creates LFR - a downtuned version of all raids that allow casuals to enjoy raiding at the same time as the dedicated.
---
...now everyone complains that LFR cheapens the experience and the community of raiding. People leave the same because they got exactly what they wanted.
---
...but this is Blizzards fault. Somehow.
---
Thanks!! I hope you will have fun as well :D
---
Is this a genuine question 😂 pvp my bruttha, this is wow classic my nibba
---
Hate to break it to you but most vanilla guilds were like this, big streamer or not. Being guild master over 40-50 players (more with joint guilds) gave you a ton of power. There’s a reason most scarab lords were thunderfury wielding warrior MT guild masters
---
Well, I'll admit I feel a bit silly now, because I've tried to find the post I was thinking about.  It had a kind of snarky remark in it, but for the life of me I can't find It.  So I'll just chalk it up to mis-remembering.  Perhaps I was wrong.
---
I deleted the manual with no issue.
---
Probably after a year and a half? I mean for me, and I would think most after fully hearing your character and an alt the content will be stale and you’ll log in less and less until quit
---
It took me 2.5 hours to install by disc and then another 2 hours to download the patches/updates Then after playing for like 10 hours I logged off and set my computer to defrag while I slept with the4 hopes it would help speed things up and decrease load times.
---
You can get the dropdown if you opt into a PTR account [here](https://account.blizzard.com/games) but it's not like that is going to change anything in regards to classic.
---
I played a druid healer a ton in tbc/wrath and on pservers.  Worth noting: You can't do the regrowth build \*and\* have swiftmend.
---
Not saying druids aren't great. They're great (and boring. &lt;3 spending all day casting rank 3 and rank 4 healing touch while listening to priests crow about being the god-tier healers while begging for innervate) but you might as well say that healer priests bring both power infusion and spirit of redemption
---
ass blasted
---
Na you're spot on those myrmidons kicked my ass even with descent gear
---
I'll be using a quest helper immediately. I can do alot of it by memory sure, but zee kiddo would steal my gaming time, so I'd rather not come back to the keyboard feeling like a lost Travolta.

I'd love to get in and step by step go through each mob, check their damage values against the bestiary released in tbc (damage should not have changed from 1.12 in most cases) and see what sort of reductions we're getting with armor etc...
---
But Blizzard won't give me a beta invite -.-
---
Not only Luna frames, but you could also use clique+Grid.
---
Play what's fun. Knowing your class is much more important than min/max. Bad skill with great gear is still bad...
---
I've heard both sides. People needing to restart, and people claiming it 'just appeared'.
---
Enjoy being farmed in the starting cave in AV, you hunchbacked troglodytes! For the Alliance!!!
---
I think they did have armor, it just didn't show when you used Beast Lore?
---
Yea, you also have the ability to increase your block rating by 75% until your next block. You will need to get agro with other stuff too, but “just spamming sunder armor” will leave you with no threat because you don’t have the rage to keep the spam on. In dungeons i hardly ever use sunder.
---
I'll do this if I get in.
---
Play what you want, but understand sweaty raid leaders may prioritize priests that rolled min max values. Does it matter? Only if you care about getting into sweaty raids.
---
No one will care in dungeons. 
---
In raids it is nice to be a dwarf, I played ne priest for vanilla and regretted it every time the tank couldn’t stance dance. 
---
In truth though, if the tank is half decent it will make no difference.
---
Beta is working, pretty sure it will on release too
---
Man the furbolgs are just as cancer for night elf’s.  There’s one spot that the packs are like 3 deep. Hell on earth.
---
You are talking about classes, that is a balance issue. AV (while slightly favouring alliance) is the same for everyone. Granted getting 30 AV marks for champion gear would be quite a bit harder with the old no-rush AV, i’m confident if there would be a poll about which AV ppl (that played both versions) want, the pre1.12 version would probably win by a kilometer (eu here ;) )
---
I think heroic strike causes a high amount of threat, but only use it as a rage dump. It cost alot and doesn't do much for a tank.
---
Yeh, probably.
---
Frost Resist and Stoneform are really nice, can also track treasure. Personally if you're going Priest i would go Gnome for increased mana pool. In all actuality though, play what you want, you don't have to minmax. Those who will play more casually and actually play the game are most likely going to find the most enjoyment from Classic. I'm planning on rolling Gnome Mage specifically for the /train emote lol
---
So classic beta mobs are actually hitting harder on average than private servers. And also have way better scripting/AI. Not surprised as honestly from what i've seen on the beta, it doesn't look easier than private servers most of the time. And some things look way, way harder too, like Verdan the Everliving dealing 3x more dmg on classic than private servers. The speed lvling beta streamers are also reporting slower lvling times than on classic servers.
---
thank you for this. This has to be one of the more 200-2006 esq videos that actually has more than 2 pixels. You must have been recording on a NASA level computer at the time lol
---
10/10 shitpost. I approve.
---
For sure. There were so many posts on the forums and such, complaining about the smallest inconvenience back in pre-cata.
---
Thank you, I’ll download the client and try it out!
---
I'm getting real sick of all these condescending articles in the games media about how people are incorrectly reporting bugs. False positives are a necessary part of the testing process too.
---
Not sure what you mean here bud?
---
Hunter is probably the most entertaining class in pvp besides protection warrior. Having to time shots and manage your pet is much more than any class has to do
---
huh? WHat's that?
---
This guy doesn't plan ahead and wants a hasty decision when everyone is quitting... I think talking about this subject at this point will allow for a longer more thought out discussion about this games future.

I really think Classic+ servers would be a benefit to the games longevity, as long as it doesn't raise the level cap or make the game more casual. Would rather wanna see more "sidegrades"; more raids and dungeons that give a fuller experience during leveling and at 60, without ruining the philosophy of Classic.
---
Fear ward is very strong in raids. Some people will say that it doesn't matter, but fear ward can trivialize many fight mechanics. Guilds would rather have a dwarf priest over another race if all else is equal. 
---
Of course, that's not to say that it's impossible to raid as a non-dwarf priest. Being a better raider and better priest than someone who's a dwarf will still get you a raid spot. If your guild already has 2-3 priests that are dwarves you can easily convince them to let you roll nelf or human, but if it's the other way around they're going to force you to run dwarf
---
Good points I like you
---
It was the only raid we had left!
---
Play what you want lol it literally doesn't matter unless you are going for world 1st. Humans are great for the extra spirit. Ignore anyone who says you have to play dwarf.
---
We have in the past, I'll pass it on to Dylo and see if he wants to run the survey again.
---
hmm yeah that's possible too. was one of the few videos I could find but realistically doesn't seem like it'd be genuine
---
Because I need to play now I dont want to wait around
---
Maggot Eye was only ever hard cuz of the 2 adds he has with him, hes no harder than any other mob at that level.
---
So, did you kill him with the 2 adds aswell?
---
For 5/10 man content you can get a decent 2 hander with healing stats (verrigan's fist, hammer of the grand crusader, Lavastone hammer) and contribute to damage to burn mobs down. Give yourself a seal, hit the mobs a bit, and keep your tank / dps alive. I wouldn't focus on using mana for dps purposes outside of this unless your group is just smashing through dungeons with no problem.  In which case it's OK to do a holy shock or a judgement here and there.  
---
As for holy paladins in pvp, they perform very well. Your job in pvp is a support role. Heal other people, keep beneficial blessings on them like freedom / might / protection when things get hairy, etc., and use hammer of justice to stun enemy players at key moments, such as when an enemy player is about to die but is also the target of a big heal. Run up and HoJ the healer so your group can take the low health player out.
---
Also you should always roll for a chest using /roll in a party
---
Really crazy seeing these streamers totally disregarding the correct behavior when it comes to looting chests in a group. It’s just the respectful thing to do. Just because you stream doesn’t mean you’re entitled to more or free items. You’re a player, just like everyone else.
---
Retail boys will be gone after 2 months.
---
&gt;Retail isn't an MMO either.
---
I might not have chosen my words carefully enough to get my point across.
---
Retail focused on mechanically aiding the MMO aspects (Playing together with a large number of other players), but in the process they actually destroyed the community.
---
Classic on the other hand, focused on the RPG aspects, and let the players organize playing together themselves.
---
They each focused on a part of MMO-RPG, but only classic ended up as an actual MMORPG, retail became an Action-RPG/Looter-RPG
---
As I pointed out:
---
&gt;Retail is almost closer to the Looter Shooters or Diablo than an MMO RPG, and if you are looking for that kind of experience it's good. 
---
Retail is not a bad game if you want something closer to Destiny, because it has some interesting loot philosophy (if you look away from Azerite/Titanforge, the base loot system is quite good compared to some loot focused games). Classic is far superior if you want an MMORPG.
---
I talked very briefly in classic (I was like 12 and didn't understand video games that much so I was bad) but if I remember heroic strike used to cause high threat. There is also thunderclap. But def have at least 2 stacks of sunder armor on a target. 3 is ideal but if it's a large group of enemies 2 should be alright
---
And people wonder why most players dont like vanilla and blizzard upgraded over the years away from vanilla's style. WoW is amazing when people aren't being dicks. Problem is most people are dicks. Thats why no one talks in retail anymore. They got tired of the asshats 10 years ago.
---
Ranged can't glance/dodge/parry only miss and so it should only be missing. Miss chance on white hits are bugged which is why people are just ranging down the lvl 39 elementals in arathi for the WW axe quest.

I thought so. Truth is, I was only 2 months into the guild when he got the ingot. DKP wasn't a factor. One hell of a great reply though ;)

this tea is fucking hot
---
The closest thing to my knowledge is felcloth, used in a ton of stuff, but a more common drop and has more farmable mobs.
---
If you are in a guild, you should have a reasonable chance to combat any mafia that forms. If you aren't in a guild, you will probably just have to pay the price for it. If you really don't want the competition, roll PVE, without polymorphic griefing it should be fair game to get the dinos.
---
Considering that the Trolls are probably the best smelling race on Horde, that’s one hell of a low bar.
---
&gt; There is a huge lack of anti-stealth tools
---
One of which is notably hunters mark. I personally don't think you're giving the class enough credit in PVP but I'll concede they are low tier raid dps.
---
Hope they fix this
---
You can always toggle it on and off. So lets say if you have a cancerous under water quest or something. Lets say a cave entrance where you spent 4-5 minutes and cant find it. Then you can toggle the addon and find it.  
---
Or could use zone channel too. I'm sure a lot of player would also be looking for the same quest if its hard to find etc.
---
Are you talking 5 mans? It's fine in small group, but it may be better to take a dps with proper CC to avoid the wipe to begin with. 
---
Judgement of justice and curse of reck can save groups. It doesn't mean you should roll a sub optimal spec and say they compensate.
---
Also because it would be another gold sink? if you want to learn other mount ridings its another 900g or whatever for each race riding unless im mistaken?
---
Didn’t he say he wouldn’t play classic or it would be bad?
---
Some people are a little salty because people here went on and on about how 100% accurate pservers supposedly are. Now they are proven to be wrong and some people just like to be right.
---
Also, most pservers use a patched versions of the 1.12 client that's partly 2.0.1.
---

You = priest cuz u is their bitch.
---
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You're aware that they already solved why the ***panthers*** were doing reduced damage right? It was because stoneskin totem lingered until players logout.
---
Yup people don't seem to get that the earliest patches had weaker classes, majorly so in some cases, and this contributed to the perception of harder content.
---
Can tell yo for sure that not all vanilla players got in. My friend and I have played since the original beta and neither of us got in either stress test or closed beta
---
An off-hand shortening of the word “asperger” from asperger syndrome. It’s basically the same meaning as retard but is used on twitch and in wow to mean socially awkward idiot
---
&gt; I played ne priest for vanilla and regretted it every time the tank couldn’t stance dance.
---
Well seeing as how stances aren't a thing in Current I imagine it could take new tanks in Classic a while to adjust to that.  Watching Preach's videos on his Prot Warrior - it's a lot harder than it looks or at first glance.
---
This is amazing
---
I've played a ton of private servers since around 2011, on and off. I've never had someone not invite a healer to a dungeon because they weren't dwarf. Shit, when you run dungeons you really take any fucking healer willing to come, you don't really get to be nitpicky about race or class, as long as their gear is OK. Unless you want to wait 2 hours to fill the group, and nobody wants that.  
---
The only time your race choice will impact you is if you try to join a raiding guild that's around semi-hardcore or even bigger tryhards. I've raided naxx with human priests in the raid and we were fine. You can easily find a pretty casual guild to clear mc+bwl and probably aq with as non-dwarf, as long as you know what you're doing, bring your consumables and show up in time, you'll have your spot.
---
2015 Macbook Air runs like a champ currently.
---
I guess since this is the classic sub it could also be a reference to the old 'theres no girls on the internet'/'girls dont play wow' thing.
---
I realllly wanna play a Druid but hate how they’re sort of a chunky class with not a lot of value
---
Yes. Battle shout too.
---
It's just an age old argument. I wish people would stop caring about how it affects them and their perception.
---
Min-makers have spent years shitting on casuals, and vice versa. Just make your meme and move on. There's not really any ground to cover on this subject anymore.
---
I swear it's like people arguing about Tame Impala before and after currents.
---
I didn't say anything like that. My post is about the players that are whining about not receiving beta access when they are one of millions with old accounts.
---
What are some of the things streamers have said are bugs but are actually from vanilla wow
---
I didn’t play vanilla, but I’m playing classic.  It’s not really common knowledge.  
---
I only know a little bit about gear being wacky, like holy paladins wearing tons of cloth.
---
Precast and predict people that would stand in a fire.
---
So Private servers have turned out to be the more challenging and rewarding vanilla experience?
---
I'm looking forward to the Warrior set + draconian deflector. Such a great look.
---
Thanks dude! Haven't changed my wallpaper in YEARS. This is something that I could look at for another 5 years. Great quality too! Hard to find decent ones online.
---
Can't wait for Classic :)
---
This one is more dope than your first attempt, looks really cool.
---
Tyrion crying over his siblings, knowing they were all flawed creatures but still family...  
---
PD showed his acting chops this episode.
---
Stupid sweaty people! Get AC!  /s  Makes me wonder if Frost mage could be adapted into a healing spec on the basis that he heals you by cooling you down... lol
---
first of all WTF? xD
---
But best thing is Lock / Warri / Priest
---
so u can soulstone the prist and never ever wipe
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
You will always get invited to an Onyxia raid.
---

---
Petridge Farm remembers.
---
Is beast lore a client side thing strictly, or does it go off of server info?
---
If it uses server info, isnt comparing it to pservers entirely useless since we know their values arent correct?
---
This sub acts like they have never seen a streamer before....in 2019....
---
orc hunter is the most op race for hunters though lol
---
You can just ignore these threads if you want.
---
It's relevant discussion for some people
---
A healer that went absolute oom can even intentionally die for druid BR to get back alive with some mana and heal further.
---
Lmao first time I read the title I thought it was about moral values. Fuck I'm still waking up
---
My reddit name says it all
---
&gt; it it self underdtably good.
---
Tongues?
---
Play what you want bro. Just be aware that raid leaders tend to favor dwarf priests over humans because they're much more valuable to the raid/guild. On private servers there's a big stigma attached to rolling a human priest and people tend to bully you for intentionally gimping yourself and your guild just so you can look cooler.
---
They do have an original 1.12 client afaik. I would love some footage from that too :)
---
Fear Ward is a crutch just like the Undead racial. It always annoyed me seeing other tanks relying upon it when they could just learn to stance dance. Especially when most bosses that had fear made the ground shake just prior to casting it (Onyxia, Nefarian, etc). I used to see people asking specifically for Dwarf Priests in Trade chat.
---
&lt;-- Human Protection Warrior
---
As someone that played dwarf priest in classic, onyxia sticks out as a good example. Warriors can berserker rage out of fear, but onyxia has a fear cooldown that is a couple of seconds shorter, so berserker rage isn't up yet. This is a moment fear ward shines.
---
Oh wasn't that footage of the warfront every one expected?
---
Doo do
---
I did a bit of dual leveling on ND a few months back with a druid friend and once you have those two roles sorted, its super quick to cherry pick which DPS class you want to take.
---
Being a tank you will be making healer friends along the way to 60, so just get them on-board and the rest will be a breeze.
---
As we're all sharing the world, please apply etiquette and be mindful for other players. This game is incredibly community based so we should band together and assist as much as possible.
---
suck the blizzard dick good boy
---
I would assume this is where the layering comes into play.
---
To be fair, he has almost full level 30 BIS for 1v1
---
get tested
---
/u/QQLESSPLZ_ is making fun of you for not knowing the difference between here and hear.........
---
Guess people will just always be upset when others want to play a game other than the way that they think it should be played.
---
They also have tremor totem, which alliance has no access to.
---
Id say every class had at least 1-2 cool tiers from vanilla. But agreed, warlocks had the best overall! Best looking set in my opinion is paladin T2.
---
He responded with "I don't see how dungeon.io would work blablabla". Obviously fucking not mate, it's a joke!
---
Which games have you played that released classic versions?
---
Yup
---
Wtf no
---
Instead of protection warrior? Would you mind elaborating?
---
Wow, so much misinformation in one post!
---
&gt; Delusions from hunter players aside, it's the worst class in classic by some stretch barring major changes to it. 
---
Wrong lol. They are excellent for farming, pvp, and trueshot aura. They are also without a doubt the easiest class to level. Marksmanship is OK dps. You just have to understand that your dps will pretty much always be middle of the road and your pet is almost always going to die mid-fight without proper management. Tranq shot needed for a few encounters as well. You trade off damage for utility in classic and pets are a pretty great utility, it's simple.
---
&gt; beast mastery was used in PvP which actually gave hunters a 15 second window every 3 minutes to be 'good' by activating Beastial Wrath. The equivalent of an Arcane/fire "POM PYRO" trinket mage, except of course hunters still needed 20 seconds to kill someone as opposed to mages needing two spells. 
---
First of all, beastial wrath is a 2 minute cooldown. Secondly, comparing a hunter to a POM/Pyro mage is fucking laughable. You said yourself hunters still need 20 seconds to kill someone (wrong) so you contradicted yourself in the same sentence.
---
&gt; With regards to other classes, all classes that *can* heal are healers. Exclusively. There are no tanks other than warriors, but they can switch to arms and pvp. Fury's a joke.  
---
Wrong. Druids and Paladins can both reliably tank 5-man dungeons and a handful of raid bosses. It has been done. Optimal? Not really, but definitely possible. You have 40 raid slots. Bringing one or two, even three hybrid DPS class is not going to make or break your raid.
---
&gt; Warlocks are the "I solo everyone in pvp" class but only one of 40 raiders will be allowed to be a warlock, and literally just to help mages deal more damage. 
---
Lmao. Warlocks are decent DPS up until AQ40 then they are some of the best DPS depending on the fight. They can easily compete with mages who are not abusing ignite. Most raids will bring multiple warlocks for extra soulstones, quicker summons, more healthstones. One warlock is a laughable assumption, since they buff eachother with improved shadow bolt. Bringing a shadow priest into the equation further justifies bringing more warlocks. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
&gt; Mages and rogues are much better than any other DPS role in the game for PvE, and both perform better in PvP too. 
---
Fury warriors out DPS mages until AQ40. Rogues never out DPS warriors, even in Naxx gear. Even Warlocks out DPS rogues at that point. (Depending on fight) In PvP you are generally right unless a healer is thrown into the equation, at which point a warrior becomes an unstoppable killing machine.
---
&gt; Hunter is the biggest victim of that by a considerable distance. They became a meme in the community and the playerbase itself basically considered playing a hunter equivalent to being an idiot, so the player behind the class was also unwanted. 
---
???? People aren't as ignorant as you make them out to be. Yes, there's idiot hunters... But idiots come in all classes. Boomkin and ret are much more memey and much bigger victims if you ask me.
---
&gt; Having said all that, I do not know the extent of the changes they'll be making for classic - but without major reforms for hunter, it would be advisable to pick *anything* else. 
---
Pretty sure the mailbox and shit aren't going to effect class balance much.
---
I mean I didn't play Priest in Classic but from what I gather it's fairly easy and even boring.  Like you just stand there regenerating mana and casting the occasional heal on people, lol.
---
Because you need a bfa sub
---
Lineage 2 (first mmo I got into before wow was released), runescape, archeage
---
Added, #16
---
implying I dont alt tab everyone in pvp
---
I read that in malfurion's voice
---
Sorry, meant lesser heal.
---
Not being able to swap armour in combat
---
/Sit not granting Crit procs
---
Something about quests not tracking properly
---
To name a few. I think blizzard have addressed most of these
---
Can't wait to gank filthy horde scum in STV
---
&gt;ger crits is p-server thing? I distinctly remember people saying that if you sit, you will be crit when I played 1.12 Van
---
you will be crit the p-server thing is it triggers abilities that activate on crit, but that aparently was not how live was setup.
---
I’ll be using it for sure but also not going to rush myself
---
I didn't say it was garunteed... But your odds are definitely higher. We were all in the vanilla beta aswell. My 2 buddies, and my  brother werw day 1... My acc started Jan 5 2005.. We all got in on the 2nd wave. None of them have bfa. If the age of the acc wasn't weighted in the selection process.. The odds would be astronomical for our whole group to make the cut.
---
just gotta find a server where they aren't
---
Mobs having the same base damage doesn't necessarily mean they are hitting for the same damage on characters if there is a mitigation issue.  One mitigation bug has already been found on the beta.  This video is great but it is still useful to see how much the mobs hit for instead of just comparing beast lore damage values.
---
Just water coming out from my eyes, I'm not crying.
---
Prot warrior has alot of shit to manage, whereas pretty much every other class is 1-3 button spam
---
&gt; and people tend to bully you for intentionally gimping yourself and your guild just so you can look cooler.
---
See, this is what I was talking about.  Fuck those people.
---
Daze wasn’t working correctly at all. Any evidence to backup that an absorb shield should prevent daze?
---
I don't think that's even a thing. You would come back with no raid buffs. Wanding/first aiding while waiting for some mana Regen would be far better than blowing a cooldown like that. It's even worse on alliance if somebody has wisdom up on any boss or add and you add in BoW.
---
I just can't see somebody purposely doing that. You would even risk getting healed by other players as well.
---
Ahh meant in an above post
---
I go for gnomes first.
---
Beta invites aren’t given out to vanilla players or even old accounts, my friends have gotten in and they started legion/bfa.
---
He doesn't even mention gear, talents and things of that nature. It's as far from proof as you can possibly get.
---
The easy choice: PvP or....
---
This is what Vanilla pvp is supposed to be lol
---
I am somewhere between these, I think.
---
This is less of a streamer problem and more of an Asmongold specific problem.
---
And wotf
---
I didn't ask for any of this.
---
Not to mention he died anyway from Dots after the Lock died
---
PVP is the true experience
---
As much as I hate this too. Deal with it. Can’t be controlled. 
---
Only power you have is to camp asmongold until he gets all his poon lovers helping him. Then do it again. Ez baby
---
Could you share a link for that addon?
---
Dude what the fuck no it won't. Avoid asmon/soda and you'll be fine.
---
Can't tell if this is satire or not.
---
Also true!
---
They don't care about the testing, beta is just for marketing and creating hype to play buggy release.
---
I think they might be waiting for wow retail patch to drop and be out for a bit. Maybe they dont want to split streamers between the two or to impact the world first race of the new content. Or may e they just dont want the load of both on their servers at once.
---
Oh god... The rage that would cause.
---
ogre´s would be cool
---
I’ve played WoW in 2004-2005 this is the best Song ever.. so true! Heueheu Classic is comming back AGO/2019
---
People forget that half the world mobs are elite. So to complete 40% of the quests in the game, many that are chains, you'll need a group and people to help you. You cannot solo things like you could in TBC where they made all the elites normal mobs.
---
Shamans can tank because they can hold aggro with rockbitter weapon enhance and earth shock which generates high aggro. Due to this, it's usually single mob tanking though, not aoe.
---
&gt; you personally hating pservers doesn't make their values and the community's hard work any less accurate
---
You accusing anyone who doesn't kiss the feet of pserver devs as "hating pservers" doesn't actually make it true.
---
The classic devs have the numbers, but that doesn't mean there aren't bugs surrounding how those numbers applied (like the recent Stoneskin bug).
---
The pserver devs didn't even have numbers, as you readily admit. So they don't even have solid foundation to base things on, it's all guesses all the time.
---
Yes, but they're prioritized.
---
... Yes, because that's their daoly job? If they provide entertainment, they get money. What sort of dumb comment was that?
---
A ready to use addon is ShaguScore https://shagu.org/ShaguScore/
---
It's extremely useful during leveling, since it allows you to filter out undergeared people at dungeon invites. Works like a charm.
---
It's also quite good at high level, as it provides a "glance" value representation of how much purple they got, which you can only really obtain via raids (or high pvp rewards) which gives a generic idea for their potential. For anything else /inspect.
---
And to resolve the Vendorstike situation, the addon has a full list of all the wearable items (yes there's not that many of them) with manual gearscore for each. So there's a general score value that you'll figure out what counts as "good enough" for MC entry, etc.
---
Sit crit will not be in the game this is confirmed not a bug
---
Yeah while leveling on vanilla private servers i probably encountered 10 guys of the opposite faction that made me want to choke them out irl. Only people I wanted to choke out during BFA were members of my own faction or even myself...
---
Didn't even pick up on it after his comment, If you could be so kind as to tell my carer i'm off licking windows somewhere i'd be grateful.
---
What a load of crap. Youre comparing preferences in a game to racism and social oppression. Get some reality.
---
I don't remember anymore. I want to say it was a helm or a weapon.
---
WoW is the way it is because over years the new Devs started replacing the devs that actually had good vision for what an MMO is about.
---
Welp, this is disappointing to hear.
---
Oh right forgot
---
As much as I hate this as well. It can’t be controlled. Deal with it.
---
Camp Asmongold until he calls for help. Camp him when he’s not streaming. Ez baby
---
In all honesty, I think it will be fucking hilarious watching streamers trying to hide their anger while getting camped. 
---
GL
---
Who cares about 20 most popular streamers when we're hoping for 1m+ players or whatever?
---
We had 'celebrities' even 15 years ago, you had extremely popular PvPers and people making chars on their servers to spam them, chase them around etc. You had PvE stars also, guys like Kungen, his Nihilum etc
---
Dude have you seen the world lately?
---
Happily in the middle, it's comfy here
---
The last point on HOTW is taken for the NG skill. Thats why I asked this ! I'v read all this afternoon threads about this and there is no clear answer ahaha. Some played 0/30/21 and some 1/29/21. I think NG is better if I will pvp a lot and the -4% bonus of the last HOTW is not a big trade off for having NG but I can be wrong lol :p

While I was playing on pservers, I spent a lot of time reading the various bug report. The number of peoples that was pulling out really strange "source", preaching them like it was the gospel was astonishing. Also, "dev" clearly using "Blizz-like" only when it was in their advantage and also clearly bias vs some classes/spec or items was only really weird to see. This was my main concern about a official Classic Server when they said the code was gone, that those peoples would try to push their agenda. But clearly, the real dev do have access to the old code if they can class those report as "not a bug" so rapidly and with such accuracy. Can wait for the final Blizzard answer on level 60 war rage generation and certain items proc rate (Ironfoe)
---
Here’s a wrench. 
---
Those numbers mean nothing if you don’t know what gear they’re wearing or buffs they have. 
---
Most players running around likely have gear for their level because bop are plentiful and the price isn’t outrageous. 
---
Try playing a warrior or Paladin using only quest items and your opinion will change.
---
Everyone I've talked to says resto shamans are probably the most popular healer spec for raids simply because you need 8 groups and totems only affect party members, so they generally bring 1 per group.
---
no it doesn't. if i see a streamer walking around ironforge i'm not even going to know they are a streamer
---
TM shall burn brightly once Classic comes out.... I vow it.
---
That put a anule um my face!! It is not about the race to 60. It is all about having fun!!
---
You’re such a cry baby. Find a server without a massive streamer and you’ll be good. 🤮

Few hours a day doesn't sound casual to me. Few hours a week is casual.

I love you for making this

I love you both

I was in an sfk run on beta over the weekend. It’s me another random and 3 friends. No one dies, but the three friends sure try to get themselves killed—but you know I’ve been playing for 15 years, you gotta do some pretty retarded shit to die with me healing you in sfk.
---
Bullshit drops the whole run. Then Arugal. the random is a hunter? The 3 friends are a rogue mage and warrior. 
---
The robes of arugul drop. I roll the mage rolls, then the rogue and warrior roll. Rogue wins it then starts laughing about it on discord says he meant to need to he could trade to mage bro. 
---
At the beginning of the run we had said if it was smooth we’d all be down to farm it for a bit.
---
Left discord and have 3 people on ignore already.
---
You are grossly overestimating the amount of streamers who are going to stick around and play classic in any large capacity.  Everything you are saying about streamers on classic could apply to streamers on retail, but it doesn't.  A lot of these streamers play with their community, or are hardcore raiders or pvp themselves.  I've been playing since 2005, and have played retail this entire time.  Not once have I been impacted by a streamer, and classic will be no different.
---
Also, have you considered just enjoying the game?  Grouping with friends or like-minded individuals would let you avoid streamers altogether.
---
Sylvanas burned Teldrassil down, Alliance sacked Undercity and captured Saurfang. Alliance lets Saurfang go and Sylvanas tries to kill him. Sylvanas later gets Derek Proudmore’s body, resurrects it, then proceeds to try breaking his will so she can mind control him. Baine disapproves and frees him, sending him to Jaina. Sylvanas imprisons Baine and kills a dude that helped. Knaifu (shadow priest artifact weapon) comes back, tricks you into letting her free by giving your soul to N’Zoth and Sylvanas gets her hands on Knaifu.  
---
And coming soon, in 8.2: &gt;!Sylvanas purposefully has both fleets fight near Nazjatar, which causes Azshara to then open a hole in the ocean and trap everyone there. It is implied that Azshara awakens N’Zoth using the Heart of Azeroth at the end of the raid.!&lt;
---
God damn, that reminds me.
---
Back in Vanilla at the point where my guild had all of MC on farm status except for Ragnaros. We didn't have many druids in the guild - maybe 2 that raided at that point and they already had their full tier 1 sets at this point. So, we brought a pretty fresh level 60 that had just joined the guild with us - even helped him do his attunement during the day before the raid.
---
Almost. Every. Single. Boss. Dropped Druid gear. This guy literally went from wearing mostly greens and never having stepped foot most of the higher level instances to having something like 7/8 of his Tier 1 set in one sitting.
---
With our DKP rules you'd still have to spend a minimum amount of DKP on the item even if you were the only one that needed it and even if you didn't have the DKP to spend. So, he had a comically huge DKP debt for quite a few weeks.
---
Why does turning something into a sheep heal it, anyway?
---
for my guild i just kept an alt which we used for our gbank. people would just send whatever they wanted to store to that toon and if you needed something you just asked and i would send it over. i kept a log of stuff updated on our guild site so everyone could see what was available. (i probably will use a google spreadsheet this time)
---
Depends on how much free time you have. If you want Wpvp and have lots of free time then roll PvP server. If you don't for example if you only have a limited time to farm consumes for raid night and can't afford fighting gankers then I would roll PvE.
---
It's not in line with no changes no, but seeing as blizzard is already adding rightclick report and loot trading, it's not surprising to see this.
---
Man this always slaps
---
PvP is true MMORPG in my opinion, i have never even thought about playing anything else
---
Oh yeah there are better specs/classes to go with to be optimal.
---
 Im just saying Druids have a bit more to offer than innervate regardless of spec the they choose.  When I was feral I would have to pop out and heal if needed, vise versa when I was restro. The utility they can offer in a pinch is the best part of Druids.  Boomkins are great aswell if you are willing to spend gold on pots and what not to keep your mana in check.
---
He says in the first 30 secs of the video that Beast Lore is bugged on the beta to not display armor values and bugged on the private server to display percentage of health.
---
Error #132.
---
What does it mean to create a new prefix? :)
---
You’re missing the point dude. Trying to find a group for (x) instance by spamming world/general chat to get an item isn’t the point that makes it amazing and exciting. 
---
It’s the sense of COMMUNITY that this yields. Sure, spamming chat can be frustrating - but once you find the group, you start actually having to TALK to your group members. Thus, you make friends (and possibly enemies). 
---
THAT is what is so amazing and exciting. 
---
BFA is a piece of shit game, and your denial to that fact is quite entertaining 😄
---
No problem, enjoy.
---
I've got one 5.5 inch floppy for ya
---
Source checks out and is appreciated.
---
This is exactly why I think going the OSRS route with playerbase votes on changes and additions is no bueno and should not happen.
---
&gt;and then countless worthless streamers with single-digit views
---
I was on your side until this.  No streamer is "worthless".
---
It does, specially if they whine on forums/discord/reddit afterwards
---
The game will belong to the players who play it, most of us will just enjoy our game without really paying attention to them.
---
That's his streaming persona ... He's not serious .. - .-
---
Is that tiny person a dude or a woman? It looks funny
---
For the launch maybe, imagine the second layering gets removed on a server where the huge streamers are on.
---
It's true. Forums are a safe space for casuals against try hards, and in game is where they have to suffer the git gud scrubs. So the cycle continues.
---
They have said that we might see TBC / WOTLK etc, whatever community wants if this becomes a success.
---
TBC is everything I want tbh, I could play it forever
---
That does what DPS classes are you looking for?
---
Revenge has a 5 second cooldown and will probably be used every time it's up, but unless your group is perfectly following your kill order a cleave and thunder clap might not be enough to keep aggro on the mobs you're not focusing. A quick sunder on the mobs later in the kill order is a great way to keep threat after gaining initial aggro. Sunder is the only true on demand aggro generator you have. No waiting for your next auto or for it to come off cooldown, sunder is always there and ready to generate threat for you.
---
&gt; but trusting 1 random guy beats hoping all 4 team mates are reasonable.
---
Even if those 4 others are being unreasonable.... I could still win the loot in normal group loot because it is RNG. If you ML and YOU are unreasonable I have no way to win loot because you control everything. I wouldn't touch this group with a 9 and half foot pole. Why should I trust you when you obviously don't trust the rest of the group? 
---
&gt; roll on anything they see as an upgrade, not worrying if others need it more.
---
And who are you to tell me that someone else needs it more? Why should I get passed over on an item just because someone else in the group haven't put the time in to get the gear I got. Especially in a PUG? I'm not running that dungeon for my health I'm there for gear be minor or major upgrades. I'm not there to carry pugs at no reward to myself because you think that other character needs it more. 
---
In guild runs.... no issues but then again you don't need to use ML in guild runs because the guild will handle the problems. On pugs, no way in hell will I run with a group that is doing ML. Gearing the guild helps me progress while getting a pug nets me nothing.
---
This feels like a very one sided exchange to me but you do you brother.
---
My view on it is if those guys put that much effort into knowing the spawn times so when it spawn they nab it, more power to them. I’ll just go herb and work my way into affording it.
---
There was a guild called &lt;Nihilum Fanclub&gt; on Magtheridon. Orgrimmar was hilarous.
---
I use them as a slideshow so they rotate if that's what you mean.
---
Alliance suck so much warrior need fear ward. Its too hard to press a button once the boss cast fear, then press another button to break the fear.
---
lol, fear ward is pretty meh
---
Rolled on a new server with a few friends once, there were two main guilds. Ours, and some other guild. At some point early in the game, when people were around level 10-20 we did a group picture of our guild in Stormwind. Some guy that wasn't in either guild was trying as hard as he could to ruin the picture. Standing in front of all of guys, running back and forth, whatever.
---
It's some weeks later now, a lot of us are level 50-60. At this point there had been some people switching between those 2 guilds for whatever reason. Sure enough, the picture-ruiner of several weeks early was 60 now and wanted to join one of the two prominent guilds. Guess what? There were people in both guilds that remembered his little picture ruining escapade and he was denied entry into both guilds. Simple.
---
Don't ruin your reputation on the server, it will come back to fuck you weeks, months, and even years later.
---
GODS THESE MOBS WERE STRONG THEN!
---
Hi, /u/Belial91
---
seems people have been wrong about private servers being harder, at least regarding mobs.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR0fT3Hz3M&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
the average damage/hp of different 1-30 mobs is higher on classic beta than it is on private servers.
---
That plus let's remember that we're leveling during 1.12
---
The game at release and the game during 1.12 is not the same at all for many classes. Almost every class got reworked between 1.5 and 1.12 and got way better.
---
I’m in the same spot, played Druid from WoTLK to WoD and they are by far my favorite class, but everyone just ignore them apparently.
---
I was in a guild on a private sever a few years ago, we got to Cthun and had one player holding us back. We were a few weeks into Cthun progression and we were losing steam fast. I made a poor executive decision and told the one player holding us back to sit out. We got the kill within the next two attempts. The player that I sit quit shortly after that. 
---
He had some event in his past that made him slower, I don’t know what level of his handicap but it was there. We played with him through MC and BWL and ZG and all through AQ up until Cthun. He didn’t speak, but we knew he had fun and used WoW to escape. 
---
I haven’t spoken to him in years, others tell me he’s doing okay... but I will never forgive myself for possibly ruining this game for someone who found a safe-haven in it. I can’t say without a doubt that we would’ve collapsed as a guild if we never got passed Cthun. I can’t say without a doubt we got our first kill because I sat him. 
---
I don’t know how to word a resolution to this, but all I can say is please be patient with other players. You don’t always know their backstory. In my case, I did know and I made a choice that I wholeheartedly regret.
---
The reason is also because Arathi Highlands has the final mob you need to kill for the WW axe, which is the BiS weapon for warriors. The war was for control over the zone for access to that weapon. That’s how the game should be... and only 1 person gets the weapon.
---
Totally anecdotal, but what I'm seeing doesn't really look to off to me. I really think our memories of it being "so super hard" was infinitely more because people were so bad at the game back then. 
---
My buddy and I levelled a priest and a warlock together doing almost exclusively two-man dungeons at appropriate levels. I'm fairly certain we were able to two man all of Scarlet Monastery and Razorfen Downs by 38. Certainly wasn't easy, but we definitely got it done. Think we did RFK at level 32. From my experience up to 32 on recent pservers, I sincerely doubt we'd be able to accomplish that same feat.. so at least to me, I'm inclined to believe pserver dungeon damage was tuned too high.
---
Seriously not trying to gatekeep or sound mean. But we know there’s no bonus for having the right armor type in classic. Why wouldn’t a hunter roll on a piece that’s going to increase his dps??
---
Yes, I actually have a bit of inside info. My uncle works at Nintendo and he told me that after Vanilla is played out we find this hidden artifact inside the Caverns of Time. There’s a crack in the wall and we have to use the bomb that we got to break it. Inside is a treasure chest with a map. You go through a narrow path way but are all of a sudden knocked unconscious. You wake up to a voice 100 years later and walk into a large open vast lush green valley. An elderly wildkin greets you and says you’re here to save the realm. You just need to complete a few tasks for him first. 
---
The new expansion is called: World of Warcraft Classic - Breath of the Wildkin
---
Yeah, sit Crit appears as a Crit in the combat log and does double damage like a Crit but doesn’t actually proc Crit effects though. 
---
Lots of streams I’ve been watching talking about it as a bug, makes me glad someone at blizz is doing the work.
---
No you're not entitled to beta access!
---
Im special!
---
It's true, people are less likely to focus on you, you will fit to places where taller races can't.
---
It also comes with a disadvantage. Even a tiny puddle will dismount you lol.
---
He leaves a snarky comment and then on a public internet forum says you're pestering him for asking a question.  Amazing.
---
Evidence of this please?
---
Exactly what I was going to say.
---
I played those classes at the same levels in that area so I know it should be harder. Granted that was on pservers so they could just be wrong.
---
Beautiful, thank you!
---
Slow mainhand and fast offhand.  
---
2x crippling if you’re worried about letting people free.  I always used crippling on mainhand and either wound or mind-numbing on offhand with pretty good success. 
---
Don’t use deadly poison in PvP, it breaks blind. 
---
I don’t remember the exact spec to use for pvp, but it was split down assassination and subtlety.
---
There's an updated peggle addon for BFA.
---
I'm okay with a person forming a group saying that they will put it on ML.
---
 I'm not gonna join your group though. I don't know you and don't trust you to be a rational individual.
---
Glad to hear that the Beta works well on it! Thank you!
---
Just click on the image it's a 1080p wallpaper but there a imgur link if you want https://imgur.com/96uEus9
---
Don‘t take it too serious guys honestly...it is getting ridiculous. This sub is getting upset about everything that is not worth mentioning and opening some giant threads. Everyone knows that ninjalooting is bad and a streamer who is „ninjalooting“ between friends won‘t make others go ninjaloot or act like a total dick. We had a group of 8 friends and believe me everyone „ninjad“ something, but its all good boys nobody decapitated the other ones for it.
---
Nostalgia strong. It's beautiful. Rarely had more fun in a game.
---
I suppose I wasn’t going for reason ascertainment but rather just proving that there was a discrepancy. At that point you could point out that there was a discrepancy and let them figure out if it was being caused by a bug. This would at least uncover anther bug . Alternatively, it could be the evidence needed to uncover whatever is causing elite damage to feel low.
---
The thing that sucks so much about LFR (aside from the absurd easiness) is that the LFD UI in Wrath allowed players to pug raids pretty easily. So even us filthy casuals were able to run the easy content like Naxx, OS, and VoA to gear up reasonably quickly. It doesn't get much more casual than me when it comes to end-game, and I had no problem pugging. I thought that if any compromise had to be made so people could see content, that was the only way to do it--you still had to run the same content to gear up, there was just a tidy interface so you could see if anybody was pugging right now.
---
3 months is just enough for one more season of Path of Exile before the next 12 months will be used up fully by WoW Classic. #itsAplan
---
&gt; his stream persona
---
Yeah, I literally used that phrase - "his stream persona" - in my first sentence.  He does it for views.  Which I think is fair enough.  That's how he makes his money.  I just wish people didn't take his "criticism" to be something real when he says something like "this is too easy."  Especially if you pay attention to the stream and see that it's not.  I think that's what's really surprising me here, people not really paying attention to what's going on.  (Maybe I'm just in the minority with that.  Kind of habit from being a healer so often and occasional tank, I watch everyone's health, resources, debuffs, all that stuff.  I also might just be a huge nerd.)
---
While i 100% get where youre going with this, and i agree with the message, i will say that Blizzard has also done a LOT of things the players outright did NOT want as well.  
---
GCD changes are the first thing that come to mind, though theres plenty of others my brain is spacing on right now.
---
Makes sense when most of the beta invites ended up with Retail folks LOL.
---
megamind strikes again
---
Umm I want just one to be my background, are they available in high quality and resolution?
---
I agree, I understand now that I’m hearing about it.  
---
It wasn’t common knowledge tho, this was the first I’ve heard about it.
---
Love how it’s “our guild” and not “this warrior”.  Truly was a whole guild achievement to get legendaries!  Thanks for sharing
---
Psht, I'll tick off a group of you. Bubble, wave, then hearth as a laugh while you sit there not being able to do anything. Get your savagery back through that portal where it belongs Green Skin!
---
I'm going to try it out. Keeping my hopes low. Asked my old WoW buddy if he wants to play, and I got crickets. Fine! I'll play by myself... with blackjack, and hookers.
---
If end game raiding is all you care about, then they aren't the best. Although every good raid needs 1 or 2 great resto druids.
---
But if you want to be the best flag carrier on your server, druid is BiS.
---
Or if you want to be a beast in world PvP. Or if you want to be arguably the best 5/10 man tank.
---
Yeah that's what I remembered, I was pretty confused when I saw 2x crippling. Thank you
---
Nice picture, but now back to reality :  MinMaxer is proper player who will be shitting on noobs with his friends 3vs10 and be playing in Top tier guild vs retarded noob who will be buying MC runs from that MinMaxer's guild.
---
might be lieutenant insignia in the quest chain hidden enemies.
---
I agree I do have faith at this point. I was just suggesting a way that we could help identify and test issues such that as many variables as possible are removed.
---
There is no confusion. One is for serieus raiding guilds and the second for casual guilds.
---
Casual guilds have alot of quiters and guildhoppers to play with friends so they constandly need people to fill the spots while serieus raiding guilds are already thinking about the setup they need for Naxx.
---
Yeah, it's too bad OSRS is pretty successful for an MMO today, especially an old-school MMO.
---
Have you ever considered that maybe they are doing something right?
---
I'm like... I'm a carebear! No pvp server for me, thanks!
---
we thought we wanted it be we didn't lol
---
That...entirely depends. If you’re over gearing dungeons and have the raids on farm, yes, that’s the case. But for the most part you’ll be vigorously healing, covering up others mistakes, and generally you stay fairly active. If the group is quite good you can throw up some piddly dps. I very much enjoyed playing a priest in Vanilla and am considering doing it again. And if I did I’d go human. I was Troll for Vanilla, which was fine, but I’m Ginny for aesthetics this time around.
---
Druids are good tank healers on Horde, since no Paladins obviously. Priests + Shamans are much better at raid healing so thats possibly why.
---
And they give beta to these dumbos? Sure blizzard. Naw, don't stress it. Ask a random ass stranger on the street if he wants an invite too. What's the point of a BETA if you invite random bozos who are unable to provide information?
---
i think he wants each pictures as a wallpaper
---
TLDR
---
REEEEEEEEEEE!
---
No, you would only appear to be farther away but the edge of your hit box would still be the same as others.
---
Ok thank you, makes sense. Is backstab the go-to PvP build? Not a huge fan of backstab builds
---
I mean, its not unusual for people to evacuate their bowels as a defense mechanism. Might as well use it offensively.
---
I played through most of Vanilla as a Hunter main and seems never had issues being useful in raids.  I was the main puller for the my raid and main assist, plenty of bosses required Hunter in their mechanics (Magmadar, Hakkar, Anub etc.) and many more benefited from Hunter skills/spells.  You always wanted Hunters Mark up for the buff for all melee dps too, as well as Trueshot Aura. Pets brought plenty of utility - it was even common to Eyes of the Beast pull certain bosses. 
---
I also don't know anyone who raided as BM.  Hunters were largely MM specced in Vanilla for raiding. 20/31/0 or 14/31/6 were pretty standard builds if I remember correctly. In terms of raw DPS ability, in my experience, Hunters were right up there.  It would be a rare boss fight where Hunters weren't represented in the top 5 of a raid for DPS, while being much less heal dependent than melee on alot of fights. Hunter's also had the huge advantage of being able to go allout all of a fight if they managed aggro well with Feign Death.
---
So yeah, kinda disagree with your write up there I'm afraid.
---
What a dumb comment. They entertain for money. Their actions are for entertainment purposes which in return gives them money.
---
The raw damage values of the NPCs being incorrect would be very easy for Blizzard to verify, and they have probably already done so. That is a simple database value that should've just been basically copy pasted. Damage formulas and spell interactions are the interesting part and what is likely to break (such as the stoneskin totem bug)
---
Time has told us that the HoTs kinda suck because tanks are either full HP or in danger of dying, meaning they either overheal or do fuck all. Meta is druids just harcasting HT.
---
It's the elite mobs that are way tougher on Pservers. And my worry is that this will carry over to raiding.
---
Hell ya brother. I'm gonna be proud as hell once I complete this set. I want to say I was missing a few pieces originally. Not this time around.
---
It should port u all the way back. 
---
We did a gnomish death race once in vanilla and my friend tried this very tactic but he spawned at his first ress location.
---
QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ
---
Cry some more you fucking baby. Every streamer can't be in every zone at the same time. Don't follow them around crying about how everyone is following them around. I fucking hope the game is controlled by streamers. 
---
Hell, I fucking hope we name asmond the king of stormwind and leader of the alliance, and name soda or some other fucker the warchief. The other streamers can fill up the higher ranks. We'll need a master of coin and a war commander and a bunch of other fantasy rpg shit. 
---
World PVP is going to be far more interesting than it ever could have been in vanilla.
---
will it be though? You can literally watch the same dozen people on each faction stand around and help each other get devilsaurs.
---
Because that was 2007 and this is 2019, stop living in the past. To quote Garrosh Hellscream, "Time's change".
---
If you honestly think classic wow is going to have 8 million subs with 2+ years of no added content you are out of your fucking mind.
---
if you can currently play on the beta realms you were invited to the actual beta. It will stay after the stress test
---
Did anybody actually claim balance?
---
Which is why you should play with people who know how to play. 
---
I usualy group with friends and if there is any random dps who screws up in anyway: 1st offense master looter and you get nothing. 2nd offense; kick,
---
Well, when you're doing a 40-man you're damn right you're going to let that feral druid and enhancement shaman in because not everyone is going to be a warrior or hunter or mage.
---
Because 1.12. wasnt the prepatch... 2.0 was. That very specific change was done with BC mechanics in mind however.
---
but you trust the other 3 guys to be rational?
---
i think master looter HAS to be fair, otherwise the group is gonna instantly disband and all 4 people are gonna blacklist him. It's too much risk to go 1v4. With regular ninja looters, in my expierence most of the time the rest of the team doesn't even give a crap about the ninja, so long as it's not their loot that gets stolen. They would rather proceed with him than go through all the pain of looking for a replacement.
---
I learned how to be a better game playing WoW... but I learned far more in interpersonal skills, organizational hierarchy experience and patience. For me, that’s why it’s one of the greatest games that will go down in history.
---
Here's a PSA: we're vanilla players. We don't copy TV.
---
You'd think after a lifetime of having people tell us that Marilyn Manson and video games will make us shoot up schools, or Beavis and Butthead will make us burn down our houses, that we could get a fucking break in our adult years.
---
Yep, there would be a lot of value in that so we as players can give as much testing back to them as possible. I also imagine this is a very unique situation since we're testing a game that has been out!
---
Streaming is the reason classic WoW will succeed. Classic would never have the popularity it does right now without all the free marketing that comes from streaming.
---
Beta has all sorts of issues—which you’d assume.
---
Completely unrelated to mob health is spell pushback. 
---
If you are being meleed and are auto casting your wand then go to cast a spell (especially a heal w/o pushback protection) your spell cast will fail. You’ll trigger a gcd but never start casting, presumably because the mob pushed your spell far enough back past the maximum cast length. IIRC, it should push you to 1.5s out of 1.5s on a 1.5s cast. Not push you to 1.8s of 1.5s cast, which cancels the cast.
---
Further, on channeled damage, like mindflay, the pushback affects your cast bar. But you always get all damage ticks off. 
---
I think they’ve fixed this one by now, but at the start of beta wand animations were all fucked up. You’d wand with your 1h. 
---
Anyhow, interested in mob damages, Leveling being a bit more dangerous would be nice, it currently feels like you’re in blues when you’re in greens and whites. I’m pretty comfortably taking on 3 mobs as a priest, everything about my time playing Vanilla tells me that shouldn’t be happening.
---
There isn't an awful lot of crossover in terms of the 'best' pvp spec and the 'best' PvE spec.
---
For example - the PvP spec is based around the Subtlety tree and the ability to use cooldowns twice (with premeditation)
---
Whereas, the PvE spec is based around the combat tree.
---
That being said, a PvE spec will still be viable in PvP - but not as effective as the Sub spec.
---
Main Hand is slow - as this is the weapon you'll be using to hit with Sinister Strike/Hemmo - with a higher wep damage equating to a higher sinister strike damage
---
Off Hand is faster - for poison app.
---
From a PvE raiding perspective - you will need to use Instant Poison on both (due to debuff limit)
---
From a PvE dungeon perspective - Deadly poison &amp; Instant Poison o off hand
---
From a PvP dungeon perspective - Instant Poison/Wound Poison MH/Crippling on OH
---
voidy tanked it just fine as far as i can remember.  most of it was actually pretty easy up til maraudon and BRD
---
Melee hunter with nightfall?
---
yeah man between those 3 you have good cc, and our combo had sap and stuns as well
---
And will have no soul stones to summon lols
---
I haven't seen any proof yet of that being the case. I played extensively on the big private servers the past 3-4 years and honestly, the low lvl dungeons are just as much of a joke there in difficulty as they seem to be on classic beta. And as said, some dungeon bosses on classic beta deal way higher damage than private servers, like 3-4x more dmg. So it stands to reason that maybe some raid bosses will also be tougher on classic, though it of course may also be easier.
---
way less than 10% cry
---
Yeah I haven’t looked myself for videos of the type I’m referencing, mainly because I don’t have the beta so I couldn’t test it and I don’t want to spend the time if someone hasn’t agreed to do it. I was just thinking that it seems like people are taking twitch clips from the beta then trying to go and find vanilla clips to compare and that doing this in the opposite direction may be easier to compare. Instead of comparing a level 19 Druid to a level 60 rogue, we could compare, say a level 21 hunter to a level 21 hunter. Getting their exact gear would be a bonus, but getting close to their armor value would do fine I would think. Obviously this all depends on finding a video where the player displays their character screen and the armor value is visible.
---
Alt Tab for life
---
What sucks is how Live wow ruined these sets for me because I hated the idea of heirloom gear, and they took these models.
---
YAY!
---
I saw someone Comme t a while back that it had to do with uploading the footage somewhere and having it compressed in order to do so. They said if you kept the raw source footage you could upload it today and have it be decent quality. No idea if that's true, but an interesting thought. I should check my old hard drive...
---
As someone who is a vanilla noobie, I'd love this so I have a quick reference. I think it'd be awesome if they'd just re-release it to go along with classic release. I'd gladly pay for it.
---
You fucking coward
---
I wonder why I can remember such things but not birthdays of people close to me. Nice to see your old screenshots. Will you and others from the guild be back for Classic?
---
The reference client is the basis for a recreation. You can't get closer to that. Private servers have been wrong. Oh nooooo
---
It definitely has an impact. You're harder to spot and pick off, and harder to click on (if somebody be clickin'). I think this probably had a greater impact in actual vanilla when we were all playing on toasters with high ping, but they're still annoying fuckers. Getting dismounted in shallow water can be a bit annoying but it doesnt happen frequently.
---
Not a surprise, it was a long time ago and it's hard to remember, add private servers into the mix and most people are bound to have forgotten or misremembered one thing or another.
---
Because Polymorph would be even more overpowered than it already is
---
Someone give this gold!!!!

&gt;To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game so that we have the right mix of players to ensure great feedback toward making WoW Classic the very best experience for the community.

This was the same case when warhammer online released. It was just too streamlined. It is much easier to want to get the other faction back after it taking 20 minutes to turn in nessingwary quests

Make sure you read the lore in the manual first. Then read the lore for warcraft 2 manual. Then beat the base game. Then read the lore for the expansion. Then beat the expansion. Then read the 4 books that came out before WC3, all packaged in 1 book called WarCraft Archive. Then read wc3 lore in the manual, then beat the base game, then read wc3 tft lore in the manual. then beat the game. then start reading the 1st and 2nd book from the War of the Ancients Archive called The Well of Eternity and The Demon Soul. Then after classic is out start reading the 3rd book, The Sundering.

But what about the hundreds of hours of staring at my characters back...

Yes, you’re right. I already have done that, but in a different version that will be available soon. Thanks!

Do I have to buy a Nintendo
---
Black Lotuses are a pain to farm and are required to make flasks. On pservers people would create dedicated accounts for placing level 1 chars at BL spawn points. That will be harder in Classic but a guild could lock those down if they really wanted to.
---
While I agree with some points, I have to comment others:
---
\- I failed to remember community asking for Shop.
---
\- We had badges of justice to catch up gear, which stimulate people to run heroics keeping the game healthy.
---
\- LFR was supposed to be a tour, they made it part of gearing process.
---
\- LFG is not the problem, the problem is nerfing all the content so 5 random people can faceroll.
---
So, game throw itself into a single player experience with incidental cooperation and micro-transactions, don't blame the community.
---
WoW retail is the way it is because Activision makes more money from micro-transactions and rehash content than from month subs and original content.
---
\- We did not ask for mounts to be copy/pasta and put on shop, we assumed shop was only for DEV hobby time and original non themed mounts;
---
\- We certainly did not ask for bans in forums for pointing out the all shit we could clearly see coming our way;
---
\- Also WoD scam, promising and not delivering, proving a lot of players wanted the old way, and not delivering the damn housing;
---
Etcétera...
---
It's time to stop making excuses for Activision. Deal with it, game is garbage, they are robbing you blindly with unfinished content and disrespect for people that need care for their gambling problems and abusing positive reinforcement.
---
And I don't care about my Karma, I 'll always fight the good fight.
---
Players use a mix of click and tab targeting. 
---
Being a melee you’ll be up in the cut anyhow. People will just tab to you. 
---
If you were a caster, with a short name, short guild tag, and using a bunch of consumables to make you tiny, and were hiding in the bush at blacksmith...I probably wouldnt notice you right away.
---
All the pserver I played on distributed the patched client. It enables 2.0.1 features like auto loot without pressing shift as an option.
---
Battle shout causes a lot of threat for AOE tanking, the more allies you have that receive the buff the more threat you gain.
---
You think vanilla will last 3 years ?
---
Should certainly be some today.
---
I know I'm not owed anything.... but its kinda shitty that I have been playing since august 2005... and have spent $5,637 on sub time + in game services over my two accounts lifetime (yes I just now added it all up) only to not recieve something as small as a complimentary beta invite that I would actually be able to test thoroughly being a veteran player.
---
I've not played private servers and I definitely remember tapped targets being polymorph. If it wasn't vanilla, when was it? It doesn't seem like something they'd randomly allow in TBC if they already didn't have it in vanilla. Then again, I don't have any video or screenshot from that time to provide any evidence. Obviously I can be mistaken, but it seems odd that very many others are also mistaken. I can't imagine all these people have extensive private server experience.
---
All I ask is that this time can we go anti-clockwise this time with the circlejerking?
---
i subbed last week to try and get it beta, logged into my 100 day playtime level 72... then i logged into my level 50 mage. my level 50 mage can use all the super difficult mounts i grinded months for on my main. wtf thought that was a good idea.
---
They can tank low lvl dungeons and some higher ones. It gets to a point where the shaman just gets hit too hard to be viable. They have the aggro but not the gear or cooldowns.
---
Banish still works lol
---
As long as you dont need on every single weapon because it gives you 1% crit/hit
---
BGs dont count as vanilla pvp
---
There is a tread every monday. Thats where I found my guild.

I have found a few elite kill videos from open world that can be easily tested by someone with beta access

---
Human is the best race possible for human with the +reputation and the +sword skill but if you really wana play NE shadowmeld aimshot is pretty nasty in pvp.
---
&gt;than to just hate on streamers like 50% of this sub does
---
if only it was higher than that
---
People didn't hop guilds all that much in Vanilla.  They made friends and stuck with them.
---
Warrior tiers looked so good.
---
imagine defending someone on the internet for free that makes 200x what you do by doing nothing
---
Honestly, it's hard to argue spec viability isn't one of Vanilla's major flaws even if you do consider the content very easy.

For real who doesn't tab target 90% of the time?
---
we should start calling them fantasy servers as they are made up.
---
This was super wholesome. Wish my parents had the same mindset as you but they see all video games as evil death machines of Satan.
---
Yes. I remember soloing it several times in vanilla. You can also find a bunch of people in old thottbot/allakhazam comments talking about soloing it.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7079/viscous-fallout#comments
---
"Vishious Fallout is the Bigger of the Irradiated Horror's(Elementals), Can be solo'd with a 28 Rogue using evasion. First drop was Cane, scond &amp; third was Boots, &amp; forth was dagger, reasonably easy for his lvl."
---
"Thanks to the postings on this site I was able to figure out how to get to Viscous Fallout. I went through as a gnome rogue and took some pics along the way. First time I killed him solo at level 31, but I was ready to vanish. Stuck it out and got the Boots. "
---
"Solo'd him yesterday at lvl 28 (very well geared) to get the dagger, boots dropped.
---
Tried him again, boots dropped again. "
---
Yep, which means bringing an entirely separate class with different healing abilities.
---
So long as you have a few dwarven priests in your raid, you'll be fine.
---
Except if you were a geared Main Tank.
---
My same issue. Played a warrior in vanilla and I want to see the other side this time around. Priest or shaman. I am leaning a little more priest for a (greedy) chance at Atiesh.
---
Simplest way of making sure you keep aggro, always get a attack or a skill off before anyone else in the group, even a battle shout or demo as it puts the mobs on your kill list. If someone else pulls or does an ability they will likely gain aggro and it'll be harder to pull it off them.
---
Every spotted boar of the same level has same health damage armor resistance and ability damage
---
Exactly right.  Amplify the assholes that will do anything to cry out for attention and this is what we get.
---
PVP is how the game was meant to be played. If you decide on pvp, you will probably get ganked and probably wonder why you didn't role PVE. You won't be the hunted forever though, and becoming the hunter is a reward in itself. 
---
Basically, if you roll PVP, you might regret it while leveling. If you roll PVE, you'll regret it forever.
---
&gt;No offense, but who are you to decide the fate of every role in the group?
---
**the loot master of course!**
---
 People are not entitled to roll because they would benefit the most,  they're entitled to roll because they are in the group and the item is  an upgrade at all. 
---
Fair enough, but as i replied to another post, in that case I'm not going to invite hunters, because they're gonna  hog most if not all loot. In what I'm proposing, i would take the hunter on but he would have to agree to pass on melee items if a melee class needs it (unless it's a 2h agi item or something), or int items if casters want them. He would still get to roll on agility leather/mail armor and have priority on ranged weapons  
---
over people who just need them for pulling/stats. But as is i just won't invite them at all and aim at having 3 casters and maybe a rogue.
---
Guess it was too hard for you to search for the dozens of interviews and topics already made on this
---
To be fair, I believe I remember a Blizz employee pointing out that the problem with cutting "casuals" out of raids was that they spent so much money on end-game content that only a small fraction of players ever saw. They couldn't justify spending that much money developing something that was effectively a niche thing. I can't find the quote, it was pretty old, I don't even remember if it was circa TBC, Wrath, or later but I think it was referencing the increasing amount of gear catch-up mechanics.
---
To be honest I wish they had found a better compromise that left the leveling content and some casual end-game content a little more robust instead of trying to funnel everybody into raids to focus solely on that. I think that's where a huge part of the game became so linear.
---
We will see how it all plays it. But the general consensus on the beta is that elite mobs are way undertuned. OG private server players like monkeynews, perplexity and tribe concur.
---
I bamboozled myself. Before I played WoW, I could only play Free to Play games. These were usually asian grindy MMOs.
---
Rolled Human Rogue. 
---
Saw a rabbit.
---
Started grinding... 
---
Few minutes later noticed my exp bar didn't budge.
---
Good timed brez’s can turn a wipe into a kill. Think along the lines of, “best defense is a good offense”. If the boss is at -5% and you can Rez a mage with evocation or a warrior/rogue and they can heal up to prevent being killed immediately... that extra DPS boost can bring the remaining health down before the entire raid goes down.
---
Dumbest statement ever. Blizz has already found and fixed bugs that were reported by players.
---
I understand. In an ideal world, we'd have seen the invites first.
---
Druid was shit? Depends on what you wanna play, but druids definitely weren't shit.
---
The only bad thing about Druid healers is they have no OOC rez ability. That was my only complaint up to AQ40.
---
What I mean is that people that have commited to a serieus raiding guild are less likely to swap guilds compared to casual players. The hopping overal is less in vanila compared to newer versions of the game, you are right about that.
---
no, you cannot polly tapped targets. But, you could just gank the mark who's farming your stuff
---
Oh how the turntables.
---
Which does nothing to excuse the toxic culture that they create in the game.
---
This screenshot at the back of the box was actually fake news. First there are no dragons in SV, second what the fuck is this gear on the NE.
---
It comes down to this imo.
---
Are you good at healing?  If you're trying to play at the top level, but might not be the best healer Dwarf will give you a little edge.  If you're confident in you're healing ability I can't see a guild passing on an amazing healer for a suspect healer for an extra fear ward when there other's will have it
---
Seriously. It's not the damage values are off but the average skill of players and especially healers is WAY higher right now than it was back then. It used to be quite common that the healer wouldn't notice you took any damage for 5+ seconds.
---
&gt;Pretty much, it's just a shittier version of ElvUI and ElvUI has been confirmed.
---
great video!
---
There was a poker addon that we used between nef pulls. Long runback + a 15 minute respawn timer on Victor Nefarius - I won almost 500g one night from guildies, it was great.
---
Cant wait to see a huntard complaining because he didnt Get thunderfury
---
Because all the old vanilla players aren’t subbed until classic drops lol
---
If the content is very easy then surely any spec is viable?
---
1100% true
---
Raw damage - armor mitigation = damage taken.
---
A player without armor will take more damage from the same hit. 
---
For the sake of ease, presume the initial hit would be for 100 damage. The level 60 with just 12% mitigation from armor would take a hit of 88, and the level 19 player with 42% armor mitigation would take 58 damage.
---
If you reverse the process to take the damage observed to determine raw damage, you should get back to 100 for any character (it is a basic principle of mathematics that everything can be done in reverse).
---
Doing your version of 'reverse math':
---
 88\*1.12 = 98.56
---
 58\*1.42 = 82.36
---
After which you claimed the numbers were wrong, when it was really that you can't do elementary level math correctly.
---
You gotta find the right guild then.
---
There will be many casual guilds in Classic WoW that dont care if you aren't min-maxed. Private servers are generally where the min-maxers are since casuals didnt want to bother on unofficial servers.
---
The best part of vanilla wow was the lack of balance. 
---
Anybody expecting balanced pvp is in for a bit of a surprise, even 1v1 duels
---
Only funservers really ever patch clients. Most servers don't even distribute the clients, they just tell people to go find the 1.12.1 client (you can try going to the most popular current vanilla server's website, and see for yourself)
---
I would be _very_ wary of downloading anything that has been modified by a private server. They are often extremely shady.
---
It's absolutely possible. however, you can't just walk up to them with a twohander and hit buttons at random and win. You need an aware healer, and you need to properly manage cooldowns, stance, stuns, etc. You might need to pop a potion if things go poorly. It helps to have a rogue or ret pally in party to stun mobs at key moments.
---
To be specific, those nasty myrmidons in SM are nothing if you disarm them. When it starts to enrage you disarm and easy peasy.
---
Yup. It's pretty similar to how it was about 20 years ago, but more connected.
---
You could go for Warrior tank as well because of the 1% dodge.
---
Oh look its 11am time for this thread again.
---
No lifed back then - don't have the time to no-life it now - but still plan to raid. All my no-lifers from the vanilla days are in almost the exact same boat.
---
Everyone says druids are shit and the worst PvP class and lowest amount taken to raids of any class
---
Best. ~~Show~~. Game. Ever.
---
I feel you. I saw Asmongold take BiS mail gloves from Esfand literally right after he took blue leather gloves because somehow the leather was a need for him. Should’ve passed having just gotten blue from the last boss.
---
And yet, here we are.
---
DAE miss Classic?!?! LOl at my favorite streamers
---
So defensive lol sounds like you have some deeply held beliefs. I'm pointing out flaws in your generalization through example. Want more?
---
Do we really know how defense / glancing blows play into this though? My understanding was that a higher defense rating increased the chance for a "glancing" blow, that did less than a normal damage roll, but I'm unsure of how much so.. and similarly, lower defense = higher chance for "crushing blows", which were harder hits but not full blown crits.
---
I feel like we're missing several other variables here..
---
Let’s just be honest ....we do have something against them. They influenced Blizzard to turn retail into a shit mess of transmog and mount collection.  I hope the gogogogogogogo people stay there!
---
Bullshit. After wf got nerfed shamen were defenseless in pvp.
---
Yep, but i'm kinda doubtful because moneynews also said all the mobs he was fighting in the world were dealing "way less damage" than they did on private servers. Yet now we have a video that proves the exact opposite is true. We'll have to see indeed.
---
Streamers are great for testing. There are always hundreds of people watching, which increases the chances of someone spotting a bug and bringing attention to it. And the fact that they're recording means that there's video evidence, making it easier for them to track it down.
---
Obviously free advertising is some part of it, but there are other benefits to inviting streamers.
---
I ran so many people through instances and got off-day raids going so they could catch up... then they would quit a couple of months later.
---
Thank you, I've updated it
---
Same for rogues and fury warriors rolling on ranged weapons for stats. And don't forget that every weapon is a hunter weapon!
---
I think you are right. They said there was  a bug with a shamy totem that reduces damage taken. Basically, the buff does not disappear and it stacks. If you ever received the buff, you pretty much kept it till the end of times lol.
---
Layering solves it in p1. The question is how many of asmons stream wants to eat shit and sleep asmon? 
---
I keep him up for background noise when discord is dead. I’ve got no desire to follow him around in game for two years.
---
Even 10% is a full server off just asmon fans. I dunno, I can’t get my head around the streamer groupie thing to even project it out really. 
---
If anything I feel bad for the guys with 10k+, ya know, outside of the fact they get paid to play. But that said, to have a normal experience they have to play twice as much streamer character and private character. 
---
Those lower ~500-1000 I dont think they suffer from the drawbacks nearly as much.
---
This should be stickied.
---
Yo!  
---
My go to dagger spec on a fresh realm or a not very geared rogue is this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGx0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGx0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R)  
---
You get improved sprint which breaks slows and roots and is super good for beating mages, couple this with thistle tea that's pretty cheap from the auction house and you can burst down the majority of classes super super easy. Remorseless is more for world pvp and 1vX situations but you can swap it for 2 points in ruthlessness or even imp slice &amp; dice if you want to have an easier time in PvE. I didn't win the dpscharts on the first MC's on the server in this spec, but i was always around top 10 which is pretty okay for a pvp spec in my book, this was without improved S&amp;D and 2/3 ruthlessness instead of remorseless. The 3% hit from the combat tree is helpful here too.  
---
What you're looking for is high damage in the main hand, a super easy (and solo farmable!) good dagger to get is the barman shanker ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=12791](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12791)). You can stealth to the boss and just LoS whenever he's casting and burst him down solo if you are in blues, I did like 5 runs and got the dagger no problem. Early on in a server when people are in blues this dagger absolutely destroys clothwearers, it's super fun. Problem with barman's is that it has a DoT proc, however it was rarely an issue since most of the time I could kill them so fast. You can craft Heartseeker ([http://classicdb.ch/?item=12783](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12783)) which is great for PvE too. Or go for one of these green daggers: [http://classicdb.ch/?item=15246](http://classicdb.ch/?item=15246) [http://classicdb.ch/?item=15247](http://classicdb.ch/?item=15247)  
---
For offhand i'd go any dagger really. Scarlet kris, bonescraper, any of the dungeon daggers is fine really. You'll get Lobotomizer and the blue AV dagger when youre revered/exalted with AV which is easy enough to get.  
---
As for poisons i run the one i want to proc the most in mainhand due to more hits with special attacks, so generally crippling in MH and mind numbing or instant in offhand. Another great item to get for PvP burst is Darkmoon card:Maelstrom which ignores armor and is great vs mail/plate wearers, especially early on combined with instant poison/bleeds.  
---
Sorry for the long answer, hope it was helpful.
---
People keep using the word ‘viable’ instead of ‘optimal’ I think.
---
Ok, that was pretty funny! But I had to watch Boromir die again and that wasn't cool :(
---
Thanks. Its on my list of things I wont be getting. Like scarab lord. I would love to see the AQ event this time around. Got kicked from server with over half of my guild and couldn't log in.
---
&gt; I can’t get my head around the streamer groupie thing to even project it out really. 
---
It's just people who don't live fulfilling lives so they chase around someone else who does.
---
The guards! They do nothing!
---
RELEASE THE GAME BEFORE I PISS MYSELF
---
A PVP speced druid is insanely powerful 1v1 and as a flag carrier. Also, number of druids brought to a raid doesn't matter wlif your min/maxing - you'll be the one that raids.
---
They should make a queue for closed beta, or even when the game gets released
---
3 dps
---
1 healer
---
1 tank 
---
Can join in batches and only when those spots are filled they'll be able to join
---
It also spreads awareness, through asmon I've found out about a multitude of WoW content creators. Tipsout, Nixxom, Hamsterwheel, and MadSeason. This is likely true for many other avid twitch viewers.
---
I don't typically roam around for content creators on youtube when I'm at work, but have found several to whom I've subbed from watching asmons stream reactions. Can then watch their stuff while at work.
---
You can't make me play dwarf priest bruh. Just dispel it. You know, like horde.
---
PvP 100%. 
---
If you doubt, then you don't know what you are talking about.
---
The tbc prepatch was patch 3.0. When blizzard says they are using numbers pulled from a 1.12 version of the game, I trust them to be doing exactly this and not pulling numbers from 3.0.
---
But I understand your concern.
---
Then I guess I'm only gaming on my Switch.
---
Mind control the gnome and kill his allies with him
---
11/10 spicy oc
---
I agree each spec is literally "viable" to an extent but the reward for playing one of these underperforming, unappealing specs is basically non-existent.
---

What kind of simpleton falls for this obvious troll....
---
One of the healers in our guild started and ran a weekly AQ20, ZG, MC alt/pickup raid. He kept a loot priority list (suicide kings style) and kept attendance for the server. Usually we were about half and half in MC (alts vs pugs, with a few mains who missed main raid), it was phenomenal, and so much fun. 
---
We actually had a pretty good record of clearing stuff, the group could handle Rag about half the time, since a lot of people didn't have FR gear, we even crafted a Thunderfury out of it for one of our loyal pug tanks.
---
Technically you watched Swòrdfìghtz die, and frankly he deserved it ;)
---
It is but layering might be worse than sharding when it comes to waiting on spawn rates. 
---
So let's take this 3000 player example on a layer. Your layer of eastern kingdoms houses 3000 people. There are 3 starter zones, so for sake of argument let's say there are 1000 people per starting zone. Bottlenecking quests like killing a specific NPC will make you consider grinding mobs to get out of the zone and try to beat the pack.
---
I got in on the beta one day after the first wave and I wasted 30-40mins in fargodeep mine fighting 20+ people for kobold taps and goldtooth. And this beta is small in size. I don't think I could complete a quest in reasonable time if there was just 100 people in one specific area and you were grouped with 5 people.
---
I have considered that what works for one game doesn't automatically work for another.
---
I have considered that given Blizzard's very long track record of polar opposites, extremes, and taking miles when "given an inch" so to speak indicates it might not be a good idea.
---
classic druid vs vanilla druid is basically a different class.  the reason druids have this stigma is because they were actually terrible for most of vanilla.  innervate was the 31 point resto talent and feral was gimped before the talent rework and constant buffs to feral forms/abilities so you were essentially just an innervate bot.  it wouldn't become a baseline spell until 1.11.  
---
i wish we could get our hands on a launch version of wow because leveling a druid was a truly painful experience that would put all the warrior leveling memes to shame
---
Get on his level and play first person view, bro.
---
A classic case of a few people ruining it for every one.
---
Druids get ripped on a lot but in reality, when you're actually playing the game and not on Reddit, they perform very well and the lack of Druid players makes the demand for them very high. They really are sleeper OP.
---
What's the corpse run for alliance like? It's relatively short for horde, we spawn at XR
---
Starting to cast aimed shot from stealth breaks it, unless theres been beta confirmation of otherwise?
---
You don't have a clue. I've played on both pve and pvp servers. I played on pve during vanilla and pvp servers from TBC on up to wod. There is the same amount of wpvp happening on a pvp server as there is on a pve server. Thinking otherwise is wrong and shows you don't know what you're talking about.

I'm stupid. Added the link now :)

And yet you're still not owed anything.  I've been playing Blizzard games just as long.  I'm 39, I've been playing Blizzard games since Rock N' Roll Racing.  I feel no such entitlement.
---
Going by patch history is probably your best bet.  
---
1.5 (June 2005) - AV is released. This is the one where some games took days (never personally experienced it).
---
1.8 (Oct 2005) - First big AV rebalance. Games rarely took a full day, but most games still lasted for hours (This is when i started playing AV).
---
1.10 (March 2006) - Not a major rebalance, but Korrak was removed.  
---
1.11 (June 2006) - The big one. "Most of the NPC guard units have been removed." and "Creatures that remain in Alterac Valley have had their hit points reduced." That said, reinforcements weren't in the game yet. So it was still entirely possible to have long games.   
---
There are three major "versions". 1.5, 1.8, and 1.11. Technically, 1.8 was actually the longest-lived version in the vanilla life cycle. But I believe 1.5 is the version that OP is referring to.
---
For pvp my preference:
---
Slow main fast off, double crippling
---
Swords with hemo spec 21/3/27
---
Dude there were “famous”people on every server back in vanilla. Yes not to the extent that streamers will have. The server made them famous on the server. It’s been 12 years since I left Illidan server and I can still name the Warrior that had an army of healers with him in every BG. His name was Splug. 
---
I think you are over worrying about it. Yes some big streamers will have an army of devoted fans. It’s why I will be checking where big streamers will be going before our guild picks a server. 
---
I will say also I am in the beta and in Make Azeroth Great Again guild with Asmongold. Granted it’s the beta but he has no more clout than any officer in a large guild would. 
---
Yes every server will have a streamer on it but let’s be honest every server has some streamer on it on live right now probably. Most have less than 100 followers but it would be hard to find a server with no one streaming I bet. 
---
Yes they will affect the game but I don’t think it will be as bad as you think.
---
That’s just been typed out, there’s no source or anything as proof.
---
I hope Blizzard looks into it. I don't want a watered down easier version of the game.
---
doesnt matter if what they report is a feature or a bug because blizzard has an original 1.12 client from 2006 to fact check things with. so if something is reported as a bug, but its meant to be that way, its not going to be changed. idk why this is becoming such a big story.
---
He was asked dude. You're just toxic :p

Absolutely, but not in terms of "all values are wrong"

**About us**: We intend to level at a medium pace. That means we won't stop to smell the roses or "explore" every corner of azeroth but we do not want to rush the game either.

Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. memespecs are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.
---
**PvE**: We would like to clear all PvE content in time and hopefully step foot into naxxramas when it launches.
---
**PvP**: While we're not too pvp focused, we would like to do some organized wpvp together during phase 1 and 2 and some battlegrounds later on.

Most importantly, we wish our members to help each other, even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange!

**Recruitment**: We've started building our main raid roster and so far it looks like we only really lack hunters and maybe a few warlocks and rogues. Nothing is set in stone though, which is why we're still recruiting all classes/roles (except main tanks). We also accept Socials, Casuals and Non-raiders!
---
We do not enforce nor encourage min-maxing and rushing but we do expect our future members to be experienced (or at least a little familiar) with classic wow.

If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!

---
How do you think this is an advantage?
---
The best thing about when specs were actually diverse and brought different utility was that even if your spec under performed bringing you could provide value. For example, Shadow priests for Shadow Weaving.
---
I mean, everyone doesn't say that. Druids were the least played class so they would be the least taken class to raids. If someone is telling you that druids are the worst PvP class, you should stop listening to that person
---
Dude, anyone who is unironically shitting on people for playing the game a certain way is just as bad as the elitists doing the same thing to casuals. There is so much value to be gained out of playing this game either 8 or 80 hours a week, it's a shame to see people get into camps like this. Even if someone picked a Dwarf Priest because "it's good", that is a valid way to enjoy the game, and maybe that person doesn't value the aesthetics as much as you do, as much as the specific type of gameplay it provides (stone-form, fear ward both change the way you play in PvP, it's entirely valid to pick that because it's fun).
---
The problem isn't people min-maxing, it's people being total shitheads about it. I've met ridiculously friendly players in Naxx speedrun guilds who will take an hour to help you learn something, and I've met guys in blues/greens who spam the N word at me and call me shit because my 60 is more freshly dinged than theirs.
---
Nothing wrong with enjoying a video game a certain way, I hope you don't legitimately feel any concern about picking a race you like out of fear some stupid boomer is going to call you a tryhard.
---
Super random/creeping - just came across this though, are you going to be playing classic?  Remember you from Frostmane/Frostwolf,  I played a paladin in War Front and always saw you outside IF dueling and maybe have even done a few bgs together (I PvPed with some of the VC guys for HK grind). Loved your NEVER video, great music choices.
---
I've played since AQ patch in Vanilla and don't feel as though I'm owed shit. I've had multiple accounts running simultaneously over the years too.
---
I don't care about beta access whatsoever. I wouldn't mind stress test access just to help test the servers for launch, but it doesn't matter too much.
---
25% upvoted and decreasing. /thread
---
Not really I would say 70% use swords hemo, and the rest prefer dagger backstab.
---
Any priest that is not a dwarf is useless though
---
The reasons Asians make more money. Is they have tiger moms that make them put out 10x the effort of their contemporary's. They have much higher standards to meet before they are allowed into college. This is well documented and why Brown is currently being sued.
---
It's the same with the Jews. They get picked on and put down no matter where they go but, they always seem to rise to the top. Turns out focusing on family and education really pays off. Frankly the rest of us need to be more like the Jewish and Asian community.
---
Easily the best looking gear in the game. All the way from T1-T3 and the PvP gear.
---
Shoulders???
---
That split is generally assassination to cold blood and subtlety for that entire line with prep and hemo. People going full daggers backstab got the relevant combat points and I don't remember if they still bothered with hemo, but yes for ghostly strike.
---
Played arms in vanilla, switched to prot-pvp in BC and never looked back.
---
What's the point of letting people login just to level to 5?  How many people will actually be interested in doing that?  Doesn't sound fun at all
---
Should just give everyone a pre-leveled character (could be any level) and stick them all in a PvP zone
---
Yes, and if you want early access I’d advise getting both a switch and the original gameboy
---
We would discuss within the group who needs what. If everyone is after different pieces then there's no issue. If multiple people want the same piece they can just agree to roll on it, or one of them can quit before we depart, instead middle of the dungeon.
---
But for example if we did scholomance, and had 2 casters and a hunter who wanted the headmaster staff, as a Loot master i would not let him. I would lay it down that only casters get to roll on it before we get to the dungeon, if he refused he would be free to leave. But in group loot you are right, i have zero right to decide what is and isn't a hunter weapon lmao

What an utterly ignorant statement and you should you feel ashamed for allowing yourself to think such things. Thinking along such lines is allowing yourself to become so removed from a sense of humanity. That's absurd and you should honestly question your ability to think logically.  I understand it's easy to sit at your PC, staring at words, and think the only person in the world who can feel and care is you, but you are sorely mistaken.
---
They don’t create a toxic culture in the game anymore than this sub Reddit does with their obsession to find something to complain about / hate on i.e streamers most recently. If you aren’t a child you know these streamers are playing with other streamers and are all friends with each other. Exclusively through the clips of them posted on a Reddit it’s pretty obvious they’re all having fun and this sub wants to tell them how they should enjoy the game or interact with each other.
---
imagine being so jealous of another person that you have to dismiss what they do for a living as "nothing." Envy and jealously are very ugly things my friend.
---
flintlocke and some of the other characters are in wow because of him
---
Consider sneed may or may not have been under demo shout as well.
---
So I'm thinking either Hunter, shaman, or druid as the best level 5 twinks. Gotta prep for the stress test
---
Another unoriginal meme...quality over quantity guys! (not trying to be a hater)
---
Yep. I tanked RFC-Mara on my BC shaman(not vanilla, but still not a "tank") and got loads of "U cAnT sHaMaN tAnK wE nEeD a WaRrIoR" from some until they saw it happen while actively focusing on my targets.  
---
It was a beautiful thing.
---
No it's not. Cross faction communication has existed for 15 years with voice comms, you literally cant enforce it unless you're retarded enough to win trade in rated pvp.
---
With a decent healer some skilfull play it prolly is , should have been more elaborate when i posted that. At the very least it shouldnt be possible to do  it as they did it on stream like someone said with a pally off healing it etc. . Welp hope to get hands on beta and see how it goes for myself .
---
I think it's less salt about beta and more just a weird flex.
---
You aren't the only one tired of seeing this entitled, whiny attempt to flash the "I played vanilla" card. Most of us probably did. It isn't special. Saying "reeee I played vanilla" in this sub is like acting entitled and special because your parents owned a Datsun or those stupid Facebook posts where people post \[insert utterly common household object they still make, sell in stores, and people regularly use today\] and ask people to "like and share if you remember what this is!"
---
Yeah I saw that one too. They decided to pull while waiting for the healer and just kept pulling.

Fair enough, then!

---
My son (first child) is due a few week after release - totally plan to no-life/partial-no-life a lot of that time while I'm off of work.
---
Omar Gonzalez told the story of how they found the code lol. It was happenstance and was hidden in some random backup somewhere. They didn't know they had it till they looked for it.
---
And we're back to "It's just a prank bro". It's okay to be an asshole if you do it for Twitch. I now understand why we need to know beforehand where the streamers are gonna play.
---
I haven’t gone back to pservers to see if it works the same way there. But I’m pretty sure I found an issue with quest turn ins, full bags, and receiving a quest reward.
---
In 1.13 if you have full bags—with some of them being quest items—and go to turn in said quest, and the quest rewards you with an item; it works. You exchange quest items for quest reward no problem.
---
IIRC, in 1.12 when the same scenario presented itself, the turn in failed. You had to free up an inventory slot prior.
---
I’ve reported other bugs, but not that one. If my memory is correct—it’s just a fucking hassle with no gameplay value. The new logic is much better.
---
Think of all that DKP you're giving up and having to start building again in a new guild.
---
And if we can't find any video footage, continuing to report it so that Blizz takes a look at their 1.21.1 reference client.
---
I mean, at some point we do have to trust them since they're the only ones who can actually verify.  If anything, the stoneskin totem bug tells me that they are hearing this complaint and researching it.  They found one cause, but if people still are reporting, they'll keep digging.
---
I suppose this is why beta was 3 months long and they're capping people at 30.  They want people running all the dungeons so they can find this stuff and not racing to 60 right away.  There'll be time for that.
---
you defeat yourself by allowing popularity to override your own preferences. whether you do something because it's popular or you don't because it's too popular, it's the same decision: allowing popularity to make your choice for you
---
Maybe my math is off here, but for the skeleton example that would mean the player is mitigating nearly 80% of the incoming damage.
---
which was a lot less convenient since irc sucked and u had to buy vent servers or use free ones that could only hold like 10 people
---
You can't even deathcoil the pet under enrage, that was absolute nonsense when I was lvling warlock myself in STV that I realized.
---
It's obvious a chunk of this sub just reads old guides and thinks they know what they are talking about. I really want people to enjoy classic, but it's beyond frustrating to see people post blatantly incorrect information in an attempt to look like they were there during classic. Just be excited for the game. There's nothing wrong with being excited for something you aren't that knowledgeable about.
---
Both reasons are why. I wouldn't say it's dumb other then the definitive implication. They want the bugs fixed for sure but they also want to make money hand over fist.
---
I see it as, Activision bought blizzard when the sub numbers where at max or right as they were dropping. Activision bought on the idea that money train couldn't be stopped. THEY WANT THIS MORE THEN LIFE. They feel owed it and finally they have a way of forcing what they believe is theirs.
---
That video isn't vanilla wow lmao
---
What do you think you're doing right now?
---
to get people to buy a $50 virtual ticket
---
Players couldn't be affected by Glancing Blows - mobs always inflict normal damage, crits, or crushing blows.
---

---
In 5 mans I mean, not in raid.
---
Hi, /u/M3thlor
---
I don't think so all these framed images are from wallpapers from 2001. I found them on this site  [http://www.gamewallpapers.us/world-of-warcraft](http://www.gamewallpapers.us/world-of-warcraft) but most of them are 1280x960 if your lucky you can find them in 1600x1200 but I dont' know where, maybe blizzard will remaster some old wallpapers on release.
---
They are blue quality. They were great for gearing pre-raids. They mainly dropped from the 10mans UBRS/LBRS if I remember correctly.
---
The next expansion will mix the wow universe and the starcraft universe, will have 3 races added, and the final boss will be called "I forgot where I left my future seeing oracle"
---
Yeah true, I forgot about that fact.
---
And Cleve sucks it only hits 2 extra targets
---
I don't even have a drop down menu lol. It's completely obscure.
---
Followed by tact.  Give that one a shot too, while you're at it.
---
Most players won't even make it past MC. I don't understand what people are talking about sometimes when they say stuff like this. If you went on Nostalrius and took 40 random people, truly random, you would have trouble killing adds in MC.
---
Pugging naxx? How much of a bubble do you have to live in to believe that? The average person maybe plays 5-10 hours a week, and you think they're just gonna 'smoke these raids"?
---
I'm tired of people who play like 20+ hours a week and who know every boss and mechanic saying how easy vanilla will be. Everything is easy if you spend that much time doing it. The average person is gonna wipe in WC multiple times, let alone MC.
---
But what level was the party? I didn't see the stream. What you say sounds off if they were of proper level (23-25), but if they were over-level killing elites of their own level or under it's not out of the question to handle a pull without needing a single heal. Especially with a ret paladin throwing down a 5 second stun to mitigate damage, and whatever else the party has.
---
Is there a video I can look at?
---
Yeah wtf l0l
---
&gt;Getting my tube monitor back. Intentionally downgrading PC.  Throwing away my MMO mouse. If I'm not at 4 FPS in a raid, it isn't a true experience.
---
I know this is a joke post, but I just wanted to chime in and say that you can cap your FPS, and the beta has a "classic" setting to get the graphics as close to vanilla's as possible. So you don't even need to downgrade your PC just in case you want to play some other graphical powerhouse games like Half Life 2 or UT2004.
---
Yeah! And I'll always be completely enchanted by all of the night elf zones. As a kid, running around in these huge enchanted forests was nothing short of amazing!
---
Might be a good idea to put a column for tertiary stats in it. For example, Bonecreeper Stylus has spell damage on it. If there are wands that have +fire, +frost, or +shadow damage on them, certain classes might be interested in that information too.
---
I see, thanks! And good work btw.
---
That was the best part of it. It was content you had to work for. When you just give it to everyone people get entitled and don't put in any effort to raids. When you have to drop hundreds and hundreds of gold to raid, you pay attention and start to get pissed when people are not pulling their weight.
---
Blocking with a shield works in the same fashion
---
Why is Viking in your name...
---
It's kind of funny, modern games keep trying to put restrictions in and systems to block/stop people from being "toxic" but you had this in the old game. The game required you to be social. If you kept being a bad person to group with you hurt yourself more than anyone else in the long run because you'd establish a bad reputation. 
---
You're never going to stop people from being dicks in the first place but when it's in their own best interest to get along with other people it's wildly effective. 
---
You needed to invest time and build bonds with people to overcome challenges and move forward in the game together, you wanted to stay with a guild, you had an investment. There's no investment now, it's sad. Join a guild? things didnt go perfectly your first raid night? Ah, on to the next one.
---
i like these memes but some of the lines reflect a certain level of insecurity and im not ok with that
---
I didnt say itd be easy
---
"most players dont like vanilla" lol ok bud
---
Unless you play warrior, with all 3 specs perfectly viable
---
You are not pointing out flaws, youre just an idiot. Good day.

Thanks for linking it and see you in Classic!

I am going to all the play. All of it.

*Amplify the asshole* sounds more like something you would do with your wife on a hot night...

I would say they did it to build up the hype. Played it and i loved it
---
&gt;ensure a fractured playerbase and worse performance on classic
---
How? I don't think many people will be switching back and forth but if you do actually enjoy BFA you get a hell of an advantage, there should be a discounted option for classic only like $5

Don't Devilsaurs have actual loot? That should protect skinning attempts.

For aoe pulls you want to Los Shoot the mobs the immediately battleshout so it hits all of your party(this counts as healing aggro) when the mobs come to you demo shout and tclap then Swap to prot and start tab sunder rotation.

YES! I'm all for this I remember a friend making it onto photo of the day and all of us freaking out.

good lord you're fucking dumb

---
Can't stress enough how much community matters. I know you touched on this but I think it'll be the biggest shock to new players. Pretty much everyone knows each other by name once the servers mature. That's part of why I hated the later xpacs so much. I was ride or die for my server back in BC.
---
Spot on

Thanks. It does seem that i have been beaten in both time and execution.

Guess i'll stick to that spreadsheet then.

But there's no loot trading.

Are you gonna ask your parents too get back together and divorse again to make it a really authentic feel ?

Wait, she actually has a boyfriend?

Only good if you enjoy it, if I staple a game you hate to a game you love then its not really a good deal at all
---
I'm not sure where is this "region/account" drop down menu, can you clarify ?

You are so mad dude :p on all these posts. Just let people be excited... I'm hella jelly as well and I am doing nothing but staring at my bnet all day.

Ironic, Joana is a classic Portuguese woman's name
---
Until you see 100 people following him
---
Standard pve spec on hunter does quite well.
---
SM+Ruin warlock does fine too.
---
Deep frost winterchill can work in pvp too.
---
That's about it I'm afraid.
---
There is pretty much no raid gear for some specs, so while playable in early raids it gets boring as fuck and the specs that will get more out of the gear will want it over you.
---
That's because HBO didn't do it.
---
Yeah my level 10 warrior got stuck at STV
---
Thanks for the advice. What would you do in this situation?
---
Sure no problem.[BR2 Logo](https://imgur.com/mnc7NFf)
---
Banish doesn't heal the target though, unlike Polymorph.
---
Sure you can be annoying with it but it doesn't actively hurt the person fighting a mob either. Except his/her patience.
---
It was just a proof of concept.
---
Nobody cares
---
Hmm. I was going to say it sounds janky but honestly leaving adds on your oom healer isn't even a bad idea. Use up that blood bag so the DPS can kill stuff.
---
I agree with you, but the problem is providing evidence to blizzard beyond "hey, private servers show X damage for these mobs". So finding old videos, values, and data from additional sources is going to be crucial to getting some of these things fixed in the beta.
---
It's literally round #398248932 of "I know what you enjoy better than you do"
---
It's extremely ironic to me that this subreddit preaches the "you think you do, but you don't" bullshit while simultaneously gatekeeping peoples' vanilla experience because they're "trying too hard". Entire point of the game is that it supports a near-infinite number of playstyles lmao
---
Difference is that players that enjoy both get a hell of a lot more for the same money
---
There is a PuG that clears Naxx on pservers right now. I just did it last night and its tuned way harder than this Beta. I cannot emphasize this enough; classic is not difficult and these raids are going to get smoked.
---
Actually, I think I might have found it?

Not really, the best way to farm lotus will always be in Fresh av games, unless you’re alliance. Roll troll mage for Berserker, faster herb pickup time, and also skull of impending doom is a must and carrot on a stick and mount speed enchants
---
What actually factored into that statement besides the DKP meme?
---
\-"People had a one button rotation, so easy !"
---
\-"People were doing 50% of their expected DPS, they didn't know how to play"
---
Do you think that gearscore will be a good measure of gear power in Classic? Every item would have to be hand-scored
---
Played on 3 different servers in vanilla never seen this happen.
---
You private server people need to stop giving the hype-train ideas.
---
Holy paladin sort of 
---
If You are the kings or sanc buffer
---
Unironicly this.
---
For sure. I also think the class itself you mained has a massive impact on your perception. I payed almost exclusively warlock, and warlocks sucked major dick until like 1.4 or something like that when they got a rework. 
---
So, I know on some level that my memories of early game content are super skewed for that very reason (I was a noob, and locks in general were super weak), so the game seemed super hard to me at the time.
---
Why wouldn't he simply be executed for threatening to assassinate Tyrion?
---
You... *trust* the current devs to expand onto Classic WoW in a enjoyable way without transforming Classic into Retail 2?
---
Bold.
---
Ninjaing pretty much gets you shunned by the server
---
It served 2 functions:
---
1 - It showed players that they got this game up and running on modern tech. People got a taste of it and not just those who were live at Blizzcon. Which brings my 2nd point..
---
2 - It boosted Virtual Ticket sales because people have been salivating at the thought of playing Classic WoW since...well...2006.
---
Yup, I’m a og vanilla and won’t sub until a few days before launch just to get that download done
---
I've just had the opposite impression of that. Most screenshot/memes/whatever are either of alliance races lining up or taking shots at the horde.
---
Yes. It happens now. I am in a PuG that clears Naxx and I did Naxx in OG Vanilla. The tuning is extremely close if not harder on PServers. Vanilla is *not* difficult anymore.
---
I didn't even said anything about the process of forming a group.
---
Guess people forgot why blizz implemented all that new stuff... so a few week in, when people are their full dungeon/raid set, noobdy will log outside of reset day... yay.
---
love or hate the M+ system, for PvE player it was the first time since they had a reason to do stuff outside of their once-a-week clear.
---
as far as having to TALK to your group member... lol. 0 communication beyond LFG/LFM is still the default behavior on beta.
---
I'm not an expert on Druids, personally not a big fan.  I do think you should do some research on them though.  You're no longer required to heal end game either

---
&gt; If blizz so chose they could just create a new timeline from classic onward 
---
while it is a nice thought. I am pretty sure the lore was there well before WoW classic. This was a series of books. 1st one was published in 2001.

PSA: dont play with streamers.
---
But most discussions are about elite damage in dungeons not in the world. The world feels right.
---
I love the time delay on this post. And then also the “sometimes”. Made me laugh cuz it’s true.
---
I think you are correct in that as Shaman is maybe the class that benefits most from Spirit regen. Generally the only spells you would use are Lightning Shield and the Shock of your choice, plus heals when needed. You could easily weave in spirit regen to that rotation and never even have to drink
---
I don't even have a slidebar for realm selection, can't switch between europe or na. Is that normal? Few other games (diablo, hearthstone) has it
---
His gear is all over the place. He has a few pieces of Lightforged which has no DR and absolute garbage stats, but he also has Force of Will from BRD and Quel'Serrar. I doubt he's at DR cap with so much random gear.
---
Human is typically considered to be better due to the increased dps/threat from weaponskill. Dodge is the worst form of mitigation because you don't gain rage from it, which harms your dps/threat.
---
I agree. If we ever saw a WoW 2 it would most likely be long after WoW peters out and has either been in "maintenance mode" without receiving any new content updates or is shut down entirely. They would almost certainly want to build up a new I.P. at the very least before returning to another Warcraft MMO.
---
I don't think people realize that going the OSRS route or making "classic expansions" beyond porting over TBC and WotLK is more work than, so far, Blizz has indicated it's willing to put into classic games.
---
No, this shit is hilarious. The cringey fuckwads who are so obsessed with retail being "hard", usually despite not completing any of the hard content currently available.
---
Blizzard doesn't have the numbers right, because they literally don't match up to the footage or data from vanilla.  End of story.
---
Really? I’d rather have a social experience and communicate with people to set up a group and teach people who aren’t good than get a new record run time and a higher loot rate.
---
Tier .5 tho
---
Yeah. I didn't try LFR in Cata, but I did enjoy it in MoP but holy crap, people really didn't want to pay attention until you wiped 5+ times. The repair bill is usually what got people to say "alright fiiiiiiine I'll stop running into the purple killy death cloud."
---
Somebody once tried to vote kick me because half the raid wiped on the durumu maze and since I was the only healer left standing, it was my fault for not healing them through it all.
---
I was watching Payo stream and he was soloing the Test of Endurance quest to kill that mother harpy in the cave in 1k needles. Pretty sure those mobs are elites without the elite flag on them. They also hit like trucks and that quest is never soloable.
---
"How do you kill that which has no life?"
---
That song choice though. "Ooh woo ooh ooh, he gives me head."
---
Prob spell power gear if he knew what he was doing. But it might be random green gear. But honestly most of his gear can probably be identified and the amount of defense rating we are unsure about would not matter when we can compare the final numbers.
---
Agreed lol
---
Yea, I mean alot of the anti streamer crowd doesn't know how to act, your right about that. But I agree with alot of what they're angry about. 
---
The streamers (not all but alot) act like man children and assholes. In turn their fans follow suit and play the game with these bad attitudes.
---
Everyone who doesn't follow these streamers doesn't want to deal with that. And to salt the wound alot of what's posted on here is streamer bs, so I can kinda get why the anti stream crowd is mad. But who knows mabye the streamer probably is being blown out of proportion and things will be fine once live rolls around, I guess I'm just worried about the fate of this game based off what I'm seeing now.
---
There's no token in classic, so not in this case :)
---
I see parallels there though. Much of the OSRS community, for quite some time, was very opposed to changes. I imagine Classic may have some of the same growing pains.
---
The content release plan will keep players fairly engaged up until all of the content has become stale. It's probably around that time that Classic will experience the same drop-off that OSRS had and we'll see what Blizzard's plan around that is. I think Classic should be as close to the original experience as possible right up until we reach that point where content is stale and there's nothing more for Classic to offer.
---
At that point, Blizzard has three choices. They can choose to let the game stagnate and suffer, they can choose to follow the original progression of WoW expansions and have players progress through the content of TBC, or they can choose to let Classic follow its own divergent path in the spirit of Classic--much like OSRS did when diverging from RS3.
---
My personal hope is that up until the content plan is done and players have been able to experience Naxxramas for a while that the game has as few changes as possible to the experience. After that... I want to see Classic forge its own path with new content following the spirit of the game as it was.
---
I'll edit it down for you Welshu and post an update when it's done with my new updated Impressions.
---
Im waiting on the "reforged version" lol
---
Hunter in fact is probably the best class to solo content, and level up the fastest. They do have a heavy advantage in low level PvP. but up against the right person might give you a run for your money. I've been having fun on my paladin on a private server with pvp, only thing I seem to struggle with is Warlocks.
---
This subreddit was made to demonize pservers just look at rule 4, no point arguing with these people about this.
---
This is only a “truth” for those who never played in vanilla.
---
Great video. For the mobs he compared private servers were extremely close to real values, health was usually within 5% of actual health with a few that were up to 10% different. Damage was almost never off by more than 1 or 2 point, which is significant at level 1-10 and then becomes insignificant. Very impressed by how accurate private servers were.
---
Which would mean you know the actual numbers, so please do tell the values of every mob.
---
If you don’t know you probably are not good enough to be in one
---
Right!? Jk I love all classic content
---
Yes, nothing speaks to the teenage angst like a fresh divorce will listening to Headstrong by Trapt on Winamp while I get ganked in STV
---
Wpvp happened all the time on pve servers back in Vanilla. At least, on my server, it did. There was always a battle going on somewhere, or someone organizing a capital raid.
---
hey retard - he literally said he doesn't remember
---
and you just keep getting pwnd
---
I fully agree, Lvls become redundant after a point. And retails 120 levels just looks obnoxious.
---
Yup, boring as fuck.
---
After a while you’ll be forced to either dip your toes in STV or grind a while in the other zones. I’ve tried to skip it, ended up caving every time.
---
The pants dropped from Baron in Strat. The chest from General Drakk in UBRS, the headpiece from Darkmaster Gandling in Scholo. The rest randomly drop from any level 58-60 instance last instance dungeon boss.
---
This is one of the few old DOS games that just works as expected on modern Windows without modification.
---
However, the resolution is so small that it's gonna do funny things to your desktop XD
---
Someone had a rough morning shit today. Better get some tea and calm down
---
Nah,  #NoChanges means no changes. Gotta go back.
---
There's still debates about this, but pretty damn sure it's +25, with base resist being 5%, meaning orcs have 30%.
---
Dunno if anyone tested this yet on beta, that's what it is there for not twinking at lvl30..
---
Bejeweled was for sure in Vanilla, spent a looot of time in flight paths and Bejeweled was only slightly less boring than watching your gryphon for 10 minutes.
---
this beta should be named demo imo..since majority use it as such..
---
on topic, blizz has all formulas from 1.12, all stats etc.. so why wouldn't them be right? ;)
---
The shareholders aren't running the beta test.  The shareholders aren't combing through the bug reports, fixing the bugs, and delivering the game to you.  The shareholders aren't the ones watching the server load and adjusting layers to make sure the Day 1 experience is solid. 
---
It's people who fucking care that are doing that, busting their balls to get it done. And then people come along, point towards that effort, and say "lol, they just care about dat profit." That's what you are doing. Lumping those people in with shareholders.
---
There is a pug? So 1 pug? Is it random people or is it just a group of players from the best guilds?
---
I've tanked probably 200-400 private server dungeons in the last few years. I've wiped endlessly. And this is me just inviting random people. 
---
If you don't think Classic is difficult for the average player you have a warped view of who the average player is.
---
You think the average adult who maybe hasn't played WoW in like 10 years and who has time to maybe play a couple of hours MAX each day is gonna PuG naxx? No chance.
---
Do you recall when hemo was hit with attack speed normalization?  I remember it was missed when they normalized most of the instant attacks.
---
The classic wow ball was rolling before Tips was even remotely popular, so settle down.
---
so did everyone on beta
---
Druids are ok actually. Blessing of Kings makes cat DPS somewhat viable, which is a faction advantage since Tauren druids can't use windfury totem. Good luck gearing for cat DPS when you have to take good leather gear from rogues and hunters. 
---
Otherwise, resto/feral is the build to be, as you can still tank/heal dungeons and off tank/heal raids. There is also a good resto/balance spec. 
---
While it's true that they can't be on the same level as their pure class counterparts, they still definitely hold their own. 
---
Otherwise, if you want to minmax pve on alliance as a Hunter, go Nelf. 
---
If you want to minmax pve warrior/rogue, go human. Weapon skill is too OP too pass to
---
2/12/2005 N/A Free Month Expired
---
Please don't tell me I didn't get into the beta because I made it the day after release (I had trouble making an account that day I think)...
---
He could've done it by accident. It just worked out.
---
nope, shutupshutupshutupshutupshutup LALALALALA I CANT HEAR YOU \*\*sticks fingers in ears\*\*
---
I reeeeeally wanted it so bad. 
---
I was 16 at the time. I came from a inner city poor family that had 1 computer. I had 1 hour turns to share with my brother and sister. I can't tell you how many times I just didn't get up or how often the computer "stopped working". Shouldn't trust a young asshole to be your tech support for the family, shit can happen.. Ahh to be an asshole... I mean YOUNG; again.
---
I pray for your karma, good luck sir
---
You could never swap armor during combat in any version of the game so that's just stupid. There was a time you could swap trinkets in vanilla.
---
Spawn time lock down has never been the issue, the "mafia" was a cross faction group who colluded to stop anyone outside said group from ever getting a chance to kill a devilsaur in the first place.
---
We can be hankful for pserver players for getting blizzards attention on classic wow and be careful about spreading misinformation from pservers at the same time
---
Pservers are not and never been like the real game and they should not be used in examples of how things should work ever
---
Then he should retire to play video games all day long. That is my plan when I'm 70 at least. lmao
---
But good on him. My dad still worked after his retirement, because he was bored otherwise.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427272471?t=1h56m
---
Just look at that shit, he's charging in and they hit him for 43 damage. Remember that gear does fuck all for mitigation, it increases HP and damage done first and foremost. 
---
It's beyond a joke how weak elites hit, regardless of it being correct or not.
---
Haha true, i still remember like 7 months ago in my mc raid on pserver this hunter literally wanted to roll on spinal reaper, it became a huge meme in the guild :p
---
Exactly this. Lets just hope they respond to the feedback from the beta do some checking and adjust things if they need to be adjusted. To be fair i'm just hoping they dont disregard the feedback like they did with BFA , no matter if its right or wrong its still feedback. Minor things in lvling dungeons might reflect on raids as well.
---
Apparently I started day 2. I think there was some problem making my account, so I made it the day after.
---
Is that the reason why I haven't gotten an invite? If so, that's fucking retarded on Blizzard's part.
---
Which is false.
---
*The modern riding system was introduced in one of the later 1.12 patches, and as we were discussing it, we felt this system was added to prepare the game for Burning Crusade, which had the ability to ride flying mounts.*   
---
They are not cherrypicking. They are including changes that should have been in the BC prepatch. Completely different than AV.
---
Yea I agree.
---
Furthermore I think niche games have it easier to retain players than pop-games. When WoW decided to go pop-audience, they wilfully risked losing their niche audience to go for a big but volatile audience. Popculture people do what's hip. So you can be the hip thing for a while but eventually something new will take over. Niche players are loyal. Niches are rarely saturated (because smaller target audience) so the niche players will cling to anything you throw at them.
---
Now Blizzard is whining about player retention having to deal with periodic players, who only come for a short while during a new patch or expansion but no longer keep an active sub. I WONDER WHY.
---
Also a good game (or any piece of art for that matter) will always be about transporting something personal from the artist to the consumer of that art. Pop culture garbage is never about a personal message, it's about the question "what does the audience want to hear?", which makes it an extremely hollow experience outside of acting as a mirror of society (which is interesting in it's own right, but not as art in the sense of an artist trying to express themselves). WoW has gone down the route of trying to pander to player demands for too long now. It used to be awesome when it was about the devs showing us their vision of the World of Warcraft, now it's just a streamlined experience of player expectations. Gear is boring, everything is formulaic, dungeons are tubes... 
---
Welcome to the World of the biggest common denominator. I miss farming Hide of the Beast or some crap. Everyone wanted something else and you'd make allies to pursue your goals. Nowadays everyone's got their grocery list for the week and just random queues through it, items are 95% boring. 
---
Like I'm not delusional about the utterly shitty quest rewards or the lack of quests to get to maxlevel without grinding... the lack of mechanics on many dungeon bosses... I know classic had room for improvement. But overall the game was just so much more adventorous and fun than doing the same formulaic shit every fucking week for years.
---
I really hope lots of live players try out classic and fall in love with SOME OF IT and leave feedback so that maybe Blizzard adjusts the main game to be more vanilla-like
---
You dont have to tell anyone that lol.
---
If rogues dont know truestrike is bis for everyone they can fuck off.
---
I can't watch the videos because my internet sucks right now. Is it possible the player is well geared for his level? Does he have any added buffs like from food or other class buffs that could reduce it so much?
---
You wanted the real classic experience.
---
Here ya go.
---
Does it appear in the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher or will it be on the account management page?
---
It's fair to want a more casual RTS. And that is one of SCII's biggest detractors. Heck, I'm a huge fan of SCII and I never play online (just story mode and the co-op commanders). But I'd argue that's what difficulty settings are for. I know that's a bit controversial these days what with certain games being labeled for "hardcore gamers" and their fans not wanting a more casual version. But I've always been of the opinion that games are made to be enjoyed and you can appeal to the wider market by making difficulty a sliding scale.
---
Pretty sure it's additive too. Played a rogue all vanilla and orcs resisted stuns so often I'd usually switch up my game plan as a resisted cheap shot or kidney shot basically ruined you.
---
A lot of the elites are hitting as hard as/sometimes even weaker than regular mobs of the same level. It was really jarring seeing Asmongold go from tanking 6 level 23-24 elites at the same time without breaking much of a sweat, to getting absolutely fucked up by 2 level 24 normal worgens in duskwood.
---
Enjoy it all over again. Good stuff stays good stuff, forget about the „I need something new and new content“ shit. That‘s what our generation is today and apple tells us we always need the newest and best shit
---
My personal favorite was a help desk ticket I received from an  employee working for the same company that was a few hours away, regarding a certain application we developed.
---
&gt;Hi, this program isn't working, please advise.
---
Sure thing, could you describe what isn't working?  Is there any error messages, instances of certain fields not populating correctly, or any other indicator that could help narrow down the issue?
---
&gt;Yeah the screen just kind of stops
---
Thanks, is anything displayed on the screen once it stops?
---
&gt;Yeah
---
It would definitely help me figure out what is happening if I could understand what is on the screen.  Could you describe what is displayed on the screen or take a screenshot for me?  If you are not sure how to do that, \[insert instructions here\]
---
&gt;no.
---
If you are still having issues, could you try restarting your computer and seeing if the application works from there?
---
&gt;I tried that already
---
And does the screen show the same thing as before?  Is there any text or symbols on the screen? 
---
&gt;Please advise. 
---
\*Goes across the office.\*  Hey uhh, Jim, can I get the software to piggyback/control a remote computer? \[Gets software installed and connects to the remote computer\]
---
\* Back to employee needing help\*
---
Hi there, I just connected to your computer, can you try to run the application that was giving you problems again?
---
&gt;no. \*proceeds to work on something else\*
---
\- Disconnected, closed ticket, never heard back from them.
---
Then it'll be shit. But its been geting nothing but praise lately by those who have beta so.
---
with how many resists soda's gotten on his stuns, I'd bet its +25
---
10 years from now they gonna release WoW Classic Beta as a standalone server level cap 30
---
&lt;3 Beautiful!  Your dad is freaking awesome!  
---
When i first started playing i made a couple good friends in the guild i was in. Played with them daily. It was months later when i realized one of them was a girl, and they were a couple. Still months later i finally got into Vent and it was instantly apparent - these people were obviously much older! I was shocked that they were just as down to earth and "gamer" as us kids! I believe they were both nearing 70.  They were my fav people by far for several years before cata and they quit :(
---
Guys we found the virgin min-maxer
---
*Laughs in orc hunter*
---
Well that's kinda fucked up
---
Hunter pets do have talents in classic. Every skill the pet can learn costs talent points. You also spend talent points increasing armor/hp/resistances. If you tryhard you will be respeccing/using different pet for different things. For example, for solo PVE pet tanking you want to max armor over stamina, as armor increases the value of mend pet. For MC/BWL when your pet wont tank physical damage, you want to max stamina and fire resistance.
---
What the streamer debacle has taught me, is that a big portion of r/classicwow is more concerned with the perception and feelings of their favorite streamers than the accurate feedback and development of this game.
---
The excuses are pathetic, all because they are under the impression that they are somehow friends with these people or part of their community, because they stole their mother's credit card so Zoomy Zoom can get his shout out on stream, OMEGALUL.
---
This would have been such a better timeline. Classes getting made for their respective faction and having each faction be a unique experience. Harder to balance but the payoff is way better
---
Whether it's 25% flat, or 25% + the base 5% chance, it's a killer racial and will make many a rogue (and mace warrior) cry.  It's either going to be 25% or 30% so if that's the teetering point for you choosing your race. Maybe a rogue and an orc of equal levels can have a duel on the beta and test this out?
---
To be fair, 9/10 druids just suck at their class and it will most likely stay that way in classic. Very few druids actually learn to master the class. I'm watching Soda duel rogues with his resto spec wearing cloth gear right now on stream and hes wondering why he can't win &gt;.&lt; So I understand why people think it's bad, even though it's not.
---
Do we have a time frame of when that drops?
---
Thanks for typing that out dude, loved reading it! I quit back in early WoTLK and hearing the "how many raid difficulties were there?" thing made me laugh out loud. 
---
Does he know there were 40 man raids back then?
---
Just you, multiple polls in past showed that it's pretty close to 50/50
---
Some weeks horde players can be more active some weeks alliance it happens
---
Hunter, hello?
---
It will appear above the Play button on your [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher if you're been selected. You may need to restart the launcher for it to appear. 
---
This is the same location all future Beta tests will appear (if selected) and where you can change to the PTR (Public Test Realm) if you've moved a character there for future patch testing.
---
if you look at the game as more than raiding its really not. outside of druids not having a res its pretty fine balance wise.
---
every spec is good at things and bad at others
---
Hi there!
---
Currently lead a 9/9M guild on retail wow; but i will be transitioning to leading a guild on classic. We have about 25-30 dedicated individuals so far and would love to add 2 more to the roster.  
---
My discord is Alejandro#0151 if you would like to add me and chat. We are going to be alliance on a PVP server and currently raid Tue-Thursday 8:00 EST.
---
Maybe he used to be good and worked hard in vanilla, but this time around he has nothing to prove, he just wants to dick around and have a good time.
---
Happy cake day, Dwirthy!!
---
Actually it wouldn’t have happened without retail servers playing retail servers since Blizzard is a business and they have to pay their fuckin’ employees to build shit.
---
We need more hunters doing this for elite mobs.
---
What’s the point of a community when you have google, right? /s
---
"Stop living in the past"
---
"You think you do but you don't"
---
Sound familiar? And did I say that I expect classic to have 8 million subs? Nowhere. So try reading next time before you look stupid.
---
From a business stand point it was a great idea, they probably got a huge ticket increase once they announced it. I know I bought one just for the demo. And it was one zone for both factions that was polished, there were some bugs but mostly clean. It was a great business move. 
---
As for the demo and beta serving the same purpose, no way. The demo was a hype/interest boosting idea, the beta is testing everything, I don't think they really thought all the top wow streamers would have gained this much interest into it and that's a positive side effect for blizzard.
---
If the rogue join a group with a hunter, feral druid, warrior of any spec or another rogue he should automatically assume they will roll on Truestrike. The shoulders bis for all of the above and nobody should have to justify rolling on their bis.
---
You didn’t say that. 
---
You said Naxx wasn’t PuG-able. It very much is and we just did so last night.  Mishmash of people from different guilds. All that’s required is consumes and disc. Obviously it’s made up of people who know what the fuck their doing but i don’t even play more than 15hr a week. I did Naxx in OG Vanilla and the tuning is pretty even if not more difficult.
---
Of course your average 2 hour a week keyboard turner won’t be in Naxx.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427272471?t=1h27m
---
Beyond ridiculous. One of the elites is lvl 31, hit him for 50 damage.
---
theres no spec that underperforms in everything. every spec is good at some things and shit at others its just how the game works
---
cringe
---
Why didn't Blizzard just invite people from the first two weeks or something? Their website and servers were terrible the first week and some of us could not create an account day one because the website would not load all of the pages. Apparently I created my account on DAY TWO and according to blizzard that means no invite.
---
"The shareholders aren't running the beta test. The shareholders aren't combing through the bug reports, fixing the bugs, and delivering the game to you. " No, they are just the ones who decided to let that happen because it was in their best interests... They are the decision makers and everyone else is the pawn.
---
I mean yeah, their reasoning is sound. But it does mean you can't simply use the "only 1.12" argument. There are plenty of things in patch 1.12 that were made as a "just waiting until TBC" kind of change.
---
Rogues are scissors and warlocks are mushrooms, that's balance.
---
Right but isn't the damage laughable? Could you solo kill in pvp? Could you even farm solo efficiently? It's been so long and I didn't play private servers so it's tough to remember.
---
&gt; Private servers are your best bet at gauging Vanilla data as players as I am sure none of us have done years of research as they have, and especially since Vanilla data is very scarce overall.
---
While I'm thankful for all the work people did - pserver players and devs and others - to get us to Classic, the best data is definitely Blizzard's own 1.12.1 reference client.  We have to trust them to get this right, which means continuing to file bug reports when we know (or feel) that things are off but then letting them to their work at figuring out whether or not things need correction.
---
I started playing towards the end of classic just before TBC was released. I played as much as was possibly allowed but like you, I never dinged 60 straight away. I found it so difficult to level, and also my parents refused to buy me the TBC expansion when it came out so I thought, what's the point. My friends at school were the same as me, too nooby and undedicated to level a character to max, and one of my friends discovered twinks @ the 19 bracket so we all started playing those. It wasn't until When the end of wrath happened and ruined twinks I leveled my first ever character to max during Cata, and raided for the first time. Essentially, I spent like 4 years playing on level 19 characters, and never had never gotten above 30. I am so sad I missed so much of the end game content but the days of 19 twinks I will never forget (Shout out Heroic Twinks Tarren Mill if any of you are here, ET Phone Gnome etc etc)
---
Maybe demo shout os the problem in some way, reducinf more than intended.
---
What, for example? I am genuinely curious since I only started at 2.2 or 2.3
---
They dropped from many of the level 60 dungeons, including the 5-mans - Strath, Scholo etc
---
That sucks. My active sub is on an account made in BC. I have 2 vanilla accounts but I wont be paying for them in hopes of getting an invite.
---
There already are microtransactions in current wow. I guarantee there will be in classic eventually if not right away. Transfers, name changes, pets, mounts, transmits etc. Would not care if they had more if it was free. I just want an upfront cost model.
---
He charge in and didn't get hit at all because the spriest had agro, and then he continued to hit the mob while it walked towards the spriest. That is normal behavior, you can melee a mob without taking damage if the mob has agro on someone else.
---
This is also a level 30 warrior fighting mobs that are 4-6 levels lower. His armor is much higher than a normal proper level warrior (around 23-24 for this zone) would have.
---
I see renew constantly ticking, that isn't "no heals".
---
I see several small pulls of 1-2 mobs. These are supposed to be easy, if they were not easy the later fights where you have to pull 5 mobs would be impossible.
---
It's a known fact that rogues hardcounter locks in vanilla, this wasnt surprising at all. But that lock was super slow with his healthstone/sacrifice so theres that too, he could have done way better. All classes have counters and can be put in situations where they just can't win. Thats the cool thing about vanilla.
---
i hate that quest chain and will avoid it like the plague
---
It was the Kodo Skin Scroll you get from the quest Frostmaw.
---
You can see him delete the item [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG8pkhreZjU&amp;t=1688s) in his video from his old vanilla run, without the quest being abandoned. 
---
It happens very fast in the video, but its the item he deletes from the top bag.
---
Welcome to Vanilla PVP, Thats highlight reel stuff right there!
---
Just do some small things troughout the run that would iritate them to make them speak up , like an exra pull , dpsing the target he is not focusing taking agro etc .. xD
---
Do you want a cookie? You and a couple million other people have all of those achievements. My priest has more achievement points and I stopped playing shortly after the cata release. The only people prioritized are streamers. In the first few  years after release, WoW was upward of 7 million subscribers. Should all 7 million get beta invites?
---
If you get an invite, that's great. I'm happy for you. But, you are not owed an invite.
---
You didn’t play vanilla did you. I’ll never forget levelling a Druid, having to use bear form to kill white monsters your level because catform would die in one hit and do really shitty damage. Even in bear you’d have to pop out to self heal 2-3 times before the damn felwolf is dead.
---
Vanilla druids aren’t the jack of all trades. They are healers, who can’t stack heals and can’t resurrect.
---
yep, with weapon enchants and maybe a searing totem, you can spend most of your combat not casting.
---
The only thing that matters is armor, which will not reduce damage by 30% or some shit like that even if you are "twinked" at 30. 
---
Knock yourself out. They don't even bother with devo aura or sitting in def stance.
---
As long as they don't ever add flying and group finders... And keep the grind for leveling. They could do TBC and never add those things and it would be a good experience.
---
Winamp, it really whips the llama's ass.
---
Druids are not shit in classic, they where shit for 90% of vanilla untill they got changed *alot* in 1.12 or what ever it was, but BC was well on its way at this point and the stigma remained for most. 
---
They are the best flag carriers, they are supreme world pvpers, you can get out of almost any situation if your being ganked etc, very capable 1vX, high skill ceiling.
---
The best true hybrid in the game with probably the most utility. Can tank/heal/DPS at will, most of the time it's 2 of the 3 in a single spec. Don't write them off, sure they won't top meters and you won't be replacing your warrior as MT but that's not what they where designed for. Best OTs, high threat, can switch on a dime to another role when not needed. 
---
Fun.
---

---
I think people know this even if streamers fuck around with their friends
---
&gt; Nostalrius PvE was the much lower rate of toxicity compared to the PvP server.
---
I'm shocked
---
And charging for it
---
That kind of thinking never made sense to me, because if there were no girls in wow, then why are the healers coming from? ^^/s 
---
No, but seriously I'm gonna play a priest and like the coop portions of the game, so I guess I've played myself here.
---
Have EU members who aren't streamers able to access the beta yet?
---
You sure did mate.
---
This needs to be higher. Classicdb is nothing more than a pserver database. You can do a comparison between pserver numbers/beta but you can’t just use pserver numbers as fact. Especially not with classicdb, which is pretty much stock mangos values last I checked.
---
Warr is always the best :(
---
In a closed community with no name change and transfers its much less of a problem than people make it seem though.
---
The demo is more scuffed than open source 1.12 at the moment. I played vanilla and pservers and even though my memory might be blurry, mobs are NOT hitting hard enough and regen is too high. Yea we was all noobs back in 2005 but we weren't retards, this is lfr vanilla not real vanilla.
---
1 maybe 2
---
shittier != shitty.
---
tl:dr Eyeballs are dried out, not a pretty sight.
---
True, but if he wants to min-max the NE then it's a possible path.
---
No, but if you're a mage you have plenty of other tools to help out lol
---
I'm not gatekeeping either, whatever that means in this context.  Or maybe I am. Because it sounds to me like the most boring shit imaginable.
---
But again, in order for a so called streamer to have a population of support to affect the outcome of the game, said population has to make it to Sithilus. I doubt this will happen. Progress guilds will gain rapport and momentum first and foremost.
---
&gt;Based on previous Beta’s this seems to be the case
---
Betas, non-possessive, have run past the launch of the title itself in almost all cases.
---
Access to Classic is worth $15 on its own. 
---
Everything else is bonus
---
I f you dont think $15 is worth it then you really dont want it.
---
When are you staring at your characters back?
---
I just had to google that and I totally forgot about Training points. I had the image of an actual talent tree in mind and completely disregarded the training system. You're right.
---
I don't feel owed, but the prospect of having to wait another 3 months while people have fun now is awful.  
---
Worst part is im from Australia, I'm not even sure they're handing out invites to accounts here.
---
Yes he does! But I have the feeling he doesn't know that there is no group finder...I picked on something that he said that gave me that impression, I will just roll with it if its true and let him find it when we start playing and decide to go for our 1st dungeon xD
---
Warrior T3, the Dreadnought set. Is undeniably the greatest set of all of WoW. T2 Paladin, Justice, and T2 Warlock, Nemesis, are the other best lookers in Classic. Naturally this is my opinion. Except for T3 Warrior. That is a fact.
---
Doesn't matter who is correct here because it's flat out braindead to play with those damage numbers.
---
I think information based on private servers should be taken with a grain of salt, but I don't think they're completely invalid. They often had numerous developers and were a labor of love in order to try to make the experience as accurate as possible. That's not to say they're right, but I think finding discrepancies is still worth reporting and talking about.
---
Obviously they may not be spot on, but they generate bug reports and questions and that still helps the developers look into areas where there may be inconsistencies.
---
I don't think Blizzard has every last piece of data they need to recreate the game 100% exactly as it was back then. I trust that they're putting forward their best effort and are relying on the players to provide them feedback and reports to best recreate the original experience. I work as a developer for a pretty large company and it would be incredibly difficult for me to track down code from 2007 and earlier, so I can only assume Blizzard would have a similar experience.
---
If you've never played W3; it's a great game and really a fantastic way of getting ready for classic. It really sets the stage for WoW. No need to way for that reforged stuff I'd say ;)
---
They could just say our actions traveling back in time changed the future or something. It would probably be stupid and possibly poorly done but there's ways around it if they really wanted to I guess.
---
I’ve seen this post 100 times now lol
---
Yeah the problem is the teenagers connected into a lawless, slobbering horde.   
---
Or maybe I am getting old. Can't tell.
---
It comes down to this: do you want others to dictate how you play? Choose PvP. Do you want to go at your own pace and do whatever whenever? Choose PvE. (You can also PvP on PvE servers. Even world PvP.)
---
Oh, totally agree. I mean, we wouldn't want it to be as bad as fear. I was just wondering about it from a lore perspective. I guess you're transforming someone into a sheep with no wounds.
---
Imagine this: Pyroblast -&gt; Polymorph -&gt; Pyroblast -&gt; PoM Pyroblast. If poly didn't heal the target super quickly, it would be incredibly abusable in pve and especially in pvp.
---
Exactly. It's not about the pixels, it's about the time. By needing "for fun" when you dont really need the gear you just caused the other person to spend a lot of doing with no chance at reward.
---
I really fail to see why the time spent in a game is somehow less valuable than time spent doing something else.
---
Yeah nothin we can do though. Just wishfully thinking that they pop up a few more beta realms and invite more and more people. Just wanna try it get some early leveling path practice so i dont get stuck in the zerg on launch
---
When are you not? Unless you're playing in first person your character is pretty much front and center on your screen all the time.
---
Well, some people did want those things. 
---
Classic and modern WoW are for different audiences.
---
Blizz could chose many things, yet they chose to bury half their reputation in attempts to make everyone happy. Hope they will chose wisely next time. This goes beyond WoW.
---
So for now they could show some respect for the 2004 team and release that classic, and make sure i'ts not some franken-patch monstrosity.
---
Actually wrong. There was alot of talk about having pvp at all when wow was first made.
---
This is an Unpopular opinion.
---
I played retail vanilla on my mother's work computer and it ran totally decent framewise (except for that IF lag that yeeted you into the abyss). What kind of computers did you guys have back then? :D
---
Hot damn! You're really passionate about this, aren't you?
---
The easiest is to have specific realms and allow you to stay on a classic server or transfer for free to a bc enabled sever.
---
But to me it would be cool if they built out all the rest of the Kalimdor and Easter Kingdom zones and added 60 content to them. Like Hyjal and Caverns of Time. They existed then just not used until later in the game.
---
\[NA - Alliance\]   
---
Prot/Fury Warrior &amp; Dwarf Priest team of 2 looking for guild for Classic. Our current guild is going horde and we are FOR THE ALLIANCE FOREVER!  
---
Very experienced in all things WoW, both of us played and raided retail vanilla up to Wrath consistently. Been playing vanilla for the past 2 years on private so we are on top of our game right now, will get to 60 and start chewing content in a JIFFY comes release.  
---
We both have experience as guild leaders/officer roles, so we can help in this regard but it's not a requirement for us to join.   
---
The guild we're looking for is:    
---
\-NA Alliance East Coast based   
---
\-Raids 2-3x a week starting at 9PM EST and going up to 1AM EST, except Sat/Sun (we don't raid on weekends)   
---
\-Committed to clearing the entire content from MC to Naxx   
---
\-Laid back but focused during raids  
---
\-Mature yet fun in a friendly, non-toxic environment  
---
\-Transparent raid spot / loot system which is based on performance and attendance (we loathe nepotism / corrupt LC) -Full of nerdy min-maxers who understand how their classes work and want to be #1 server  
---
Please send a PM if interested. Thanks!
---
I don't even know what the point of your post is? What are you even saying should or should not happen?
---
You could just use rank 1 frost bolt instead, it would have the same effect in so many cases.
---
Rage generating abilities also cause threat. So your pull should look something like this,
---
Shoot skull with a ranged attack —&gt; break line of sight if any ranged mobs —&gt; use blood rage —&gt; use battle shout in range of all group members —&gt; demo shout —&gt; Revenge &amp; sunder as available until dead, refresh demo as needed.
---
Maybe a one time purchase of $15, the games nearly 15 years old, I can't really justify it being more than $5 a month since there is no more content being added as far as I know
---
So why even flaunt that there were 8 million subs in the first place? Did you seem to forget that possibly some of those 8 million are still playing retail today?
---
There is not the same amount of wpvp on a pve server as a pvp, like what? Obviously i was slightly exaggerating, there isn't 0 wpvp on normal servers, but claiming theres the same amount as a pvp server is just dumb
---
I think you’re right on with most of this. 
---
After about 2 years I’d expect classic’s population to start dropping significantly.
---
Fucking christ man. First you get disarmed and now you don't get beta invite? Might be time to punch a kangaroo and get the fuck outta there!
---
You have a point. Though I would say you're talking more about the casual players of wow. I don't think you can be that casual and be active in raiding in classic. The player base wont be as big as retail and you wont have pugs going nonstop due to no lfg. It takes a while to get 40 people together. This will make it harder for casuals to be able to raid due to time constraints. 
---
I think what might tip the scales are the addons. What will be allowed and what wont. People have a tough time with tunnel vision and multi tasking in general. If they dont have big flashy lights and loud sounds they will die most of the time. 
---
We will see when it comes out though. A lot can happen in between now and Naxx dropping.
---
it can be both. 
---
"how do we increase subscriber count?"
---
"There are 180,000 accounts on nost..."
---
not in vanilla, but similar happened to my enh shaman during WotLK.  First raid invite - ever - nearly fresh 80 and they just invited me to fill extra dps spot(sick carry guild that didnt need me tbh) and i got like 2 weps and like 3 or 4 armor in first 5 bosses lol  it was ridiculous. They werent even mad and used my experience to sell their raid run for a while lol
---
Not sure if I can provide a link.. but its .tv/irescath Just like my name. :)
---
If the group agrees, then fine. But, ML in pug 5 mans was not a regular thing, at least in my experience. Maybe other servers were different. ML only happened in raids.
---
you hush with your perfectly logical argument
---
we are busy gorging on member berries
---
I had some legit garbage PC from Staples in 2004. I mean, I could do 5 mans and questing content fine. But raids and main cities it was a shitfest.
---
I was Melee too. So I was basically queueing up actions through the framerate lag.
---
Eh seems like most complaints are directed at 2-3 streamers specifically. People just need to branch out more instead of defaulting to Asmon/Soda.
---
I watched Monkeynews, Perplexity, Joana most of the weekend and they were super chill.  Ziqo is chill as always and great to watch.
---
Am Alliance, I can confirm that gnomes are basically tiny meatshields.
---
Reworking modern WoW to be a little more like Classic? Maybe, if done correctly. I know this community is a heavy classic fan but there are some things in Retail WoW that players literally asked *for ages* to be included, like the Looking for Raid freature.
---
Also,
---
&gt; I'm fully aware they won't but they could. 
---
The thing is, I think they actually can't. Let's say that they introduce a new dungeon. Just one little dungeon. Druids get mad because their class isn't invited to do that dungeon, because the current players of online multiplayer games (be it WoW, LoL or Overwatch) is mad with gatekeeping and "following the meta".
---
Now the devs are pressured to finally buff Druids, somehow. They do it, the community complains *a lot*, because Blizzard can't balance right since Starcraft Brood War. Or maybe they do it right - the community will still complain, because now it isn't Classic anymore, and we need WoW Classic: Classic.
---
I'm just saying that figuring out how to progress with Classic WoW beyond naxx is a challenge that may be the mightiest thing Blizzard will do, *if* they do it at all instead of just creating tBC and WotLK servers.
---
Or you could trust the Blizzard team that have the source code from the original patch 1.12.1. There really isn't much debate to be had about this.
---
All those posts were of people saying that others aren't owed or that others are owed. This is just a thread asking why.
---
the chad hunter saga:
---
*runs out of arrows*
---
"haha no big deal i'll just make sure to grab some when i get back to crossroads"
---
*forgets to buy arrows before leaving xr*
---
"damn, haha that shit's kinda annoying..."
---
*pet runs away because happiness system is hard to understand and not really all that clear in the game*
---
"lol what the fuck is this game how was i supposed to know to feed my pet every fucken 20 seconds"
---
*pet pulls entire dungeon because pathing ai*
---
"dude why tf do people even like this game it took us 2 fucken hours to find a tank and then our healer just quits on the first wipe it wasn't even my fault this game is retarded"
---
*quits at level 22*
---
Goodbye chad hunter...
---
Sure just ignore all the video proof of actual classic mobs hitting the same as they are on the beta. Or Joanna saying they hit the same.
---
I am saying Blizzard is going to have to make the decision on how they plan on keeping players 2 years down the road.
---
Then dont play.
---
Play a private server.
---
Druids are generally better alliance side. I'd put one feral tank in a semi-hardcore progression guild. 
---
Dagger rogue nelf is the best dagger rogue due to base stats, but swords are usually prefered.
---
Hunter is the best honestly.
---
Id be shocked if anyone in NA was better than Tips. Battle hardened vanilla vet.
---
Well anything is PuG-able then. In every expansion i'm sure the hardest raid has been PuG'ed. I remember Black Temple PuG's back in TBC near the end, and that raid was so out of reach for 99% of guilds.
---
99% of people wont even get naxx attuned. So to say that it will be easy just because a select few might have an easy time with it is absurd. If 99% of players wont do something then i hesitate to use the word 'easy'.
---
heres a google / youtube search filter

---
Proof? Thank god they didnt make that mistake. Pvp is a huge chunk of the game
---
180,000 pirates
---
Well it breaks on damage but you're still right. I was thinking about it more from a lore POV.
---
Could also just use the Retail reference where they sent Garrosh. They've already set up that timeline patch so if there was a real push for this Alternate Timeline and money Blizzard would put towards it...it could be there.
---
Wow, that wasn't obvious already to anyone at all. Thanks for mentioning this never thought of possibility to everyone.
---
What if now we're living in the WoW universe where Garrosh went back and changed things? We never did get to see what changed in Azeroth based on Garrosh's actions.
---
I think OP was a tongue-in-cheek reference to  [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/)
---
They’re not gonna shut it down. They said at Blizzcon they’ll keep Classic servers up no matter how few people play it. But not to worry, there will always be a sizeable crowd for vanilla.
---
See you on the battlefield you piece of shit horde.  🖤
---
180k people that’ll QQ that it doesn’t match the incorrect private server values and mechanics then continue to play for free on said private servers.
---
If you have time for it go PvP, it's a blast. Myself, I got into university this year so I have no choice than to go PvE as PvP would take too much of my time.
---
don't forget about ventrilo
---
I'm of the opinion that, at least until the content plan is done, the game should remain as it was.
---
After that, I think any game would need new content to survive. We've all experienced that dead period after the last raid of an expansion has been out for months. OSRS experience the same even when its community didn't want any changes to their experience.
---
WoW Classic probably won't be a direct parallel to OSRS, but I think there are some lessons there to take away. OSRS forged its own path, divergent from RS3, and has done quite well for itself since then. Once Classic's content has gotten stale, I think it might do well to do the same.
---
But you will still be seeing it more than the 3 seconds on character select screen. Also a lot of people enjoy having their characters looks be aesthetically pleasing.
---
Consider me a gambler then, dear boy.
---
Ty kind stranger
---
The game is still alive and well, and its been emulated and played on private servers for soo many years. Why do you think that all of a sudden, the game will die ? After been played over and over and over again for so many years ?  
---
I see your point in wanting to venture on with new content or go into TBC, but personally i just want them to launch a new fresh server and let us play it again. And if i have to go back to private servers to do that, ok sure ill do that again.
---
Wish my dad had the ability to play because he likes watching me when I stay with him. He makes me put it on the 60" 4k(i dont complain) so he can see everything and turns up the surround nearly to max.   
---
He just doesnt have the motor functions or cognitive ability anymore...  
---
First game I ever played was with him, Top Gun on NES when I was 5.  We were MaveRick(his name is Rick) and Goose.  
---
Damn now im tearing up :(
---
Thank you man
---
Thanks - I think I might choose female nightelf.
---
But dude, pezman knows with 100% certainty. Are you saying he's a retard?
---
Logical? He can't write out a sentence, let alone an argument
---
The tough part in vanilla was almost always communication and organisation, the mechanics aren't tough, so i don't think addons will help that much.
---
I played on a like 3k pop server. There were maybe 3 guilds who could clear MC reliably (pre BWL) the rest were still fumbling around trying to get 40 attuned people or getting stuck halfway through MC.
---
Thats such a bad argument. Be aware of the sub rules btw, I'm not even subbed here but I read them. I already do but for WotLK, just because I don't want to pay the same price for the actual game that is still being worked on/updated doesn't mean I don't want to play WoW classic.
---
Because the numbers are being run through formulas that may be incorrect. Implementation can cause discrepancies. Which is why there are bugs
---
You can go play osrs i heard they got change
---
"Fucks around but still gets raid spots due to personality" - describes my vanilla guild pretty solidly.  /u/Dustinfl knows what I'm talking about.  Totally fun guild though and we still got a lot of shit done.
---
When you get use to it, you will most likely not go back. Thats what i think. TY gonna buy one
---
When the argument is lost, the insults come out
---
Np. I’m all for investigation.
---
Yes I’m 100% saying he’s a retard
---
I only remember the old website of elitist jerks. But all I found was this.
---
If mob def skill is less than 10 from your weapon skill its theorized to be 5%+(def skill - wpn skill) × 0.1%. That "will" give you your miss chance if u ignore hit rating.... allegedly.
---
Is there any kind of "pre-order reforged, get the old WC3" thing blizz is doing? If not, they massively missed a great opportunity to build up classic hype/sell more copies to classic players since reforged won't be out till after classic drops.
---
I use a Logitech g502, and only program like 3 abilities. 2 for cooldowns and one for auto run lol
---
There were massive engine changes between vanilla and TBC, how would they use the old values lmao
---
You think it's pedantic to differentiate between shitty and shittier?
---
The word shittier does in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM, imply the thing you're talking about is bad, just that it's not as good as what you're comparing it to.
---
Thank you! I didn't wanted to steal any spotlight to that great photo, but you just brought back nice memories, and a smile :)
---
Relax buddy. A year into classic and you'll be begging for a change from the vanilla gameplay style. Almost everybody wants TBC (and Wrath) - yea it started changes that we didn't want down the line but nobody will deny that it was a massive improvement in all aspects of the game.
---
made perfect sense to me
---
I really hope they go with a new timeline instead of just re-doing TBC. There's plenty in the world they can expand on.
---
people complain no matter what so there is no use addressing that. 
---
The most populated private servers I know of are all shutting down when classic drops
---
Praise the sun! Oh wait...
---
both.gif
---
Bestiary was released during TBC so take this with a grain of salt as most elites in particular where nerfed going from vanilla to TBC.
---
there is but I think you only get the stuff in retail wow
---
Hey, thanks for the reply.
---
That seems weird af, you should not be getting any glancing blows against enemies whose defense is &lt;= your weapon skill.
---
I don't get this post. Why freakout about what happens in two years with the game? Even then, seems like a pretty obvious choice to maintain classic and then either do TBC or post-naxx stuff, I think 100K is a super low number, especially because the population will spike greatly on the launch of anything
---
Me and my friend joked that eventually WoW would get so easy to level that they would give you an heirloom mount at level 1. And then they actually did.
---
this is amazing on so many lvls... as a wrath baby i remeber this in like 2010 or 2011... i love what you did with it. keep making druid mains proud!
---
I've legit never seen someone who is ACTUALLY pissed about piracy. What about it do you dislike so much?
---
This is the real unpopular opinion.
---
Don’t worry I’m sure there will be plenty that stay up because there are plenty of people who just refuse to pay $15/month
---
The title was added in tbc right? Being overtuned would make that more casual.
---
TBC
---
I wish they'd upgrade this with mechanical buttons. G600 is way too squishy and leads to missclicks. Better off going with Corsair or Razer.
---
I use it mainly for buffs, blink, bubbles, drinks. Stuff that you're not constantly casting, but it helps to have quick access to.
---
I stopped reading at "Arguably the hardest part of raiding back then was actually getting 40 people to show up".
---
For someone who spent countless days raiding for one of the top guild of my EU server, this make me cringe.
---
As a Druid player, I suggest you keep that opinion to yourself. The less people roll druid the more loot for us!
---
Lets say we have 2 casters and a lvl 30 int staff drops. One of them has a lvl 28 staff, so it's a minor upgrade for him, but the other has a lvl 18 one so it's massive. Wouldn't it be fair to at least **KINDLY IMPLORE** the former one to pass?
---
lets not forget that private servers were free
---
&gt; You are unable to Polymorph enemy targets that are tapped by players with whom you are not grouped. 
---
Welp there goes one of my opposite faction griefing ideas.
---
Hunter pets are absolutely disgusting at low levels and can solo most players
---
TimtheTatMan I think has very minimal experience with classic but doesnt stream it often only seen him get to level 13 a few daysago
---
Is it possible to play warlock good/viably without using pets? I love their sets as well, but can't stand the whole pet thing
---
Wait wow vanilla is out?
---
Np!
---
The thing is with HOTW, your playstyle is getting bleeds up and just sitting bear, you win by outlasting. You don't kite them around as you would with 8/12/31 or 30/0/21 so you don't really need it no. I personally would go without and put 1 more point into HOTW.
---
here's a post where i compared the damage values from SFK from Asmongold's run to a random level 25 Warrior in '06. accounting for the differences in available buffs, it seems like the mobs are doing damage that is more or less accurate to the Vanilla WoW versions.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5rxj/can_someone_explain_this_discrepancy_in_mob/eo29ftv/
---
This is me as well, I was 16 during my peak vanilla experience. I had nothing to do but my part time job and homework, outside of that it was all wow. I could farm for 2 hours then raid for 4 hours most nights. Now I am 29, married with a baby and a full time job. I will get maybe 1-2 hours a night to play and a bit more on the weekend so raiding is likely not going to happen and only the odd dungeon. Luckily there is still pvp so my goal is to get rank 10 so I can at least have some decent gear.
---
Which is exactly what i wrote in my bug report.
---
At first I thought the mob might be some weird edgecase that had higher defence than normal (it was the first of its kind i fought) but when I reengaged and it didn't happen for the next 10, I reported it as a bug.
---
You're going to see many, many more uninformed and entitled rogues doing that than hunters.
---
If your GM is a rogue or has a rogue buddy and it is not made abundantly clear that your first TFury will be going to the guild's most reliable tank, /gquit immediately.
---
I get everyone who has not got a beta invites frustration.
---
I know I got lucky to get in on day one of the Beta. I was shocked to be running around with streamers that day after I got home from work. I have had the same active account since 2005 except for a few months in WOD. I preorder every game Blizzard makes. Been playing Blizzard games since Diablo. 
---
Still don’t feel I was owed a beta invite. Glad I got one. I have reported the few bugs I’ve seen. Going  to test as much content as I can and give feed back. 
---
Been great so far. Looking forward to my vacation for the release week.
---
Hypothetical number, don't read too much into it.
---
I'm thoroughly glad you get to spend time together like that, he sounds absolutely lovely. I'm tearing up as well over here
---
If you plan on sit procing reck bombs. It doesnt work. And or shouldn't work come live
---
I don’t dislike piracy. I pirate plenty of stuff. I also don’t breathe down the necks of the developers and say “Hurr durr my pirated software is bugged you need to implement those bugs into the release version”
---
Oh dope just checked their site, you do get access to old school WC3 and TFT right away. The retail stuff is for the spoils of war edition which I'd never get since I don't play retail or hearthstone.
---
I have a feeling this is bait but I'll bite regardless.
---
Please enlighten me as to how you can tell hundreds of thousands of players who have been playing vanilla on private servers for years, that it’s "simply all nostalgia"? News flash, pal. People play older games because they like the game-play. End of... 
---
Hell, I prefer CS 1.6 over CS:GO for that very reason and still play it to this day.
---
Naxx attunement is just reputation and like 100 gold ? It is easy. Most of the player base is terrible but Naxx is hardly gate-kept by being in a top guild anymore. Those days have passed. You will see PuGs of upper-echolon players in Naxx, it won'y just be the top 1% anymore. Probably the top 10% or so.
---
the G600 is the best mmo mouse imo. the G button on your ring finger effectively gives you 24 buttons all on your right hand, add in shift and alt binds and you have 48 keybinds without ever needing to touch your 1-12 keys. 
---
its a godsend
---
Agreed
---
Once you turn in the quest at the shrine, you had the complete rod in your bag and had no need to pick up the follow-up quest, keeping your log clear.  That's how it was up until Cata so hopefully is the same in Classic.
---
Those people will never be customers so it isn't worth worrying about them.
---
Above it they say you can't poly an already tagged enemy. Was that always a thing? 
---
Seems like a helpful mage could poly an enemy and help save your life.
---
I think all the rogue sets are ugly. Bonescythe is kinda okay, but kinda boring. And rogue is the class I like the most to play/feel most comfortable playing. rip
---
You can have your pet out but it will almost certainly die. Just dismiss it before the jump in MC
---
people have been playing vanilla for almost 15 years now, i dont think longevity is going to be an issue
---
Lol I guess, but you can't say the userbase will fall under the limit to raid and the say you have no idea what the pop will be
---
Sure :)
---
lmao, what?
---
Ambush backstab crippling poison eviscerate
---
Anybody seen crushing blow?
---
This is not accurate, while you can frost in both pve and pvp they're VASTLY different specs.
---
If he has 5000 armor/71% DR then that would put the mob's raw damage at about 190, which I guess is kind of close to the 141 (after mitigation on leather) cited in the Allakazam comment in the OP.
---
Druid was definitely NOT shit in Vanilla.
---
I think we'll have a better idea of how the Classic team is once we're a year or so in. Maybe then, combined with focus on player input before pushing any content, Blizzard could consider the idea.
---
Best possible outcome is this. No raised level cap, no new skills or gear. Cosmetic upgrades only for the new teirs.
---
for healing yes
---
For?
---
what are you two talking about? Are there tier sets below these?
---
But... It looks exactly the same
---
&gt; WoW will always take the cake for best cosmetics in any game.
---
*Black Desert Online would like to know your location.*
---
Honestly use what spells you want. I always pull with Holy Fire because it looks fucking sick.
---
true true, did not think of that, I blame tiredness :p
---
It's not bait, it's genuine concern.
---
You also need to understand that private servers are free, which means players can just pick up and every now and then.
---
Are you realistically going to pay $15 a month for a game that is in maintenance mode for years to come?
---
Using your formula that would us put at a base miss chance of 6% + (315 - 300) \* 0.4 % = 12 % against boss level enemies. That seems to high.
---
I think on most private servers it was something like 8,6% (plus an additional +19% if you dual wield).
---
99% play them because retail has been fucking shit for 10 years. Dont gimme that nonsense about pirate. Your a fucking sheep. Go farm transmog and pet battle a panda.
---
Hey! Hey! Wanna join my guild?!?!!? 
---
We're going to raid Molten Core.. ha ha
---
Half the mechanics in pserver raids don’t work properly.
---
Pservers world buff and flasks are easy to get and low cd. In retail it was used rarely, most never used flasks. In pservers every raid is stacked with world buffs and flasks every raid. That along with sit bug is why warriors are gods of pserver raids.
---
1 piece would drop per dungeon as bop and the belts, gloves and bracers were boe
---
lol Yes it does. It implies one is shitty, and the other is shittier.
---
Not entirely true. The hands actually weren’t BoE for all of vanilla. They were made BoE, but like the shoulders and boots they drop from a single random boss.
---
You may not understand it but there are people who have been playing vanilla constantly since beta...  I have been playing vanilla on private realms since approx 2010/11 and have levelled literally hundreds of characters and raided on most classes and pvp'd too.  You ask why do I still do the same thing over and over? Well I meet new people EVERY day.
---
I have known others like me that drift from server to server looking for a home, and classic is going to offer us the real fans that exactly that.  The vanilla community pre nostalrius was about 15k people total, nostalrius attracted another 200k+ plus to the scene, Nost closed and the petitions were sent and this sub-reddit was created.  The community has grown from a few thousand to possibly MILLIONS in the space of 5 years.  Why? Because 50 or so dedicated developers and hundreds of volunteers and thousands of passionate fans played the game enjoyed the game and talked about the game.  
---
So should we now start moving the goal posts of what the "community" wants because the community is now vastly different to what it was not a few years ago.  The original player request was for vanilla servers, nothing more, nothing less.     
---
We are fortunate to be in this position, and please dont forget it was PLAYER DEMANDS that pushed retail to a game people didnt end up enjoying.
---
End of rant.
---
When OSRS was released, I was so happy about no G.E, and would have quit if they added it.
---
The difference is the $15 price tag.
---
These are tier 0. There's some shit you can do to upgrade tier 0 gear into tier .5
---
Is the improved poisons talent (5/5 +10% chance to apply poisons) in the Assassination tree worth taking for PvP since we don't have Shiv in Classic? I'm worried about not getting crippling procs and getting kited to oblivion, without Shadowstep or Shiv. Any vanilla Rogue PvPers try this talent to see if it makes a noticeable difference?
---
This is unreal content. r/lotrmemes would be so proud
---
Thanks for describing WoW's evolution up to BFA.
---
Oh, and since you brought OSRS, there are many that disagree on said changes and many that want "true" OSRS servers.
---
So what if it grows? WoW grew up to WOTLK and was at it's peak, yet its that same expansion that started the decline.
---
Have you considered that a game might simply have to die someday? Will you force me into playing OSRS or TBC? Or you will give everyone a server? How will that work exactly, i mean...you brought up the community split yourself.
---
Don't want mob rule, sorry. Changes eventually bring players because of said changes. Player that came after 1 year of additions and changes, doesn't vote based on what the game was, but based on the changes that brought them in the first place.
---
Or to make it simple, if i don't want anything but Classic with fresh servers every 3 years, i should go \^%\^@ myself right? Believe it or not, many don't give a flying @##@ about OSRS, so how much people can you reach to before everything tears itself appart?
---
Classic
---
Classic+
---
WoTLK
---
PvP/PvE/RP servers for EVERY one of these, + fresh servers. tell me your magic way of making everyone happy if you was Blizzard?
---
Maybe sometimes the developer might need to wave the middle finger to people and their ideas.
---
AcKsHuaLLy!!!!
---
But they can certainly do more than one thing because they have multiple servers.
---
Bro! No, slow the fuck down! Hold on, hold, I got news for you son! Just let me fucking finish! After all.... shut up!
---
Wow you just came in with a super aggressive and broad stance generalizing the community of classic WoW into one entity that you don’t like. Color me shock that you got banned. In all seriousness though I didn’t even play vanilla, nor do I plan to I just like the news but you are basically doing what you said the other side was doing. You basically just wrote off the entire non pserver side of the WoW classic playerbase and tried to play the victim saying they are just here to demonize pservers. Get over yourself
---
No, it implies one is shittier than the other, regardless of whether or not the latter is shitty.
---
Oh look..
---
Another post of someone bitching that will be deleted very soon.
---
or blizzard could just compare it on the sandbox 1.12 gold server
---
Hang out in tinkertown in ironforge and you will very quickly realize what you’ve been missing.
---
I agree completely. 
---
That said, I want this batch of servers to be as 2006 as possible. 
---
I want them to iterate on classic. Make classic hard—that’s what we all say we want. Keep the pace, but make it tough. 
---
Give every class a 3-5 (gasp 6) button combat rotation. Let us keep our 30+ key bound abilities.
---
Give us raid content that isn’t brain dead. Implement mythic difficultly mechanics in a Vanilla mindset—40 man raids, 1 difficulty, tuned to 15 year veterans, 1 set of drops (no titanforging), keep resistance sets and a reliance on consumables at the highest level. 
---
Retune dungeons to be challenging and require cc. Decent players can still blitz through 5 man’s even in leveling greens (though those first few runs are the most fun) give us mechanics more interesting than tank and spank, but maintain that vanilla focus on trash and don’t let it all just be aoe bullshit, like today.
---
Keep the world large by not having flying mounts and making everything we want to accomplish a reason to go out in it. Keep the uniqueness of the classes but work to make them a bit more functional vs eachother—especially at 19, 29, 39, 49, 60. Keep a system of pve’ing to PvP and having good Pve gear from PvP. Keep us farming by keeping good sources limited—no daily quests. Keep all zones 40+ relevant, be they where raid zones are (or next to, Badlands, Kargath, for example) or where farming is or where consumable materials are. 
---
Keep the progression creep in check, offering measured upgrades, so those in blues and t1 don’t feel impotent v 2/2.5 but those in better gear feel unquestionably better. Don’t wipe gear, offer catch up content, like zg and aq20 and the raid 20 man raid that never came after naxx, require players go through mc to get to bwl to get to aq to get to naxx.
---
Keep existing attune,ents and possibly add more a la BC attunements. 
---
Rework some loot and talents and abilities to make certain class specs viable. 
---
Remove 16 slot debuff and retune boss health.
---
I mean me too thanks
---
Yes, youre gonna be a squishy tank, but a tank nonetheless. A healer and an off healer should suffice in healing you if youre trying to kill trash and the tank is afk or something.. but you do get hit hard because you dont have plate nor the defensive cooldowns and abilities
---
You’re*
---
You want at least 1 or 2 weeks br1 to get to 13, Compared to 4 or 5 for r14. If one is possible the other is. But don't expect to sleep.
---
People will stop posting this thread
---
Frostfire honorable mention no?
---
How are they going to determine you fit a better criteria than those who got in? Pserver experience is gonna help you test bugs in the beta.
---
Imagine trying to be pedantic, then accusing the other person of being pedantic, then when said person explains how he isn't, you run out of arguments.
---
Must feel pretty darn sad.
---
Criteria is subscription and flagging your account for beta? And some patients. Stress test starts tomorrow. I would imagine they are not inviting more til after.
---
Judgement &gt; Dreadnought &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything else.
---
Guys the streamers will be gone when the next big game comes out. You might have 1 or 2 but the real big ones ( I would drop names but I don't watch them so I don't know them) will be gone, then classic will be like we want it. We will just have to ride the shit wave till then.
---
Well Pserver proofen to be Wrong in many Things. So people.from.pserver are prob. Not so good testers AA they through
---
What’s the French song called?
---
didnt they remove resources from av tho in this current patch?
---
I see that you, too, are going to be leveling a paladin.
---
I have to say that is really motivating but I have a couple friends and we've all always played Alliance and to top it off...I really dislike the Horde leveling zones. They seem either bleak (Undead) or kind of bland (Orc/Troll/Tauren). I also don't get the entirety of my nostalgia fix since it's the Alliance zones I remember.
---
Thank you anyway though 😉
---
This is insanely sad, people like you do more damage to the release of classic then retail players having no clue what they’re doing with that gatekeeping.
---
Ok, then I don't understand where you're coming from. Seems like you're just arguing to be arguing.
---
A lot of the bugs on the list are only on the list because of private server players believing everything not being like nost is a bug.
---
The holy quartet: tanks, healers, DPS and the mascot.
---
&gt; which he definitely has since he wears a shield
---
thats not a given... his hands are glowing which means he is ret, which also means that shield could be an old quest reward and he could be in mostly leather or mail... or shit even cloth.
---
Fighting hunters isn't really 1v1, its more like 1v1.5 or 1.75 because of their pet.  Especially so for casters and spell pushback.  And they're ranged and have good tools for kiting melee, also.
---
Yes smaller hitboxes
---
Very true, I forget that it isn't assumed any more that someone is going to be skinning. The funny part was that they were the only that cared and the DPS was also a warrior. If he was in such a hurry why not queue for tank instead of DPS.
---
warlock dungeon set ftw
---
streaming pserver of course, by this sub local hero cm_ythisen, after he stalked me for a week.
---
i always thought you could only poly humanoids
---
This is why people won’t play with you if you’re on master looter. If it’s an upgrade to both casters, they both need it.
---
Glad you could have a civil discussion.
---
Same !
---
that's actually normal afaik. I farmed him as a rogue, solo for a dagger i recall. I'm pretty sure i was like, level 30 too. tricky, but doable to solo.
---
Isn't the 1.12 mount system way better? Whats not to like about it?
---
Sorry you did not have the gumption to say this reply specifically to the people who you had in mind when you made it. Maybe you will get lucky and they will stumble across your thread and you will get that vindication.
---
They reversed course in cata and made the heroics hard again.
---
In any case it can’t hurt to familiarize yourself with the stats each class is looking to itemize for. Then you know when you see 2% hit on Truestrike it’s gonna be pretty damn good for all the physical DPS
---
I remember you. Definitely envied your status and gear. As a rank 13 warrior from a semi decent raiding guild on azgalor, i followed a lot of the top warriors. Even grouped with you back when aq40 was on the test realm. Great pics too, I like the pvp one. Vanilla player names seemed to have so much more thought into them especially without the server tags.
---
very proofen
---
Thanks for the info. Copped this and will use it for different druid/mage macros.
---
I’m mainly just fucking with the retarded private server crowd. I mean seriously, it’s like they don’t realize private servers are emulation. All the numbers are best guesses. Made up. Blizzard has the actual data that private servers are trying to emulate. It’s stupid. So much reeeeeing that they have to be subscribed to get into the beta. Entitled children.
---
The 1st two youtube links are still broken.
---
Same here! I also am excited to level up fishing and cooking instead of just grinding LFG and PVP all day long in retail.
---
1.6Ghz  i5  with 8gigs of ram.  Only has the 128gb sdd    i didn't plan on using it for much when i got it
---
In every UBRS group half the people are gonna come just for the TS
---
Demo and sacrifice
---
&gt;wrote off the entire non pserver side of the WoW classic playerbase
---
No I wrote of the regulars of this subreddit, who do nothing but insult pservers for no reason. I say nothing bad about anyone else, I am completely fine with any player who likes classic/vanilla/pservers.
---
Ok but that isn't what people are saying. People here are treating streamers like they are providing some kind of generous contribution to the public because of the goodness of their hearts. You need to take them off the pedestal and realize they are no more charitable than Wal-Mart or BP.
---
"i play on a private server i deserve beta i know better then people who played in vanilla" idk if you know this, but private servers turned out to be wrong on alot of things
---
I couldn’t name a single piece of gear I’ve gotten in WoW the last 10 years.
---
Yet you know corpsemaker, nuff said.
---
I'd expect it to simply match wowwiki. I don't think wowwiki authors (theorycrafters of the past) could be wrong, and I also think Blizz checked it before releasing the Beta because it's pretty basic.
---
I have 13 active subs right now &lt;3
---
Ok Bloodfang is also okay, like the Bonescythe. I think the Bloodfang set just instinctively feels repulsive to me because I've been grieved so many times by 20+ lvls higher Bloodfang wearers. Also I think it's cliché. But yes, when I look at it more and try to analyze it more I think it's ok. But only ok. Not good. :p
---
Games just easy, always has been.
---
Hell of a lot better than his VA work in Destiny, that's for sure!
---
Seriously though, I do actually like PD a lot. I promise.
---
Ah that's true. I only played a few months of Cata and skipped WoD. 
---
What I remember of Cata was the Heroics were initially challenging, but were nerfed not long after release.
---
Hypotethical: let's assume beta values are correct and we are collectively misremembering and observers. Would the NoChanges crowd be open to buffing the damage to recreate that "difficult" experience?
---
Isn't classic db, private server database ? Just like most of the vanilladb websites
---
In some situations it can be an advantage, in some it can be a disadvantage. In vanilla, you could hide under water so that a pvp enemy won't spot you. With the transparent water, he will see you (even if on your screen the water is opaque and you're not visible).
---
And while it's fun to reminisce about merching and buying things in fally world, the game was dying before they added in the GE. It, along with new raids and other content, fundamentally made the game better.
---
Druid HoTs aren't very strong.
---
From what I remember, even Renew is stronger than Rejuv - and priests are much, much better healers overall.
---
First - Who the fuck cares?  I’m in the mid 30’s, pay VERY little attention to streamers at all.  Just ignore them.  Why does a streamer having easier access to mats, or a large following of friends impact you at all?  Just mind your own business and you won’t even know they’re there.  Hard for me to believe a self proclaimed ‘man’ hasn’t yet come to the conclusion that the rich and famous and those with a large circle of friends have advantages throughout all of life, not just online gaming. 
---
Second - viewership will drop substantially after the game releases and all people who are dying to play the game actually can.  Right now viewership is severely inflated because it’s the only way for those not in beta (vast majority) to ‘experience’ any of the game at all.  There is zero chance this game will be a top watched game from a streaming perspective by the end of this year.
---
There's lot's they could use, the original Vanilla was meant to be higher level cap(70) and more content basically hitting on and continuing/wrapping up the lore from the previous games.  Most of that got cut from classic and re-imagined for other xpacks and the big 3 Arthas/Illidan/Deathwing each got their own xpack with expanded extra zones and lore based around scrapped vanilla  content.  While they could definitely expand Classic and use that content in a way it was originally intended, and I would be fine with that, they would need to keep certain vanilla quirks like itemization jankiness to make it work.  If they use modern design philosophy of new content should always offer better gear then gearing becomes a vertical moonshot once new content is released instead of diagonal/horizontal gearing which exists in vanilla up until basically Naxx.
---
&gt; Clearly, there's no criteria for entry into the Beta...
---
Citation Needed.
---
Wholesome!!!!
---
That's how I read it too.
---
TBH once AV is out Hunters get their best preraid weapon and any dungeon drops really do become stat sticks for rogues and warriors. The AV quest xbow is only replaced with Rokdelar in MC or later when Zg/aq 20 are our
---
Yeah, that's exactly what Beta needs. Substituting players who don't know the genuine 1.12.1 values with other players who also don't know the genuine 1.12.1 values. Additionally, playing on a pserver doesn't guarantee you still aren't just a lookyloo tourist who wants early access, and doesn't guarantee you'll actually bugtest and report instead of posting about it on reddit for e-cred.
---
Look, I like what the pserver scene has done. They've done an admirable job and put in a lot of work into creating an authentic experience and I think they succeeded. But literally all of us know there's a lot of guesswork in there. Educated guesswork, I would say, but guesswork all the same.
---
theres also the difference of having to download an illegal client through a third party that also cant be advertised or promoted. so having an official game supported by blizzard that will be properly advertised and marketed. and people have been paying 15$ for wow since the beginning of time and its never been an issue, so that argument doesnt really work.
---
If he’s a chad hunter he would be succeeding through his sheer inherent betterness.
---
Just because they are different companies, doesn’t mean that they can’t work together
---
There’s been cases before where they work together, like you can link your twitch account to your blizzard account, there’s been times if you connect you amazon prime to your twitch account you get stuff in a blizzard game, when you watch X on twitch you get something in a blizzard game, use bits on twitch to cheer for a team in a blizzard tournament and get stuff in that blizzard game
---
So asking Blizzard if they want their wow split up or not, seems very possible imo. It’s not like it’s gonna cost Twitch anything, but it keeps a good relationship with blizzard
---
Your comparing a beta capped at lvl 30 to BfA, and classic is still better.
---
Enjoy your dead game
---
You are totally right! Great read!
---
I have actually a story to tell about the Dwarf Priest being the only option trend...
---
Back in Vanilla I played Night Elf Priest, I was part of very good guilds but still a tad short of being cutting edge guilds if that makes sense. I cleared AQ40 and a Wing on Naxx by the time BC was announced or got a release date, I can't really remember exactly which one was but I know it was when we found out raids were becoming 25 man next expansion (or at least when my guild realized that anyway)!
---
So that kinda affected the guild I was in, instead of trying to invest as much as we could on Naxx and try to clear as much content as we could before BC, hopefully finishing it...some officers started to plan ahead and were already establishing stuff for next expansion, who would remain raider, who will become benched or 2nd team, etc...that took an huge hit on progression and over all moral (who would guess right?) and was clear the guild was going nowhere.
---
I then knew that the best guild on my server that was wiping on Kelthuzad was recruiting a priest...so I applied, it was me and 2 other priests.
---
One of the officers of said guild commented on my apply and said exactly this: "Not being a Dwarf show you are NOT serious about raiding!"
---
I was devastated, like my apply got shat based on my race alone...I mean I created my character knowing nothing about the game, should I just rerolled and lvl another priest when I found out months later getting into raiding?
---
I am currently progressing on Naxx and I don't take raiding serious? What?
---
Ofc that I was a teenager but that kinda destroyed my enthusiasm for the remaining time of the expansion...I felt like a big deal inside the game (which is also ridiculous) only to find the "real deal" and being treated like an idiot.
---
I ended up not entering the guild. To be completely fair, the guy who got in while being a Dwarf had more progress in Naxx and slightly better gear than me so maybe that was just an asshole officer and the race wasn't the deciding factor (not entirely anyway).
---
No I won't be using a quest helper but I'm not fussed about playing optimal, I just want to have a good time
---
Ca plane pour moi - Plastic Bertrand
---
Didn't LFG come out in WotLK?
---
Someone challenged my statement about them prioritizing vanilla accounts and I went to recover my old account and the GM said this.
---
Nah it would not be happening if it wasn't for Omar Gonzalez.
---
Sure looks legit.
---
You don't get how it works. It's not about minimum DPS. It's about getting invited into a guild.
---
A raid leader does not want a ret paladin. They will take a ret paladin if there isn't anyone else but you are not desired.
---
Yeh mythic is a boring pile of shit.
---
But he is legend. 
---
There are always those folks in games with communities, and that's why it's so important for community to be important.
---
I'll never forget Onekagai from Tempest server in SWG. He was a total troll bounty hunter who is now legend to me.
---
Exactly this. I am not saying changes have to be something that makes it similar to retail.
---
I am saying they need to take it into a different direction and use the same vanilla philosophy and apply it to new content they add.
---
Yes :-) Seems you Like correct people. Why Not get a teacher?
---
Can't believe anyone would be stupid enough to think that it did.  DO 2007 ACCOUNTS GET IN!?!?!?!?!
---
I haven't tried playing with one of these because I'm not sure I could get used to all those thumbkeys lol. I prefer a simple(ish) 10-button mouse and just use ctrl or shift modifiers if I need them.
---
Still, good find. Might be time for me to try one out since my old mouse is broken.
---
Is this a personal attack or something?
---
Sorry, I meant relevant* game.
---
I bet they keep them up till launch day honestly. More testing. More streamer hype. Keep the hype train at full speed into the release day imo.
---
Random unless you stream.... Then it's guaranteed access.
---
as a new player how do i know if i need an item or not?
---
The best thing about druid bullying threads (accurate or not) are the hyperdefensive druids replying.
---
Interesting, do you have a link to what the tier 0.5 sets look like?
---
&gt; Deep frost winterchill can work in pvp too.
---
Vanilla mage here, I just want to emphasize *can work* here.  Sure, you have key frost talents like Ice Barrier, Ice Block, Cold Snap at your disposal in PvP, but those 5 points in WC and 3 points in Frost Channeling really eat into what you would much rather prefer in PvP: improved CoC, Shatter namely.  You won't have these talents in a PvE Winter's Chill spec without essentially going 39+ points into Frost.
---
&gt; Thats for the kind of moment im excited for classic :)
---
Honestly though if you kill 1000 sheep in Elwynn Forest you get a sheep mount.
---
Hey so, this is a good question. I have a mid 2010 iMac that at the time was fully tricked out with all the top upgrades. It still does all kinds of stuff super well, but when I click 'play' in the Retail launcher, it tells me that my video card is no longer supported by Blizzard (or some such). I looked it up, and sure enough, my card is not on the list. 
---
I am wondering whether it will run the Classic client. My hope is that I'll get a Beta invite so that I can determine whether I need to buy a new machine.
---
Because literally everyone who works on WoW at Blizzard are incompetent?
---
&gt;For example, Shadow priests for Shadow Weaving.
---
You bring a holy priest actually that just keeps up the debuff. You don't bring shadow priests.
---
Are you watching the fucking videos from 2006 that people are posting here? The damage values are correct. End of story.
---
That's why everyone who has posted they got in has been 04/05 outside of PR accounts
---
I agree now, but if you told me that at the start of OSRS, I would be pissed, which is kind of funny when I read people discussing classic wow here. 
---
This post reminded me of how I felt about the re-release of my childhood game.
---
Will be interesting too see how the wow classic community will evolve. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/NuRBytz.png
---
It is definitely not the optimal pvp spec no.
---
Well, there's a bluepost out there saying they **may** take other factors into consideration such as subscription lengths and account age.
---
Frankly playing on a private server should bar you from beta entirely
---
Speaking of fun addons....I sure hope texas hold'em makes a comeback in time for Vanilla raiding!
---
Having a secret 6-8 man group playing poker in-game through an addon was some top ramen shit way back when.
---
Bejeweled was BC, I remember Popcap hired the addon developer and turned the addon into an official product, it was pretty big news. Peggle was after that.
---
I don't think they are, at all. First, all the issues raised here when talking about streams are about how they can impact social aspects of WoW and since we are mostly in our 20s or more here, it won't be as impactful as game with a younger crowd. Second, WoW is not like, for example, a moba, where a big streamer will start a different build or playstyle and the community will try to copy that. I'm sure that stales the meta in retail arena tho. Also, Dota 2 has 700k people playing and 60k twitch viewers. WoW has 6 million players and 80k people watching it (at the time i'm making this post). That does matter when we are talking about how streamers actions can alter your experience ingame.
---
Questing guides and addons have a bigger impact on the game then streamers being a dick on his 5man runs, imo.
---
You can use imp and let it stay stealthed, it'd basically just be a walking HP aura / fire shield giver.
---
play what u want. But if ur not up for micro managing pet then warlock might not be a good long term class to play
---
Nice! I'm rolling a mage too, I'm excited to make use of all these buttons :P
---
IIRC there was weird interaction with Arcane Missiles, in which each hit of the missile had a separate roll chance.
---
**WE KNOW**
---
BUT WE DONT CARE
---
Will cross that bridge when we get there, for now lets start the game from square 1 and go from there! THE TIME IS NOW, OLD MAN!
---
You are all wrong. I soloed him all the time. Rogues all did for his dagger. **See this is the type of shit that triggers me. Everyone claims to have played vanilla, then calls authentic stuff "off".... No its NOT off.**
---
Go read the old comments on classic wowhead. Soloing fallout was common on rogues.
---
&gt; Are you realistically going to pay $15 a month for a game that is in maintenance mode for years to come? 
---
People sing this song and TBF it's a pretty weak argument. I spend more money on coffee ***per week...*** In the end we're playing because it's a source of entertainment.
---
Damn some high quality forum roleplay going on here.
---
Define "players" please. If you get bored quit, if you think the game will ever reach "0" players because it lacks content, well not gonna happen. I don't see D2 being dead, all blizzard has to do is put fresh servers with the same timely content release, like classic launch will have. If you are a fan you don't care if there is one realm with 10k players or 50 realms with a million each. Or maybe you are concerned about what Blizzard will earn, and if they are going to starve on the streets? Im really trying here...what the hell people mean when the say "retain players". What is that number of players you people are talking about and why does it matter? For whom does it matter?

Thank you. I’ve been wondering that since watching Eurotrip in 5th grade
---
Several IIT saying stuff like: "ey, tier .0" or "ey, tier 0.5". Do you have a link or something for what u r talking about? :)
---
Because it doesn't fit their viewpoint. Just take it all with a grain of salt.
---
Then you run into the problem of people realizing everything after BC is bad and it's just over. The game slowly become bad. Instead we could have old wow and new wow. It would take some balls and committment from Blizzard but people have been wanting old back for over ten years. For ten years we didn't have a game in the market that filled a void. I would like to have more of that content if at all possible.
---
How come? Am I missing something or do you farm gold or something? I havent played retail in years
---
I always loved flying from Ironforge. It is so beautiful to me that I don’t mind just looking around.
---
It was prooven that they prefered old Accounts. But not exclusively.
---
thats not true. the private server players are generally the most hard core vanilla fans. alot of people avoid private servers because they dont want to have to re-level their characters every few months because a new server pops up or dont want to risk all of their progress being deleted overnight because a server gets shut down.

OP is literally using the Nostalrius database as “proof”, as well as a single comment. 
---
We don’t know anything except the level of the commenter. We don’t know their armor, if they got crit or if they’re simply exaggerating. Hell, we don’t even know if he was on caster form trying to heal himself while taking those hits. 
---
Don’t use pserver databases as proof, that should be common sense. Especially something like Nost, which was popular because of the population and passion behind the project, not because of its scripts.
---
I agree the fanbase of these streamers can at times be bad. But they can also bring people to do events in the game that they enjoy and have fun doing. No one is even getting defensive, i joined this subreddit to get info and learn about vanilla/classic. Not complaining about streamers in a beta ya know.
---
I've been planning to play a holy prot/pally for dungeon farming for a while now. They are slow at leveling solo though.. Kargoz and some friends tested out leveling on different classes and duo leveling. Hunter and locks are great at solo leveling, but their top tier duo was Holy/Prot + Lock, which was surprising but makes a ton of sense. Their aoe pulling, tanking and farming potential beats mages by a long shot.
---
**Sooo, I'm looking for an alliance Warlock.**
---
Pallies and locks both get free mounts, use different weapon types and armor types (no conflicts, can share un-needed drops) both have great AOE and compliment each other with seals helping a lock to regen life/mana and focus on damage. You have a set tank/healer for dungeons and the ability to summon people. I would love to find a duo leveling partner that can go HAM (8-20 hours a day) the first couple of days of release. After 50-60, you can do your own thing if you want as aoe farming hearthglen or WPL is pretty easy.
---
* *Intended region* **North America- Central time (Austin, TX)**
---
* *Intended server type* **Normal or PVP**
---
* *Intended faction* **Alliance**
---
* *Intended raid/play times* **Not sure yet.**
---
* *Any priority you may have in a guild* **Leveling at first, farming second. I don't have a ton of time to play on a regular basis, but intend to take some time off for release. When things slow down, I'll usually play solo and farm just to build a twink character since they require less time investment to build. My main pally is use to farm lower level dungeons for gold and gear.**
---
* *Any pertinent rules*. **I intend to go Enchanting and Blacksmithing. I would love someone who wants to go Tailoring and Mining. We can help each other out. I'll eventually make enough gold to buy ore or level a miner.**

Lol I download the bnet client on my work computer so I can check at work. Don’t worry boss I haven’t downloaded any actual games, yet.
---
Cool.  I’ll compare with mine at home.  Thanks!
---
No you banish mobs, put curses on mobs and then shadow bolt
---
I think all of these scores are worse than cancer and they should be banned from classic, from retail, from everything.

Vanilla is all about imperfect game design...
---
Almost every Blizzard beta lasts up to the last week before launch.
---
So um...how much time do i get to complete that content before you enforce Mob Rule on me?
---
This is pretty accurate. I was...16? 17? when Vanilla released. I played a sport and I had a part time job...but outside of that I was able to play as much as I wanted.
---
Now with Classic release I'll get to pseudo experience that for a brief window, where myself and a few others request a few days off of work...but after that it's back to casual hours and casual playing.
---
oh sorry mate, i didn't realise i was writing a letter to the queen.
---
Are they going to let the beta toons roll over to live in August?
---
Yes. It is not optimal to have to primarily use abilities on the keyboard. I use 1-9 on my mouse and it's amazing
---
I don’t feel like people shitting on the pservers have played them.
---
The beta would be laggy as fuck for australians anyway haha, at least it would be the true vanilla experience, didnt get our own servers until much later on.
---
Go outside
---
&gt; Whole world should just run on a 24-hour clock.
---
Pretty much. It's a totally arbitrary numbering system. Who the fuck cares if the work day is 23:00 - 07:00? As long as it matches up with daytime where you are, everything will work fine.
---
It was in vanilla, just not in 1.12. Was likely changed around 1.10 but I don't remember exactly.
---
I'm currently on my way home, will tell you the whole story later.
---
This was my assumption as soon as people started reporting the values being wrong. It's also the worst case scenario, because that's the patch Blizzard is going with regardless of how much we complain.
---
I'm sure some tryhard add-on dev will create some kind of tool to artificially gatekeep people out of content in one way or another. Ilvl doesn't work since there are level 50 greens that are better than 60 epics.
---
You'll get used to it and never want to go back.
---
&gt; You accusing anyone who doesn't kiss the feet of pserver devs as "hating pservers" 
---
LOL kiss the feet? Bit of an exaggeration don't you think? My point was literally that the numbers are a good resource that shouldn't be ignored. Does that sound like kissing the feet? 
---
&gt; The pserver devs didn't even have numbers, as you readily admit
---
no shit, do you think blizzard would send them source code if they asked nicely?
---
The community backed out calculations and data based on video evidence, the exact same thing people are still doing *to this day* to find bugs with Beta. 
---
The nice thing is, lots of that has already been done on pserver, so let's not ignore that resource.
---
If you don't agree with that last sentence you have an emotional or a logic problem, simple as that.

Name checks out.

Thank you for taking your time to write an actual response instead of just writing some random angry hater stuff.
---
I don't really care about beta entry, personally, I can wait 3 months as I am still active on the Pservers and the community hasn't changed much at all since the Blizz announcement. Actually, the majority of the Pserver commnities share the same sentiment the Official Blizz community shares; "We don't want to play with you guys!" so I absolutely understand the hate I'm getting for making the suggestion that Pserver people should have some type of priority for Beta. 
---
I just find it funny that the "beta" is more or less a theme park tour for people with active subscriptions, obviously, the vast majority of Pserver people wouldn't have an active sub and haven't had one in ages
---
I used message boards back then and I still only use message boards today(Reddit is basically a modification of a message board).  I really don't see how social media comes into play.  The only thing I could see is that social people already have groups they run with while back in the day it was all new so people were looking for guilds and people to group with in general.
---
Mad hit on exactly what WoW brought which was that it was the gateway for many people in their first experience with massive multiplayer online games.  I remember my first time between swept up in a horde counterattack from the barrens that ran through ashenvale all the way to darkshore and just constantly typing "Holy ****", "this is amazing" to my friend from Guild Wars who I was playing with.  I remember being blown away my first time stepping into Molten Core with 39 other people
---
Healing priest. Sure you can min max and take none of the expressly PvP talents. But they are easy to pick up and you sacrifice very little. 
---
You can pick up 99% of a pve build and get most PvP talents or get 90% and get all.
---
If anything, this video makes it clear that pservers are less "made up" than people thought.
---
I think you would be awfully surprised how many people will still play private servers simply because of the fact that it's free.
---
I haven’t seen any accounts from 2006 or later get in. 
---
There are other explanations of course. 2004-05 players would be most excited to get in, so they’re more likely to notice, to play the beta, and to discuss it here on this sub. But it’s stoll weird to not see ANY accounts from after 2005
---
Thx bb
---
AV comes out in phase 3 so most dedicated hunters will have rhok'delar by that time
---
id rather trust in 13 year old vids, than in classicdb  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq6mdt/difficulty\_of\_dungeons\_on\_the\_classic\_beta\_vs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq6mdt/difficulty_of_dungeons_on_the_classic_beta_vs/)
---
You're right and I edited my comment. Thanks!
---
That's not it, private servers don't have the right magic resistance and armor  values which are customized for dungeon/raid boss. On private server they all have the same armor value per tier and 15 magic resistance to everything while it should be something like 150 fire 50 shadow 20 frost 70 nature
---
Private servers use defaults generic values, classic bosses resistances may be much higher
---
I want the values to be right, but lowkey ill enjoy classic if they are off.
---
Hi, /u/La5eR
---
The boss hits the same damage as all the other mobs in the room, that seems wrong

He is not wearing a shield tho so if I'm doing the calculation correctly he at ~60% DR. I did the following (please correct me if I have made a mistake):
---
He said he is wearing full imperial plate armor and we will assume this is true expect for the leggings as those require lvl 56, but let's ignore that as the difference will not be significant. Other than that armor, we will be assigning him a pair of gloves and a cloak as those are the only things missing. His armor value will be something along this:
---
&gt; 285+386+225+570+456+507+380 +100 (set bonus) +166 (jouster's gauntlets) +38 (lvl 54 cloak) = 3113
---
Then I inserted the armor value into the DR% calculation:
---
DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * AttackLevel)
---
(Sneed is lvl 20)
---
&gt;  3113/(3113+400+85*20)=0.597
---
So his DR% is at ~60% (a bit below the armor cap of 75%). Is this no correct?
---
Do you actually believe that vanilla raids are harder than a modern hc raid?
---
Most dps specs can do just fine as their pve spec in pvp. They might not be optimal, but they are viable. I pvp’d almost exclusively as fury on my warrior, and still was fairly effective. Getting gear will solve a lot of the issues having a worse spec causes.
---
How come tabards are diff?
---
You just dont want to pay for it.
---
I tried leveling a rogue and would buy white gear from vendors. I thought the game was hard, turns out I just didn't know how it worked.
---
Agreed completely. I hope many of those videos are still up
---
Two of us guildies convinced a third guildie that there was a special vendor halfway down the dam separating Wetlands and Dun Morogh that was only accessible by jumping at the right spot. Supposedly this vendor sold a very rare epic rifle for level 60s.  
---
...that guy spent the better part of an hour attempting to find that vendor.
---
I dont want to be rude to anyone or jerk on financials, but I thinks its safe to assume that 15 eur/usd a month for the general wow classic crowd (20+ as indicated in the straw polls) wont be a huge problem. I mean its a cab ride from the bar to the club on friday or 2 menu at mcdonalds (and I live in the poorer part or the world...). Even a few "fun" hours in the month (like checking back on your main toon for BGs, playing some alts with your friends) would justify the price tag.
---
I do agree that people aren't thinking long-term. People are still thinking about it like it's an unstable pserver that's more likely than not going to implode within 2 years and have to start all over, or like vanilla will be progressive and continue chugging along into TBC.
---
In an evolving game or on servers with routine wipes I think it makes sense to have special time-restricted or one-time content, like unarmored mounts temporarily at the start, and the AQ war effort. But if this is going to be a static museum piece that remains in perpetuity without any restarts/fresh servers after phase 6 has grown stale, I don't think it's good for the longevity of the game to not recycle some limited content once in a while like semi-regular holidays, or to not open up TBC realms, or to not open up fresh servers occasionally and restart bucket rollout.
---
I don't know how I feel about post-naxx content. Theoretically I'm all on board because I think that would be great. I'm just not sure that Blizz would deliver a completely authentic vanilla experience with new content, and I don't have as much faith in the community to OSRS-style vote in new features or changes because with the benefit of hindsight we see how well that worked out in later expansions--players got what they asked for, often with Blizzard's signature overreaction, polar opposites, and throwing in a number of things nobody asked for and asked to be reverted during beta (reeeeee merged druid forms).
---
I've seen numerous people say their friends or themselves have gotten in and they started in cata/legion.
---
Greetings Vanilla_WoW_Salad (sounds delicious). We here at Blizz have some great news! You were intended to be included in the next wave of Beta invites. 
---
Unfortunately, due to this horrific post, you have now been removed from consideration. In the future, we recommend you not be a total douchecanoe and we will take your account into consideration for the next retail expansion’s Beta. 
---
Thank you and enjoy your journey into Azeroth.
---
Oh the salt that could be mined from this comment...
---
I don't know the context of their claim that they have an internal client, but having a *client* and having the *server* are two distinct things. Having the client is helpful for retrieving strings and the like (to verify data against tooltips, for example), but is not useful for determining things like mob damage or aggro ranges (as those happen on the server).
---
If they *also* have a server running, then they should be able to easily verify all of their data.
---
This is where common sense comes into play.  If the item is statted for your class/spec, then you roll on it.  Just look at the stats before rolling.
---
get that fear DR
---
Nailed it
---
Depends what you want. Hardcore raiding? Yea maybe choose the warrior. Fun casual raiding? I'd choose the pally 100% of the time.
---
Yes and the players were expected to use all their crowd control abilities on every mob while focusing down the heavy hitters by skull first, X is second then whatever the biggest threat next, while maintaining crowd control abilities as necessary through the fight. So maybe if we had that in mind when worrying about the damage it will make more sense.
---
No worries at all. He's definitely had a vast number of roles with "mixed" deliveries.
---
You’re so full of it lol, people have been asking for and interested in classic servers outside of the private server scene. It’s crazy how entitled you are when you point at retail players claiming the same, talk about pot calling the kettle black.
---
Why do I have to keep repeating this.... 
---
When writing a story, it's not the conclusion that determines good writing, it's how you come to the conclusion.
---
The character development and plot points were handled hamfistedly as fuck, the consistency of the show broke down even at a basic level as to where characters were placed, how they traveled (this is just the beginning), loads of cringey out of character dialogue, and there seemed to be no consistent rationale behind how plot points came together.
---
This season was an absolute trainwreck and it's gotten progressively worse since s5. If you unironically watch s1-4 then watch this season and cannot discern the absurd difference in quality then you might just have zero standards for good tv
---
I have no doubt people will agree to your terms to finally have a tank. But I imagine that pool will be limited. And if people are willing to go under those agreements, well, I suppose I'm not allowed to tell consenting players how to play the game with each other. 
---
I guess all I can say is, good luck and have fun!
---
yep druid can heal a lot
---
its just that you cant bring many of them
---
u seem mad that blizzard gave me beta access and that i’m better than u at the game and that ur never gonna even down onyxcia
---
The point is when you get to nitty gritty mechanic level stuff though private server experience and private server data is wrong. Nost guys will freely admit large amounts of things had to be guessed at. 
---
So when you feel insulted that people point that out. Well they are not wrong. The meta on PServers was different than Vanilla. The meta for Classic will be different from both but they are trying to match Vanilla not Nost. 
---
They have a working server that is 100% accurate at Blizzard HQ.  The sooner Pserver players realize that all their experience and data is skewed and can’t be trusted the better.
---
ITT: Retail babies that don't know how to read stats.
---
This is what I want Classic to become eventually.  When Blizzard was making TBC, they completely botched the story imo.  If they create a completely different timeline, new raids, and better questing, while removing the bad elements from TBC and WotLK they could create something amazing.  
---
Take OSRS for example.  It is quite clear that OSRS is no longer the same as Runescape 2.  But they have done an amazing job to preserve the feeling of Runescape 2.  I think if the devs took this approach that it would work.  Its also important to add the poll booth from OSRS into this game.  That system has done wonders for OSRS.  The community has the say in what gets updated, and if we did that in Classic WoW, we could guide the developers into creating content we actually want, and avoid another retail WoW.  
---
I know a lot of people don't want any changes, but there will be a content drought eventually.  New content probably wouldn't start out for a while after launch, but eventually it will have to happen for the game to stay around.
---
the problem with alot of private servers is the quality. alot of them have very bad scripting on pets and mobs and are laggy at times. classic wont have any of those problems with scripting and mob pathing etc. i cant speak for everyone, but 15$ a month really isnt that much. wow has always costed 15$ a month and 15 years ago 15$ was worth alot more then it is now due to inflation.
---
well now that classic is out he can finally retire
---
https://i.imgur.com/wjEeneY.jpg
---
fine for me. Druid it is.
---
I remember as a tank spellcasters were far more lethal than melee, especially once you had lots of gear that didn't do anything to mitigate spell damage. But there's no way I would be able to remember the real numbers.
---
When I leveled on private TBC recently the spell damage really stuck out to me. Every mob with a Shock ability was extremely dangerous because of the high burst and low cooldown. I suspect with all the crowdsourcing development we have gotten pretty good at figuring how much damage things are supposed to do but not at all accurate at how often they decide to use their abilities.
---
Its fun to fulfill a fantasy in the fantasy game. Its fun to have unique talents/spells that other classes dont even if the one number that shows damage done is a bit lower.
---
It's good for laptops as it works fine on uneven surfaces like sofa cushions due to way the pads are layed out on the base. I rarely used the extra buttons to bind some healing spells.
---
yeah it kinda creates a quickheals buffer
---
There need to be Classic servers, and Classic+ servers.  
---
TBC was good alright, but it's not the continuation of Vanilla. Flying mount, arena, 6 zones endgame etc... destroyed the vanilla essence.  
---
I understand people that only want Vanilla. There will always be Classic only servers.  
---
But indeed, we need Classic+ servers, with new content in the same vein as Vanilla.
---
This is making me nervous.
---
This. I wish Blizzard would take this into account. There's accurate and then there's the spirit of accurate. If they're going to do 1.12 talents and gearing, then they NEED to buff the actual NPCs to compensate, otherwise while it may statistically be what the game was in 1.12, it won't represent the spirit of Vanilla
---
If you have an active sub, you can check a box on your battle.net profile to opt in to beta
---
There are hundred of threads on this.
---
Been wanting one of these, THANKS!
---
You will not have a problem in 5 mans. Most warriors even tank lower level dungeons as fury (maybe recommended to switch to prot come BRD). If you’re actually in you’re tanking specs as Pally/Druid you’ll do fine.
---
No. Despite what you may read, paladins and druids can tank any dungeon. Especially undead dungeons.
---
I'm sure.
---
there's going to be literally an entire faction of non-dwarf priests you fucking e-retard
---
oof
---
KEK! LOKTAR OGAR, BITXHEZ. My orc hunter will wreck everyone in pvp
---
Ah yes, we needed **another** reminder.
---
Well I’ve been using one since the original Naga around 2007ish and I honestly can’t play wow without it. I don’t have to bind a bunch of stuff on my keyboard so it’s used primarily for things like target marking. I eventually build up enough muscle memory that I don’t think during pulls I just naturally know which buttons to press.
---
Yeah that’s genuinely fucked up. The person who wrote this must have *severe* issues, and I honestly pity them in every way.
---
You need to be currently subbed to retail and have opted-in manually for the Classic beta in your [b.net](https://b.net) account. 
---
After that you pray and hope you're selected.
---
GOD DAMN IT. THIS BETTER BE FIXED.
---
They should honestly give out beta keys. It would hype up the community a lot I think.
---
Maybe I remember it mostly being a thing where you'd swap out your pvp trinket after using it.
---
^^OwO ^^what's ^^this?
---
Bro what the fuck
---
No, they said the MAY be restricting the API to limit the social impact of some addons.
---
Problem is, our addon is mostly working and we don’t use a single API function that both Recount and DBM use. If you’re going to break out addon, you’re going to break them all.
---
Not OP, but thanks for this.
---
\+1 for  you. I switched to a G600 many years ago and I can't use anything else.
---
It's great for things other than MMOs, as well. I used it a lot for photoshop.
---
No problem! :D
---
Yeah gold. Try to get bigger chance
---
Can't agree more, i subbed cause of classic, did a level 70 heroic on my 70 tank war and the only people said in chat is go faster even after I thanked them for the run I got full silence, ew.
---
Tremor totem is hardly a replacement for fear ward. Fear ward is used on rotation to make the main tank immune to each fear cast, so they don’t lose threat. On horde bosses with fears typically need two tanks to alternate using berzerker rage to be immune to the fear, and these two tanks need to be 1 and 2 on the threat meter. Tremor totem will remove the fear but it takes a few seconds, more than enough time for onyxia to turn to the fury warrior who used deathwish and breathe fire over the entire raid

---
as someone who's also played since 2005, the beta looks absolutely beautiful.  I don't know what experience you're receiving or if you even got a beta key, but it's spot the fuck on.
---
That's great man. Look, I am really not here to argue with you, we are fighting the same war. I want classic, you want classic.
---
I just want classic to appeal to new players later on. Who wouldn't want a game with more people coming on board?
---
i actually dont use quest helper addons. played since vanilla and have never used them. played pservers since nost and have never used them. i know most of the quests by heart at this point, but believe it or not i actually enjoy reading quests and trying to figure things out myself. i enjoy riddles and puzzles and problem solving irl so i guess it makes sense. its genuinely stimulating.
---
What's wrong with that video? The mobs do ~50 damage each which seems entirely reasonable.
---
I mean, I love WoW and classic has so many cool sets to be sure, but you're still objectively wrong as fuck.
---
What we love most about WoW is the gameplay, not the graphics. That's why I can't understand why people were opposed to using the new models.
---
&gt; If you don't agree with that last sentence you have an emotional or a logic problem, simple as that. 
---
If you think pservers are a useful resource, you have an emotional or a logic problem, simple as that.
---
Honestly, as long as they don't add flying mounts I'm down for alternate timeline expansions.
---
This video has some good tips for players new to classic/vanilla that can help them have positive interactions with others. It's kinda long, but if you're new to classic it's worth the watch.
---
You don't even have to be in the tanking spec. You could totally tank dungeons to a decently high lvl being ret or feral maybe 50ish?
---
Nope, they were in BWL gear. I’ll add a link when I get to my PC.
---
I have no idea, but I think that if the Classic team decides they want to add new content that they should strive not to invalidate their old content. New content inherently makes older content easier most of the time by adding new gear that might be more optimal for your character or by boosting your stats here and there... but as long as that progression is slow and calculated, then old content should remain relevant for a long time.
---
I'm no developer and as a player I don't want to kill the fun others are having. The affection people have for the raw classic experience is genuine and I really respect that. I think the players who value that should be able to enjoy the game for as long as possible. If the Classic team designs new content, it should be designed in the spirit of the content that people who love Classic enjoy most and then still be designed as not to invalidate the challenge and sense of community that comes with the original game.
---
Google is frend
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeon_Set_2
---
Yeah, that’s not common sense.  It’s not intuitive.  
---
I get that it’s the appeal of classic, but it’s not your first thought to use cloth and shit on plate classes.
---
Big
---
&gt; You bring a holy priest that talented shadow weaving and keeps up the debuff.
---
I mean, yes if you want to nit-pick that. Sure, you're right. You're not being a full time shadow priest. It's kind of ignoring the main point but whatever.
---
Wrong. When we said we want wow classic, we want it exactly how the pservers are.
---
Fucking slaughtered lmao
---
Also on a serious note, BDO is graphically fancy but has no visual identity at all other than washed out environments.
---
half of these people probably don't even know Joana fam lmao.  I can tell a lot of these so called "vanilla" players weren't actually there back then..
---
MUCH more wrong with this season then pacing. This just served as a catalyst for the already terrible parts.
---
S7 was awful as well
---
I do remember VERY specifically that what you said here was the case. Spells were extremely dangerous compared to melee.
---
kk 1sec
---
Yeah beast lore is not showing armor atm, don't know if it's a bug or if it was like that in Vanilla.
---
There are some vanilla screenshots where we can see it showing armor on raid bosses but maybe it was only for bosses.
---
We are actually pretty evenly spread right now. I would say any DPS except Warlock and Rogue.
---
I think the skepticism comes from developers promising x, y and z in a game and when it comes to deliver it falls way short of the mark. A lot of MMO’s have done that over the years, and with the way blizzard has ruined retail, I think it’s justified to have low expectations at the start.
---
Thankfully that was unjustified in this case, it looks like they are coming through.
---
Alt tabbing in PvP sounds like a bad idea
---
Gaming experience was so strong then we were arguing over whether we were playing too much !
---
GODS! Remember when the content was so good, you couldn’t even stop!
---
That's still 5 years down the line. Plus, classic dev team mentioned, they are open to possibly expanding Classic or continue with recreation of TBC and onward. All depending on people.
---
And with this mindset... All we have to hope for is to Vanilla being a successful project. Because if it is - it's worth their money to support this way of things. We'll see. But even if there would be nothing after - it's still 4-5 years of the best game I've ever played.
---
This sub seems to be mostly bitching about streamers. How out of touch are some of you? ImStreaming has been around for years now, it just seems like attempts to be edgy at this point. 
---
You wont even notice them once youre playing too
---
Yes yes and YES. It looks disgusting when you actually compare them. This is important because one of my most important memories of the game as it was, was the way flights seemed way cooler back then. You were happy to be able to fly on this mount that flew around the way it did. Now it's so linear you feel in the subway...
---
Thanks. I have two at home, but I ordered two more for when they break in the future. This is a great deal.
---
I completely agree, I haven't even touched retail since early Legion myself. I don't see an issue with allowing some specs (such as Balance druids) to participate more in raids though.
---
Blizzard wouldn't have found the Stonetalon totem damage bug without someone noticing it was wrong, would they have? And they noticed it was wrong because it wasn't what it was like on private servers. Granted, it was wrong for a different reason than the person thought, but it was still enough to get Blizzard to check on things, and prove what was happening.
---
Yes, private servers are off, and shouldn't be held as the gospel, but it isn't like we need to throw away our experiences entirely. They do help, if only by getting us to put more scrutiny on certain aspects of the game.
---
Warlock : DOT DOT ALT TAB, DOT DOT ALT TAB, DOT DOT ALT TAB,...
---
He still has a point.
---
There's a large demographic between causals who are never going to (be able to) raid and your kind who's been playing vanilla since vanilla and then on private servers.
---
Essentially, your 15 hours a week aside you are fairly hardcore as far as these classic raids are concerned. You and probably all of the people in this "PuG" have done Naxx over and over, and all the others raids as well.  
---
You are all there because you are interested enough in classic that you're ditched retail and are still playing a 15 year old game "unsanctioned".
---
You have to understand that you are essentially the marathon runner of WoW, and you are acting like the only other group that'll play vanilla are the lazy bums.    
---
In truth the largest demographic will be not the lazy bums nor the marathon runners, but the midrange-runners.   
---
And those will be able to raid, albeit not as proficiently as you.   
---
You are not running with a PuG. Not in the traditional sense.
---
I'm a tard coming to this sub for the upcoming classic release.
---
What is so bad about pserver?
---
No you won’t at all lol
---
What I wouldn't do to see that on my launcher :o
---
This would not surprise me. My first character at launch struggled hard against any elite. Alts that I did in the second half (poast aq40 launch) were much easier to level. Some of it could be class/skill differences, but I definitely feel like the challenge was easier in general.
---
thats a question of the group discipline. 
---
when you realize that if a mob is not smacking a paladin the mob is not tanked, your run will be easy. if a paladin has to dump mana to pick up a mob that some idiot charged and cleaved on a pull, sure you have to stop and drink.
---
but if you are smart dps you give the tank, regardless of what kind of tank it is, a couple seconds to grab the attention. then you attack. for a paladin tank this means maybe give it a couple ticks of consecration or a couple swings against bosanc.
---
a paladin tank running bosanc and seal/judge wisom can get away with a single consecrate on an aoe pull so long as the dps are not morons who jump the gun. the paladin then does not need to pause for drinks before the next pull and can maintain that pace for the whole run.
---
but if you want to make your run with a paladin tank have zero downtime minus the healer or caster dps drinking you will do the following:
---
1. never charge into a pack until they are tanked, and dont use aoe on the pull
---
2. always focus the same mob as the tank before you move on to dpsing whatever you feel like dpsing
---
3. if you do something that pulled aggro, stop hitting that thing and keep it near the tank. dont make the problem worse by running it out of the consecrate or making the tank dump all their mana to save you from yourself.
---
4. profit
---
if your paladin tank drinks too much its either because they are dumping their mana to compensate for idiot dpsers or they just dont know how paladin tanks work.
---
Pallies were fine as tanks for 5 mans and UBRS, but only ideal for Strat and Scholo due to UD. I got my 45 minute Baron completed on the back of a tankadin. The game was and will be much more fun if you are open to a variety of group comps.
---
Its illegal
---
I'm not entirely disagreeing with you, but you're making an assumption that the Classic team is a large team. You cant just make new content, or add class changes. They're not going to invest developers, the art department etc into a retro game project until they know its massively successful.
---
^^^This. Yes you would have an easier time with a Warrior after 40ish but as long as you have a solid group of knowledgeable players you will be fine. 
---
Raiding... not so much. Not that you can’t but is it worth hurting progression for 39 other people for you to play a snowflake meme spec? I would say no.
---
I’ll be 22 come August, and sacrificing the amazing potential of my youth to nolife classic wow for a good 6 months. The circle of life!
---
Yes it is, its piracy, they steal blizzards files and use them without permission.
---
I'm sorry to hijack this top comment of this very wholesome post.... but what the hell is a /u/noner_boner ???
---
&gt;In WoW there are also classes that can use multiple kinds of armor for example hunter can wear leather and mail. If you are hunter do not take leather item from druid or rogue when they need it. You will quickly find mail replacement for your character and that druid/rogue will have no alternative and will have to go back to that dungeon and hope it drops again.
---
Gonna have to disagree there. Just because a better item for you exists doesn't mean you shouldn't get an upgrade now. I'm all for simple loot rules; If it's an upgrade for you (and you plan to equip it right this second in the case of BoEs), roll need on it.
---
This isn't counting guilds obviously, just casual groupings. Your obligations to the other players in your party do not extend past the current dungeon/questline/etc unless you're definitely going to be running more content with those people.
---
No u
---
We had a lvl 19 twink guild in classic (pre-BC I know that much): Twinkle Twinkle Baby.   These were by far my favorite WoW experiences.  We took down a lvl 60 player once :)
---
&gt; Excepting bugs, like the Stoneskin Totem issue
---
It's entirely possible this is another similar issue. The number are likely correct, but their scripts might have a bug.
---
Would it be possible for you to run back through the dungeon after it's completed to Skin the mobs? That might be better if nobody else is skinning/mining the dungeon and everyone is waiting on you.
---
On very important pulls in aq40 we teamed up with an alliance guild that mced or tauren main tank and than buffed him with all the blessings.
---
They did salvation once. He didn't notice 😆
---
armor stops helping against low level mobs after a point
---
Yea, I'm glad people are really digging to help and figure this stuff out but also I'm not at all stressed - given the amount of time they have (and how good the Classic team seem to be about actually listening/understanding what we want) I dont have any real concerns for release.
---
As an UD player, they taste the best of all alliance races.
---
Last I saw, accounts with beta access were being sold for $500-$1000. Saw some big time streamers that arent getting in say they are considering paying it just to get in.
---
Pretty crazy.
---
i was Dwarf Warrior Main Tank in 2005. this time around i'm gonna be Chad Casual Dwarf Hunter
---
Aye sadly so, and while it is all happening you have fellas making all sorts of excuses or just willfully underestimating the impact of a culture like this.
---
Well we did all of BRD, not just a Emperor run or to do Jailbreak.  Not even sure why we did that, thinking back. Think I finally got UBRS attunement that day - good way to make cash.
---
Why is sm ruin warlock used only once? What are the other locks?
---
I had one the biggest problem is they seem to break fairly easily also after years with a naga I’ve found I prefer my ring finger to be able to hold the mouse stationary as I click side buttons. I use shift, ctrl, alt, as my modifiers and can hit most of those with various parts of my palm since I have windows key disabled.
---
Lots of good info, I'll read this fully when I'm out of work thank you
---
Healing dungeon as paladin, cloth healing gear drops that would be an upgrade for you.  You also have a shadow priest in your group.  Do you roll or not?
---
They have never required a sub to get into any beta before, why require it now? That's why its bullshit. I have the 8.2 beta but can't get the classic one unless I suck blizzard's dick first.
---
my bet is that the ugly ghost of scaling is still lurking in the code
---
High quality content, my king. Loved that Gilmi was Legolas' pet lmao
---
OSRS's original team was definitely smaller than it currently is today. If Classic WoW is a huge success I can see them bringing more devs on board.
---
I kinda like swords better as well. You find it has good burst still compared to daggers?
---
Ogar
---
I'm guessing you would never DARE to download a movie.
---
Because that would be illegal.
---
the pserver I "play" on has reported a significant increase in new low level players....  I contacted a few of them and many gave indeed as reason that now the launch date is known, they wanted to test out a few characters to make a choice for their classic main.   "Play" between "" because I am not really playing anymore, I just use it as a fancy chatbox to keep in contact with some old friends
---
Well for instance it would be top right if they are in Australia.
---
I wonder if Legolas feeds his pet enough so it won't leave him.
---
Funny if I not even get Stress Test.
---
While these are technically 10-ish% differences, being off by 1-2 points isn't necessarily that big of a difference. For all we know so far they remain like that all the way up to 60 and into raids, at which point it's fairly irrelevant. We need to see a trend as it goes up higher levels (and especially against elite mobs) that the gap grows at a proportional rate.
---
Also, as a side-note on the AI thing. There are definitely mobs on pservers that utilize a much more aggressive skill pattern than what we've seen on the classic servers as well.
---
The problem is the cross faction colluding. This wasn't really a thing back in the day - it was hard to even get in contact with the other faction.
---
So why arent we playing BFA? It has everything you listed:
---
- Hard raids
---
- New content aka "new blood"
---
- It is more balanced than Classic
---
So...why aren't we playing it? Why do we even want this garbage Classic game, when BFA game is clearly superior by your own standards? Why does BFA have anywhere between 2 to 4 millions subs? Where did people go? Do they just not know how awesome Retail WoW is? 
---
When you wrote this essay, did it ever occur to you that everything you are arguing for already exists, but clearly does not work in practice? Perhaps because hard mythic raids only appeal to a fraction of a fraction of the community. Perhaps because "new content" is largely reskinned races and homogenized classes. Perhaps because balance does not equate to fun, if every class plays the same?
---
Everything you are arguing for sounds reasonable in theory, but in practice all of it can be found in Retail, and the game has been bleeding customers for years.
---
Good snack before the next victim
---
Would the fury tanks still use a shield/defensive stance?
---
Qq big bad company didn’t give me free access to very desirable beta ahead of their paying customers qq :(
---
Only if I paid for it instead of a physical copy.  Downloading without paying is piracy and is illegal
---
When blizzard promises classic but lies about what lies beneath...
---
Flying was the first thing that started to ruin the game. No flying ever please
---
Cheers mate. I guess us plebs need to keep our fingers crossed then!
---
Prot pally has some of the best dungeon tanking and I’d put it on warrior level depending on gearing.
---
You rotate max rank and rank 1 consecrate for sustainability and threat generation, it’s a good idea to wear 8/10ths plate and 2/10ths mail with intellect/spell ( shaman gear) to hell your sustainability and defense. Devotion aura can usually fill the gap of missing armor values and if you don’t decide to use it you should still have a sizable defense. 
---
The main staying power of prot paladin is its ability to block rapidly.
---
Hope this helps man, good luck.
---
paladin and druids are perfectly fine for any 5 man dungeon, especially at low lvl. Paladin will struggle a but more because they dont have a taunt
---
For the options that are more realistic (not two world drop BoEs), I think it's still Dalrends. Could also be Ironfoe - no one knows for sure what its procrate is.
---
That's sick, I played Rogue for so long and never thought of that. Thank you. Mages blink seems like it's NEVER on CD haha, so this is awesome
---
The good ole skullcrasher days.
---
Yes I can't wait to be able to open bottles of brews with my shoulders.
---
The huge tri faction battles in Elder Scrolls Online can really scratch that itch (unless they've changed something. I haven't played in about 4 years). Matches that lasted forever and everything gets thrown into turmoil when the Aussies wake up and log in en masse. I loved stealthing around with a small group and picking off stragglers on the outskirts of the big clashes, then setting up some seige engines and attacking a small keep or outpost while everyone is occupied.
---
Also , happy cake thing.
---
scaling wasnt a thing in vanilla, the rating system was not yet invented. 1% crit on a thing was 1% crit no matter what level you were.
---
but yes this is probably some bfa style scaling code not properly suppressed.
---
Joana is a girl's name in English speaking countries as well, he's just using his character name.
---
The maximum amount of damage reduction you can get from armor is 75%. Since the player character in this case is a high level Plate-wearer, they’d certainly have reached the armor cap for this low level enemy.
---
So the exact armor value doesn’t matter in this case; you can safely assume that true player has the maximum 75% DR from armor.
---
Day one account here, no invite yet. :(
---
In leveling dungeons?  Probably not.  You'll start to have issues in the level 60 dungeons.
---
Fear works properly.
---
I don't mean to sound like a jerk, but if that's the case just play a pserver. They are not going to be exactly the same. If Blizzard's data conflicts with pserver data, Blizz is going to take their own data 100% of the time.
---
Yeeees this! Goddam these campaigns set up classic so well. I'm on act 3 of the founding of durotar and it's so cool to see thrall creating the horde nation. Also the game play in that campaign is like a mix of classic wow, and if mobas had a story mode.
---
sounds like you dont pvp
---
Hi, /u/DevSammy
---
Well yeah of course, but that's my point Blizzard in 2019 isn't a risk taking company anymore look at all of their products now. Microtransaction filled bullshit because they know it makes them the most money. Until they KNOW Classic will be super profitable they won't invest the resources.
---
Tier 0.5 is an upgraded version of dungeon 1 gear, and requires a bunch of quests to finish the upgrades. For instance the set on the right in the OP is warrior d1 aka Valor, and its tier 0.5 equivalent is called Heroism.
---
Never got the competition between players that played the game back in the day and people that played it by other means. Just enjoy the damn game, it’s extremely uncommon we get the chance to experience something like this.
---
You only actually have the menu if there's more than your base WoW account connected to the launcher. If you merge it with another account or sign up for the PTR or something like that, it creates a drop-down menu. The base game doesn't have one because there are no options to choose from until they get added.
---
That was awesome
---
No because LFR is an issue, not LFG. Too much of a good thing is bad.
---
If you don’t want to rely on buying BoE epics from the AH, dal rends swords are very good pre-raid. You won’t get the +skill from axes, but you’ll do just fine until you can get a deathbringer

You dont seem to realize that the main reason for downranking is mana efficiency and not to prevent overhealing.

pservers buff instance and e mobs. its widely known.
---
Yes. You can probably get away with no shield if your group was really good.
---
but why are they fighting night elves?
---
Tell that to the 1.2 k people that upvoted the post on the main page while i keep getting downvoted. Reddit is so dumb lol, bunch of sheep.
---
Roit in mah feels.
---
pservers buff instance and e mobs on purpose.
---
You just changed my downvote on this post to an upvote!
---
I doubt it will be a big deal. Quite a few of the big streamers, which there aren't a lot of, will likely congregate on the same servers to play together. It shouldn't be too difficult to avoid them if you want to.
---
You’ll be fine trust me ignore the idiots saying to min max
---
BUR'd
---
It was "revived" by the G.E being implemented. 
---
We do not have that problem.
---
Thing is, that would be harder than making a new retail expansion or even a new game. If the goal is to bring more players, i highly doubt they can simply ADD on top of vanilla without making it impossible for semi-casual player to achieve anything. You literally cannot endlessly add without eventually hitting a point of no return. 
---
Even if nothing surpasses Naxx in gear, people will simply chose the path of least resistance, eventually invalidating content. I'd rather get a fresh server with fresh economy and everyone starting anew (not to be mistaken with server resets, that would SUCK). People should never feel like they have a set amount of time to complete a game, that goes against the point of the word "classic". It should be there for them.
---
Common argument is "um well realms for everyone". Problem is the community split, its like people expect 30 million players on that game. 
---
You start splitting, you get disbalanced factions and empty realms...how long before sharding is re-introduced? I've seen countless threads on the subject but no one of the OP's even try to go deeper than "um yea new content good, old content will get boring". It's not that simple, sometimes less popular= better quality, because you KNOW what you get, whether you are new or some day you decide to go back.
---
No they can’t.
---
They didn’t ban AVR, they limited the functionality obscure API calls it used to interact with the game world.
---
They didn’t ban BabelFish, they just made cross-faction communication a violation of the TOS.
---
Everything is client side. If the API allows it; then any addon can use it.

* Is it true that the highest skinning required is 315, and is it correct that only The Beast, Gyth, and Onyxia require that high a skill?
---
* What is the highest fishing zone, and how high is the requirement?
---
Feel free to answer in a top level post, you don't need to respeond to this one.
---
&gt;But I'd argue that's what difficulty settings are for.
---
Well, specifically for the type of "casual" style WCIII is, I disagree. It is not a problem of making the AI better or make the numbers different, it's a matter of the whole design of WCIII gameplay being quite easy. It is just a simple game. It's like Hearthstone, especially before all the xpacs - sure you can increase the difficulty, but it does not change that it is a very simple game, which means it is easy to pick up for the masses but at the same time puts "hardcore" fans of the genre off.
---
People that plays AoE2 or Cossacks 3 will find WCIII terribly simple. Now I found *other* charms in WCIII, but it wasn't the deep RTS elements. That is not something difficulty can "fix" (personally I don't think it needs to be changed from that, it makes WCIII unique in other ways).
---
But I fully agree with you that the whole "hardcore game" doesn't make much sense. The thing is, some games are difficult because of the design, not the numbers. For example chess vs a computer, sure you can make a difficulty where even the worst chess players can win, but by doing so you basically just removed what the game really is. Then sure, any player can just do random stuff and win, but aside from maybe kids it is not really fun for most people to just randomly do stuff and win anyway.
---
This is why, as I said, WCIII is so popular (aside from he amazing lore) - it didn't actually have to make a braindead easy difficulty to make it accessable for everyone. Instead it relied on being sufficiently *simple* so that you could easily understand 90% of the game and then turn the difficulty up to where you felt the challenge. That feels better than having a really complex gameplay where you don't know what you are doing and have to turn the difficulty to braindead AI that basically don't even try to win. Essentially you feel like you actually know how to play, but the enemy is what makes the challenge as opposed to feeling like the challenge comes from you not understanding how to truly play the game.
---
nvm, the set that ppl ITT is talking about are there in that link as well under the name "Dungeon 2".
---
In vanilla i wore full t2 in a naxx guild and my dorf was fkn awesome! I hear that's not the way ppl do it nowadays though lol :D
---
No one can see your spec anyways, so pretend youre something else and tell people you are and then just do your own spec
---
Did it ever occur to you that Blizzard has a fresh opportunity to offer content in vein of vanilla content? Where in my post did I say I want classes to be homogenized?
---
You are completely missing the point of my post. I want more content added to the game that is in spirit of vanilla.
---
I want classic to succeed. I am not against you.
---
You had me on that Ratchet shortcut right from the starting area
---
We’re talking about different things.  
---
The answer is yes, but it isn’t common knowledge unless you’ve played classic before because it’s not intuitive.  This whole comment chain is about that. Gear/specs were even changed to prevent this exact situation in future expansions.
---
Dude gnome is the best alliance race not even counting the benefits. 
---
Always has been. 
---
Plus in PvP getting killed by a gnome is the worst feeling. Enjoy the power of tilting.
---
They need to branch off after vanilla and just keep the main tenants of what made vanilla do appealing to many. 
---
Community - no dungeon finders, etc
---
Size of the world - no flying and no ports outside of player created ports
---
All items earned in game- no cash ship, ever
---
Unique feeling classes - some will be better than others in some areas. Keep class identify and remove homogeneous classes
---
Well pserver doesn't really make anyone a specialist in Classic / Vanilla. Also having a lot of experience with a product can make person little biased and testing can actually be more difficult than for a people with no experience at all. When you know how the game should be played you don't do "stupid shit / try to play game wrong" and many bugs don't occur to you. Ofc there is stuff where experienced people are much more better testers. The fact still is, we need all kind of people to play in the beta and get as much as feedback it is possible. False bug report is not that big of a deal, not getting reports is.
---
Both would be great.
---
If they do decide to do a new timeline, they need to fix class design. TBC brought much better class balance and made other specs actually viable.
---
Install the battlenet client, then you can install the game from there once it releases.
---
Omg people crying about the beta. You can't take it with you for live. It would make sense they wouldn't give old accounts beta, you have played it. They want to get the people that didn't play vanilla. They know old vanilla players will play it. It's basic marketing strat.
---
Atrayne checking in to call you a scrub. Christ, the nostalgia...
---
I don't see why not.
---
But we already know the truth, you're trying to double dip into the NA and EU beta pool. WE SEE YOU
---
Also these streamer examples are just them messing with friends while in a non-permanent beta....are we really thinking that people won't see the context and this needs to be brought up?
---
Probably because you couldn't even clear bwl lmfao
---
You don't need to buy anything but you won't be able to use your old disc. 
---
You'll need to download the new client. Classic doesn't cost anything besides the $15 monthly sub fee.
---
I think the people who got Beta access and are needlessly rubbing it in everyone's face are the ones that seem entitled and like they are bragging. All these "hey I got beta and its all good but you didn't so stop whining and stop being so entitled" threads (yours included) are the most annoying of the lot.
---
when I first started my human mage I spent an hour or two in Elwynn forest and I decided I had invested enough time in the character that I didn’t want to lose the progress, so I started looking for the save button.
---
After 10 minutes of browsing through all the options I still couldn’t find it. 
---
Eventually I risked logging off and closing the game client and I was relieved when I logged in again to find my level 4 mage still there!
---
I think everyone is grossly overestimating the amount of people that are going to be playing the game for an extended period of time.  I hope I'm wrong, but I think they will break 1 million at launch, drop below it to about 750k after a year, then be somewhere between 500-750k at the end of classics life-cycle, if that.  Blizzard is indeed a company, and they know that Classic isn't a cash cow, its a cash grab.  Blizzard isn't going to continually pour resources into something that isn't going to make them money.  They know subs are going to drop after launch, layering is very literally a fail-safe for it.  Instead of making a server for each "layer", they are just layering servers so that when populations do settle into their norm, they are left with one populated server as opposed to multiple servers with varying populations.
---
At some point they did introduce freezing XP; when was this?  My first 19 twink was absolutely top-tier geared and I accidentally leveled him to 20.
---
Right. I was thinking about that the other day. It could be like $32 now and it still wouldn’t be a lot.
---
Gloooorios 360p
---
That is one of the coolest things I’ve seen in wow in a long time. I’ve never been so excited watching a video.
---
This explains a lot. I resubbed for a month or so in Legion and was surprised that people would sprint through dungeons, pulling haphazardly. The speedruns felt so weird and rushed. 
---
"How are we CCing this pack? Nvm you already pulled."
---
"Let's wait for the patrol . . . or just pull both groups. That's cool I guess."
---
"Hey tank, please stop pulling while the healer is at half mana and drinking, 20 yards out of LoS."
---
Vanilla punished you pretty hard for that style of play, unless you were overleveled or overgeared.
---
I'm not part of the argument I just think u like to lick the blue balls of blizzard inc. Dont worry one day they will recognize ur efforts and hire u.
---
I don't remember being able to kite with fear in vanilla.  Not like a hunter could. Was it fear + dots?
---
Seems like someone is salty because their private server is turning out to be a piece of unauthentic piece of shit and people are jumping ship in favor of a beta LOL
---
well shit nvm then lol
---
Woof the two I was torn on playing.
---
&gt;Who cares about the story if every moment not spent in bleeding edge mythic raids, m+ dungeons or high end arena is terrible and a chore.
---
That was pretty much my whole point - there are many things in the game that result in it not being enjoyable for a lot of people that previously liked the game. I simply said the idea of a faction war was cool - honestly the whole "world ending threat that you have to defeat because you are Superma.. I mean the champion of Azeroth!" gets kind of boring for anyone older than 12. 
---
&gt;And leave the mass appeal bullshit for heroes of the storm
---
Well, if it really appeals to the masses you can hardly blame them for doing that - I mean, they are a company after all. Sure it is a bit scummy to previous fans of the game, but now we get Classic so who cares.
---
Would be happy to be Nightfall bitch to get to raid and get some gear :)
---
Totally me right now
---
Oh my.
---
Well they also mention it on the Classic intro page that account age is something they may consider, along with Ion in interviews talking about wanting players to make sure they got it correct (which only Vanilla players can do). So all in all it's highly likely that they are using account age.
---
A CS rep wouldn't know these sorts of details, but all signs point to it being true. People need to stop giving themselves false hope.
---
As a warlock I love you
---
No one is entitled to BETA access, but why should this even be a contentious issue. Why divide a community who has been waiting a very long time into two categories, thralls chosen ones or lepper gnomes irrespective of how betas have worked in the past, There are so many creative solutions to this problem where blizzard can get the data they need and include the entire community.
---
And before I get called salty , I have had access for a few days now doesn't change the fact that this beta offended the majority of the classic community for reasons that were entirely avoidable. Lack of creativity and zero fore sight on blizzards behalf. 
---
The game may be classic , but its the same shitty outdated management from retail that is over seeing it and calling the shots. That alone should concern everyone.
---
That's correct. Cata heroics were somewhat challenging (not as hard as BC heroics, but not trivial either) for the first few months and then severely nerfed again after extensive player complaints. Heroics have not been difficult at any time since then. They've kept challenging 5-man content only in CMs and M+ which you have to form your own group for, nothing challenging in queueable content.
---
Didn't Blizz confirm that summoning disorientation was not part of the 1.12.1 database and that its spellID is consistent with TBC spellIDs?
---
Truth be told, Blizzard CM's don't know a lot in regards to this. There was a bug with beta/alpha flagging a few years ago where the amount of ptr licences would stop the beta from showing up. 
---
I asked them to remove PTR licences from my account so the flag would come through and even though they were helpful in regards to getting rid of the excess licences he was convinced it would make no difference. 5hours later I was flagged.
---
Sounds like you’re in the actual beta bro, you got yesterday’s wave, congrats
---
Throw in a firm handshake and I'll consider it
---
I believe it comes down to youtube's recommendation algorithm.  I recently rediscovered a LoL youtuber(sp4zie) and his channel basically died due to a change in the algorithm.  IIRC from a video where he soap boxed youtube changed to a format that favored frequent 10 min+ videos.  So now you have endless amounts of people trying to pad 10+ mins of video and come up with tons of bullshit to make videos about constantly.
---
No offense to OP or anything &lt;_&lt;
---
I could be wrong but I'd imagine when the servers are up that you would need to keep 2 subscriptions active. An EU account and a US account. As far as I know on retail wow you cannot use a EU account on US or vice versa.
---
As far as how the beta goes I have no clue how that works :/
---
If you die in water on the southern edge of Wetlands  (or slightly in Dun Morogh even), you appear in Coldridge Valley. Should be a tiny bit faster than running through Wetlands, and I read here that it works on Beta.
---
Read this instead of listening to me lol.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
Lets be even more honest, blizzard is a company and companys need revenue.
---
Even before TBC people started to turn away from wow, and when people is'nt playing, blizzard doesnt make money.
---
Which meant that they had to throw a much wider net and please a much wider audiance. And THAT was the slippery slope that that started wow on the path to where it is now.
---
The people you're refering to did'nt influence shit, they were attracted.
---
Some do, some don't.
---
which has gotten a port for bfa: [https://github.com/adamz01h/wow\_peggle](https://github.com/adamz01h/wow_peggle)
---
As an IT guy, and a Paladin main, I bless you!
---
Classic will be based on 1.12 which means there will be resources in av unless they decide to change that, havent heard anything about it
---
Those troggs are hitting 39s on him. That's less than the mobs in BFD. I really don't believe the damage formula's are right..
---
That is good News!
---
They got nerfed because some fights required the group to be like full 359 gear. Even later down the road when ZA and ZG dropped which gave 353 gear we had a hard time getting the bear mount with almost full 359, good times
---
Still have my old discs too, in one of those black cd binder/cases lol
---
Yeah it was a few gold last time I remember.
---
Totally agree. But I can imagine on paper the imagination of flying in this world must have been mind blowing
---
There was Texas hold'em add on that was quite popular.
---
private server emulators are reverse engineered which is not illegal on its own, it becomes more illegal once the private server devs get into selling stuff and making a profit.
---
Rogue will still be one of the most popular classes and will still be a bitch to gear. Having said that, Mage will also be one of the most popular sooo play what is most fun to you.
---
Meh, I prefer the good old simple lore from WC3 and Classic manuals.
---
Over-explaining lore lead to inconsistencies, especially with sub-par writing.
---
Are you still using SHIFT + OTHER BUTTON binds?
---
It's part of the whole experience man.
---
Private servers are not perfect reproductions. Data like this are manually added and tweaked by the developers of the private servers because they had no access to the real, underlying numbers that the original game ran on.
---
Heres what I could piece together on the gear.

This is what I've been trying to tell people. We also have to be careful taking beta videos at face value because we can't always be sure just how overgeared people are for any given content. People are always quick to say groups will feed loot to the streamers but then seem quick to turn around and claim "asmongold isn't taking enough damage something is off" without accounting for the fact that, y'know, he could just be really overgeared.
---
My unicorn item
---
HOTW can raid heal casually no problem. For flagrunning/organized pvp the NG point is probably worth it. Mandatory? Not really, but very very good.
---
It's amazing how you can be full t2 and only play 6-8 hours a week.   You just have to be on at raid time
---
That’s a bold assumption there bud. Thousands of testers one noticed a bug that happened to have played on PServers... Correlation and causation bud. How do you know that bug wasn’t reported by 20 other shamans?
---
D1? That's an interesting name I've always heard it called tier 0. Funny how different servers use different word for the same stuff. Like the DM/VC debate that pisses everyone off.
---
“We know we aren’t letting you into the beta to actually play the game, but we would really like it if you did some work for us with nothing in return”
---
No that's be incredibly stupid.
---
From another perspective, heirloom gear romanticised this stuff. For some people who didn’t play in vanilla, I’m sure it will be exciting for them to get their thrash blade and valour gear that they’ve seen the celebration of for 10 years (God, heirlooms have really been around that long?)
---
It will depend. You may need two subs.
---
For BFA you need two purchases of BFA . One NA and one EU.
---
I know this because I moved from US to EU. They could not transfer it, not could I play with my new friends. Ultimately I bought the game again. 
---
I now have an 05 original US sub and a 2013 sub on my bnet account. They have unique friends list and realms.
---
&gt; which he definitely has
---
These are dangerous statements... there's a million ways he could NOT be at DR cap, regardless of him using a shield.
---
30/0/21 shaman for as long as your guild will allow it (prob until AQ).
---
Really? God how pathetic, can't even joke around...christ.
---
I’m playing beta right now. 
---
Mob damage seems about right. You typically can’t pull more than two mobs at a time. 
---
Pulling two mobs, depending on class is dangerous. 
---
Did deadmines the other night and we struggled a bit but wasn’t impossible. Every pull was dangerous though. 
---
But things are easier because gear for characters is plentiful and cheap. So your tanks are decently geared for the content. 
---
Try playing with only quest items and whatever you get through normal means. You’ll get your shit pushed in.
---
Its copyrighted material though,  so still piracy
---
It depends on what level you do the dungeons, obviously, but if we're going with the "this is when we'd do them if we had a warr tank", then the druid groups will not struggle, pala groups might.
---
Oh nice, thanks!
---
booty bay
---
Just remember you will compete with other rogues, hunters, shamans, and druids for gear until probably about lvl 50 when 2 of them leave you alone for all except necks, rings, trinkets. And then there's weapons....

Exactly, this is why I loved vanilla so much. You only interacted with your server. That guy you randomly grouped with for some elite quests at lvl 35 will be chilling with you in Orgrimmar at lvl 60. The guy that you ganked in STV when you were level 40 might pass you in levels and gank you a few weeks later in the plaguelands for revenge. This is what killed retail for me, I never knew anyone outside of my guild and never had multiple interactions with other players. People actually have a reputation in classic, either as the dude that everyone hates or the badass healer that can save even the worst groups in a dungeon.
---
I will downvote and upvote this comment
---
The best threat generators are single target: revenge and sunder. The multi-target and aoe threat generators (cleave, t-clap, demo shout, battle shout) are all situationally useful but typically inferior to tab-sunder/revenge. This is what makes classic tanking compelling, once you try to hold on to 3, 4 mobs or more it gets chaotic. 
---
Ranged attack followed by Bloodrage and battle shout can be a good way to start a pull of three or more mobs, because when you battle shout buff your allies it generates threat on every mob you are in combat with. But if you only have 2 mobs that aren't being cc'ed in a pull, you're probably better off skipping the battle shout and go straight to tabbing back and forth with your single target threat generators.
---
T-clap and demo shout are good for a small amount of threat on lots of mobs, or for damage mitigation on hard hitting mobs. They are very inefficient threat generators against a single mob. Someone linked an old forum page below that outlines the threat values of each ability, be sure to check that out. You can compare numbers to figure out when to use what.
---
Yea make it hard AF. Everyone knows Darksouls is "good" because of that. I'm not being sarcatic for real make it hard make it want to ask a buddy for help make people band together!!!
---
And it's still like that on Pservers. Sometimes my PUG will be communicative but, in my experience a lot of times it's quiet. Of course it gets lively when we wipe and they blame the tank or healer or DPS.
---
Depends. Any preferred class?
---
What are you on? 56k modem? The quality is fine.
---
Race specific??
---
apparently people in here have the intellectual ability of a downsyndrom person.
---
The best kind of optimistic.
---
Hey, I really like the sound of this guild and the schedule fits me. I have limited vanilla experience (played it when I was a kid, hit level cap near tbc release). I hit gladiator on retail when I came back for BFA and I am primarily interested in pvp, though I know classic pvp is a different beast with consumables, balance, engineering etc. 
---
My raiding experience is somewhat limited, as I've always exclusively raided in 100% irl friend guilds, but I'm a fast learner and I listen. Planning on playing ele/resto for pvp and resto pve, but I'm willing to be flexible in my class choice. 
---
Do you think I'd be a good fit for this guild?
---
i have used the webarchive@allakhazam to find quest xp values in coldridge valley, which were drastically different from pserver
---
turns out allakhazam values were off, and pserver was pretty accurate with a maximum difference of 10xp
---
In vanilla you had to manage resources like threat and mana, so the number of concepts you're juggling in your head could still be pretty high even if the fights had fewer mechanics.
---
I played human pally back in classic. Only class I don't have a real interest in is rogue just due to the number of rogues there will be.
---
you can play night elf or you can min-max. pick one
---
It's not just an IT problem. I work in plant  plant maintenance and have the same conversations almost daily.
---
Yeah ill guess ill see what comes first
---
Bear tanks are better than warrior tanks in lvl 60 dungeons. More DPS and better aoe threat.
---
They actually did put a limit.  It was 2 per person.
---
Easier than i remember: aka easier than it was on shitty pservers
---
Let me slow it down for you. It doesn't invalidate that concern, it's a legal concern. It's not about not making classic servers, it's losing the rights to the name world of Warcraft. Stop ignoring that aspect.
---
It's both. It's partly I.P. protection and partly because they know they can turn a profit from both vanilla fans (some of whom still play retail) and tourists who aren't likely to stick around. Brack didn't mince words, he flat out stated Classic would launch and servers would stay up even if it was all lookyloos and tourists, or if only a handful of dedicated players stuck around.
---
He also stated that they discussed looking the other way and letting Nost continue on its merry way but due to legal gray areas that couldn't guarantee their I.P. rights would be protected, they had to get involved.
---
Pservers definitely were a huge factor in classic being a thing. It isn't because people signed a petition, though, it's because they were a potential risk to I.P. rights and also showed a viable market for their own 1.12 product. Can't shut down pservers very well in France, Russia, or China, but they *can* poach players from them and make money at the same time.
---
The books are really really good. The artwork is amazing and the details into the lore is incredible. 
---
Source: someone who actively reads the chronicles and the original manuals all the time
---
Agreed!
---
My perfect WoW would be with:
---
*  TBC's class philosophy, of having hybrids not meme-tier in anything but healing-spec.
---
*  Vanillas attunement-system (screw doing attunements in TBC on an alt).
---
* Old Alterac Valley. I miss summoning stuff :(
---
* Retails raid-difficulty, but with "hard modes" for more loot, which you access from inside the instance, not by simply selecting "Normal/Heroic" from a drop-down menu.
---
* and of course: **Dartol's Rod of Transformation**
---
I hate to be this guy, because I’m probably gonna farm the set and wear it as long as I can until someone asks me to stop or I get T1.
---
While a few of the items are pretty good, it’s not at all tank pre-raid BIS because it lacks defence rating. Maybe one or two pieces. 
---
It’s likely you’ll pick it up while farming your best items, and with valour + a resist set, you’ll be fine in MC anyway. But minmaxing tanks will farm mostly random defence blues.
---
In vanilla priests got a couple of spells unique to one or two races.
---
Humans and Dwarves got Desperate Prayer, Dwarves got Fear Ward, Undead got Devouring Plague, Nelves got Starshards? (something like that).  Theres others as well that im forgetting.
---
[This lays it out](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Priest_racial_abilities)
---
I feel like I'd be pushing the wrong buttons all the time. So many so tight together. I have enough problems with my mouse that only has 6 on the side
---
Then why the fuck is everyone making a big deal about not getting into the beta. If you played before BC you know what its is.
---
Even if this particular one is fake it is still doable to a point: taking the manual lfg out of it.
---
Back in vanilla and BC era there was a resource node addon (forget the name) that could add nodes other players found on your server in near real time. This addon used hidden (hidden to the player by default) custom chat channels to communicate between other players that used this addon.
---
That way of communicating maybe against TOS now, but if not then a LFG addon could work the same way. It most likely couldn't auto-create a group and definitely not port you right in to the instance. But it could take the manual LFG typing out of the equation for the player.
---
Thank you for clearing it up. Waiting for new batch.
---
I hope they add new content, I just hope they don't:
---
-release expansions like TBC and Wrath (we've been there)  
---
-add flying  
---
-add lfr  
---
-add arenas or rbgs  
---
-overhaul maps/classes/gameplay/talents  
---
-add catchup mechanics  
---
-make the game easier  
---
-and anything else im missing that ruined wow
---
I really don't want to burst your bubble. And, this is a hugely unpopular opinion people don't want to face....
---
But you will 10001% for sure see "gogogogogo" in Classic. There's just no way you wouldn't. Sure, part of the gogogo mentality can be blamed on the developer's designing dungeons more streamlined and (frankly) steamroll-able. But the other half is player knowledge and ability.

As a whole, MMO players are more mainstreamed and capable today than they were 15 years ago. You can't erase or neglect a decade and half's worth of advancement in skill and knowledge.
---
As soon as your tank is geared enough to not get smashed, and as soon as your healer is mana efficient not to go OOM quickly, you will definitely see "zoom zoom" gameplay.
---
On a related note, you should also expect the raids to fall down super quick too, provided guilds are A) able to field 40 people and B) insist they come prepared.
---
MC mechanics for example are an absolute joke compared to retail standards....and the #'s aren't terribly demanding either.
---
*On the plus side though*, with no cross-server grouping and no LFG tool, you'll likely see far less griefing, kicking and general harassing for not being as fast or as good as the "leader" wishes. You might just not get invited back. Which frankly is fine, because you in turn can just run the dungeons with a group your own pace.
---
One of my best experience in the game was when I was leveling with a friend, and we used to often fight the same bunch of people regularly. Then they would always get annoyed real quick and bring their high level character (we had none on this server) and spawn-camp us. This happened untill our level was high enough so that even their best character couldn't kill us anymore lol.
---
Yeah. Because that's how they pick potential testers..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
---
I promise if people do this they will be ostracized by the server community during or after layering goes away. People and guilds will literally talk and right your name on lists.
---
Addons existed back in the day and I used them back in the day.  Addons could even play the game for you with OG decursive, healbot, ect...
---
I remember using decursive as a mage in MC and setting up priority lists so that if it was a mana draining curse spamming the decursive button would remove it from healers first, other casters and ignore non-mana users.  Wouldn't have to click a UI element or target anyone, the addon would handle the targetting for you.
---
There were plenty of RS3 players that railed against OSRS. You can go back in the forums, and see their posts.
---
I quit the game before RS3 even came out, and I came back to vote for OSRS, so, no, it was not RS3 players that exclusively voted for OSRS, like you're trying to make it seem. 
---
Right now people may be set on #nochange but I doubt they will be in 6 months, to a year or two, when they have nothing left to do in the game. 
---
I had the same mindset when it came to OSRS in the beginning, now, despite not liking the style, and themes of a lot of the new OSRS content (it's strayed FAR away from the medieval middle-ages setting that I fell in love with, originally, in 2006,) I'm glad it's there, because the core game I enjoy hasn't gone anywhere.
---
Also, let's assume the playerbase WILL, in fact, drop, if there are no content updates, whether it be TBC+WOTLK or new, original content. People aren't going to be happy when their guildies quit, and the cities are cleaned out, and they could quickly change their minds on new content.
---
Game isn't even out yet, we will see in due time.
---
I remember in WOTLK i started playing right as ICC came out. The badge system and using old raids to gear for ICC was a great system in my mind. It made heroic dungeons relevant and old raiding content was relevant.
---
I grant you 
---
5 good boy points.
---
They are meant to be druids of the fang, surprisingly few images of them floating around though
---
Yes that becomes relevant when you start to over gear dungeons.
---
Real pro's use alt f4
---
This is why I personally plan on volunteering to be the dagger rogue for my guild. Sure swords are BIS but there’s way less competition for weapon drops, and it’s still pretty competitive.
---
That two button rotation life.
---
Human/orc are the best choices for fury.
---
Are you planning on doing a 21:9 (specifically 3440x1440) one?
---
If it worked for jagex, who absolutely ruined RS with rs3, it would work for blizzard. Devs come up with ideas that stay true to the 2007scape design philosophy and put them out to the community for vote, in order to vote you need to meet certain requirements (could be having at least one level 60 in Classic).
---
If you want to skin a mob you need ENEMY LEVEL \* 5 skinning skill. Boss level creatures are level 63, so that includes the one you posted but also the Green Dragons, Magmadar etc.
---
Also some raid trash mobs are also lvl 63 and require 315 skinning skill.
---
Some bad news for you, Vanilla was really badly balanced.
---
i'd also recommend a pve server as really "world pvp" doesnt exist. It's just ganking tbh.
---
You get an upvote for the cleverness of your insult. Don't spend it all in one place.
---
No doy, you buy the token in Bfa and then you've playtime
---
Prot Paladins are the BEST 5 man dungeon tank.
---
They mean something. They may not be the true values but you don't get buffed or geared at these levels to make up a 2x difference. The issue might be an honest one though. The data might have been read wrong from their data base, take from the wrong place. There is a discrepancy, one that cannot be explained by gear and buffs
---
I actually did consider adding that point to my comment, but still I just feel a little bit bad when I see a reaction video getting *more* views than the original. It just feels a bit cheap to get more views for literally no work when the original spend several hours on a script, editing etc.
---
Again, I don't have anything directly against Asmongold (don't watch him enough to really have an opinion on him), but I just find the whole reaction video trend a bit weird sometimes, which was actually my main point - I just don't *get* it. Like, why would I want to watch a dude sit and stop the video all the time just to tell me how much he agrees? Like, he doesn't bring anything more to it than (as an example) Bellular already did. I guess I just don't understand that kind of content.
---
I just don't think I understand why Asmongold is as big as he is. Sodapoppin I understand because like him or hate him, he does all kinds of crazy stuff on his streams and he is basically one big meme. Some might not be into it, but I find it easy to understand why he got an audience for that at least. Maybe I need to watch more Asmongold to find out.
---
You’re missing out on a huge aspect of the game if you don’t play on a pvp server.
---
That looks a lot like my circa 2005 dwarf priest, though I never ran full Devout that I recall (had it till i upgraded it though).
---
I figure the best route is to respect other people and play serious if they're serious and be silly if they're silly. If you can't achieve your goal on a run, set it aside temporarily and enjoy yourself. If someone is really invested then pitch in.
---
additionally the whole give us money for a chance at getting a invite is so unethical and scummy it blows my mind. They could have easily let you just update your beta profile settings without needing a sub.
---
Can add fury warriors to the list for pre raid BIS gear farming as well.
---
TBC was still good, it still had a lot of classics design philosophys like content as a reward, class niches etc. my only gripe is if they do re-do TBC sometime in the future please no flying mounts
---
This is why I’ll always admit to, and never be a productive and deserving participant in beta testing. 
---
You guys that do, and are capable of this sort of in depth testing and theory crafting and knowledge are what help companies work out the kinks and make games great and enjoyable. 
---
I know this is off topic, but my mind is always blown when I read this sort of info.
---
Watched the entire video, nice watching him having so much fun, I can't wait to be in the same position, somewhere in august / september :)
---
the popular streamers are basically professional entertainers who create a community, they aren't random dudes playing games. I think that's kind of like asking, do people really go to bars just to talk to some random dude behind the counter and have a drink?
---
I say add new content to classic.
---
New raids, new quests, gear, battlegrounds, zones. Just don't add flying, lfr, higher level cap and don't do any major overhauls or the world of gameplay. That way there is fresh content but its still vanilla.
---
Well, human is actually nice against Rogues, due to Perception. And it's best to go melee - Maces and Swords I think, as humans have bonuses for those. So War / Pally?
---
It might be the worst pure-dps class in absolute end game content like some Aq40 fights and some Naxx fights but Hunters are fantastic in MC / Onyxia / BWL / ZG. I used to absolutely crush damage meters as a hunter before everyone got tier 2.5 / tier 3 
---
as for PvP MM / survival is very potent... i always did very well in PvP as a Hunter in vanilla

I agree on my server in EU there was no Maffia 
---
And from world pvp perspective I only had one guild on KOS list.   On Alliance it was dominated by two major raiding guild.  One who had everything up to Nax on farm and was selling items from the other players for gold.  The item for benediction 600g for example.  There was no visible x-faction usage then a few special asholes and we used to gang them (my guild when ever we saw them).  I can tell you on my server the biggest danger in Ungoro was the devilsaur attacking you in the back from the fog when dealing with two other mobs.   
---
Ppl need to stand up to bullies and kill the maffia guys if the start to pop up.
---
As a Warlock that last sentence inspired rage.

**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore
---
Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm EST, and create a family like community. Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.
---
**Who are we?**
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006, and our leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.
---
**Who are we looking for?**
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40 man roster. **Our current highest needs are for Holy Priests, Mages, and Resto Shamans.** We expect our raiders to have extensive knowledge of their class and their role. Prior boss knowledge and research is preferred but not required if you're playing at the appropriate level. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community that may want to raid from time to time and act as a substitute for our core roster.
---
**What will we be doing?**
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use an all-or-nothing DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional weekend day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards. We will offer spots to all specs so long as the dedication to play is there, though non-meta specs will be highly competitive. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process. Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.

Oh, so you are of the opinion that when I purchase a piece of software, I don’t own the files?  That they are the property of Blizzard still and accessing or using them without Blizzard’s explicit OK is illegal, even when Blizzard has made it so that I cannot play the game I purchased anymore?
---
No files were stolen.  The database was reconstructed from the data put out by those files.  
---
Your position is actually a radical redefinition of property rights, to claim that when you purchase something you can only use it as the original seller intended.  EULAs and other types of soft software licensing are not valid, and have been consistently struck down by the courts.
---
Do you think that when you buy a car, the dealer should be able to tell you when you can drive it and when you have to stop using it and buy a new one?
---
You should play what you want, because in reality if/when your guild breaks up or you change to another guild, you find yourself in a situation catering to the whims of others. Be the chad, play what you want
---
I would 10000% play what you think looks best.
---
Play what you want. Fuck the rest
---
Nope
---
Not if you are DS/ruin spec; they'll get one of the SM/ruin locks to bring imp buffs. DS loses way too much damage if they don't sacrifice.
---
Entirely true in classic though
---
Aesthetic!
---
I never realised and now it’s so terrible I wish I hadn’t
---
With xrealm BGs I have no question that I will prefer a PvE server.  I hated queues on Nost PvE and I hated the fact that certain BGs simply didn’t pop on non-weekends.  Otherwise it was a better experience while it lasted.
---
Sure, it’s obvious with BiS gear, but I had a Rogue roll on a [Drakeclaw Band] (https://classicdb.ch/?item=10795) just because it had agility and stamina, despite it being BiS tank item. People don’t always know every item in the game, and a little courtesy can go a long way.
---
There are trash players of all classes and specs, but I could see how someone's experience doing the whole fresh 60 spamming dungeon runs could be heavily tainted by hunters solely because they are so easy to get to max level with virtually no game knowledge or cooperation with other players.
---
That said, once you are seeing hunters with raid pieces the "huntards" will make themselves very recognizable.
---
Get that into Sekiro
---
Has it though? The game was much more popular as an mmorpg with mmorpg elements. 
---
I’d argue the decline is more a result of their fan base increasingly not liking the game and less that we are getting older or that more compelling games are being released.
---
I think we all know, but in the quest to please everyone, they made a game very few actually like. 
---
For years blizzard has listened to people who don’t like the game, not those of us who have been too busy playing the game to go to the forums and tell them the things we liked or were good.
---
I’d argue flying mounts are bad and hit rating (at least as a %) was good. Even if people see convenience in flying mounts and inconvenience in hit rating. Having to traverse the world and not passively fly above it is good. Having to manage negative stats is good item design.
---
it's a grey area. so if the user downloads the game it's piracy, that's blatant. but running the server is emulation, which has been legal since forever. i believe it falls under fair use until a profit starts to be made.
---
At least they’re usually decent for PvP

I'm rolling a Tauren Warrior because I can't stand the Orc's hunched over battle animations.  I actually don't think I'll be rolling any Orcs at all.  Maybe Warlock for lore reasons, but it's up in the air between them and Undead.

---
Ganking on PVP servers is overblown, especially if you level at the start when there aren't even any 60 rogues to worry about. Even leveling on well progressed private servers with inflated populations I barely got ganked or corpse camped.
---
The worst ganking I got was  a 60 mage tried to Polymorph grief me in STV but I snuck a logout in between polymorph casts and escaped :)
---
Mage used to be most popular with rogue second. Now I expect it to be switched, but I expect those two to have drastically more players (relative to other classes) than before. Those are my two favorite classes, but honestly I might avoid them unless you're going in with a group of friends that is interested to at least get to 60 and run early dungeons. Your pre-MC gear up process might be hellish if you're going alone with either of those classes.
---
Benefit to mage though, they're good money makers. Sell food and portals. Can solo some money makers.

its  a game that knows no boundrys i remember there was an german documentary where there were wow  pensioners who played together and you could tell they enjoyed it 
---
I wonder what they do today
---
same here  (March  05 I think ), not hugely upset mind you but hopefully get in at some point
---
By having both classic and retail under one sub, seems like a pretty good deal to me. I unsub when I'm not playing
---
In other news Water is wet.
---
I honestly think T2 Paladin and T3 Hunter &gt; T3 warrior. It's pretty damned close though.
---
For warrior sets I genuinely liked Icecrown set more than T3. I am probably a huge outlier in that, though.
---
I know it's easy to say it, guess that's why there are 100 threads about it every day.
---
Pretty sure it's active sub only. I have an active sub

I’m not shitting on them, I only criticize the loud mouth players(Alexsensual and similar mindsets here) that think they know better than an actual vanilla veteran like me.
---
Don't be a scumbag like Asmondgold, check.
---
&gt; Also, as a side-note on the AI thing. There are definitely mobs on pservers that utilize a much more aggressive skill pattern than what we've seen on the classic servers as well.
---
That is a known limitation of the private servers where they chain cast many abilities while the original AI used them in a more spaced out way that the private servers have been unable to replicate.
---
What an incredible read. Brought tears to my eyes.

Oh yeah, Heroic Shattered Halls were the Warrior tanking proving grounds.
---
Well if all 1000 people attempt to do the starter quest, none of them will finish it. That's why the smart people will group up and go to a higher level zone to kill stuff.
---
I know this topic could just be a mattering of people being bad at the game or remembering it wrong, but I definitely have been watching streams and thinking "okay, they're dead here" and they just won't be dead.

There are certain pulls I've seen Asmon and Sodapoppin do that should numerically have caused their parties to die. Something is definitely wrong.

runescape was my trial by fire

---
I'm not saying rush to do anything, phase 6 content can keep people occupied for years
---
[DS+Ruin](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Ii0bZbxhzThoZgx0tM0z) is the other Warlock spec and, from my understanding, it is better for a couple reasons.
---
* Higher DPS
---
This spec maximizes your Shadow Bolt damage.  Since that it your primary damage source, reguardless of spec, this becomes the better spec for DPS.
---
* Doesn't have a pet
---
This is a big point for two reasons.  First, in Classic, pets don't have AoE damage reduction.  This means that pets will die all the time.  With this spec, you remove the worry of your pet dying, glitching out, or any other issues that they can have.
---
The second reason this is big is because only other pet that is ever worth having out, for Warlocks, is your imp.  This is because you can have the Imp be passive while phase shifted.  This means they will never die or pull if they run off to Antarctica.
---
* Doesn't take an extra debuff slot
---
SM needs a debuff slot to do optimal DPS.  This is because they need to proc Nightfall (Instant Shadow Bolts) to do their top DPS. 
---
SM is still wanted in raids, even though DS does better damage.  This is because SM can grab some improved/unique curses and can bring the Blood Pact buff for the tank group since you won't be sacrificing your pet.  SM still does respectable damage as well, so it isn't like you are sacrificing a Warlock spot for this utility.  
---
SM is also considered the better solo spec, so you can be pretty efficient with one spec.
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
Well no shit he hasn’t played classic in 14 years lol.
---
You just wait for the skinning animation and then CC or kill them and skin it.
---
this was the reply i was hoping for. thank you sir.
---
During the original WoW vanilla beta I did this as a NE trying to get to stormwind.
---
My path was wetlands -&gt; southshore -&gt; badlands -&gt; searing gorge (stayed as ghost here) -&gt; burning steppes -&gt; redridge
---
Attempted to rez in redridge, but was rezzed in searing gorge. At launch I was able to find out the IF had a train =)
---
The journey isn't actually all that long. Boat wait time is the biggest time sink, and I've clocked in 15 minutes from darkshroe to IF tram on PS. Can also abuse some res spots to travel faster. Discovery xp isn't much but it helps make the trip not a complete waste. With planning, you can make this trip without it being a big delay in leveling. However if you're trying to do this at lvl 1 I'd advise against it. At lvl 10-12 you can often survive a hit or two on certain aggressive mobs and will have some CC for getting past the orcs on the mountain pass to loch modan.
---
I played in Vanilla, but was never a raider.  All I did was pvp, and I was horde.  What makes the dwarf so special?  I honestly can't remember what makes them special at all.  I played an orc shaman, which I don't think the racial was good for at all (didn't it buff melee or something?).  Guess I'm just a filthy casual ;)

True is that. I remember spikes of 25k-50k ms during peek raiding hours on the raid instances.

It was 3. Unless it changed to 2 later.

The vanilla tier sets always get a lot of love, but the TBC ones don't seem to get much at all. Druid tier 4 and 5 are both gorgeous.

Because most locks will go DS/Ruin for the extra 5% shadow damage over SM/Ruin, more stamina, and better healthstones.  SMRuin will keep an Imp out for the tank group.  It also has nightfall though, so having a debuff slot for corruption would be extra helpful for their dps (corruption damage + just instant SB would probably make up for the 5% dmg loss)
---
Personally I think SMRuin is more interesting and flexible in the world environment. If I was going DS/Ruin I'd consider possibility of giving up improved corruption in favor of MD for more world content flexibility

That’s so cool, I never knew!
---
Addons were a thing in Vanilla and they were actually game breaking in that they could make decisions and do things for you such as Decursive and Healbot.  All you had to do was press a button and it would take care of choosing the target and ability based on preset filters and priority.
---
I ran the OG Decusive in MC back in the day.  Not sure what other Addons I used but I used atleast a bar mod and a UI mod.  Not sure if Miks was in Vanilla or I started using that in TBC...  I also remember using a music player addon in TBC :p

Classic client is retail with some alterations. So no. It's a graphic card that's capable of using Apple's Metal that's needed.
---
Ironic bc with AQ gear you'll be a lightning god
---
Maybe when I get a 4k monitor, for now 1080p is the max resolution.
---
Thanks, I put it in as edit, primarily as PVE.
---
I was mostly referring to the fact that gloves are not “random” trash drops like the belt/bracers are (because I believe even they’re limited to a few types of specific mobs for each). The gloves will almost assuredly be BoE to start, yes.

No that's what I'm doing!  That means you have to pick something else I can be the only one!  ;)

Thousands and thousands of people trying to get in, how many spots do you think their beta servers hold? Good luck

Oh, it's  unlikely I'll be doing much raiding.

&gt;You are -NEVER- going to recreate the experience you had back then, not even close. We just know way too much now compared to what we knew back then.
---
hundreds of thousands of private servers players know this and they still play the same game for years.  It's not about having the exact same experience as in 2005,  but having something that RESEMBLES it to a degree that is enjoyable for us players.
---
If I recall correctly the graveyard for Deadmines is at Sentinel Hill
---
There was no proper spell power plate gear in vanilla, which is why prot paladins weren't a thing.

What’s wrong with the daze and shield thing?

Shocked how we are having to explain simple things like this. I thought everyone knew protocol for chests. Streamers seem worse every day.
---
This is the real answer. There are too many unknowns to say. However as I've explained in other threads, PvP rank gain is relative to other players, which means that unlike grinding rep or gold, it is possible to farm it forever and not make any progress.
---
if a hunter loses to a rogue, and all things are equal -  he sucks
---
It's your character, it's your choice man.
---
Go for what you think looks and feels best, or you will regret it later :)
---
Definitely a good way to look at it!
---
I agree though that some pieces lost their Charm being BoA's.  Like the Tank Shield is one of the coolest shield model's, but hopefully they still feel badass in their genuine form in classic!
---
Except it is about keeping players. It's the main reason why they are going to charge you $15 a month to play. They are a company, they need money to run. The classic server is not going to be ran for free, there are monthly costs. They need to pay the devs, they need to pay to maintain the servers.
---
If they cannot keep players, then they are not making a profit. No profit = no more servers.
---
Cause you need to have played Vanilla to know absolutely anything about it or have any desire to play Classic?
---
Could be, but we can't be sure. Private servers don't have the correct values that's why they play it safe by overtuning everything. Especially the armor values of raid bosses are increased to stupid amounts to curb the melee dps.
---
&gt; Excuse me fellas, but this would not be happening if it wasn't for Vanilla private servers, mainly Nostalrius, and that is a fact. 
---
"I played a PServer and I want recognition for making Classic happen! I'm important! You can't dismiss my claims, even when they are wrong!"
---
Just wow. 
---
It would also not be happening if Retail didn't still exist. You can thank BFA players for classic.
---
&gt; Stop dismissing them. 
---
The dismissal is based on faulty knowledge and improper bug reporting, nothing at all to do anyone's involvement, or lack thereof, in getting Classic realized. 
---
&gt; Private servers are your best bet at gauging Vanilla data as players as I am sure none of us have done years of research as they have, and especially since Vanilla data is very scarce overall. 
---
And they still couldn't get it right with "years of research". The fact is, they were lazy, and made changes where they could not recreate the original. A few changes were due to the nature of the Pserver vs an actual classic server, which is understandable, but that doesn't make those changes okay for Classic. 
---
&gt; Instead of interpreting "elites are not dealing enough damage" as "here is a private server player bashing Classic", interpret it as "here is a Vanilla enthusiast who wants Classic to be very successful and as accurate as it can possibly be". 
---
Way to play the victim. Real whinger. "Anyone who disagrees with me, the slefless Pserver player that is basically the reason for Classic, is attacking me personally."
---
&gt; The bickering is getting old at this point. 
---
Rofl. Says the guy bickering about it. 
---
Never seen someone so self unaware of their butthurtedness while simultaneously continuing the same behavior they are telling others to stop.
---
Almost as bad for the final product as the big streamers. Don't get me wrong, super hyped that Asmon is getting 100k viewers on twitch to promote it, but whatever server he ends up on is going to be completely fucked. Same for any server that gets a guild full of Pserver playing, fast level route mastering, resource camping no-lifers. 
---
Instead of interpreting 
---
*"Go back to private servers lmao."*
---
*"Your private server information is invalid."*
---
*"You're not remembering correctly. You're deluded by private servers."*
---
as non-pserver players bashing pserver players, interpret it as  "here is a Vanilla enthusiast who wants Classic to be very successful and as accurate as it can possibly be".  
---
Pserver players are not the only Vanilla enthusiasts. 
---
No one cares that you or anyone else played a Pserver. We have Classic now, and that's really all that matters. Keep stroking yourself about how important you are for playing a pserver though. I'm sure there are plenty out there who will thank you for your incredible sacrifice.
---
There were questing addons in Vanilla though TBC is where I remember first using one.
---
There was also Thottbot and Alakazam(sp?) which were the wowhead before wowhead.
---
I like these tips, they are solid. I'll throw  in my two cents to add to it.
---
I like to save my Bloodrage for after the pull most of the time, so I can get the aoe threat from the rage generation.
---
OP mentioned prot, I'd recommend against it for leveling. Tactical mastery in arms increases your toolkit as a tank by a lot, particularly in the 30-45 level range where a prot warrior can't get it. It let's you charge into packs for the pull when it's safe to do so, and you can stance dance for mocking blow, hamstring, berserker rage, or intercept. It also makes it a lot easier to solo.
---
I wish I had them irl
---
I’m aware.
---
He wasn’t.
---
Nitpick and what you said is obviously right.
---
It is technically linear. Just not with respect to damage reduction. That would be stupid anyway as going from 98% to 99% halves the incoming damage the same way that going from 0% to 50% does.
---
It is linear with respect to effective hit points. Every 400 + 85 x lvl gives +100% base HP added to the effective HP.
---
DM N farm is my favorite way to pass the time. SO MUCH GOLD and I find the process to be incredibly zen.
---
That's an odd way to say three seconds
---
&gt; It was not in classic is not an issue for me btw.
---
Your lack of care about establishing authenticity does not invalidate that goal. Blizzard has specifically said this beta is both for finding bugs and inconsistencies between this version and vanilla wow.
---
You don't really use the ele stuff on raids and once content becomes more difficult you'll want to pick up manatide totem or improved weapon totems.
---
Really you should want that stuff from MC on. 30/0/21 is kind of a selfish spec. But some guilds well let it slide on the "easy" content.
---
Vqueueue is a great add on, the only thing bad about it is that not enough people know about it or use it
---
Looking for an NA EST PVP Alliance guild or just some random players like me who are laid-back. I don't want to commit to raiding schedules until I figure the game out. Is there a casual guild out there? I'm here for the social aspect. I don't want a guild that becomes a job. I plan on playing pretty hardcore but I guess I don't want a strict guild telling me what to do and when.
---
What the fuck Blizzard, please remove heirlooms they are not part of vanilla wow &gt;:(
---
On live if you have a shield up (an absorb, so the azerite trait, warlock soul leech, i'd assume mage bubble, etc) you wont get dazed when hit from behind.  When youre mounted that means you wont get knocked off your mount.
---
On the PTR theyve changed that to not work.  Theyre also releasing mount equips, and one of them is something that prevents you from being dazed.
---
You dont exactly 'lose' anything, but its something that you apparently have to buy on each toon, and its just an annoyance when weve had a system that worked fine for over a decade.
---
I was also kind of excited to try out some of the other mount armor since i wouldnt need the anti-daze one on my warlock.  Now i wont have that.
---
Professions being way more meaningful is a big one for me.
---
Its also important to keep making those threads to make blizzard reevaluate current data on classic to make sure, they are right, if any concern regarding low damage is present. Personal opinion, it almost blew my mind watching Asmongold charge into 4-5 elites in SFK. Something I definitely wasnt use to see on private servers
---
i have no idea about beta but pws stops rage generation. throwing it on a warrior/druid is very bad.
---
From what i understand, classic is a goodway for blizzard to combat private servers. Which they have tried to shut down before.
---
Oooooo topical. I like it.
---
This is a great video. He should go into dungeons and do this on elites, just to humour us. and get a more full picture. What dungeon would be the best for beasts? BFD? WC?
---
It takes $$ man
---
Hey, is there a discord we could join if interested?
---
Dwarf Priest had a racial called "Fear Ward". That basically buffed someone  to be immune to the 1st fear effect applied to them...it had a CD of 3 mins (? som1 corrected me if this wrong) but if all your priests were Dwarves they could rotate fear ward on some important target, like the Main Tank in some fights.
---
Experienced players can do everything. Remember though pala has no taunt and that is a problem on some bosses when you are raiding.
---
Ok im not alone phew
---
There's no real downside to it if people find value in it. I bet hardcores who were gonna buy virtual tickets anyway thought they were getting double for their money. Who's to say they didn't?
---
I’m sorry but how can you say gameplay was dumbed down after vanilla? How can it get any easier than a mage spamming frost bolt.
---
I usually don't upvote memes, but when I do

---
I will play dwarf hunter. Dwarf&gt;elf lorewise big time.
---
I rather be a wealthy, grumpy, fugly ale-drinker than some cuck living in a tree being  all self righteous with sausages as ears.
---
2017 called and they want their forced meme back lad
---
I think I understand now :)
---
I think this was mostly a case of different ppl having different terms for the same things. But thx for taking the time. Kind of you.
---
I was also confused because I interpreted OP as a kind of "hey you guys are always talking about the high tier sets, lets show some love for the lowest tier set", so I immediately thought these types of comments were in the same spirit and OP has forgotten about some earlier tier set.
---
I haven't played wow in years and looking at vids of raids of twitch kids makes me really uneasy, I don't want that in my game
---
I had 2 irl friends who played warrior. They hated me with a passion... Why you ask? I had the full warrior t0 as paladin hat har hat.
---
Ohhhhhh that sounds so fucking frustrating
---
You are the one playing that character, not your guildies. Pick a troll
---
I didn't know what true FPS was until I saw kids in college with fresh gaming laptops playing it. I averaged 15 to 20 fps throughout the entirety of Vanilla and a good chunk of TBC.
---
&gt; Never seen someone so self unaware of their butthurtedness while simultaneously continuing the same behavior they are telling others to stop.
---
I know, right?
---
This is what current WoW is missing.  The freedom to be a douchebag makes the game more personable.  We don't even have the freedom to be a dick on live retail.
---
You really think that idiot has put that much thought into this?
---
the difference isnt that big. vanilla raids arent that hard that you need it. i'd go troll.
---
if you like your character looks, that means you play it more, and put more effort into it. So the looks of your character that you like is a racial sortof. so tell it to your guild.
---
uhh is that still a bug? Should one remove their PTRs? I Still have Legion one..
---
Imagine not being able to interpret a meme out of baseless aggression for someone fueled by spite and jealousy.
---
You have become the meme.
---
Wasn't tier .5 not released until like AQ as basically a catch up mechanic?

If I didn’t already need enough evidence to know this sub is dumb and gullible, this post proves it for sure

Dwarf is better against rogues due to 10s immune to poisons, which makes you imunne to stacked wound poison or blind
---
When pally tanking at levels sub 40, you will have to mark targets and deal with extras with dps. Pally threat is non existent at low levels and has no taunt. 
---
5 experience players should be fine. But honestly, pally is hard to tank until you get more spells or have a nice wep
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/he-does-it-for-free
---
Understands some things cant stay the same. 100% this, nobody is saying it's going to be a totally different game but expecting the same feeling and the same experience might leave some people a bit disappointed.
---
Militant no changes people act that way because they fundamentally have zero trust in anything new Blizzard will come up with. It's extreme, but I think their stance will soften as the Classic team continues to gain trust with the community. They've done an amazing job so far, Blizzard CMs are even posting in this subreddit now. 
---
I think if Blizzard does right by Classic, even the most hardcore no changes purists will be open to new content made by this team.
---
That's nothing out of the ordinary, I've soloed Hogger as a level 10/11/12 Warlock on multiple private servers
---
Blizzard's terms, which are clearest,  are Dungeon 1 and Dungeon 2, versus Raid 1, etc...
---
No lol I didn't say that specifically.  I just meant that gnomes not being to play priest is pretty hard to forget if you played vanilla.  No offense was meant, it just made me chuckle when I saw that
---
If you assume the chad casual was always a chad casual and not referring to just this release of classic wow
---
all this is true. But only when pally is leveled up past 40. Sub 40, u have none of this. So it’s doable but it will be a drag
---
All weapons are hunter weapons though?
---
This. Private servers only have access to the game files and from there they manually recreate the databases and script functions to emulate how they acted on live servers.
---
It's absolutely an infringement on blizzards copyright and Blizz could shut them down with ease any time they wanted to. They just haven't bothered to/ didn't want the bad publicity.
---
As far as i can see there are no imorovements to elements/shadow curses in talents, and other curses dont seem to be useful for bosses. So pretty much the only reason is that sm ruin has imp for stamina buff and since he cant sacrifice it, the only usable dps build without DS is sm/ruin? Do i understand correctly or is there something more?
---
Speak for yourself kiddo
---
oof i love how salty the alliance kids get :)
---
Nothing, that isn't an accurate representation. We will know if Blizzard confirms it.
---
What is special about Classic is that it is (hopefully) forever. in BFA, your gear is only as good as the latest content update. The second a new raid comes out, all your old work is meaningless, since you can catch up so easily. Classic is a clearly tiered system, with all kinds of barriers for entry. Every minute you spend in the game will show in both your characters appearance and power. That sense of progress is lost in the world of LFR and Transmog, and catch up gear. I likely won't be hard core since I have a family now, but it will be cool to see those guys in Orgrimmar stand out from the heard.
---
Off topic, João is a classic Portuguese man’s name
---
my general rule of thumb is, if you can play your class as an undead, then play undead
---
God I hope they dont change because people are complaining, giving in to the casuals is how we got here in the first place.
---
One of the big reasons mobs were buffed on private servers was to compensate for 1.12 talents. I don’t think it’s completely people remembering the game wrong I think a lot has to do with 1.12 talents making things easier.
---
Ally spawn at Ratchet
---
Ah yes, cata heroics were actually a LOT of fun. I really enjoyed the difficulty in comparison to BFA, which honestly were a joke. In BFA First week mythic came out we cleared all of them in the first few days and had nothing to do for the next 5 days lol.
---
you cant really base class popularity off a closed beta
---
We are passionate about the same game , let's have argument but not stigmatize some people one way or the other ? :)
---
Ability clicking, a true representation of vanilla! glorious
---
I'm talking about the damage from elites, not mobs in general. 
---
And the DPS and stamina is completely irrelevant, we are looking at the actual damage players *take*, which is just braindead easy at ~51 damage per 2 seconds from a level 30 elite (!).
---
Hordeee Scuum
---
Oh Haha, yeah I actually didn't start playing until midway through BC. Over the shoulder watched my dad all through Vanilla though.
---
&gt;every 12 minutes
---
What an amateur.  No wonder Blizzard hasnt sent them an invite yet.
---
Troll racial berserking is actually pretty good for pve if that's a consideration at all.
---
Please play the character you feel most in-tune with. That's the classic way.
---
Not sure if I want to play beta. Might ruin some of the fun. I'm on the fence on if I should sub.
---
There is literally nothing else I want to play besides the beta and I'm watching twitch for the first time in my life.
---
&gt; what is the world coming to these days
---
That just feels sad :(
---
- [/r/forsen] [forsenCD MY MAN](https://www.reddit.com/r/forsen/comments/brd1oe/forsencd_my_man/)
---
I think u got it wrong. Its not about recreating the experience. Its just that its a better game overall. Its design is totally different. 
---
After I started playing vanilla again, I’ll never go back to the modern wow, which isn’t wow anymore
---
Surprised. I think bloodfang is the coolest set in the game from all classes.
---
!remindme 2 months
---
True. Depends if you like more proactive or reactive approach. But also... Humans just look better P\_P
---
That style of gameplay occurs in m+ dungeons now, at a much higher level than vanilla.
---
Tanking orcs using Blood Fury tho...
---
It's gonna be great!
---
Then I'd probably rank it the following for Horde:
---
Priest, Hunter, Shaman, Mage, Rogue - Troll
---
Warlock, Warrior - Orc
---
Unless Blizzard screws up and never makes a fresh realm. 
---
Beta sure is looking good though. I'll probably still be subbed in 40years, sitting in a retirement home somewhere ganking the youngsters for fun.
---
Except cross faction collusion is not a thing blizz is likely to allow. This is the kind of thing that gets reported, looked into and people get banned.
---
&gt; Any priest that is not a dwarf is almost useless though
---
*Laughs in Devouring Plague*
---
I clearly remember having to sheep mobs and use other CC, even in early dungeons. The idea that we were good enough to call out CC targets, control our attacks so we don't break CC, etc. But weren't good enough to think of healing the tank is frankly absurd. 
---
I will have a better idea once they the cap is increased so we can see SM, cause I know CC was mandatory in there.
---
Getting exalted WSG just for a tabard that matches Wrath, nice
---
That one got me as well. Dammit :C
---
That's how modern WoW is too, people just pretend it isn't. A ring with a socket can easily be worth 15-20 iLvls, same with things like bracers. Bigger items like pants it's usually only worth 5-10. But, a socket item doesn't boost the iLvl by what it's actually worth.  
---
Anyway, it would be pretty trivial to make an addon base it off of simcraft results, which will inevitably work for Classic. If Atiesh contributes 1million dps, and the Corrupted Ashbringer only contributes 800k dps, they'd each add that respective number to the hunters "gearscore." The non-random gear, no matter how "confusing" it is to a player makes a system like this that looks up gear on a library not only possible, but extremely easy.
---
So in private servers they redid all damage numbers from every NPC? Ik they had to fill in the blanks but not to that extent
---
&gt; If you are hunter do not take leather item from druid or rogue when they need it.
---
Nope. Some leather is BIS for warriors and hunters. Some cloth is BIS for shamans and paladins. If it's an upgrade, use it.
---
That should be in, they made that change during Vanilla.
---
Oh yeah the chat spam for "quick" BRD runs that ended up going all night and I didn't want to be an ass and leave early but having other things I needed to do
---
has this been reported ?
---
Because the new models had different animations than the ones we liked. I went from badass to a goof.
---
I thought paladin's had pretty strong MT healing though as they could almost infinity spam FoL mid ranks once at a certain gear point. They still had their place, but yes if you played paladin you buff and you heal. No Ret, no Prot, no options, and your Tier sets were all holy to confirm this.
---
I know a lot of people are against change but I don't think anyone would complain if Balance Druid got a few buffs to make them somewhat viable.
---
*Laughs in Truestrike*
---
This is totally false. Emulation is protected and has been ruled MANY times to not be copy write infringement. As long as the servers are not using any of blizzards code (none of the emu cores do) and they aren't distributing the client (some do some don't) it's not infringement. 
---
It's a big grey area but it is possible to operate a private server legally.
---
I'm beginning to think I'm the only person here who doesn't care about being in the beta. It's not like the characters carry over to release. 
---
I'm looking forward to playing a lot, but it's certainly not worth the gamble of sub monies for a chance of entry, to then have your characters deleted at launch.
---
&gt; The mobs do ~50 damage each which seems entirely reasonable.
---
Well, the problem is that 50 damage for a level 30 elite is just ridiculously easy. They need a full minute to kill a player by just hitting it.
---
Which is the same argument that was used against classic. "People will realize it's bad".
---
You have to realize every expansion offered something for someone, otherwise the game would decline much, much faster. Even a 2M subcount is in and of itself a massive success. It's when you compare it to the peak that makes it seems like a failure.
---
You also seem very biased towards vanilla and TBC. The sub count didn't drop below the peak subcount of vanilla until MoP, and was at an all time peak in WotLK.
---
Also if private servers are an indication of anything, every expansion up until and including MoP is a safe bet for Blizzard. People had access to every version and still chose to play the ones you regard as bad. Not only did they play them, they flocked them. 
---
Vanilla is not the be all end all of wow for everyone. I do get why people believe that it is, though, especially in a vanilla centered ecochamber such as this subreddit.
---
Gatekeeping later expansions because you didn't like them is not different than gatekeeping Classic because you like retail. Defending Classic release while actively preventing future expansions just makes you a hypocrite.
---
Personally LFG and instant gratification was the downfall of the game for me, but for many people that is what makes the game tolerable.

30+ member core with experience full clearing MC, BWL, AQ40, and Naxx. Best clear times were \~50 minute MC, 90 minute BWL, 2.5 hour AQ40 and all 4 wings of Naxx in 3.5 hours.
---
Guilds in WoW have a variety of goals. No single guild will ever fit every person’s play style, social needs, or progression goals. The core of Pretty Good has found that we value playing together and growing as a group more than any other element of this game. Make no mistake, clearing multiple raids in a single night and killing Kel’Thuzad are the immediate goals of this group. Where we differ is how we choose to pursue this objective.
---
We have an active discord and a diverse and funny group. Some have been playing vanilla WoW together for 5+ years and others are just now finding us as we prepare for Classic. There is something special about vanilla when you find 40 people with a common goal and experience your guild’s progression and achievements together. We are determined to maintain a consistent raid group in Classic who values playing together first and crushing raids second. Clearing PvE content is immensely easier than finding a group you will enjoy playing with for years at a time.
---
If you are interested in joining us and our raid times work for you, make a point to talk to some of our members. Hang out in our Discord for a day or two. We care more about the type of people we play with and their commitment to the group than your ability to lvl quickly, gear or raidstats.
---
We play hard. Consumables are expected and world buffs are strongly encouraged. We all recognize criticism is a necessary ingredient to growth, but there is a clear distinction between constructive criticism and tearing other players down. If you enjoy acting like a child or if you are a child then this guild is not for you.
---
We are always striving to build a finely tuned boss killing machine, and to do that requires constant improvement and accountability. If you choose to spend your time with Pretty Good you will always have to earn your raid spot, but you will be guaranteed a place in our community.

They didn’t give big streamers invites because they are amazing at finding bugs lol.
---
You actually don't own it , you lease it
---
Yeah, I hear you. However, people in classic have to live on their reputation, so if you act like a douschebag, nobody will group with you. Plus guilds become tighter organization units. I’m ok with that
---
Shaman tanks were always viable in these levels... I used to be in groups with shaman tanks up to at least sunken temple. I don't remember when they petered off though.
---
I think players feel it's safer to say 'Do not change anything' rather than trust blizzard to pick and choose what to play based on their track record.
---
Man, I get this too. 
---
I’ve been a bear main (Broll-Shadowsong) ever since wrath where I had other main tanks teach me the basics of how to pull and keep aggro. 
---
I talk to the group, tell them how I’m pulling and when I’m LoSing. It’s not a speed run, but I promise you it goes fast if you pay attention to me and you will never bitch about pulling aggro. 
---
But people complain I’m not pulling fast enough/healers complain I’m not pulling enough groups at once. 
---
I’m looking forward to classic where people are focused in and paying attention and not just spamming every cooldown to pull as fast as possible and risk wipes. 
---
It annoys me when I see reckless tanks and I end up always rolling a tank when I just wanted to be a boomkin or a ret pally for a day. 
---
TLDR; please just listen to your tanks. Tanks please communicate with your group.
---
I wouldn't be very hard. These mafias are very obvious, and have to have a ton of people involved to have any reasonable amount of round the clock coverage. That many people involved leads to info leaks and everyone knowing all about it.
---
I’m sure it’s a combination of things, yeah. Good post
---
Yet oddly enough, if you ask in the streamer guild chat with 1000 players most are saying 2004.. And only like 20-30 of them are streamers.
---
I played dwarf hunter.  It's great in BGs since you can remove crippling poison and bleeds using stone form.
---
Nelf hunter can Shadow meld and aimed shot ambush horde in open world PvP though.  And by 60 with T1 set you easily 2 shot most cloth wearers.  (As a dwarf I used to feign death in a bush or behind a rock for ultimate stealth)
---
on my warrior with a shield on i think i had about 20% armor redux when running deadmines on beta.
---
*sips coke*
---
I was sort of a scrub but I tanked through ZF with 2H only and sweeping strikes when I got the talent. I didn't start using shields until closer to end game instances. I just loved sweeping strikes and the sword talent for the ridiculous proc chains... I don't think I knew anything about it ignoring armor.
---
Play it again, rookie biotch!
---
It’s really too bad, almost feel sorry for them.
---
Had Virtuous. Preferred to think of them as my Jedi robes. They were more beige than yellow, not that it's much better.
---
Yeah, who knows 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Why do you think they added shifting to the gcd in legion? No way to control how much you shifted with mana essentially meaningless except for heals.
---
lightning bolt
---
I played PvE back in the day and feel like I missed out on a significant portion of the game.
---
&gt;people also like people watching sports
---
That is indeed a weird concept. If you ever would like subscribe and donate, I can start streaming myself watching football. :^)
---
I'm disappointed that they aren't adding the 0.5 sets on launch. I know that they are trying to be "faithful" to the original classic timeline, but 0.5 sets were added very late basically as throwaway content to casual players.
---
&gt;As soon as your tank is geared enough to not get smashed, and as soon as your healer is mana efficient not to go OOM quickly, you will definitely see "zoom zoom" gameplay.
---
I'm actually looking forward to this transition, because in Classic, this gameplay will be *earned*.  You don't get to engage in that chain-pulling steamroll unless you've put in the time and effort to legitimately overpower the content, whereas that gameplay in Modern WoW is baseline.
---
This has been a core part of druids up until they added shifting to the gcd in legion. Where have you been?
---
Kick
---
In your dreams because after you got SS FD trapped then aimed and multishot, you also got concussion shot and arcane shot...and by the time you got near me again, you got wing clipped. Your skill in gaining has decreased by 1. You die screaming about hunters, flares, and track humanoids.  :)
---
Idk where this idea came from that people *weren't* there for classic?  It was a very successful and popular game.
---
Because people are passionate about Classic and want to play it *now*.
---
For others, it's an annoyance that people that perceive as "unworthy" are playing the beta instead of them and so they are angry at that.
---
It's odd, I know.
---
what was his name
---
Yep, it is comfy here. I just want to get my McDonald’s Warrior set; Might is probably out of my league.
---
Definitely going to try to get a Quel’Serrar at some point, not because it’s awesome, but because it’s preeeeeetty.
---
People with stable 8-5 Mon-Fri jobs and no children can definitely no-life it up if they choose to.
---
&gt; They often had numerous developers and were a labor of love in order to try to make the experience as accurate as possible.
---
Just because you have x amount of devs doesn't mean the things they're developing is going to be accurate. The data was very limited to anyone outside of blizzard so it'll never be guaranteed to be accurate. as a priv server player myself, and retail back in the days, private servers are very buggy, and mostly, incorrect in terms of pathing, values, etc.
---
My account is 04 and not picked😭😭
---
They're palette swaps visually. Which is good for some classes (pally) not so good for others (priest) and just different for others (war).
---
....thats what she said?
---
Poring*  common mistake!
---
If classic is wildly successful (Im talking like TBC/Wrath level subs successful) they have a rare opportunity to redo WoW essentially with a crystal ball, they can see what did and did not work and can adjust accordingly. I think if this does happen, we will see new content but designed differently. Illidan and Arthas wont be killed off (huge mistake on Blizzards part imo, these are 2 of their most popular and fleshed out characters, do something besides killing them off, Illidans story in Legion was a more fitting end but they needed to basically redeem their fuck up by bringing him back to life, although it was handled well) BC content might not have flying mounts (Blizzard is on record saying flying was a mistake), its too early to know, but I dont think there will be **NO** changes, just changes with classic wows design philosophy
---
hahaha i plan on doing this with warrior. i leveled as prot warrior 1-60 in 2006 i'm no gonna do it again
---
There is a demonology build that sacrifices the demon for bonuses you could try out. It will be a while before you get there though so it may still be too much a hindrance for you.
---
In classic, you don't. There isn't really much if any advice in-game on which items are for you and which aren't. I tend to look up the item and check the comments to see if people mention it being really good for a specific class
---
Damn, I feel for you 😭
---
Druid is 100% fine, Paladin will occasionally struggle, but can do the job.
---
Yeah that one sucks too!
---
Oof, that's a hike and a half
---
A random guy working at blizz support probably doesn't know the exact details, so I'd take that with a large pinch of salt
---
That's probably pretty close to what you would have on a warrior in your average questing gear, yeah.
---
I lazily looked through a Classic database for the best mail gear you can get at level 19 and added up the armor values, and it came to about 1500. Add to that the 10% bonus from the Toughness talent, whatever armor he's getting from MotW (either 65 or 105, depending on whether the druid has rank 2 or rank 3 of it, ie. whether the druid is above level 20 or not), and I think it's possible for the numbers in that clip to not be bugged.
---
If you're using WiFi in the correct sense, and not meaning cellular data, WiFi is more than capable for most (if not all) games these days.
---
Barrens.chat
---
They are going to do it like it was in 1.12, so more like a zerg-fest. It's too bad they can't do it more like the version a few patches before that, when there were more NPCs, the Hostile trolls, and other fun things like Shredder units. But it is what it is.
---
i don't need luck. i'll get in.
---
Understandable. If you truly are an actual vanilla veteran then these plebs should bow to your superior knowledge, and have no right to disagree with anything you say on this sub.
---
If you have the modem in your house and the home office is on the same electrics you could always use a plug adapter. They work pretty damn well and much better than just wifi.
---
You can still do it in lower dungeons, absolutely. 
---
I loved early 2005 EU launch when no one had an issue with the concept, mained an enhancement shaman and tanked a ton of dungeons. Certainly hard to convince a random group of it nowadays, but it's still doable. 
---
Mid rank earth shocks for steady threat, max rank as a pseudo-taunt. Real hard in dungeons that have mobs higher than your level though. 
---
Technically you can do things like Stratholme with it as well, but beyond the niche factor that's really way more hassle than it's worth.
---
&gt;private servers
---
Not the same as vanilla/classic
---
Yeah the first things you said I knew about. But the aspect of the beast/feign death in a bush was a new one, thanks for the idea. Played a dwarf hunter to 60 in Vanilla and one to 60 on a priv server.
---
Damn, Classic cant come soon enough :)
---
Yeah I remember that in Vanilla.  They fixed it in Wrath I think.  I was just wondering how it works in Beta d/t the use of the Legion client.
---
No one is trying to dictate. however there are clear cut specs that are raid "viable" since vanilla was released on retail. P Servers did not change this meta really at all, just refined and modified it to maximum efficiency. Holy paladins, resto druid, resto shaman and Holy / Disc priest are all examples of specs that were meant for raiding, as dictated and emphasized by Tier 3 sets, the cost / efficiency of skills and talents available. 
---
When you raid, you are not only on your own time but that of 39+ others and those who choose to raid hardcore / semi hardcore / progression based will expect people to come prepared. No one is forcing you to respect your raidmates, but these things go hand in hand. Being corner case because of a want to play a certain spec is pure selfishness when looking at it from a top-down perspective.
---
I use everything with WiFi and have zero issues 
---
You should call your isp
---
She didnt forget - she just had no sense of engagement.   
---
Second time around she got it right.
---
Druid DPS isn't a thing in dungeons/raids.
---
Well, you'll have to go 200% effort for like 70% efficiency... Sadly.
---
But dungeons should be fine, once you get some nice base gear.
---
I'm not gatekeeping anything. I'm saying I'd rather have two different WoW's. I understand there would be populations on any expansion and that is a direction they could go but one I wouldn't prefer if given the choice of keeping the style of vanilla instead of slowly mixing in the things that made it retail.
---
I think the only right way to do TBC and Wrath servers is to make them, allow one way transfers of character or characters of the players choice from Classic (or TBC if it's Wrath), whilst still keeping Classic/TBC up too.
---
If they do it, it is undoubtedly going to be a pain in the ass.
---
Ya, most everyone says 2004. How many of the people who say 2004 do you actually think started in 2004?
---
I would reply to the emal "Classic or GTFO" lol
---
I've recently come across 2 videos from patch 1.10/1.11 ish which has matched up with Asmongold's streams. So it might be fine after all. You gotta remember these dungeons were designed to be run by people who've only played the game for like 10 hours.
---
You will also have amplify curse that can make your assigned curse even stronger a couple times a fight.
---
You can grab improved Curse of Weakness that, iirc, is the most powerful melee damage reduction debuff.  
---
Curse of Exhaustion is also available if you ever need it.
---
clearly a vanilla video, windows movie maker + warriors the requirements are met
---
Arcatraz was pretty fucking rough on heroic as well. That negative/positive boss could really really mess you up.
---
Are those the ones that are timed? I didn't particularly care for that mechanic. Imo it's hard to have a conversation or build much teamwork on a timed run.
---
Wi-Fi today is absolutely fine for gaming, all your games console use Wi-Fi.  
---
Of course I can't vouch for "your" Wi-Fi, weak signal etc can all still play a factor.  best try a speed test on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net), a ping of under 100ms is solid.
---
If you're on a PVP server , and a famous streamer rolls there on the opposite faction , save time and quit now.
---
Back in the day John Bain (RIP) aka Total Biscuit aka Cynical Brit was playing a Troll on Mazrigos EU , and when his EPIC podcast started getting well known , a lot of people re rolled horde there to play in his guild or hang out .
---
I sadly played Alliance there , back then it was a PVP server .Before then end there was a ratio of 90%/10% Horde/Alliance. World PVP consisted of about 10 horde face-stomping you into oblivion.
---
Horde pvp guilds had to ration ganking.
---
My guild left when we got free transfers out of there . A while later we logged on , with new characters to have a look , Ironforge had more Horde wandering around than alliance .
---
Shortly after , it was one of the first PVP servers to convert to PVE (this was back before sharding etc and long before Warmodes)
---
I just play PVE now ,world PVP just gives me PTSD..&lt;shudders&gt;
---
So its like i play for nothing ?
---
What makes you think mage will compete any less for gear? Druids, other Mages, Paladins, Priests, Shamans, and Warlocks will all compete, even for cloth gear until Naxx. That's 6/9 classes.
---
Rogues compete with Druids, Hunters, other Rogues, and Warriors. That's 4/9 classes.
---
And pvp ?
---
Yeah probably just bosses.
---
Good find. Let's see if it's related to a bug :)
---
And everyone flipped their shit when they did it. Them Blizz caved and nerfed them.
---
Vanilla gameplay isn't designed for super-low ping times. The game came out when Internet was much slower. If you can manage a ping under 200ms you should be fine. Maybe not a PvP god, but you'll be fine.
---
If your connection frequently disconnects entirely, that's not about WiFi, that's about either a bad ISP or a bad setup.
---
I play on WiFi and it's always \~30ms in classic beta, which is great.
---
Mage has portals, which not only get you around the world faster but can be sold for more cash. You can sell food too. You'd also be surprised how much you can kill in crap gear using roots an slows, mainly with frost spec.
---
But it is in the Beta, right?  Esfrand was testing this and it works in some form.  You have to stand from sitting right as you are being hit.  That way it's batched that you still take a crit but are standing not sittingto make your procs go off.  I don't think I'm explaining it right but there is a video out about it working (kind of) in beta.
---
Still not even listed at Best Buy up here in 🇨🇦😞.
---
Ha! and I still click my abilities to this day, not that I've played any of the exp since Cata for more than a month.
---
I don't understand why so many people hate transmog so much. It's a completely harmless cosmetic-only feature that allows wearing useful armor that looks like the stuff you enjoyed. Same with having a bunch of mounts to collect..
---
Then upgrade them to 0.5 ;)
---
Even if Blizzard has the correct data, it’s not coming out properly due to bugs and glitches
---
Those bugs and glitches would never be found without comparing to private server numbers.
---
The reason private server numbers are a good benchmark is because an entire community of people have been watching old videos and backing out formulas for a decade.
---
Is that data perfect? Hell no. Is it the best we have and the gold standard benchmark to whether Classic is bugged or not? Absolutely.
---
Druids in vanilla are useful for healing as far as their utility goes. You could tank but it's not worth all the extra effort
---
Im super hyped for classic and wanted to play vanilla for years. Only thing stopping me being Id have to resort to illegal private servers to do so.
---
August 2005 - I enjoyed vanilla using internet that was a step above dial up, using a weird wifi chip I bought at wal mart for maybe $10. My mom’s dell ran the game at a solid 20fps if I zoomed in close enough. I raided through AQ40 up to C’thun and achieved rank 13 in pvp. I established a reputation for myself on the server as the best shadow priest around. 
---
Those were the best years of my life.
---
I was thinking of the Forbes interview, though I wasn't 100% sure if that was it, but he says it outright in this video, cool.  In my opinion, when someone in that position in a presentation says "may," they mean "will," but it doesn't even matter much here because of how lean this addon sounds.
---
I don't really know addon language, but I get the basic idea of it.  Even I understand that function &amp; event, so uh...wow, again, that's crazy to me it can function so lean like that.  I see what you mean now.  Well, that'll be funny to see them try to stop it, but I doubt they'll find it to be be worth their resources.
---
Btw, just curious, not trolling: Did DBM and Recount really exist back then?  I definitely remember CTRaid, like most people, and that BigWigs was just becoming a popular thing around 1.10 or 1.11, and I used Violation for a damage meter in TBC.  Now that I think about it, I guess I was a little bit oblivious about addons before TBC.
---
Warsong gulch will love you
---
Plenty

Thanks.Do you mean something like this :

---
mages can farm naked. Blizzard doesnt scale that much with gear. Hunters have a pet so they are ez mode.
---
People thought this was a bug?? Lmao
---
Definitely, because the guys who played actual vanilla AND pservers are less important than guys who played just vanilla
---
Yeah if you're in epics you can steamroll say scholo, but if you're not you'd better be careful as all hell.

---
&gt; I genuinely suspect our collective memory of hard dungeons comes from the higher level dungeons.
---
Yeah, my first time doing Deadmines my group didn't even have a tank. It was just 5 random people that wanted to do a quest. I didn't even know what an instance was at the time and got super confused when I couldn't see anyone else (and had to exit and re-enter a few times). We had no tank, no CC, and the huntard (me) rolled on a strength 2H axe, but we still killed VanCleef. I really doubt Deadmines was tuned to be very difficult.
---
Completely agree, not only was I a 15 year old in the top guild on the server I have been raiding at a higher level ever since. I am one of the greatest players ever to grace this game and the numbers don’t matter because Vanilla is easy either way, a couple of elites hitting harder does matter to me because of my superior kiting ability and skill, I will get 60 and clear all the content available the first week it is released, I can’t wait to make fun of vanilla casuals as I raid on both versions and dominate you and take your boyfriend and wives.

Added!
---
It's not that, it's that those of us who put in hundreds of hours to Vanilla don't really care to do that again and just want to chill the fuck out of have a big dose of nostalgia.
---
The virgin Min-Maxer very likely didn't play retail classic, only private servers and this "This is the real wow" 
---
The people who submit bug reports of stuff they think is broken in beta because it doesn't work like it used to on nosta? 1000000% never played Vanilla retail and are virgin min maxers
---
People bitching about challenging heroics was great
---
Well, we can see what *your* point is, that you never played original MC, you've never played against a fire mage in MC, and you just wanted to beat up on someone on a post that's over a month old.
---
But you kinda have a semi-decent day and just F1 that frostbolt, mmkay?
---
While I wouldn't say that I'd use the data from private servers as accurate information, it's a hell of a lot better than people saying "Well...I remember it from 2004!" That's just crazy.
---
P.S. I do think the private realms are fairly close-ish in many aspects.
---
Logged in day one, and everyone was asking this in /1 and /world.
---
We couldnt find a single person that wasnt there in vanilla wow.
---
Depends what your personal endgame is. But there is usually about 0-1 feral dps in raids and it all comes down to how much of a friend you are with the guild master. And don't get me wrong, I love druids and I play one. Gonna play it on Classic as well. Just not as dps. Maybe much later, if I'll get lucky with op gear. But it's still very unlikely.
---
i wonder what happens if 40 hunters all do this at the same time
---
Do you have to have an active WoW subscription to get in? I'd like a source please.
---
&gt;Edit, primarily for pve
---
Weird criteria, most people choose their race for PvP since having an edge there is a lot more important than PvE.
---
I got a friend to start playing the game by lying to him.
---
I told him that when you get to max level you can train flying mounts (you have to tame them, feed them and such). You could also hatch them from eggs. He would NOT have played the game if not for this feature.
---
Needless to say we still played together for 3 expansions, him quitting after wrath.
---
Thats cool !
---
You build teamwork by pushing higher keys. There is a timer, if you beat it you get a higher level key (+1 to +3 depending on how fast), which has better/more loot. The dungeons get harder, and have additional mechanics, the higher your key goes. 
---
I was spending hours in +10 keys at the beginning of BFA for example, super hard but rewarding. Like I said the content is still there (and at a much higher level), it's just separate from the regular dungeons.
---
Gotta jump down the left side of the bridge bud
---
Yeah, he literally said he doesn't remember **how they both were programmed exactly**, and then reiterates that despite that, **it was not intended for SoR to replace SotC.**
---
Oh man, watching you squirm on this point is the best.
---
Easy?  Technically.
---
Mind-numbing?  Absolutely.
---
That rep grind was the absolute worst, because no one knew at first to save their tokens until scholo/strat runs no longer gave rep, which meant even more runs.
---
And even at that, most people on these forums have expressed sentiments of not wanting to run a dungeon more than they need to for quests.
---
The players who arent grinding scholo for gear are the same players who are not going to grind rep for AD.  And you can be damn sure that's a vast majority.
---
Yes you do, that’s been confirmed multiple times
---
Trinket swapping was certainly a thing. Was removed sometime after zg—cause I recall zhc, talisman, PvP trinket, reflectors all being swapped out by the mage on my premade team. 
---
Armor swapping was removed like 2 weeks prior to launch.
---
Even if Blizzard has the correct data it’s not coming out properly due to bugs and glitches
---
Many of those bugs and glitches would never be found without comparing to private server numbers.
---
Is that data perfect? No. But the margin of error is closer to 5% than it is 50% people act like.
---
People dismissing pserver data because it’s not perfect don’t realize that it’s 95% close and it’s even more accurate than Beta because of the glitches with damage dealing on Beta.
---
That makes pserver data, at this point, the best resource to compare Beta to.
---
I wouldn't run that without a pally or bear tank lol
---
Why Peggle?
---
Some people even wanted flying mount on lvl1 lol...
---
I was going to try and do something like this as well but didn't have anywhere to host it. Thanks!
---
That's why I'm asking, I didn't know
---
you think he had toughness? he was running around in loch modan with a 2hander before they went to deadmines. it's possible he respec'd for deadmines but i would doubt it? i think that 58% mitigation would be really high for anyone tanking deadmines. maybe if he had rings/helmet, but i haven't seen any of those and don't remember seeing them before SM. even shoulders are rare, but i think someone gifted him shoulders prior to doing deadmines.
---
Mhh i see thank you but i dont know How to Heal or tank :/
---
Creepy shit right here. Cringeeee
---
As someone who raided up to BWL / AQ 20 as warrior in vanilla, I can concur that elites should be spanking harder. Being able to solo an elite (at least as a warrior) around your level was practically non-existent unless you had wayS to cheese (Recklessness, retaliation, pots, terrain, etc.). Remember even at 60, soloing dungeons wasn't super common above, say, SM, because of pack sizes, time to clear, etc. 
---
(Please remember this is from the viewpoint of warrior, I realize other classes were way better at doing this stuff than us)
---
Years of Dungeon Finder and LFR has conditioned people to behave poorly.
---
Any class that can heal will be forced to heal in vanilla end of story.
---
Not WoW but my friend told me that in Fable if you beat the game with every alignment/class combination, Good/Evil Strength/Magic/Guile, you could start a new game in the Old World. I got about halfway, beating the game three or four times, before getting the feeling that this is a lot of work just to unlock a secret area.
---
Do we have to run all of the posts by you to make sure you're OK with them?
---
Someone in that thread said that change was made around 1.10 in vanilla. The problem with poly is it resets the mobs health to 100% when broken. It was recently used on private servers to HEAVILY greef players farming mobs.
---
Perfect thanks, I hadn't considered selling portals/food (and I guess having it traded to my priest).
---
I have, started promising enough then you realize there are strategies built around ugly exploits like the ret /sit macro. The droprates were bonkers on mine but I don't want to generalize in doubt
---
Curse of elements, banish, AND shadow bolt.
---
Too bad. This sub has turned into retail boise hopping on the hype bandwagon.
---
I will see to it that Helcular is raised form the dead and slaughters South Shore!
---
the day my guild got TF was the exact same day they opened up server transfers, and he logged out left the server after he looted it :)
---
You can feral and moonkin in pvp very well, as well as 5mans once you get some gear. You probably won't be raiding as dps unless your guild really likes you or just needs a warm body.  
---
That said, when your raid REALLY outgears something like molten core, moonkin can actually be viable if you're speed killing bosses. Otherwise you cast like 4 spells and you're oom.
---
They have a 1.12 reference server and client running right now that they're using to check their work.
---
I was being a bit tongue in cheek because a bunch of those Elitist Jerk folk ended up working on the game.
---

Your "die hard" vanilla fan base is nothing but private server players and we know those are wrong mostly. They have chosen accounts from 2004-2006 this is a beta test it's a tease to hype us up they have a fucking reference client for christ sakes they don't need us to tell shots wrong or right they could do it all internally if they really wanted to
---
We'd go back in time. If everyone on beta got together and did it at once, we could go back to 2005 and play Vanilla for real
---
Ahh I had no idea, I'd imagined it needed MC gear at least. I guess I'll be levelling a mage then!
---
Try some videos from Skarm Tank on youtube. He has very nice content on War / Druid tanking.
---
Maybe you'll find it interesting :\]
---
Shouldn't that be 0.04%? not 0.4
---
&gt; I do not see any current retail heroic quality guild steamrolling anything past MC.
---
Are you kidding me? Vanilla raiding is easier than LFR.
---
The night elf priest version of this meme is better
---
Can you link the blue post? Can't find it :/
---
Why don’t people understand that dismissing concerns will just result in a worse/unauthentic experience for them? Blizzard is running a beta for this exact reason, its purpose is not for you to report everything is fine.
---
Thank you !!
---
No, that’s actually not how property rights work.
---
You can’t sell something to someone, wait for them to get home and install it on their computer and then tell them “oh, it’s just a lease”.  
---
A lease would require that I sign a document stating I accept the terms of the lease, BEFORE I receive the product.
---
EULA terms are not legally binding, by clicking “accept” you are not agreeing to accept those terms in a legal or enforceable way.
---
I'd actually argue that a Druid tank is the best tank for 5 mans. Swipe makes holding aggro on 3 mobs the easiest thing in the world, and the advantages of Shield Wall or anything like that aren't really an issue in 5 mans.
---
What troggs? Which video are you talking about? If you mean RFC troggs, wouldn't it only make sense that they deal less damage than BFD mobs?
---
I don't think it's going to have that much importance in PVE to be honest. I also use it on retail because I want to track some abilities from boss, or some spells from my characters, but let's be honest, I don't see any fight or class (as far as my memory goes) that would benefit that much from Weakauras compare to someone that doesn't have it.
---
Let people that wish it play with it, it won't matter much :)
---
I don't know if I want to get in for just a day or two though. :(
---
No way. Frost Mage beats every class.
---
Have you considered the idea that you may be overanalysing it? Which is more likely: that it's an nth dimensional super secret dig at the autistic, or a joke about spreadsheet warriors?
---
This gave me secondhand rage. I can't decide if it's the best explanation for users ever written or literally torture.
---
Legalities aside, pserver experiences are fantastic and many people consider them more fun than actual vanilla because of how busy and active the servers are. 
---
Try one out, walk into stormwind or org and get ready to shit your pants!
---
Also people in here will shit on pserver data but the fact is pservers have better numbers than Beta right now because of Betas glitches.
---
I see gonna learn to tank or heal haha
---
the random guild i joined on the pve server is seemingly all boomer tier people who say they played closed beta/launch so i'm not too sure about that
---
Thats not really what the problem theyre fixing is. Poly restets a mobs hp to 100% when it breaks. So a mage not in a group with you or on the other faction could let you get a mob low then sheep it so its health resets just to fuck with you.
---
Yeah, some bosses were easy to solo. Rogues could solo the guy who dropped the shanker in BRD and the wolf for some boots in LBRS.
---
I have decided (based on nothing) that invites only go out every even hour, so I check then. It's a lot more manageable
---
He's not gonna fall for that.
---
Once he kills 600 and gets the weapon he'll know you were bullshitting him.
---
Did this only occur while they were in an instanced dungeon?
---
It must be a bug that only occurs within server instances.. otherwise everyone on the server would lag whenever a pet somewhere was called in lol.
---
How about you smell my feet? they're ripe. 10$ feet pics. Join my feet pic guild at www.FeetForHorde.com
---
My only regret is that it won't have the hilariously... suggestive animation from TBC
---
Then treat them like any other member of the workforce and not like some kind of demi-god that you worship and fawn over. You people put them on a pedestal and it's part of the reason they ooze toxicity and egotism.
---
Ashkandi isn't a pve weapon for any other class.
---
&gt; it does not effect your chances for a beta opt-in  
---
is that what you are referring to?  
---
because all that means is anyone can opt-in.
---
And only to be able to level to 5
---
These people are the antivaxxers of classic wow.
---
Milhouse is not a meme
---
wat, this is a good post.
---
It was worth a try.
---
I'm pretty sure the polymoeph tap thing was in vanilla, I remembet you could do it early but I believe it changed in the later patches. Been a decade and a half tho
---
&gt; It's really common
---
Yeah I see it all the time /s
---
I realize it’s very easy to dismiss pserver data as “guesswork” but that doesn’t do justice to how many community members spent hours upon hours watching old videos to ensure the formulas are correct. 
---
Pserver numbers are so close to reality and people in here dismiss them with a wave of a hand because their not 100% perfect.
---
Yet there are things they have missed even with their reference client. Also, nice assumptions.
---
Why play?
---
Oh man, I loved these sets. And dont forget about dungeon sets 2! You had to obtain du geon set 1 pieces and then you did long ass quest lines to upgrade those pieces. It was actually alot of fun and rewarding to go after these pieces.
---
How about the guy who dual-boxed accounts and set up a "toll" at the ships traveling between continents? Theres a forum post somewhere with his legendary tales, absolutely hilarious read.
---
Basically he RP'd the captain or somethin, and charged a toll to get on the ship. If you didn't pay, his alt on the other faction (2nd account) would (I think!) mind-control you and make you jump into the water way far out where you'd die of fatigue and waste a bunch of time.
---
Dude got so much hate whispers.
---
My internet ain't good enough for twitch without constant buffering and skips, so this subreddit is all I have :(
---
I fondly remember tanking SM Cath with my Whirlwind Axe. Its possible if your groups damage is high enough
---
How triggered are you right now
---
It's 4-6 PDT which is -7 GMT right now
---
There are so many absurd niches various professions can fill. You should look into cornering a market with relatively little competition. Whether that be farming for rare recipes, standing outside quest givers who require crafted trade goods (like mithril tubes or frost oil), or farming materials that will be in demand for raiders (elemental earth, grave moss, etc.).
---
I just really want the bottom right one full screen. Stv is gorgeous
---
No, someone noticed it was wrong by comparing it to one of Joana's leveling videos, which was actual vanilla.
---
oh my god thank you for this. I knew there was SOMETHING for skinning/mining/herb but for the life of me I couldn't remember whether it was an item that gave the bonus or an enchant.
---
But you aren't "dpsing" you're using a feral-resto build for flag running and surviving.
---
Flag running is a different build and gear set than raid dps'ing
---
Ya I agree. The private server have been a work in progress but they are a pretty good approximation of the feel of vanilla.
---
Exactly this. Maybe the dmg isn’t off, maybe the armor formula is broken, or something else. It doesn’t take much to screw with math equations. 
---
Either way it needs to be reported so Blizz can look into what it is.
---
Flight paths were designed as a way to view the world, acting as a tour and mode of transportation
---
You absolutely didn't need to sheep mobs. I played a mage from the originally beta all the way to the end of BC pretty religiously. We often did anyway just because it made it that much easier, but groups being what they were, I was often at the mercy of hunters or druids putting dots on my CC target and just saying fuck it the rest of the instance. CC only became necessary in the later dungeons.
---
I would need a hug after that.
---
How is it going to predict tho? 
---
Healing spells for most classes in classic are 2.5s if you start casting the bare minimum heal 2.5s later tank could have taken a hit or two making that piddly little heal inneffective, requiring multiple casts. If you were cancel casting a larger heal, you could top him off and go back into 5sr a whole cast earlier.
---
Bears can tank fine in fact they are easier of geared correctly for 5 mans but they will also take more dmg. Can’t comment on paladins.
---
he didn't confirm that you'd have better chances in 2005
---

Rogues with point spent into sub can pick pocket just fine, as you don't actually fight anything. 
---
Just get the few items that improve stealth and go to town pickpocketing.
---
What? How is that not common sense? My class needs X skills to improve - this gear is an improvement to those X skills. Does someone else need this way more? No? Hit need. Common sense.
---
what u mean fixed? its intended and makes sense.

&gt;  So a mafia could just let the guy kill it and then sap him/kill him and take the devilsuar leather?
---
Or just gank him. This is a problem when both are same faction lol.
---
Casual? 45 minute baron and Lord Valthalak were probably harder than any raiding content I saw, not to mention the large amounts of gold and crafted items you needed. :P
---
But do you have a phone?
---
Each private server has different bugs. Oddly enough somebody one a raid boss on one of them it was so buggy and broken... Oh wait that was actual retail

---
It was definitely my most hated instance to tank as a warrior, and I would only run if it was the daily and it was with my guild. We once did it without any reliable CC (I think just a hunter frost trap) and it was probably the most challenge I ever had in a dungeon.
---
I was having trouble picking between the two as well. For me it came down to mobility, I hate not having some sort of movement ability and warlocks have 0. I also enjoy the auto shot weaving play style that hunter offers.
---
&gt; and the person with lowest MS gets the skin. This is not fair, and should be fixed.
---
But it's fair that the same person with lower MS gets the initial tag?
---
No they fixed that back then a few weeks after.
---
Kinda glad really. I'm EU but I now live in NA, lost my account along the way and couldn't merge it with my new one for one reason or another.
---
Would hate to be discounted from that.
---
I don't see why it wouldn't be allowed. Power Auras existed in classic, it was a little more primitive than weakauras but it essentially did the same thing.
---
He's clearly wearing shoulders in the video, but I don't know which ones. You can only have a handful of helmets at level 19, mostly engineering goggles and some cloth helmets, and I don't think he had either.
---
He doesn't need to hit 58% mitigation, and almost certainly can't either. But it's entirely possible for him to have 40-45% mitigation, which will make the numbers there plausible. I'm not saying there definitely can't be bug there, but I'm saying that getting hit for about 80 by the boss is not a clear sign of there being a bug.
---
Based on this, if we assume that there has to be a bug, then I would say that it's probably something similar to the totem bug from earlier, perhaps related to Devotion Aura. The extra 160 armor from Devotion Aura would take this from "it's possible in theory" to "this is probably what happened".
---
So to get Wrath... I got to play classic and wrath private server at the same time? I wouldn’t go back to one ever again. But thank you all of you who do/did and brought all the attention! You guys are the real heroes.
---
Shaman can tank low lvl content in classic
---
This resonates with me more than it should.
---
I wanna know too. PM me if someone told you ?
---
My UI was hot garbage, I’m glad ElvUi is porting the UI for classic.
---
Of course not. They know that they have the correct values on their reference client and they've said multiple times that they intend to stay 100% true to the original game - at least as best as they can.
---
[How to play a druid in MC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4NbR6ZP4IM)
---
I feel like they do. I think it depends on the difference in defense and weapon skill. But I'm not positive.
---
You’re right. 
---
I feel like there are a lot of new retail people on this sub who think pservers were simply guesswork and not the result of decades of work by the community to tirelessly recreate accurate numbers from evidence video sources.
---
Pserver community has done so much work that is resulting in more bugs being caught in this beta, but this sub acts like pserver data is just random. So weird
---
Jack of all trades, master of none.
---
Tell me about it. Make one very transparent meme and it's being misinterpreted so wildly it's a laugh riot.
---
Okay, first the basics: a prefix is a folder containing the simulated Windows, you can consider it as a Windows installation. Normally, everything is in the prefix .wine - if your username is jheddsy, this prefix will be located at /home/jheddsy/.wine
---
With this structure you can separate games and apps in different environments. I've set up a new prefix like this:
---
WINEPREFIX=/home/myusername/.wine-bnet winecfg
---
Then I've moved the WoW files into the program files folder. It is important to run games in the correct prefix. Instead of
---
wine WoW.exe
---
you would run it similar to this:
---
WINEPREFIX=/home/myusername/.wine-bnet wine WoW.exe

We are a semi-hardcore raiding and PvP guild planning on weekend raiding, world PvP, battleground premades, and twinking (29 bracket). Our guild is primarily 30+ adults who have played various games together going back to vanilla and TBC. 
---
Raids: Saturday and Sunday 3pm to 7pm EST / 12pm to 4 pm PST (very likely we won't need this much time once we get some gear until AQ). Optional weeknight raids for 3 day reset content may also be planned. 
---
Loot: Loot Council consisting of 2 officers and 3 rotating positions filled by raiders. 20 man content and PvP items will be /roll. 
---
Expectations: We want to complete raid content efficiently to not waste people's time. We expect raiders to be on time with appropriate consumables in a PvE raiding spec. We would like to start raiding 1.5-2 months after launch. 
---
Recruiting: We are currently recruiting all classes/roles. We are looking for people interested in any or all of our guild activities, as well as more casual players just looking for some people to run dungeons and bgs with. 
---
If you are interested please contact us on discord.

see i watched the deadmines run he did and i remember it on pservers being harder.  i truly think these servers lacked some boss or mob mechanics and instead just buffed the damage and hp to make up for it.  also artificial difficulty because mob aggro is completly fucked on private servers, so clearing the boat is a massive pain in the ass.
---
Druids earn only 78% of the damage that a rogue gets.

I still have nightmares trying to get the warrior boots (the last piece I needed!) off that optional boss in Scholo that you had to do a long quest chain to even get the item to summon...
---

---
Hogger
---
Careful now, you'll get a complex.
---
You think it's weird that people that play long running series lie about when they started playing?
---
As others have said, Blizzard balanced the game (intentionally or not) in such a way that promotes it. It's more efficient in retail to just pull the entire instance and AoE them, even if you wipe, it's probably still faster than if you pulled properly. The worst part though is how since it's possible with well geared and skilled people using burst heals and some forms of CC/heavy burst AoE, they think every group can do it and actually get mad if they can't and try to kick people or ragequit. That is when it becomes an issue.
---
Classic is gonna be a fucking nightmare in the ~20s. Like I said, it's understandable and Blizzard is at fault, but it's still horrible to deal with, and we are going to have to deal with these same people in Classic until around level 20 when they quit. I'm just going to copy "This is Classic, not retail. You have to try and pull one enemy at a time and CC any extras." to paste once in every dungeon when the tank inevitably fucks up and then say nothing else the rest of the dungeon to avoid conflict. They will either learn or quit, but it's not like there was ever a point in Vanilla where we didn't have these tanks, so it's not like it will be new.
---
I pref undead for warlock, I don't want the 25% stun resist, WotF is just as good for a caster imo. 
---
The ability cannibalism is amazing for lvling and blood fury does nothing for a lock iirc. 
---
Both the axe skill and longer breath are useless for locks
---
Basically I rate Cannibalism+WotF over 25% stun resist but thats just opinion
---
Make a FEMALE dwarf priest then haha
---
I feel like dwarf priest doesn't really fit with "min-maxing", it's such a massive advantage over any other priest that it's basically a no-brainer to pick it.
---
Think it’s 15% man
---
The problem with this theory is that private server data is coming off of videos and combing old resources for formulas etc. It's probably closer to 90% accurate than the 95 figure you're referring to. The best resource to compare beta to is the legacy 1.12 internal server that Blizz has in their own datacenter since it's using the actual data restored from a database backup. Most of the issues being found right now are more likely to be caused by the database conversion process in addition to marrying that converted data to the modern wow engine. There are going to be inconsistencies, but these will be fleshed out when blizz compares the beta data to the 1.12 2006 era server they have.
---
It appears in the launcher.
---
/gasp! I shall see your risen dead and raise you exorcism! BRING OUT YOUR DEAD!
---
Very nice 👍🏻
---
Again, you can't know that without having the original database. If you somehow know the exact values of every mob, then please do tell and put this entire discussion to rest.
---
At this point I think you're a troll. They didn't know they had an untouched one *until they checked* and they've been working from that for almost 2 years. What in the actual fuck lmao.
---
Lol.
---

The Guy she tells you not to worry about VS You in the back. 
---
Are you going for a TF this time around? :D
---
That was goddamn hilarious.
---
i don't know, i will say that tanking the dungeon was difficult, and van cleef dumpstered me with \~20% mitigation and a shield. i can't imagine what tanking would involve if everything was doing 2x damage. tanking 2-3 mobs required constant heals from my healer. maybe we just needed to do more cc'ing.
---
Pretty accurate description. Logic is completely lost on these people.
---
It's in the terms of service, you know,  what no one obviously reads
---
If you were on Argent Dawn, I remember you from somewhere...
---
A ring with Defense obviously isnt bis for rogues so hardly the same thing.
---
Fucking Mario..
---
I used the word fixed merely as a synonym for changed.  It was not meant as a subtle or deep reflection on the validity of mechanics of Vanilla. 
---
Sorry I asked in the first place.
---
I mean Fear Ward AND Desperate Prayer, where do i sign up?
---
Can't really do anything against that can we?
---
But that's not always the case though. If one player is there first and tags the devilsaur, and then the 2nd player comes up to steal the skin, then you are just further enforcing the low MS requirements. 
---
It's not a perfect fix, but it is something, and it not only makes devilsaur more fair, but prevents griefing.
---
No, you're right. There's nothing special about WeakAuras. It's simply pretty much "complete" in terms of what such an addon should provide, but others have always existed. It's not the first thread of someone not realizing that addons in vanilla were just as powerful - if not even more powerful. But as the game was not as old, way less people created addons of such a level and usability was sometimes a nightmare - but power wasn't.
---
They even got the pineapple correct on the Zepps wings.
---
This was absolutely a thing in Vanilla. The trick was to /cancelform (or whatever it was) first, since that didn't count as casting anything and didn't start the GCD, then you could immediately do anything else off the GCD that required you to be out of form, then you could go right back into a form. 
---
True, later on they added the ability to autoleave form when you cast something that you couldn't do in a form, but you could always macro past that.
---
And FYI, if you think druids aren't viable, I have news for you: With farmable PVP gear, our druid was tanking in vanilla MC/BWL/AQ. And PVP? They're \*beasts\* at objective PVP. Stealth and sprint like rogues, but tough-as-shit when they're focused. And unrootable. They're not going to get all the kills. They win objectives.
---
You mean crushing blows? Glancing blows from you and crushing blows onto you happen when the monster is higher level than you based on your weapon skill and your defense skill, respectively.
---
CAREFUL NED, CAREFUL NOW

---
Most people take skinning for the extra cash after every beast kill and for your devilsaur gear at lvl 60. You then dump it to pick up engineering and mining or herb/alch
---
ew troll rogue 
---
undead is masterrace for rogue and locks
---
It sure is. I had this experience on a Pserver a year ago and I'm still salty about night elf hunters sitting in stealth on top of dead devilsaurs just trying to steal others skins.
---
I'm very #NoChanges in general, but yeah, I would
---
screw your guild play what you want
---
This is the simplest possible addon
---
It takes info from somewhere and displays it on the screen
---
If you are banning "Getting info from somewhere and displaying it on the screen", you are banning all addons
---
Priests were special in that each race got their own race specific spells. Dwarf had good spells in Fear Ward + Desperate Prayer.
---
Gnomes are Master race dont @ me.
---
I'd take the gathering profession that's going to match up with whatever crafting prof you're eventually going to switch to. If you're a warrior and you plan on taking BS at 60, take mining instead of herbalism and drop skinning at 60.
---
If the original game was bugged in this way, then we wouldn't know the difference because we would have played it this way.
---
Lmao Jesus you weren’t kidding
---
Ban for what? For communicating via bnet accounts?
---
Yes having 1 sligthly weaker warlock give imp buff is the only reason you want a SM warlock.
---
Though tbh the differences is rather small so if you ask nicely you will probably be allowed to have more than 1 SM warlock.
---
I was surprised while watching asmondgold only take about 25-30 damage from those goblins.
---
Actually I find the gold standard is old youtube videos, not private server data.
---
Your reputation will matter more in Classic than RIO does in Retail. 
---
There are going to be a lot of people who find that out the hard way in 3 months. Back in Classic entire guilds fell apart over 1 item being ninjad.
---
It wasn't a coincidence that the 90% of the time the most geared people and best players in Classic were also the nicest and most reliable team players. It was because if you were not you simply wouldn't get invited to groups or get good applicants to yours and finding a home in a guild with a bad attitude just didn't happen. Most serious guilds wouldn't even consider young teenage applicants because they were usually too immature to play well with others regarding loot. 
---
Reputation was everything. Destroying that for an item or two is playing the short game by losing the long game.
---
Ah, isn't that pretty much what the undead have on horde side?  "Will of the Forsaken"? or something if I recall.
---
I feel like most of my personal choices are usually based off of Warcraft 3 classes, it just feels right.
---
I might try for it if I can get the bindings.
---
Orcs also have pet damage bonus, that is why I listed it over Undead.
---
For blacksmithing you kinda need to go above and beyond to get the mats needed to keep up with your lvl, slightly less so with LW. The gear you can get while lvl can be pretty helpful, and uou can still make loads of cash selling the things you have made, or get ench mats from them by sending greens to a disenchanter. Their are multiple patterns while lvling skinning that will increase the value of each skin, ie 10 light leather might sell for 50c but an item made with 10 leather might sell for 80c to a vendor. 
---
I rate tailoring very high as a proff to lvl with a clothie, mats come in as you level and you usually have enough.
---
Check your local gamestop in person, or give em a call. Some people had luck doing that.
---
&gt;Excuse me fellas, but this would not be happening if it wasn't for Vanilla private servers, mainly Nostalrius, and that is a fact.
---
If it is a fact then it should be easy to provide evidence. Do you have any quotes from Blizzard employees or anything like that  to back up your statement? How did you determine that this is a "fact" and not a theory or opinion?
---
We don't know how well dungeon farming will work yet.  How viable BRD pickpocket runs with be. How viable DM lasher farming will be (since we learned you can't reset and teleport to the front of the dungeon, you'll have to die to get to the front and run back so time consuming). 
---
Rogue pickpocketing though wont require any gear, nor would farming the bloodvine in ZG when that comes out (though you'll need the scythe to do that and idk if you'll get that with a rogue in greens unless you're carried). 
---
You could also just go Hunter and just grind mobs the old fashion way. But if you're planning to have no gear on a PVP server, you probably don't want to just be out in the world so something more instance locked might be your best bet.
---
Or you could gear up your alt and make your farming job easier :)
---
The only time I saw that was outside the instance was when they left the instance to go to the cave area outside and it worked there. I was unable to see if it happened outside that non-instanced cave, however.
---
yes I am! I pay for it you noob OP
---
So we shouldn’t have access to a particular addon because you don’t want to wonder if you should make weak auras? That doesn’t make sense to me. A weak aura is just making a notification of something more apparent and there was plenty of that in vanilla
---
Our group used to run this with me as the tank, another warrior dps, a shaman dps, a priest healer and a warlock dps. It was definitely one of the hardest dungeons to tank. I think the other hard one further down the patch line was heroic Magisters Terrace if I remember correctly.
---
oh man... im so excited for this lol
---
I won't say for sure that it was necessary in the early dungeons. I never actually ran classic Wailing Caverns or Ragefire (at level) because I didn't know they existed until I out leveled them. But everything else I did.
---
But by the time we were in scarlet monastery I remember having to think about CC in group composition when forming, with mages being the best choice to bring.
---
So like I said, I will have a better idea once the cap gets increased. But things definitely look and feel off, but I'm willing to accept my memory isn't perfect.
---

It will be removed

pretty sure when you crit you lose all mitigation, including defense, meaning there was a high chance of getting crit. BUT if i also remember a post from the other day that linked to a blue, being crit while sat down will NOT give the benefit of any skills that rely on being crit to activate,

It existed in 1.12 as well, not only private servers. [Tests show it's still there in the Beta.](https://clips.twitch.tv/CrepuscularAnimatedCobblerSeemsGood)
---
It is what made it great. I haven't been a subscriber for so long.... lol. Hopefull we shall meet on the battlefields. Be looking out for a pimped out pally named Profark! lol
---
Don’t forget about the Shaman enhancement set from Ahn Quiraj!
---
Can't wait to level to 5!
---
Nah just make it exactly how it was in vanilla.
---
Youll be fine! Enjoy
---
This is true and honestly probably fine for 90% of raid guilds etc. 
---
But god damn is it funny to see an arms warrior get insta kicked from the raid when that MS debuff pops up lol.
---
This post feels more like some kind of a weird flex rather than asking for real info which has been verified already
---
That's fair and I think that's a reason to consider the feedback born from private server players with more scrutiny--but not a reason to throw it out entirely.
---
Just wondering, what is the percent of people that do what we both just said, grind mobs and move on to the next quest hub? Even if it was 50%, there's still a huge amount of people who are gonna have a terrible experience that can significantly harm the reception of the game. 
---
I actually would've preferred sharding 1-20 zones than layering because I don't think the solutions of layering outweigh the the positives you gain with sharding.
---
This thread is going places
---
Im so glad that Dwarves are so good for priests.
---
It took me quite a few years before i really started playing Dwarves on live, but they just feel so right.
---
You don’t need to level as prot man. You can take every dungeon just fine as any spec all the way up to 60
---
&gt; Heroics have not been difficult at any time since then
---
I guess WoD just never happened.
---
Not me, I'm just having fun lol
---
depends, on average yes. i have cleared uldir hc/some mythic and all vanilla on pserver
---
&gt;  I hope the gogogogogogogo people stay there!
---
Funny - as someone who has has raided on private servers as well as currently raids in a progression guild on retail I see a lot more "gogogogogogo" in raids on private servers and a hell of a lot more speedruns on private servers.
---
The private server database damage range is wrong.
---
I just came here to point out that you're an idiot, I wasn't part of these comments.
---
&gt; Kevin Jordan: It was not intended that Seal of Rightousness be the proccing Seal over SotC.
---
The hardest part about leveling a priest on a fresh server is getting your wand asap. Tailoring/enxhanting will get you there. Conversely, you could wait for other people to make them and grab 2 gathering pros (skinning + mine/herb)
---
Note: Tailoring will provide some good gear later on and you can drop it after crafting the pieces you want.
---
Hunter are considered top 3 on highest skill cap pvp classes by those who care way too much about the game,  they are by no means a "retard class". If that is what you are looking for, take a look at paladin, the class is literally made for bad players, like LITERALLY blizzard had a presentation back in 2006 where they showed paladin as a class "that is easy to pick up by new players).
---
right?
---
I’ve been on all lists as I’ve gotten access to Alphas/Beta in the first wave with the exception of Classic. Wonder if Classic is separate from the WoW list...
---
yea i mean i know that now. back in the day i was super serious tho
---
The fact that you even still have this screenshot makes me really hope you get it after all these years. I wish you the best of luck!
---
Please use the search function, this thread pop's up 30 times a day.
---
the way weakaura works is nothing new, the whole pulling info from other areas of the game, as such cant see any reason to not allow it, compared to some of the addons we had in classic weakaura is nothing, anyone remember the old decursive where you just clicked one button and it targeted someone that was cursed and cast remove curse? that shit was OP
---
Sounds like people will have a blast playing with you
---
Why'd you change orcs into Night elves?
---
&gt; I do not know the extent of the changes they'll be making for classic -  but without major reforms for hunter, it would be advisable to pick  anything else. 
---
They won't be making any class changes.
---
It was imbalanced in classic.  That is why you're going to see a ton of mages and rogues on day one. Way more so than in vanilla.
---
I'm drinking the white monster am I a boomer?

Mining + engineer for pvp. If playing casual will give you the advantage if your gear isn’t super good.
---
Absolutely man, always looking to pick up more Shaman, I'll be honest, vanilla isn't that hard, and if you are a good gamer in general you will pick it up extremely fast. Hit the discord link and we can get you integrated in.
---
Too bad nobody is going to wear them, because pretty much all pieces suck ass.
---
Have you actually played on private servers? A good chunk of dungeons I have run involve minimal interaction between players and the exact same "go fast or gtfo" mentality.
---
Yes...because they gave in to the casuals....dumbing the game down. Blizzard isn't the one who pushed us in to that....the players led Blizzard to that change.
---
I'm doing my part. Are you?
---
just trying to warn people so they don't level a nelf priest to 60 and then discover that they can't easily get into raids cause they don't have fear ward
---
but sry just trying to be helpful
---
I guess I'll move back to my mom's basement.
---
I'm planning on remaking my old main who was a dwarf priest. Had no idea they were that good back then. I'm going for the nostalgia but I'll look like a tryhard for everyone else :/
---
I have used titan bar since vanilla. No intent on switching it out.
---
&gt; Fury's a joke
---
you're not just wrong, you're also stupid
---
Are we talking dungeons and quests or are we talking Raids. There is a huge difference in viability.
---
I assume dungeons only since you said dungeon. In that case almost anything can go to 5 mans. So yes you have a chance of being invited to 5 man dungeons.
---
Imagine playing gnome  
---
 so people cant target you

I started in 2004, the receipt is still in the box and I can prove it, but I don't have an invite. The only people I know who are in it (that didn't get in through some media/employee/etc thing) did start in 2004.

&gt; Next up: can mobs that you've tagged by mind controlled by people outside of your group? That was another common grief tactic on private servers.

Mind control and Enslave Demon could not be used on tapped targets after Patch 1.2.

i’m getting a 2Her and running straight to Gurubashi
---
&gt; They are meant to be druids of the fang, surprisingly few images of them floating around though
---
Hell no. Druids are very strong tanks early on, and for paladins, I think they need a bit of time to get going if I'm not mistaken so level 18 might be too early, but other than that, you will do just fine.
---
The whole paladin/druid can't tank shit is mainly just about raids.
---
Forgot about that one, what is the %?

Really good for lvling I bet, but most locks go DS/Ruin for raid

Really good thoughts here in my opinion. It may be possible, though, I don't think asmongold was spect into tanking. Additionally, you quoted me out of context I think. I'm not going to 5500 comments to find it, but I believe I was talking about ads doing 20% of their damage, not Rhahk,zor.
---
But the argument is that Classic is undertuned compared to Private Servers, not overtuned
---
yes i think to have fun is the right thing
---
I've been a private server player for more than 7 years now.  
---
It doesn't change the fact that PServers are obviously wrong on a lot of topics.  
---
So yeah, thanks PServers, without them we wouldn't be here today. But they're not the Bible.
---
“When you’re not entitled to a Classic invite.”
---
There, I fixed it for you.
---
I think this is just a case of Blizzard claiming it worked a certain way on their reference client so they sneak a change into the Vanilla aimed at stopping griefers.
---
Im not a fan.
---
I've been using heirloom gear since it came out because I'm all about efficiency and there's no point in leveling slower if you don't enjoy leveling. This means the entirety of my leveling since heirlooms have come out have been in this gear, so when it comes to Shadowcraft, Elements, Dreadmist and Valour specifically, I am pretty sick of looking at the fucking things.
---
That being said, I'm probably going to play ~~Food Dispenser 2000~~ Mage and can just get the Magisters set instead. It's not a big deal or anything, and I would end up using the Dreadmist if I had to, but it's certainly not something I am excited about. I'm looking forward to raid tiers though. While I did collect them in retail for the sake of it, actually earning and using them will be very nice.
---
Most of the popular wow streamers minus Asmon are rank 1 arena players, they know what they are getting into and I am sure welcome the wpvp while leveling.
---
Huntards
---
Frost bolt/Nova will have the same effect 90%+ of the time
---
in terms of lore a 'lvl 5 or so' epic weapon doesnt make sense
---
Hi, /u/misterrpg
---
play the race you wanna play... and most of all dont play the race you DONT wanna play!
---
The whole "everyone was a noob" thing feels off to me though. Like, in some cases, people were *better* than Asmongold in that SFK run. Good players would use sheep, shackle, kiting, like Asmon's grp never did. Was the best way to play better really just not using CC all along?
---
Sure it is....bud.
---
I have no clue what he's saying, aside from "shit" and " Mrglmrglmrgl!"
---
But the fact that someone would ramble on about Murlocs, for four minutes made my day.
---
&gt;that would be harder than making a new retail expansion or even a new game. If the goal is to bring more players, i highly doubt they can simply ADD on top of vanilla without making it impossible for semi-casual player to achieve anything. You literally cannot endlessly add without eventually hitting a point of no return.
---
I agree in that it would be harder, but I think with a cautious and measured approach that new content can be added in such a way that the old content isn't invalidated and made entirely worthless in a short period of time. Maintain the process of attuning to new raids and dungeons, make sure they aren't added too frequently, and make sure the new content doesn't add too much new power at any one time.
---
Yes, there would definitely be that eventuality where one day the old content isn't quite the same as it was before. The game is divergent from vanilla at that point... but I don't think that's inherently a bad thing if the game is designed thoughtfully. Maybe we shouldn't trust the players to suggest and/or poll new content and maybe we shouldn't trust the developers to implement new engaging content that maintains the spirit of the game... but I don't think we should be skeptical and resistant forever.
---
For now I think the focus should 100% be on creating the best, most accurate, and most engaging Classic experience there can be. I don't think the idea of new content should be thrown off the table. I also agree that splintering the community across different servers for different points in time for the game would be a bad idea for sustainability. If the game remains the same forever for people who love the Classic experience, I wouldn't be upset.
---
Got it so you can still get crit u just can’t get the benefits of let’s say the eye for an eye talent that gives u a chance to deal a percent of the damage you were crit for
---
Using the same damn keyboard we played with the first time around.
---
Let me introduce you to r/escapefromtarkov
---
Well it says in the blue post that the ***longer*** subbed account will have better chance. And accounts made in 2004 will have the longest subbs. there are some that have gotten without being subbed since Wotlk or maby TBC, but we dont rly know.
---
Same thing with LFR... and cross realm... and sharding.
---
None of these things were created with bad intentions in mind.
---
I remember spending hours and hours setting those up...
---
yeah but what are the other of the "lot of things" ????
---
I'll be playing druid because I always have and the cenarion circle might miss me.
---
Vanilla druids are unfortunately a bit trash for all dps, but that's unlikely to cause a problem in most content (the raids really don't need min-maxed characters). They are great for levelling though, because they can switch specs dependent on the mob. Bear form will come at lvl 10 and cat at 20, so you see a caster and can get up close using prowl, you see a quick melee mob and can switch to bear to deal with it.
---
The biggest draw for playing druid though comes at lvl 30. Travel form is great in vanilla, coming a whole 10 levels before the fiscally responsible players will be getting their mounts. Being able to close gaps in pvp is very useful, being able to open gaps in all content is even more useful.
---
You mean its bannable to NOT kill players of the opposing faction? That would be absurd.
---
YEAH
---
dont pick the class that is BY FAR best solo leveler and gold maker
---
dont pick the class that can pve and pvp with same spec
---
dont pick the class with coolest(arguably) questline for its weapon
---
dont pick the class that can do extremely well in pvp with full t1 and lokdalar - and melts ppl with chromag xbow or 1shots ppl with aimed shot using nerubian slavemaker
---
of course there is only spot for 2-3 hunters in raid
---
People are already invested in their characters
---
Without speaking to the rest of your comment, battlegroups were an answer to servers with poor faction balance resulting in massive BG queues. It very well may have been done with arenas in mind, but it was also solving a massive issue with vanilla at the time.
---
Playing games on a tv that close at 60hz. that's what killed him, guaranteed.
---
I like ur name
---
If you're doubting I would say go with what you want. For me I'm personally going to min/max my characters but, not gonna look down on the homies who want to chad out with their aesthetic toons :D
---
and play with alt + z on
---
It's not referenced in any patch notes that I can find, during or after vanilla. I'm skeptical if it was ever actually in the game.
---
LMAO. This guy has no clue what he is talking about. I main a BM hunter on the pserver and I will ruin any class in pvp. Viper sting spam and you're useless. 
---
It doesnt matter if it takes 20 seconds to kill. That's 20 seconds of kiting i gotta do with aspect of cheetah on and it's a guaranteed win. You're going to lose as a hunter if you play your class like a warrior. It's a kite class. You have to jump mid air, mouse turn 180, reapply viper sting or arcane shot, and turn 180 and keep running while your pet is eating them up.
---
Honestly the best pvp class by far. rogues are beyond a joke to hunters. Mages, you might argue, will get in your blindspot and you're screwed? Only if you're an idiot. Once you apply that viper sting on them, just run. Get your pet on beastial wrath and keep concussions and viper sting. Intimidation or wing clip or freeze trap if they get too close.
---
You have honestly no idea what pvp is about if you never seen 3 or 4 hunters viper stinging a single healer or caster. No cooldown, apply instantly, to multiple targets. 
---
Dont listen to this noob, if you play hunter like me, I promise you cannot be beat until they get their epic mounts.
---
Who the f  cares if someone carry the dmg. Let People enjoy the game even if they play a hunter. Is it more fun to 2 shot peoples  because thats how it is or outplay a "better" class? 
---
Think twice my friend
---
„that one never gets old“ :D
---
Probably because admin jimmy could of set the values to whatever he wanted for all you know.
---
You do realize there is nothing stopping Blizzard from just claiming something worked a particular way right? Seems honestly like something they just want to add into the game as an anti griefing measure.
---
I played Mage and Warrior through Vanilla and I never recall sheeps not working on tagged targets.
---
Glad to be of service.
---
These are not all the things that give profession skill, only the ones that are required to reach "max" skill for each one. For example, there are +2 skill glove enchants for some of the professions, but they are ofcourse not stackable with the +5 skill glove enchants.
---
If it wasn't finished in vanilla, it won't be finished in classic
---
And yet there will be a million hunters running around having a good time, needing on your Ravager because they want to try melee.
---
...side point, and probably more an EU thing : Never mind internet groups , we had countries picking servers:
---
In the old days of just English/French/German official servers , a lot of countries would end up flocking to one English server and using that as their base .So you'd hear things like 'Grim Batol=Unofficial Portuguese server' 'Drak Thul = Checzh Tul'..'.Warsong is pretty much a Russian only server.' etc  
---
 So good luck understanding most of trade or general chat in any of those places if you werent fluent in whatever was being spoken.
---
I remember my server had a lot of swedes , which wast too bad as they're happy to speak English., but occasionally I'd join a pug and see the dreaded SWE? in /p chat ,to be fair as a non swede I usually wouldn't be kicked , but most of the chat would be in Swedish , with an occasional bit of English if they wanted to let me know something.
---
THANKS :) :) :)
---
Maybe they're restarting it with a new wave of invites?
---
And he did all that just because there were lots of people playing in Nostalrius.
---
He just didn't wake up and decided to do a classic server for no reason
---
Yea but the gear threshold sucked if you weren’t already in with a good guild.  They only brought 2-3 paladins in for buffs for a 40 man raid.  You were not there for heals, other classes did it better.
---
You had to crawl through impossible 5 mans with PUGs, steal cloth gear from others basically, then prove a guild you could raid.
---
Was a huge uphill climb at the time.  No like today, bang other powerleveling, run some pugs and be raid ready in 5 hours.
---
Automation is the problem. You should make a conscious decision to target and destroy a totem. I agreed with Blizzard when they removed the ability to make an autopilot macro.
---
Reason being: other classes have to be targeted to have their buffs purged and only certain classes could purge buffs. Shaman were in a unique position where scrubs can just make macros to remove their buffs.
---
I got the inspiration after watching sodapoppin underestimate Wailing Caverns at Verdan the Everliving. Also I'm a horde player at heart.
---
Hehe I only played Vanilla for a year or 2 max.
---
Would you believe it, I have a topical, almost period correct screenshot:
---
 https://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f147/Karreth/Wow/Karreth-more.jpg
---
They also noticed it because at one point on the beta it was doing the same damage as on vanilla and later on the tigers were doing 1-2 damage.
---
That could technically be the case, however, they have so far shown time and time again that they are extremely committed to reproducing as honest a recreation of the original game, so I seriously doubt that they would lie about something that, in the grand scheme of things, is pretty minor.
---
Thanks. I keep updating the post as I find more information... yes, I'm very bored.
---
That quote is related to Rhahk'zor. I'm focusing on him here because, well, it's easier to focus on a single mob rather than all mobs. It's possible the add damage is wrong, but I'm starting to think Rhahk'zor is doing correct damage when you factor in all different sources of mitigation.
---
&gt;Rhahk’zor
---
&gt;According to this archived comment from Allakhazam (2006) by TheZeldaDude, “im a lvl 29 druid and he killed me pretty fast, i even war stomped him and then healed but he starts hitting for like 141 damage a hit adn he kills ya fast…”
---
&gt;According to the only server agnostic database for vanilla content I could find (classicdb.com), his offensive damage was recorded to be ~154-183 (before armor).
---
&gt;In these streams, you can see that he is hitting for between 49-87 damage. You can’t even argue that armor is reducing it by that much.
---
Yeah, that is true, and 5% is pretty insignificant regardless. That actually goes for all races in PvE, you can really pick whatever you want if PvE is all you want since any edge a particular race has over another is very marginal. PvP is a different story though.
---
The Crendor* Casual

They also walk single file to hide their numbers.

part 3? do i need to watch the previous 2? also what's it about?
---
well said
---
I'm not in the beta
---
Good I prefer gm's to act like people and not just silent robots
---
Hey! 
---
There seem to be a lot of people who are experiencing all types of various errors in the sheet atm. And the first error is different from the next. Hopefully Google fix their issues soon.
---
You are correct about the cloak. I'll sort it out. Thanks!
---
Sulfaras isn't really viable in PvE, no. It used to be a shiny everyone wanted. It's suuuuper expencive and there are a lot of 2-handers which are better. BRE is better by A LOT.
---
There are going to be a lot more Warriors and Rogues than there were back in Vanilla because there will be a lot of people with memories like yours. A few specs and classes were stupid good and a great many more were awful. People are getting a do-over and they will gravitate towards what worked over what didn't.
---
Actually, it happened because retail players STOPPED playing retail lol
---
2 buddies of mine got their invited 2h ago. europe (germany).
---
Healer proving grounds too. That dungeon was my nightmare back in BC. A very satisfying and skill showing off nightmare though.
---
I can respect that.  
---
But orcs belong in the ground  
---
See you in the battlegrounds! :D
---
I’m gonna play alliance cause I have explored that route, it was always for the horde.
---
Depends on the reason they are NoChanges. If the goal was to just keep Blizzard from fucking up trying to get too fancy then I would assume they still don't want changes. Mission seemingly accomplished. 
---
                
---
If the goal was to keep Blizzard from nerfing the raw experience of Classic for casuals.... Well it looks like it was even easier than we remember and at our current skill level as players we will blow through this shit and casuals don't need to worry either!
---
They're not.
---
Imagine going through that trouble just for attention. A life, find one....
---
It's a bug  https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1130897933682061314 
---
People love to jump to conclusions
---
You do realize that not only do Blizzard have a reference version of Vanilla compiled with the original code/database, but they ported that data and combat formulas into Classic and can compare the two, right?
---
It's because they are such a meme, that anytime a *good* hunter is found, people hold onto them as something precious.
---
The moment I find a good hunter, they go on my friends list.
---
It makes sense as I watched Asmongold survive hits from Patches and level 60 mobs. Even with raid level healing, he should have been getting one or two shotted
---
My guess is rogue being in the second
---
Love the sense of humor!
---
Wich translates to how many oranges?
---
Not sure what you are expecting from a re-release. They aren't changing classes.
---
Thinking bm is the only hunter pvp spec LOL
---
I stored a whole bunch on a photobucket accounts a while ago.. I lost the loggin for my main. The email service is no longer in use.
---
I don't remember that on screen quest helper in the top right either. Am I just remembering wrong?
---
So in the end we need Blizzard to work on 2 MMO-s which are pretty much a re-release and Retail (same game generally). I mean at that point rather leave to game to die and start WoW 2. See what works and what doesn't and don't make the same mistake they did midway WotLK.
---
just go to OSRS reddit and write "Vanilla OSRS" in the search bar. You will find many many things that sound exactly the same as the "Wall of no" we used to get back in the day when we asked for vanilla. You will see that this approach happens in OSRS, people get tired of the changes and want that Vanilla again, except there isn't enough of them yet, but in 5 years? Just let it die as classic, which wont happen since "death" implies less than 5k players, which isn't happening ever.
---
Yup, he is
---
https://youtu.be/3Y7aWLpuxA4
---
Whaaaaa?
---
Love it!
---
We have that in the form of a paid character boost
---
\#NoChanges won, so they won't stray from it one bit. 
---
So avoid hybrids like the plague. Except Warrior, the jack of two trades and master of both. But you had that one already.
---
Imagine being able to quit your job, cash in on retirement, and play classic until you die.
---
It’s hard to say, I like them both, I’m leaning more towards warlock since I like the ‘demonic spell weaver’ but I also enjoy having the whole ‘hunter and his companion’ type of vibe  as well, as for the weapons I’m kind of leaning more towards spells since it’s more of a ‘fantasy’ weapon than bows/guns
---
Shaman Tanks were extremely viable through 40. I used to tank on my Shaman regularly back in the day. From 40-60 it gets tougher, but on single-boss/fight encounters you could still do it.
---
Dont pve, you pussy. You rolled a shaman. It's a pvp god. If you want pve gear, suck it up and heal in enhancement spec because resto doesnt have much to offer and no one can inspect your talents. 
---
You're viable in facerolling players and you can kill full pvp geared warriors in ele/enh build. Because spells bypass armor and you kite em around with frost shock and earthbind totem
---
No it's not the same thing with LFR/LFG or sharding. It's not even remotely close to the same thing. It's not the same ballpark it's not even the same sport. LFG/LFR/Sharding massively impact actual gameplay, playstyle, and social aspects of the game. So does phasing, so do flying mounts, etc.
---
Transmog doesn't affect anything beyond what your character looks like. It doesn't impact any aspect of the social experience, the gameplay experience, or literally anything that matters. 
---
Neither do mounts that are as hard or harder to obtain than the "regular" mounts that are the same speed/capability. It only affects things if one mount is easier to get or one is faster etc.
---
They wrote a few seconds later "jk just restarting servers" or something like that.
---
Sorry if you want to be both dorf and casual it's paladin or it's nothing.
---
Mazrigos PVP
---
I played alliance, and it was ....unbalanced to put it mildly.
---
The shield, at least, is the draconian deflector, which is the best pre-MC shield in the game.
---
It's a comment on humanity.
---
Still doesn't quite make sense. Someone who worked hard in vanilla can go casual, but they'll never just call everything hunter gear unless they're deliberately trolling.
---
I hope they win his, too. Players play things for fun sometimes, damn OP.
---
Eh, anything goes in a dungeon. Show up and do your bit, be nice, and everyone will be fine. Usually, anyway.

I did play on Argent Dawn. Was in a raiding group, then in a guild called ultralisk, and raided with magicians of kisses for a bit. was kinda all over the place there. :P

Tank mininum is elixir of superior defense, mongoose potion, elixir of fortitude, major healing potions, and all related elemental protection potions.  Bring a flask of titans for progression.

Says everyone except for people with 0 brains that believe the title of shocking wannabe newspapers that just write trash.
---
Think people may have read into this a little harsh, maybe because it was early in the morning and I hadn’t had any coffee that it was due to my own typing. My big deal is I want new WoW content, but I don’t want it from the current retail version. In my mind, the game is irreparable; they try to fix things with new expansions and it usually just leads to more problems and the cycle goes on and on. 
---
I think that it is possible if blizzard sees how successful classic is and how many people still want that old school style mmorpg. That they could explore ways to create a new WoW with the same things classic stood for. 
---
I mean is that really such a bad thing to desire over rereleasing expansions as a main priority post-classic?
---
The "balance" was that nothing was balanced.  If everything is OP, nothing is.
---
Nah he did.
---
To those saying priest don't have many spells, there are alot of priest spells that are added by the talent tree. Mind Flay, Holy Nova, Mana Burn, Inner Focus, Etc
---
Same, man. Enhancement too. The most casual of classes. I'm gonna autoattack my way to victory.
---
Asking god like questions to answers everyone needs.
---
lol what
---
that’s hilarious
---
Don't think they say anything about account age, but rather how long you have been subbed. so older accounts would get priority by default. But not if you canceled your sub a long time ago.
---
Y'all should take this time to catch up on your gaming backlogs. Mine is fucking huge.
---
&gt; Even before TBC people started to turn away from wow, and when people is'nt playing, blizzard doesnt make money.
---
You might want to re-check your numbers there.  Sub counts were only going up until Wrath.
---
Roflmao, that is amazing
---
Alliance cause its new experience for me, and also I want to play a Druid and not be a beefygirl
---
&gt;I think this is actually why twinking is bad for us, most of the time. You don't learn anything by beating people using a massive gear advantage, and you spoil the game for people who are just trying to have some PvP fun while they level.
---
I never understood this argument. People doing battlegrounds at low level without twinking will spend what? A day tops doing it?
---
Meanwhile the same people are whining and want to ruin the fun for those interested in twinking. I never made sense Blizzard would listen. This was never a fair game. If you want an advantage on someone by getting gear and consumes you should be allowed to do that.
---
Yes,  but it would explain the difference in damage even if the numbers are correct on blizzard's side.
---
Tips didn't do shit, he's just a mediocre streamer. The people who did the most for Classic WoW was Nostralrius team, Mark Kern, and Mike Morhaime for being a non-traditional CEO. Thank fuck they started the ball rolling on Classic before J. Allan "You think you do, but you don't" Brack was put in charge.
---
Streamers had fuck all to do with any of it.
---
&gt; Just to be clear, I don't want them to completely overhaul anything or  bring hybrids up to top DPS, I would just like to be able to play a  Hybrid non-healing spec without people trying to either shame me into  healing or laughing me out of the room. 
---
This is the thing, i've read that for at least 1000 different opinions. I suggest a IRL battle royale, winner gets his buff.
---
You "adjust" one spec, you better adjust all of them.
---
Haha that’s awesome!
---
Figured warrior &gt; rogue &gt; mage &gt; lock for to 4.
---
that’s hilarious. props to Blizzard for that haha
---
Were people claiming it as lower or higher than it should be?
---
love it
---
Imagine needing to shit on others joy for attention...
---
See you in Stranglethorn!
---
I have so many pipe dreams for Classic if it's as successful as Blizz needs it to be to in order to add to it.
---
But in the meantime I do think they'll have to throw us a bone with regards to "we aren't going to roll it out then forget about it forever and ever and ever" and approach design with the long haul in mind, rather than the "here's my chance to get a rare mount and Scarab Lord" short-term thought process I see a bit more than I'd like.
---
The irony of commenting in a subreddit for a 15 year old game telling someone to get a life.
---
I did a who by class a few days ago trying to gauge how many were online. I remember wars and rouges both having over 50 people per class. Druid was the lowest, around 20 people. Everyone else was between 20 and 40. 
---
It was late and is a small sample size, but that matches most polls.
---
Just got that in my mailbox, seems like first waves of non streamers are out
---
and why is mythic less fun than doing UBRS 15 times?
---
Mage is a lot of fun. Easy to get dungeon invites too, for a dps.
---
Most of these streamers did not play vanilla. Do you know how easy it will be to stream snipe in classic? They are going to get destroyed everywhere they go.
---
Stuff like finding if someone is within a certain range of you, and having your character spam /s over your head to make yourself more visible isn't taking info already available in the default ui and making it visible somewhere else. They definitely could ban that kind of thing, just like they banned exact positioning information in raids on retail.
---
I lol'd, have an upvote
---
Not sure why the sarcasm, it's true. Had it happen to me the last time I played on ND in fact.
---
im in the beta, i have two accounts on my battle.net account. one that was made in cata this is active, and one that was made day one vanilla that is inactive.
---
No because I’m going to be shadow spec’d and heal raids. Shhhh
---
You would know if you were playing on a server like that since you would need a wotlk client.
---
No emails
---
Today its US only?
---
Devilsaur Mafia didn't grief you by polymorphing the Devilsaur. They griefed you by calling in 20 of the opposing faction to camp you...
---
Oof
---
I actually think lock might be lower and rounds out the top 4
---
Totally excited for this true rivalry to return! See you in World PvP and BG's dudes!
---
It is going to be the same. Only chance you have is maybe there's tbc in the future. Not only would clas changes upset a large part of the community chanching it is a massive and very delicate thing to do.
---
Imagine being so thin skinned that a joke about a beta invite caused you to ignore your own username. LUL.
---
Is there a way to see if you got invited without logging in to the client?  I hear the emails can take a while to come in.
---
*That's literally the slippery slope fallacy.*
---
Lower.
---
I saw those. I could be very wrong about all of this. Perhaps he has correct damage values. But that doesn't explain RFK ridiculously low damage values.
---
Actuality, when they fixed it in Wrath, they stated it was a bug, and I had never had issues with rage and a priest healer prior. It's a very valid question, as it changes gameplay for those players. I'm glad you're asking these kinds of things. 😊
---
Yeah, somewhat. The other important point is that plenty of groups (the entirety of Horde) manage without dwarf priests. They're cool but far from mandatory.
---
Launcher gets flagged long before an email. You have probably been in the beta for days
---
i hope not man. imagine sitting outside a dungeon at level 60 and some twat is like blah blah blah your talents should be blah blah blah instead of blah blah blah
---
I think the point is that private server data is based on old YouTube videos.
---
Yeah, early small sample sizes usually indicate where the community is heading.
---
&gt; And also have way better scripting/AI.
---
This is a bigger difference than the stats on a mob. There are lots of ranged mobs that constantly re-position themselves during a fight (ie shoot arrow, move 5-10 feet, shoot another arrow, move 5-10 feet) but on private servers they stand still the whole time. This kind of movement makes packs of mobs much more difficult as it increases the chance of aggroing additional mobs.
---
Im in Germany, so EU :-)
---
Did anyone actually believe they were serious?
---
I was invited the second day of the beta....
---
i dont even have a twitch account
---
Do you have an active subscription to retail?
---
You can thank Sodapoppin later.
---
Emails go out far later than actual invites usually. Best off checking your battle net app or account via website.
---
pvp spec disc.. will u have holy nova btw?
---
for DM farm
---
ur rogue idea is good but still huntard nr1 if u can do tributes
---
or mara should work in greens
---
No, the messages came either together or immediately after one another.
---
Check your account on the website.
---
But did anyone actually believe they were serious for those 20sec between the messages?
---
One notable PvE advantage that I can think of is Human Warrior for the weapon skill racials.
---
Although Gnome Warrior is probably best in PvP for Escape Artist, most Warriors still go Human. A large part of that is probably because people don't like playing Gnomes.
---
PvP advantages:
---
Dwarf Priest for Fear Ward.
---
Dwarf Rogue for Stoneform.
---
Orc Warrior, Shaman, Rogue, Warlock, Hunter for Hardiness.
---
Undead for WOTF. Undead Priests also have Devouring Plague.
---
Agreed, Collective!
---
For the Alliance!
---
well fixing and changing are two very different things.
---
June 2015?  I think classic is going to be based on the build from 2006 so scaling is going to be different.   I do agree hunter is great for wPVP though, some would say rogue is more fun considering you get to pick your fights.
---
Voting you go horde, I want to hunt you down.
---
Blizzard stated that a subscription is required. As far as I'm concerned only 1 player has claimed that he doesn't have a subscription, and didn't provide proof thereof.
---
EU. you probably got invited yesterday.
---
WC, RFK, and SFK have a good amount of elite beasts, could be a really useful comparison.
---
It takes patience and discipline to play Horde. Especially when your lower jaw has fallen off!
---
Truth is I'm undecided atm. I played various Horde classes from TBC through to Legion (with a fair amount of time off). Although I'm nostalgic for the past times I feel like playing something different.
---
Wow, that's amazing. Kudos!
---
Doesn't look like you can on the beta, so I'd say nope.
---
I would like to see people acknowledge the amount of work that went into the private server scene. Those people do deserve a lot more credit than they seem to get.
---
You say the numbers are really close, but we don't really know that for certain. There's a lot of backend server-side stuff that Blizz never released or leaked. It's nonexistant outside Blizz HQ. It cannot be replicated beyond literal guesswork and theorycraft. And based on the discrepancies people are claiming to see in damage right now, either Blizz's data is not implemented correctly or (and let's be honest) the more likely case is that pservers got it wrong.
---
All that said Joanna did say on stream that he isn't noticing this difference, and I'd take the king of leveling's word and experience over a lot of other beta testers.
---
I'm just saying that the pserver data could be right on, slightly off, or hugely off. This is very, very understandable given what they had to work with and I don't think it should be dismissed so casually, but I do think we need to take it with a grain of salt.
---
And this is why there’s a beta test.
---
Please no. Trust is a big thing in classic. And if they underperform you kick them.
---
The only thing that really matters in this narrow context is armor, and Lightforged has comparable armor values to the BiS pre-raid tanking items.
---
Hopefully he will know better this time around :)
---
The problem is assuming *all* private server data is based on solid evidence (like YouTube videos, old database snapshots, thottbot scraping, etc) instead of "not really sure, tweaked it to be lower cause people said it felt too difficult".
---
I'm okay with some of it.  But I prefer to have the hard evidence.  Blizzard has that 1.12 reference copy, we kinda have to take it on faith.
---
Fortunately (and I mean this) they are being exceptional about communicating what is and isn't a bug.  I've been shot down once already thinking something was a bug that wasn't.  I like it.
---
That's right - I played a Paladin named Jaedan, and you were my main tank to heal for raids. Small world.
---
this lvl 30 cap is causing a really unique meta that we'll probably never see again.  It's super interesting and looks fun as hell.
---
You can't in beta right now.
---
I won't be surprised if some one doesn't write an add on to figure out people's specs based on activity.
---
Blizzards CS team, overall, has done a great job with the game. Since 2005 I've been very lucky with my GM/CS reps. Glad to see they're still having some fun with it
---
&gt;restarting my launcher for the 4025th time
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
.... So does that mean we're all Zombie Cleganes?
---
To give me 4ish days of joy.
---
To be fair. Unless blizzard specifically says classic was made because of private servers, everything said otherwise is speculation. Do I think private server heavily influenced classic releases?  Yes. Do I know for certain? I do not.
---
Regardless of who or what led to classic wow, I'm just happy I get to ruin my 30s like I did my teens.
---
I feel that struggle.   I have zero desire to tank raids but running dungeons are so fun as tank.
---
Well thats nice to hear, at least.
---
Got the mail a few minutes ago :-)
---
In my post I show another comparison of Classic vs a Vanilla RFK boss fight. Something definitely seems off.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brdpxr/overlord\_ramtusk\_damage\_vs\_retail\_evidence\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brdpxr/overlord_ramtusk_damage_vs_retail_evidence_of/)
---
Undead only breaks it for themselves. So not as useful as placing it on someone else.
---
This sub has become infested with complete MORONS
---
I sort of agree with you but its kind of a slippery slopes if we're talking purely about Raiding simply because a lot of classes are locked into 1 role and only 1 role by design or items.  
---
(By X class I do mean classes that spec often 30 to 31 points in a single tree)
---
Feral druid   
---
Balance druid  
---
Ret Paladin  
---
Prot Paladin  
---
Enhancement Shaman  
---
Elemental shaman  
---
Shadow Priest
---
These are all non-viable for PvE Raiding and their Tier sets focus on healing first and foremost. The reasons range from purely the item sets to abilities that are flat out missing from their tool kit.
---
Saying that some in the list above are very powerful in PvP (Shadow Priest most noticeably). They can obtain items more tuned to the stats they need from off-drops in some raids and with PvP Sets, however; these items often miss out on some key stats that allow them to be as optimal in Raiding (+hit a big one)
---
DISCLAIMER: now when I say non-viable, I mean they will be dead weight until you have the raid on farm and start out gearing it in general. Some raids like Onyxia you can quick start 15-25 manning it once most of the raid are equipped with BWL items, and Molten Core isn't precisely a min-max test of a raid that requires specifically 40 correctly spec'ed players in any case.. AQ40 and noticeably Naxx won't let you really give an inch @ 60 however.
---
Congratulations for being an idiot, you probably got invited yesterday but never checked the laucher
---
I do think it's fair to say "hey, we always thought it worked X way and this might be wrong". Like I said it's entirely possible client bugs are interfering with the way some variables are implemented.
---
Same, the beta made me make an account, lol. It was awesome seeing Crendor and JesseCox play again, feels like a return of an era.
---
I uh, appreciate the effort you've put into this but... Why? We already have the likes of Wowhead spell data bases by class, and even those nice info graphics someone here on reddit made.
---
It seems a bit pointless.
---
Yeah just was activated a few minutes ago. Dropdown didn't show Classic Beta yestersay
---
Nothing. :'(
---
Imagine assuming I'll be playing a 15 year old game.
---
This simply isn't a valid test. You have to go back to contemporary data from 2006.
---
The teamwork is everyone knowing how to do their jobs and timing it well with everyone else. The actual plans for the run path are laid out well in advance in a proper run.
---
Keep flattering yourself you utter mongoloid.
---
An uneducated cut throat being made the master  of coin for all six realms with wealth he was only just gifted ? Makes sense..
---
or you could go enjoy a private server.
---
Classic db values are WAYYY off
---
It wasn't in my dropdown yesterday, so the invite must have come today :-)
---
I'd like new content after Naxx has been out a while. However, I'd rather have it be side content to fill in gear gaps rather than increasing the power level. Emerald Dream is the one I'd like to see the most.
---
Contrast this to the hundreds of people saying "lmao private servers too easy, you guys are going to get smashed when the real classic comes out" and now real classic is out and it's a fucking easy joke
---
I've been saying forever that private servers are actually harder than vanilla was but people constantly circlejerk about "muh blizzlike difficulty" that in fact did not exist. Vanilla is going to be a piss easy joke with 1.12 talents, itemization, and player knowledge.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. Here's to hoping that i somehow get an invite despite not having a sub even though Blizzard says it's not possible.
---
we're strugglin out here.  No amount of Monster zero ultra can fix this.
---
2004 called me https://dagobah.net/flash/wow_waiting.swf
---
Iirc didn't disengage just decrease threat?
---
Dude you are so misinformed it's sad, many pre raid BiS items won't be your typical armor type so saying that hunters/shamans/warr shouldnt roll on leather is just wrong
---
All of them.  I never get into anything.
---
What is every piece of gear they're both using?
---
Without that information it's pointless asking.
---
The Chad Casual is basically Crendor, lmao.
---
I'm not sure whether I need a microscope or binoculars to read that.
---
Report everything you think is wrong, if it's not then it's not. If it is wrong, it'll be fixed.
---
And just.. Come on guys =( Vanilla was amazing because of the community, don't ruin it by bringing this new age internet meme shit here. Be respectful and discuss rather than bash.
---
Do we know if people have been getting invited using WoW tokens / gold for subscriptions?
---
People used BM for PvP in the expansion, in Vanilla it was mm/surv.
---
Hunters rocked in Vanilla, at every thing.
---
Meh. Did it for myself. If anybody else is interested then yay.
---
Old Blizzard &lt;3.  
---
Now we need old GMs back in the game trolling people somewhere.
---
Can we get another 20 screenshots of this? Don't think there's enough on the front page just yet.
---
This is why you had two different specced druids.  One went deep rest for the good hots and swftmend for MT healing, and the other balance/resto for the regrowth crit spot raid healing.
---
Sure, if you'd like :)
---
Quivers dont effect the wand attack speed in beta.  I have no answers for the rest.
---
Some private servers actually have good bug trackers where you can see the evidence used to make decisions about changes. Too bad the shit servers without said bug trackers became more popular.
---
and once the lvl cap is lifted / classic launch, you'll replace RFK-gnomer-SM GY with BRS-strat-scholo ( or MC if you raid)
---
same thing, but good on you to dodge the point because, just like all the other fanatic zealot on this forums, you can't justify your points.
---
as for 'dead game', there's an arms-long list of M+ group / pug raid group forming up no matter the time of the day, do you seriously think you'll have that much action on the classic server after a few MC / ubrs / strat / scholo clear?
---
I talked to a Gamestop employee when I stopped in -- turns out that the people going in lucked at the same time that pre-orders went back up on the website, since the in-store pre-orders just place an order on the website for you.
---
Truly doing the lords work
---
But you should consider: would they even have gotten those views? Without asmon I wouldn't be subbed to any WoW content creators (except nobbel87). Now I am and watch their vids. For some reason I watch them again with him reacting - he often adds an insight or point of view I didn't consider. I doubt they have huge issues with the reaction - if they did, I doubt asmon would watch their content on stream if they mentioned it in private. He's not a bad dude, regardless of memes.
---
They are still doing a really good job overall. Especially when compared to other games. But it feels a lot less fun nowadays
---
Badges existed through most of bc as well.
---
Can you please share where I can see this atlas?
---
Fair enough. I do agree that it's sometimes easier to view something you've made yourself, and if it helps you that's what matters I suppose.
---
Classic wow has a bigger community than just the streamers. Some may leave but it will still maintain a healthy population if they do.
---
Private servers are more accurate to the old youtube videos than classic is. You can repeat "blizzard has the data" as many times as you want, but what we got clearly doesn't match 2005.
---
I aim to please
---
They already said they would do nothing about it
---
A twitch account is not required. Did you get lost?
---
I was invited on day one and I've never streamed a day in my life, and the only youtube videos I've ever made was years ago for school.
---
STV is the reason I go pvp servers. So much fun :D 
---
But depends on the person. For me, PvP is the main reason I play wow.
---
I don't think it's unreasonable for Blizzard to work on two MMOs and see what sticks. Unfortunately, awesome games die all of the time and good periods for games pass too. It's great that Classic gives the opportunity to experience (or re-experience) what it had to offer. Maybe the game becomes WoW 2, maybe something else happens to it. It's hard to say.
---
I'm sort of familiar with the struggles OSRS faced, having played RS2 from 2006-2012 and OSRS occasionally more recently. I'm not an avid player, but the game is fun and I feel good about the design of OSRS as compared to RS3, I think it's an improvement and I think they've added some really fun and engaging new content. Some things I like less, but overall I think it's an awesome game as it is right now. It may grow into something that isn't good later on, but I think that's the nature of games sometimes. I think the additional content for the game has been healthy and maybe someday people will be crying out for a return to the way things were. I think that's okay too.
---
I'm glad Classic exists at all. I personally think it would be awesome to see the game go down a different path, but I understand why people wouldn't want that too. That's just my opinion, and maybe it's invalid because this isn't the opinion of someone who experienced vanilla during its time. I'm still excited to experience the game as it was.
---
???
---
Do we have solid confirmation on this? I've not been in the loop and am only really just now starting my search for information. The only thread I've found seems like they're open to the idea, but I've not gone far beyond.
---
Anyone know how it gets dungeon completion times? Does it hope to get enough market saturation that every group will have at least one person with the add-on (that hasn't been modified to lie about the completion time) to collect that data? Or, will it spam /who to find out how long you were in a dungeon map for?
---
I will have my first Vanilla experience of STV. On a PvE server, thankfully,
---
Where specifically?  I'm totally new to the website since it's all different now!  Thanks!
---
I've never streamed a day in my life and got in day one, it's not a streamer exclusive beta and never has been.
---
Got the same email, same hope and same disappointment!
---
But the more it goes, the more I am fine with not getting into the beta, I would not like pla
---
Characters being deleted was a joke btw.
---
I appreciate the effort, a less resourceful individual would've just linked to /r/iamverysmart and called it a day.
---
I think someone said EU invites went out like 2 hours ago, though the only sources I found was them and you. Both Germany.  
---
No luck here so far.
---
Don't subscribe to newsletters etc
---
Still more accurate than Classic Beta damage values
---
Imagine being this deluded.
---
Could it be the modern client handling player values wrong? We say in the alpha that a lot from legion was still leftover in terms of health regen etc. 
---
Also Arugal in SFK didnt teleport when Asmon did him in beta. As you can see from this clip (11 years ago) at about 1:08. I dont think he said “another falls” either
---
https://youtu.be/ttCwzgjgU60
---
Maybe the client isn’t reading mob damage and abilities correct? Using Legion values?
---
Checking the launcher daily, no Classic in Dropdown yesterday ;-)
---
Doubtful. Most people that were calling for vanilla, will remain and that populace is quite vast. The streamers are only on board because it's a hot topic.
---
Do you like living in filth, not bathing or taking care of personal hygiene? Roll Horde. 
---
Like Shoes, cities that aren't shanty towns, and thicc female dwarves? Roll Alliance
---
You only saw one of the posts before posting this, didn't you?
---
Man this brings back horrible memories for me.  Our MT got TF and then left he guild the next day for a better one.  Our guild fell apart and could only do 20 man content after that.
---
So you’re mad that the gaming community is loving classic content on twitch and YouTube? So people like you used to complain that WoW is a dead game, and now you’re complaining it’s too popular? Next
---
something genuinely fun/funny? Looks like we're not just getting classic wow, we might be getting classic Blizz as well!
---
.. what? Or maybe we can enjoy the game and make or minds up after we've seen how the game will be when we've actually gotten to the point where we know if it is or isnt a problem? Tou know, *not* making hasty decisions based on little knowledge?
---
How the fuck did you manage to twist my comment to mean the *literal* opposite of what my position is?
---
Definitely, I ll be human just for the look haha
---
I'd be surprised if people didn't. I suppose a sub is a sub no matter if it's from money or gold.
---
Undead priest or NE priest but maybe dwarf
---
There will be people who play cause their favorite streamer is playing and there will be plenty who are playing because it's classic.
---
He was referring to OP saying only streamers got invited up till now.
---
Well people playing on pservers for a long time might have been playing with wrong values for all that time... and because those values have been wrong since the beginning people have taken it  for granted over the years.
---
I mean look... how many people who play on a pserver have actually filed a report for the devs that some values arent right? i doubt anyone did that to begin with... most people just take them for granted thinking "okay its made by fans so it must be correct", also the reason why those values are most likely wrong is because of  their memory.  
---
Vanilla definitely is harder than retail if you compare the two, but how much harder? thats not something we can easily figure out by watching videos or using our memory. Most of the time our memory is clouded by it being the past and we being  younger and perhaps worse at playing the game, and videos can give false impression of the game because the players might have worse gear, it would make the  game seem harder than it actually was.   
---
So the devs creating the pservers might have gotten those values wrong simply because they remember it being harder than it is. Also consider who would even develop a pserver? Most likely it is the people who miss the game the most aka nostalgia-freaks. So that further begs the question how wrong their values might have ended up being because of their personal attachments  to the game.  
---
Last time i heard anything about pserver development, it mostly just revolved around one database people had... and what servers did differently was scripting, not actual damage values. When i was wondering which server id like to try they  were all advertising how good their scripting is compared to others, nothing about values being more accurate.  
---
Theres nothing wrong with what these developers wanted to do... but people shouldnt take pservers for granted.
---
Since we know for a fact that pserver values are achieved through guessing from video footage and memory... that alone is a strong question "but are they really accurate?". Just because it feels like vanilla doesnt mean it is.  
---
Initially OP seems to scream of pserver entitlement "you wouldnt have this if it wasnt for us!".   
---
The only developers im willing to thank for is nostalrius-crew... nobody else, because there are so many pservers who try and make money out of running nostalgia-servers and im not going to give them any credit and neither should anyone  else. Remember WoWScape? Yeah, that one was baaad.
---
Nostalrius is also the only team who were invited to blizz HQ and they were literally the beginning of this classic journey... no other pserver-team did that and no other deserves that respect since so many tried to abuse it for personal gain.
---
Since you got the Email the invite ist from Yesterday. Mail Takes 24 hours
---
Cool thank!  Do I need to create a PTR account?
---
That counts as a subscription so yes
---
I actually relate with this a lot. I was like 7 when classic came out! Thank you for sharing your story!

Besides the totem bug where are you getting that mob damage is inaccurate?
---
luls
---
Oooh good find. I'll add it in, thanks.
---
I mean I guess, but then I don’t consider anyone who isn’t raiding mythic to be raiding at all. There is and only ever has been one difficulty that matters: the hardest. 
---
The community of players that I played among in retail, the 50 or so guilds at the top of us wow progress, none of us ever even mentioned normal (as heroic was the hardest when I last played seriously) he only thing that mattered was a dead heroic kill (now mythic). 
---
I don’t mind it, my enjoyment isn’t predicated on others exclusion. That said, during tiers when I can’t raid the highest difficulty, I just don’t play. Lower difficulties aren’t even an option. So I emulate the old experience of raiding is only for the hardcore, at least for myself. 
---
Multiple difficulty tiers are a symptom of this seasonal thing they’ve been doing since Wrath, where they want to gear reset every tier. I’d prefer the classic/Bc model where content gets harder as the expansion goes on and there are catchups not bypasses. People still did Kara during sunwell days—who was doing naxx during icc? Or killing Chagall when dearhwing was a thing?
---
But with that model, it’s inevitable that you will have an issue like first tier of Wrath. Too easy. Top raiders just came off sunwell and you give them naxx80? Content has to keep progressing for them. But you want raiding to start accessible every expansion. It’s a tough road to walk, especially with how competitive the top raid scene has become. Maybe the solution is tuning nerfs. Like HLK, give us the aura. Maybe just tune content to be retarded for method then every two weeks a stack of the aura goes up, making it easier.
---
ROFL @ I've been playing since Legion :p

I'm going to be recreating CaithUI. Excuse the Wrath screenshot of it.

&gt; “Anyway... the call goes out in LFG for regular arcatraz. I need the rep, so I answer. First thing I notice is the paladin tank. This is usually good news because most paladin tanks love sanctity aura (+10% holy damage). The tank asks me to put blessing of kings on everyone. I don't have it, but he can kings and I'll do blessing of salvation. No problem, right? He asks me what I got instead. So I said that I had sanctity aura, at which point silence ensues. After a moment, the tank says "I can't take you into Arcatraz with a spec and gear like that." I told the group that I had l337 +heals and all the holy talents that were useful for healing, but he booted me from the group anyway. Now, I was taking a pvp healing spec into an instance.. but it's regular arcatraz! I could heal that as ret spec with +1500 healing...
---
&gt; It's amazing how people's gear expectations have shot up. I didn't even know that people still thought any of the regular instances were hard...”
---
Anyone having issues with Cone of Cold not hitting?
---
Even that would be sweet, a weekly thread where we can post our photos would be good enough.
---
Tanking I understand, it's a knowledge and awareness based role, but healing is really easy. Just look at group health bars and don't let them hit zero, prioritizing the tank first. Just imagine it as the opposite of dpsing.
---
Nope. As long as you're opted into the classic beta and have a WoW account you should be elegible to get an invite (it's a chance not a guaranteed invite).
---
Except there is way more than 5 npcs, they’ve been as sole expeditionary forces several times now, there are probably more high elves than pandarens in the alliance maybe even more high elves than void elves or lightforged draeneis.
---
High Elves make sense too.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's a developer or sysadmin or something.
---
You need help.

If you roll alliance priest and don’t choose dwarf, yikes.

So will it show up as a new account or something?
---
If you go Alliance Dwarves ftw

Tauren Druid
---
This might be true, however I love the difficulty of private servers. I personally dont care, how strong/weak elites will hit on classic, I just want dungeons to be challenging
---
Priest and Druid make for great healers, and their offspecs are perfectly reliable in PVP, if you're going Priest though, i'd suggest levelling with a warrior buddy to decrease his downtime, that'll make both your lives much easier.
---
I hope they lengthen the duration to some extent but I doubt they will for cost/performance reasons.
---
It doesn't? Weird. Not even near the PTR account?
---
Been looking for something like this. Good job.
---
He's the only one who I enjoy watching for his personality. He's quite skilled as well.
---
This is exactly what blizzard is banking on.  Its a cheap enough endeavor to warrant creating Classic severs but its no cash cow, just a quick and easy money grab.  I've seen people predict the number of people playing Classic at 5-8 million lolol, thats not happening.  They will spike over a million at launch, then slowly dip under to about 750k after a year, then between 500-750k left at the end, if that.
---
This looks like me on Frostmane server EU (2005-2006) :p

My guild disbanded and everyone spammed me and told that you must have bought the account with that gear lol.

I've just had someone reply to me telling me it isn't show there for them so I'm not 100% sure honestly. It should show near your WoW account, as if you make a ptr account it would show that there too.
---
Getting enjoyment out of misery is the forming of a complex

Joana means family.

I told people in this sub and in /r/wowservers many times. Pservers are deliberately made more difficult. Classic is going to be piss easy by comparison.
---
I know, I thought it was funny by the devs
---
Cheers for the discussion but i have to end it with a question, what about people that don't want these changes to ever happen and always have a place they know and want to return? Not having some kind of time limit before they complete something. Even if blizzard leave servers that wont "Change" its still a split. In the end we are but 2 people, there are 10k more that want TBC and WotLK and even they have some "version of that expansion" on mind. It's just insane. I mean D2 is still played...
---
You can play druid, can tank 5 mans and heal for raids.

So how will I know I have access?  Like what will it look like?  Sorry, you're being very patient and I appreciate it.
---
Lol that shit was definitely OP.  Healbot too if it's the one I'm thinking of.  Also full 1 button rotation macros.   All sorts of crazy shit.
---
No, this is correct.
---
Except not. Blizzard has the old version of the Client/Server running internally as a reference, as well as having imported the combat formulas and unmodified database data. They can compare the two directly, and have the math on their side vs your misremembering and out of context videos from 2006. The damage values aren't wrong. Blizzard knows more than you do.
---
You had it happen = really common, TIL

Did any point in my post sound like I am mad? Have I even complained about wow ever being dead? Am I complaining it's too popular? Made me laugh tho. Next?

Just fyi, you don't need to restart your launcher. When I got in I hadn't restarted mine, it just appeared in the drop-down box.
---
Figured I'd save you some time :)
---
Should have Class/Race flairs
---
Crowd control was mandatory!!! DPS order always went : first to any Healer, then Caster, last Melee. Also, spell interrupts were used often. I remember playing a rouge and sap, stun locks and blind were used all the time in rotation; rogues had to sacrafice dps for the sake of the party.... Tanks could not really take 4 mobs beating on them; two to three tops.
---
As far as PVP Rogues, I guess Rogues will be able to indefinitely stun again while they slowly kill you with a white weapon lol
---
I'd like them to increase the armor of raid bosses. It would lower melee dps, balancing things out, and slow overall raid dps making things harder. They won't do it though because #nochanges
---
Yeah I always called it Dungeon 2.
---
The trap that Blizz fell into was focusing on making it easy for new and returning players to get back into and "catch up"
---
Short cutting to "current" end game both diluted the experience for those that claimed they needed that to not be "overwhelmed" with "catching up" and destroyed the feeling of progress and accomplishment for those that conquered each tier of gameplay.
---
FFXIV handled it very well.  At first I was annoyed I couldn't "skip" to the latest expansion but I got so much more out of it because of it and their roulette + level scalling system really helps.
---
In TBC they were more than in their way... They were broken in PVP
---
if you look at some screenshots of BDO nothing at all is unique about it, i'm pretty sure i've seen the exact same environmental designs in rift, aion, pretty much any other mmo. when people act like (x game) is really good just for having fancy graphics it seems shortsighted to me because those graphics will be outdated in a year or two and without having any distinct style or stylization won't have anything that makes it stand out afterwards, which is something wow does pretty well both now and in the past

DM/VC determines if you are one of the earliest of early players who was around before Dire Maul came out. After that, It seems like everyone new was calling it VC.

If you go read the blue post on the Stress test, you will realize they've changed the launcher name to this for the stress test. You will still have your beta access.

Note that the beta server will be unavailable during the stress test. Everyone is forced onto the stress test server and capped at level 5.

can you noobs PLEASE call the company what it is? ACTIVISION. BLIZZARD is dead and gone.
---
I played a Druid and Warlock during Vanilla Wow and raiding with them (up to Naxx). 
---
Before Molten core items were wide-spread groups would sometimes do one of the following   
---
\- turn down a Druid healer  
---
\- request a paladin to come with you (allowing the paladin to deal damage which they didn't mind)   
---
\- let you heal but if anyone dies they rage and kick you.   
---
My own experience this didn't happen too often but was often enough to remember it. Most the time their fears were for nothing and the dungeon was cleared fine.
---
Pretty sure we can confirm there was no wave, otherwise more would have posted. Just a delayed Email.
---
I played until TBC...never saw a PUG down Rag on my server...let alone think about AQ/Naxx.  When did this start happening routinely on other servers?
---
&gt;Definitely rolling a shaman,
---
I love the Tauren starting area especially the ambiance
---
They totally didn't explain this on blue post yesterday
---
Sorry meant the sub should make them available
---
Yes but the addon makers found a workaround for position information. The workaround is to check if some spell is targetable on other players. Spells have different ranges. Huge collection of toys helps. This functionality will be less accurate on classic
---
And if you disable the ability to check if a spell is targetable, you are breaking action bar addons
---
I'm glad you've seen the light, friend!
---
You probably won't see true, full-blown PuGs of AQ/Naxx. They simple require a bit more gear and coordinator than MC/BWL. The latter two raids though will definitely be PuGable though.
---
This GM is wrong unless they've changed their selection criteria and aren't willing to disclose the criteria for the first wave invites. In which case, this is misleading.
---
OSRS is a great example of how you can take a previous version of a game and move it forward, while staying true to the ideals behind that initial iteration. This sub seems strongly against moving Classic forward beyond its original development....so OSRS is not a good example for your point.
---
OSRS is also not a good example and/or indicator of Classic WoW overtaking it's parent / retail product. WoW retail is a mess right now, but it's in no way shape nor form the same kind of mess RS3 was in when OSRS was released. We're talking about a difference of several millions of players.
---
I am psyched about Classic. I haven't played Retail in months (BFA is honestly hot tier garbage). But I am not deluded enough to think Classic will be anywhere remotely as successful as Retail in terms of overall engagement #s.....*especially if they keep it classic forever, years later, and never add original content to it*.
---
Mc and BWL (T1 &amp; T2 ) are very pugable after a few guilds get them on farm most guilds will run MC pugs and just have thunderfury and Hand of rag eye on reserve.
---
That's some shit. I've heard many similar story..
---
Question is are the current values wrong for the 1.12 patch? Also regarding regular mob damage they are completely accurate very near the private server values aswell.
---
They said "active subscription or game time on your account" so wow token time would count based on that.

Human Rogue
---
What the hell are you talking about. Hunters have a place in raids, although not as in demand due to lower scaling dps over time. Skill cap for hunter is actually very high and they have 3 viable specs that can be played in PVP.
---
wtf is a streamer house
---
Thanks for the reply. Is that kind of thing common? Do they just basically mass roll on items and funnel it to others? I guess it would be, people tend to suck, surely that kind of thing will still happen in random pugs. Guess though good thing in classic you can make a shit list and you know.
---
If elite melee damage matches the bestiary guide published by Blizzard that's not a good sign because it's official data from TBC
---
oh, yeah I completely agree
---
You’re complaining because popular influencers are playing the game, which is a result of a game being popular. Would you rather nobody be interested in classic? I done get it
---
You used to be severely punished if you didn't use crowd control or marked important targets to take down first. Sure many did this as fast as they could, but just running through the instance taking every add on the way wasn't viable back in classic.
---
The prophet has spoken! If only this guy was around when we wanted a release date. 🤣

Keep telling yourself that :-)

Not in game but there will be armory websites for sure, and it’s not like you can respec every time you logout.

Sad times when you have to refer to Bejeweled as "candy crush with gems", instead of the other way around.
---
Running a single feral druid really isnt that bad and it did happen quite often (unless you had a GM or officer who was really stubborn). Their damage isn't THAT garbage (was acceptable if you were alliance) and if you have enough rogues/dps warriors/hunters in your guild they will ask the officers/GM to have atleast 1 in their raids so they can get that crit buff.
---
Freeking Diablo 3 season info. Was so hyped when i saw a new email from blizzard.
---
in Raiding they have a fair bit of value as a Healer. 
---
They heal differently from Priests but are just as powerful in the right hands. I went for a heavy +healing (later +damage when the stats were merged) and used down ranked healing touch (rank 3 or 4) saving rank 9 for huge heals, rejuv for light damage etc.. there was a lot of tools to heal and could sustain healing for a long period of time.. Yes innervate was a powerful too and heavily desired, but I found with healing Druids were as good as priests (but different) and complemented them well in raids.  
---
The other two specs weren't so great in the raiding space. In PvP Feral worked pretty well once geared and the druid learn how to use the tools at hand, but I don't remember Balance ever being that great.
---
Nope - no honor in phase 1 at all.
---
Short answer: No. 
---
Long answer: No.

I can see that, I mean I got into those in OG vanilla, lot of alts of major raiders or people who couldn't get in that week but I dream of a true pug for that fairytale win on a binding.
---
I don't know what's ultimately going to happen with the game. It's possible the game will remain 100% in its vanilla state until the servers shut down. It's possible it will change (either by adding expansions like TBC and WotLK or by going down a new path).
---
Unfortunately, if there's change, it almost always leaves someone behind. Any game that is designed with new content in mind will somehow experience that. I used to play a lot of League of Legends and one of my favorite characters was Gangplank; he used to be a fun pirate character that really played up a lot of tropes. They later reworked him to have a tragic backstory and he was suddenly much less jovial. That's an experience I'm never going to have back and it's going to remain stuck in my memory.
---
If the game changes and grows, there will be people who didn't want that change. If the game remains the same forever, people will grow bored. Not all of them, of course. Games like Diablo 2 pull people in for a good reason. That said, a lot of people wanted Diablo 3 to be like Diablo 2, but *more*. That's why a lot of people are on the hunt for the next big new game. That's why a game like Path of Exile has done so well, because people wanted something that captured the spirit of the game they knew so well, but added something more to that experience.
---
Maybe the private server community comes back with a vengeance if the game diverges too much. Maybe a lot of players leave and hunt for that "Vanilla WoW but *more*" game that captures their imagination.
---
Maybe they accidentally applied the stat squish to the classic DB.
---
I truly hope with the combination of starving classic players mixed with this new generation of bfa players make aq 20 and zg pugs possible I would love to have the community even itself out so the gear gap isn’t so huge for so long ya know?
---
I don’t want to play! I keep my energy and testosterone level up for the release. Going to be bloody!
---
Yes, they won't be tuning or changing anything. All classes will play like they did in 1.12.
---
Changing even the most minor thing can have very severe consequences.
---
Prot pallys could tank up until aq40. So they was some gear.

Must look pretty instead, amirite?

The ego on some people in this subreddit is amazingly overblown.

Everyone should take skinning - so when I need to level leatherworking and I'm 1 rugged hide short, its super cheap because the market is flooded.
---
Seriously tho, keeping your professions up to your level is tough for crafting, since crafting requires way more stuff than what you're likely to find in the leveling process... Taking skinning/herb/mining as a way to supplement some income prior to level cap isn't a bad thing, and will be done by a lot of people.
---
One of my favorite things in vanilla was being known server-wide as a Leatherworker with all the patterns.
---
Undead Rogue with mohawk and FAP abuse.
---
Thank you so much for this. That crystal sounds amazing. We need a list of awesome items to search for once classic releases.
---
I played an Orc shaman in Vanilla... but since then I kind of fell in love w/ the tauren models.  As much as I feel like I should reprise my exact race/class as my first wow character... I'm jumping to the cowmen because I just like how they look so much.

Are you ready for the eyestrain?

Doesnt make private server info  correct 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Define "solid confirmation". 
---
They did say that the data is sacrosanct, which includes ability data. Other than that, it's mostly implied by the fact they try to replicate even the tiniest of details, like inconsistent quest displays. 
---
As for being open to the idea - The blues are more open to it than the players and it'll likely depend on the latter more than the former. Have a bit of early Classic drama on that topic:

classicdb is a private server database and not from actual vanilla

How does changing the way the interface looks (not functions) make the game easier?
---
I like the idea of a decent set of blues to get you to the spot where you earn epics. Blizzard was doing this for a long time. They did it with PVP through Wrath as well. Then it went to epic pinata. I had a nice run with my blue PVP gear in BC before I started slowing getting epics. It felt good.
---
Alright np buddo, the thing is, this game is supposed to be a re-creation to the best of Blizz ability, of what was originally released from patch 1.12. 
---
If Transmogs werent in then, then they shouldn't be in, just that simple.
---
200% effort? Absolutely. But it's more like 95% efficiency.
---
I guess you don't know what the word classic means.
---
&gt; Private servers are your best bet at gauging Vanilla **data as players**
---
as players. As in not blizzard...
---
Right? Dude we had a large group of guilds form a super guild called fight pug and we just ran our poorly geared toons all the way to T2 together the bond we had made it all worth it
---
I truly believe the intention of current Neth*rwing are good and very similar to Nostalrius. Regarding the accuracy, I dont know how accurate private servers are and most likely are off. However what I know is, that most of them offered a challenging, but doable content. Did u miss-step? You wiped. Did u make proper group and played it out correctly? You made a smooth and quick run. This is something, everyone would love to see in classic I believe. We have retail for rollfacing after all.
---
It doesn't really matter if it's a personal thing or not. The precedent would be set and that needs to be avoided. Give an inch and people will take a mile.
---
Yes. Same goes for Battlenet or Colorblind Mode. And?
---
I gotta be honest man this twitch streamer drama stuff is mostly being perpetuated by threads like these. I think it's giving them more of an audience. People like that tipsout guy only got more popular due to threads on here. Like them or hate them, no matter how silly or stupid a streamer is they will likely be sticking around.
---
Unlike you, i could say what i fought by the looks alone. When you run with your green bullshit and see someone with ashkandi, you are either like "oh boy, lets check how good that guy is" or you run like a bitch. So um yea... in my case its pretty simple.
---
I guess on a classic wow sub i could assume people are old enough to remember bejewled, but I dont take wild chances like that!
---
Yeah, but for me the fun of it is figuring out what the path we want to take and what tactics to use, together, as a team. Pre-planned speedruns are just not my style. Maybe if it was a timed runs with randomly generated trash mobs and a rotating cast of bosses, so that you had to figure it out on the fly.
---
It would also be cool if the timer only ran during combat, so that you could sit in between pulls and strategize, get to know people. Take a bio break without wrecking the run.
---
You have to live with what you wear

---
Most of the time when pservers make a fix to their game they are just fiddling with database values because it's far more simple than making changes to the core code. Even if the issue lies in the core code.  This can lead to something acting similar to vanilla bit not technically. Which can cause issues that you would never see in vanilla because that's just not how they would make those changes.
---
low quality b8. 1/7
---
Yeah i saw that one as well, FUCK
---
Probably possible but impossibly probable.

I did that and forgot tho.  Trolled myself.
---
It has taken Blizzard over a decade to tune the classes to be within something like 10% of each other. Look at all the tinkering that had to happen to make that a reality, to make everybody viable. Even if your goal is just to buff shaman DPS or mana regen enough that it isn't a joke to your guildies there are a number of problems to resolve.
---
The classes in question, the ones people want to see buffed so their off specs are "viable", have really powerful support utility. Over the years Blizz has buffed and nerfed this utility, spread it among other classes, created counters to these utilities for other classes, and buffed and nerfed content encounters in response to these changes. They've also had to tweak some of them so they can't be used against other players because they're too broken in a PvP setting but adequate for PvE.

I'm not afraid of a slippery slope. I don't think if Blizz gave Pallies a taunt they'd go down some class balancing rabbit hole from whence there is no escape until all classes are homogenized so severely that you're just picking one of 4 archetypes (tank, heal, melee dps, ranged dps) with different graphics. That isn't what I'm worried about. I'm just saying the kind of "minor tweaks" people are asking for are either going to be insufficient, or are going to have unforseen conseqeuences that could wind up forcing *other* classes into the "you aren't as valuable as an enh shaman now" hole, make these classes too powerful, tangibly impact how encounters play out, break a class (for better or worse) in PvP, etc.
---
We've watched where this road goes for 14 years. Sacrificing the class fantasy, RPG, and uniqueness of each class just isn't worth it. I'd recommend being a team player instead. If your guild needs you to heal, then heal. When the content is down, in return, I would think a decent guild would let you try some DPS.
---
Man all the time spent just to fuck it up with "beta key'. 
---
Come on, man. We know those don't exist.
---
Let me DREAM MAN!! Yeah plus I'll be rogue, so lots and lots of dreaming.
---
This damage looks normal.  Judging from the tanks gear, his armor rating is probably decent enough to justify those numbers.  The elites are his level, but watch at 1:35:00.  He dies to this boss, which is level 32, and his hitting consistently for 85+ damage.
---
That wasn't just a GM though, that was a server admin ;)
---
Orc or troll warrior. Can’t decide which would make a better main tank.
---
Source? This is news to me and does not sound like blizzard at all.
---
The only playlist I'm gonna need is the new Tool album. At least this year is gonna wind down on a high note.
---
Oh fuck me thank you I knew it looked weird lmao
---
I always loved the look of The Elements and worked super hard to get it all. But the stats suuuucked. There was no cohesive theme. Some peices had Str. Some had Agi, Some had Int. Almost all of them had Spi. And spirit was basically 99% useless for all shaman specs with no Meditation talent. MP5 was what we needed. 
---
You could tell that the devs had no idea what to do with shamans.
---
Also, we never got our class review. Fucking Eyonix. Bus shock!
---
Your gear and appearance MATTER in vanilla. It's for honor and prestige. It's actually a real MMORPG.
---
I don't care if transmog would only show up on your own character it would ruin a big aspect of what makes Classic so great.
---
Really? You put mogs in the same category as infrastructure and fckin colourblind mode??
---
&gt;  this was always the case in vanilla  
---
I... don't actually think it was, at least not through all of vanilla.  I swear I recall this actually happening to me in vanilla (not with devilsaurs, just with trollass mages), and I can't be confusing with a pserver because I've never played on one.  I remember not caring much because I mained rogue so the hits would *often* land before the heal tick.  
---
Well, whatever- even if it was on live, it definitely seems like the sort of thing they would have addressed before 1.12.  Most of the brutal same-faction griefing shit was removed before the end of vanilla, after all.
---
coz that skeleton be BALLIN!
---
I love it. Can you please do it again the day before release as well?
---
Can you please provide a link to where Blizzard said this?
---
I think its related to the Crocodiles that drop Kron's Amulet, I had same type of issues only when using that as pet, obviously can't say for sure since when I tried on another hunter without taming it I didn't experience this issue.
---
Down voted :\]
---
I feel like i was too young when I started WoW. What I mean I wasn't mature enough to truly understand the Lore and depth of the game. Nor was i able to maximise the effectiveness if my class. Coming back now I think I will be much more skilled simply because of maturity and game experience.
---
I'll either be Disc+Holy Nova or Inner Focus+Holy Nova+Silence.
---
Esfand wasn't using Devo aura iirc, he almost always had retri aura on for the extra reflected damage.
---
Orc Warrior / dualbox an Orc Shaman
---
So what kind of computer will you be using?
---
Its the raids that ate overtuned on private not random lvl 20 mobs
---
Oh shit didnt even realize
---
Go undead so no one is happy /s
---
I think, even when given the choice not to use transmog at all, that it cheapens the experience or amount of effort it took to really pull together a look in the game. Getting a set of matching blues and greens and transmogging to that makes it much easier to kind of pull that ideal look together, even if it's just for you. Ultimately, I think it weakens that "carrot-on-a-stick" effect for some people and removes the motivation to really push people to get that powerful matching set at the end of the day.
---
"Looking cool" is a valid form of progression and I think transmog, even for self, kind of cheapens it. In MoP, WoD, and Legion I put a lot of time into collecting transmog sets and I think it's a fantastic part of the game on live. But that said, it really drains a bit of interest out of experiencing new content for some players.
---
I don't think transmog is a bad thing, but I don't think it really fits the spirit of Classic.
---
That's not really a pug though. Combining two raiding groups who know the fights is not the same thing as recruiting 39 RANDOM  players to take down C'thun.
---
You will not see a true PuG do that.
---
I don´t play Retail because I despise everything of it. Besides transmog.
---
In my opinion for example forcing Paladinhealers to wear robes is diamentral to "fun". You could transmog your way out off it for your OWN visual satisfaction.
---
And gtfo with "no changes". You guys already have battlenet, colorblindmode and better graphics.
---
As a bug yeah
---
\#nochanges that's the argument
---
Some good quotes in english:
---
\- This fuking murlocs doing a folk festival because of my presence !
---
\-  i hiting one, but this one walks into the others and i must run for my life !!!! 
---
\- one casting, the other healing and one other hiting me so hard, mrlmrlrmrl, flashbolt !!!! 
---
\- murlocs are the mainchar of Blizzard !!!
---
agreed. you cant 'overdress' so outside of "pvpers seeing what stuff youre wearing", i dont see why people have that hateboner for transmogs.
---
I posted this yesterday, it's not new, and there are blue posts about it.
---
Who actually cares? Don‘t play on their servers, avoid them and have a good time on a normal server without any big streamers. Their communities are 80% trolls who screw up the entire server
---
That's the way it was, you've just gotten so use to private servers.
---
you mean like this?

git gud
---
True, but all of these got either a continuation or a new game by a different Dev. While we are talking about classic which is a re-release. I meant, if im yet again to be forced to complete the content in a given time, why even call it classic?
---
Bored or not, you don't leave people behind by force, you give them options. And i don't see this working when we're talking Classic, TBC and WotLK. In the end it isn't D2 vs D3 but WoW vs WoW, and this can be stretched only so much before breaking.
---
The 20 man's are definitely more likely and successful to pug than the 40mans, I agree. Hopefully we'll see!
---
&gt; Is that data perfect? Hell no. Is it the best we have and the gold standard benchmark to whether Classic is bugged or not? Absolutely.
---
I am sorry, but this is nonsense. the only real source of accurate data for non blizzard employees are old videos, screenshots, etc. Private servers have spent a lot of time researching these things, but they also guessed on other values (like mob armor). Due to these guesses the whole system is inaccurate. I have a lot of respect for the people actually developing these servers, but you have to be objective here. private servers are not a reliable source.
---
Since everyone seems to need to outknow everyone on vanilla to raise the epeen allow me to clarify having 4-5 guilds with GOOD leaders going out to find players by lfging in org for raids IS what we called a pick up group we just had leaders who knew how to coordinate people apologies for not explaining i had no idea you would respond.
---
So, first, xmog wasn't in classic.
---
Secondly, and probably most importantly; in vanilla, the gear you wore was a status symbol in it's own right.  Much like world first titles, mounts, gladiator, etc, are in retail; the gear you WORE showed everyone what you have accomplished, be it raiding, or pvp.  Seeing a player wearing full T3, you know they EARNED it, and didn't just come back three expansions later to farm it for the looks.
---
It is a role playing game.  Characters being able to "transmog" items would be a powerful magic that only a powerful mage would posses. Just giving the ability out to players breaks  the role playing immersion aspect of the game.
---
Some, possibly. Not all though. I don't have much time for streamers, personally. I don't believe they'll bring anything helpful to an already well founded game, classic variant, or not. They'll no doubt move on to the next big thin to keep their numbers ticking along.
---
Same but 2005 account
---
It's one of the many things that helps erode the RPG elements of WoW. People in Classic like their gear to represent how they are. The tank looks like a tank because he is a tank and is wearing his tank gear. If I get charged by a warrior, I can instantly tell by his gear if I have a chance or not.
---
They're not too good if we're speaking of slaying grounds with 39 other adventurers, but has their niche.
---
For example, mages head piece has 30 INT on it. That's like the MOST INT IN THE GAME you can get on this slot, no other existing gear beats it, even naxx loots. With an exeption of Gnomish Turban, it has, 31 but that's an AQ phase :) 
---
Same shit with chest, 31 int is highest value available in the whole game. Shoulders also has 22, essentially it's the most you can get for mage as all the purples above is a priest-only.
---
Now, why would you want them? Well, AE scaling off spd is with like 0.12 ratio, blizzard is 0.3 for a full duration; you can easily get away with those items for farming purposes, especially that no one usually wants it :)
---
That's not the only example, Warlock gear is essentially *of the eagle* with a good balance of stam and int, which comes handy in a first phase for PvP'ing.
---
so which is it? "we want vanilla warts and all" or changes?
---
Really hoping I can find a Sunday-raids-only guild. I'll spend the entirety of my Sunday running large-team raids and my week can be, you know, real lfe.
---
Yeah, helping disabled gamers really is the same as enabling sad nerds like you to not wear a robe.
---
Actually, it might be:
---
"World of Warcraft®: Legion (WoW4)
---
Public Test Realm"
---
That's the account I choose when I manually log in via the beta client. Otherwise nope.
---
I think I figured out Asmongold's gear, at least for the most part. I updated my comment. The gist of it is that I think the damage on this boss in particular is not bugged. It's possible the other mobs can be, though. I haven't looked into that.
---
Critical thinking is important.
---
Good to have some direct comparison. 
---
Thunderclap damage looks good, it hit for 44 in the 2006 video and 47 on monkeynews.
---
It's hard to say about the melee damage though without knowing their gear (I assume monkeynews has great gear for his level, and a shield doesn't make that much of a difference in mitigation at low levels). The tank in the 2006 video is also level 29, which would make Overlord Ramtusk orange to him, which could definitely be a factor.
---
It's interesting but I'm not sure it tells us anything definitively.
---
Yes. People are dumb, in general.
---
I don't see this being a thing, but picky groups could always ask the prospective member to drop a token ability for the spec, like Mana Tide for Shamans.
---
A vanilla priest's point of view:
---
After looking at lots of videos from streamers in beta, I think the numbers are correct for what we've seen so far.  Most of these players have had decent gear and armor rating when tanking.  These low level dungeons are not that dangerous unless you pull way too many mobs.  I was terrible at healing until probably level 30 or so, and my wipes in the dungeons that we've seen the streamers doing, were because tanks would show up missing pieces of gear, or just have white or even grey armor on from starting zones.  Also, DPS was bad and killed things very slowly, combined with always body pulling or hunters shooting other packs and pulling too many mobs.  As of right now, from what we can see in just level 1-30, I think the damage is accurate.
---
Pretty sure all my emails from blizzard have been going into a junk folder for quite a few years now.
---
Definatly! Don't overestimate twitch-chat. 😄
---
Honor is also not a currency at any point in classic until the 2.0 patch. You bought gear with gold once you reached a certain rank. Some gear was sold with marks from doing BGs as well, if I'm remembering correctly.
---
I'm just looking at numbers and making a guess :( ... I hope its a lot more!
---
Battlenet and colorblind mode somehow makes transmog a legit change?
---
Character run speed seems a bit faster. Just watching streams and they seem pretty fast. This is something I noticed when I came back to Legion that movement was significantly faster. I could be totally wrong, and this may have already been mentioned - any ideas on this?
---
I know it's subjective how it appears and also different models seem different speeds ; tauren / gnome etc. I always played undead so maybe just they seemed slow.
---
peggle is\was a popular addin. You could play peggle inside wow which was useful when you are waiting for stragglers to make it to the raid
---
&gt;Men will not understand us -- for the generation that grew up before us, though it passed those years with us in Azeroth, already had a wifey and a calling; now it will return to its old occupations, and the World of Warcraft will be forgotten -- and the generation that has grown up after us will worship streamers and push us aside. We will be superfluous, to the World of Warcraft and even to ourselves. We will grow older, a few will adapt themselves and find a low-key streamer not suckling off the teat of the bigger ones, some others will merely stop playing, and most will be bewildered -- the years will pass by and in the end their characters will fall into ruin.
---
This is some high-effort quality trolling. I hope. Well done?
---
[Here.](https://i.imgur.com/PXfTWGY.jpg)
---
Yes, that's relatively well known at this point.  I stopped cheesing awhile ago on the pserver I play this spec on- you still get crit all the time and will often have max stacks.  Hunter pets, lock pets, mage abilities like frost nova, arcane explosion, rogues, lots of ways for you to receive multiple crits in a short period of time without taking massive damage.
---
Which is an excellent example "just because it isn't raid viable doesn't mean it isn't viable period".
---
No you don't.
---
No changes
---
sorry was an editing oops on my part - I fixed it

---

---
(He didn't)
---
You're an obnoxious fool.
---
That assumes that matching sets (already a subjective element depending on taste) is an any way related to performance in the game and that is def. not always the case.
---
It doesn't show up on that list.
---
Well ZG is very very easy
---
No, honnor system is deactivated till p2
---
You forgot Shamans. So 5/9
---
Your gear is a visual representation of your accomplishments in Vanilla. You could easily identify someone who was raiding based on their gear. Dungeon sets, raid tiers, pvp sets - they all mattered. You earned them. While I love transmog in the current game it does not fit within the world of Classic. Epics and gear sets during this time were a sign of prestige.
---
About that starter area white vendor items - It might not make a big difference for casters, but I tried it out with a warrior I leveled - its like night and day :D
---
Only way to answer this may sound kinda rude but I’m not meaning to be - read the description.
---
“Additional 25%.” By additional, it means additional
---
Base (5%) plus (additional) 25% = 30%.
---
Well that kills it for me.  Dummied down Classic.  So.. Fucking.. Lame...
---
Well .... only class that can summon players to a location since summoning stones are not a thing outside of dungeons / raids i believe.
---
Tips interview with devs during the summit earlier this month. They said they want it to be the wild wild west.

You have absolutely no way of telling what side is more popular in the beta.
---
resto druids are good for brez and motw
---
It happens everywhere but you're right to be surprised.  Its beyond pathetic.
---
It's one of those things that takes you out of the immersion of the game.
---
The fact you're asking proves you don't even know anything about the expansion.
---
And even if you were an expert unless it's bis pre bis an upgrade is an upgrade.
---
The fact you think you get to decide is absurd. You're just a pleb tank, very replaceable while leveling. Know your place. Good tanks are hard to replace. Not at level 40- when you're trying to master loot with no game knowledge lol
---
You would not just leave master loot on as teh norm outside a run where you were all friends, and then why would you/
---
The ONLY TIME you can say "this guy gets it it's better for him" is if it's BiS for one or not the other or he's rolling for off spec. If it's just an upgrade for both but not Pre-Bis or Bis for either then you just roll....No need for master loot
---
Bloodvine farming would be great, but yep I'd struggle to get a group. I've read that a rogue can kite mobs away from some of the jinxed hoodoo piles and vanish+sprint to get back before they return. No idea if this will be possible on Classic as a way of potentially looting the scythe. Alternatively would it be possible to team up with a druid/rogue and take it in turns kiting mobs away from the piles? I haven't been in ZG since vanilla, I barely remember what it's like in there.
---
Don’t compare the architecture which all battle net and activision pc games use to color blind mode. Ffs
---
Shaman probably. Everything is viable. Dwarf priest is just the most meta, so all the min maxer virgins spout that it's the only viable class.
---
Fuck no.
---
Think of it under a few circumstances:
---
1: Everything is about PVP. 
---
Really, afte all the PVE is done, all you have left is the PvP, which wasn't as horrible as it is now, and people actually did it.
---
2. Gear, there isn't much of it.
---
Everything in Vanilla that is worth a damn is very specific to a look. So much so, that the really, really good players could look at a character and determine what they would be able to pull off DPS-wise in a fight. Also goes to what Casters had and what they might have as a bonus, effects.
---
Now take number 2 out and get a pre-made group, transmoged out in Twill while wearing the BIS for PVP and just wiping the floor against everyone else because nobody can tell what they are really wearing while fighting. You start to ruin #2 and then #1 falls to the wayside because nobody wants to PvP and end-game really gets stale and the game falls off after that.
---
Me too, but I would definetely spend quite a few hours if I had it, in the opposite faction to not burn myself.
---
Prot warrior
---
Paladin. With crit gear they have near infinite mana in raids and are really good in PvP with all of their blessings. Priest isn't the only way to go.
---
Wait these are just heirlooms.
---
/s (please dont shoot me)

I got an invite day 1, I am not a streamer. A lot of day 1 2004 guys got invites at the start.
---
Ahh yes, this baby stacked with the Warrior protection tree 15% stun resist
---
Could spec into mortal strike in Arms and snatch that stun resist from protection and become the terror of Rogues everywhere with 40% stun resist and a big axe
---
Good times

Still waiting for first pally
---
You obv. didn´t read my op post.

I guess that was his point, the rogue rolling on it because he didn't know better
---
Telling people to "git gud" doesn't make you correct or right. Your entire theorycrafting has been predicated on bad private server emulation and everyone knows it. It's why you were laughed out of Esfand's Discord. Not a single Paladin takes you seriously. There's a reason for that, my man.
---
I use to play Dark Age of Camelot back in 2001. The community for that game is the same way now. Id you do not play the class/spec the elitists consider to be "S Tier" then they will go out of their way to make sure you are excluded from every raid/group/event they can.

Without Draenei and Blood elves, it might be more even?

Why not say that at the top of this comment thread instead of just to me then?
---
meanwhile, in beta, running deadmines I don't even have to heal on half the packs because the mobs die too quick with 4 DPS + priest wanding... and the 'challenge' of healing is kinda tame with only 2 possible buttons.
---
not just priests but holy priests are the general go to 
---
Id love to tell you that the others are just as good but... not so much

Druids can be ok, and I think pallys were used in some ways but non priests are mostly support healers

The only way to pug bwl successfully is to be coordinated or you won’t get past razergore. The ppl pugging bwl will be guilds who need to team up with another guild or randoms to finish it. I’d be surprised if someone cleared bwl with a full pug till naxx was out .

Guys. READ MY POST. The change i suppose is so that ONLY THE PLAYER ITSELF SEES THE EFFECT OF TRANSMOG.
---
Thanks to everybody for your help! This is a reply to everyone who has posted. You've all been genuinely helpful with my understanding. More I considered the idea of all those consumables the less the idea of gathering them all daunted me. I made myself consider that I have the rest of the entire week each reset between raids to gather all those consumables up. Splitting the effort across a few days would make it drastically less time consuming.
---
Here's a follow up question though. What do Prot Warriors typically do to earn gold at max level in order to afford their raid upkeep costs? Rent-a-Tank work? Fishing/cooking?
---
Yes, but blue wasn't worthless in Vanilla.
---
&gt;There are no tanks other than warriors
---
Bears tank raids and raid bosses just fine in 1.12

Some of these would be for twinking and i'll only roll a dupe if I feel like i need to
---
that would explain why i have memories of level 15 being the minimum requirement for deadmines. Thats when the instance becomes a challenge. Doing it at 18+will be faceroll, which is the norm on private servers. Some groups even want 20+ because vancleef and his adds put out so much damage and attack so fast. I just hope the raids arent stupidly easy although id imagine much much more research was found and implemented into making those correct for the most part. As raid boss data and raids would have tons more forum discussion and video evidence from back then.

Why do idiots like you keep asking the same question over and over and OVER again? #NOCHANGES

It's more harmful than good

We never rolled for chests in vanilla, but we DID call it out and basically ask in the group who needed what from it. And sometimes rolled after that.

You obviously didn't read my first point.

In classic, you look like a clown fiesta and you LIKE IT.

Truth's somewhere in the middle, iirc. Priest is the optimal healer, but the others were valuable; just in a tighter context.
---
I'll be going priest because I've loved the class for a long time (up until legion, anyway.) The bigger question for me is whether I put meta over aesthetic and pick dwarf over human.
---
Exactly, just be quiet and let elitists also play how they want. No need to start pushing your own agenda.
---
&gt;I think in Patch 3.2 or so, they nerfed dungeons, added in badges
---
We got badges in late TBC. Tiers of badges came later.
---
What exactly are we discussing here? Isn't that griefing? I'm referring to the act of a player killing another player in the world, not a targeted grief over the course of hours. Regarding death being time wasting, isn't that par for the course? If I die, I run back and rez, that's normal. For me at least. Maybe it's just anecdotal and I haven't experienced what it's like to have been camped for hours.
---
Yes it does.
---
If you can heal at level 60 you'll get into a raid
---
You're a clown ornament troll...choose
---
Not really, if they change fear and i can't solo things the way I could back in the day... then zero chance I will play a lock again
---
This might be the most divided sub of all. Retail vs classic, purists vs changers, PS vs vanilla, blizz defenders vs blizz haters, casuals vs hardcore. When will it end!?
---
Even with this, the gear grind is real, and getting those SPECIFIC PRE RAID BIS is a grind upon a grind. You add even that Transmog system and then the Ninja Looting/stealing really goes nuts "all for the look"
---
I used to think like you did that a client side would be okay but the more you think about the player base, Transmog makes it so much worse to have in a game where it's so hard to gear to be ready as is.
---
Farming low level dungeons with friends and viewers on beta and stealing the chest from each other = omg all these streamers are scumbags. 
---
You realize none of this Carries over right?
---
Large streamers like Asmond aren't playing with randoms, they are likely playing with their streaming friends or fans/guild and may be taking things for said guild or just to be selfish during the temporary beta. 
---
I've seen some streamers play with randoms and loot everything the way it should be.
---
I don't think we exactly know what Classic is yet. Old School Runescape is different from how Runescape was in 2007, so does "Old School" really fit as a title either? I think there are some similarities in the experience. People disliked the direction of the modern game and wanted a return to "the way things were." People enjoyed the way things were, but got bored when they started exhausting the content in the game.
---
I think a lot of games do leave people behind by force. New expansions for games do that a lot. A lot of people really dislike the direction of modern WoW. Each expansion has the potential to leave people behind as they dislike the new systems or changes to their favorite classes.
---
I agree that things definitely could break. Both Blizzard and the players of Classic will need to think about where the game goes after Naxx has been around for some time. I don't know what that decision will be. I think that a changing game can keep holding onto the people that truly love the original game as long as the changes don't betray the spirit of the game. That's just my opinion as a wrathbaby though.
---
Regardless, I hope Classic is an awesome experience that gives people the chance to experience the game as it was for as long as it makes sense.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it, it really is as you said "a great great game".
---
That's really touching, I hope you both have a fantastic time together on classic when it's released! :) 
---
I will personally enjoy the journey back in time, seems like your dad will have a lot of fun too :)
---
Dude, your post is 6% upvoted. Not one single person other than you wants this. Now just go away, it's never going to happen and we don't have to convince/explain/persuade you why. It's not going to happen because Blizzard say so. End of.
---
YES!
---
... well ... kinda yes:P ... because it is a great honor to kill you enemies ... you don't get points from it ... but you get something way more valuable ... SATISFACTION :D
---
Is there a way to know if a particular realm/faction has a lot of streamers?
---
Ohh this is actually great advice! We joined wow just at the end of classic and TBC launched just a few days later I think! My memory might be a bit off though
---
Its additive, thats how it has been. The text also literally states it is additive
---
If a mob strikes you twice, does it do exactly the same damage? I think there was a small random variation, but my memory is hazy.
---
I healed WC 3 time on classic beta and i never let the tank die on Verdan . I hope it stay that way , dont need nerf.

---
Mace warriors? Why would you play the worst Arms spec anyway?
---
Raise the epeen? What?
---
I raided in Vanilla. I've raided almost every raid since up to BfA. I ran my own raiding guild for 5 years. I'm not here to "raise the epeen" or brag. I'm merely stating some truths.
---
If more than half of your raid is an already established group, it's not really a PuG. A PICK UP GROUP is a bunch of random people who just decide to form and jump in to the mix. Considering you'll need people on coms and 40 individuals? You're not going to see a whole lot of successful PuGs formed by Joe Shmoe who decided he wants to go raid AQ40 today cause he's bored.
---
What blows my mind is how people think they can/should remember how a 14 year old game worked if they NEVER played a private server to refresh their memory. Like, assuming you did in fact play back in the day, how do you remember what the damage from a specific mob were like? Or how were you suposed to do a specific quest that is no longer available in a post-cataclysm game? Sorry but if you never played on a vanilla private server, it's really hard for me to grasp the idea of you remembering those things. Heck, I started playing WoW back in MoP days and if today I had to test a MoP classic server I wouldn't remember what the damage from a specific boss was like, even though I raided back in those days. It's just mindblowing how people can remember that. And lets not forget how most of us 15 years ago were in their early teens (with some of us even younger than that), which makes the memory of things even more hard, specially menial things like damage numbers on a video game.
---
Now, if you played on a vanilla private server and then went to test classic WoW, that makes sense! You now have a thing that you can compare that is fresh in your memory, even if all private servers had their numbers wrong. But at least you CAN compare something. It's mindblowing watching Tipsout or Swifty swearing for their life that something worked differently in vanilla than it does on the Classic beta when it turns out they're just remembering things wrong (like Swifty) or just misremebering things due to having played private servers (like Tips)
---
No, Paladins and Shamans are also extremely powerful healers. Druids kind of get f'd though since HoTs don't stack and only have brez.
---
You don’t get an email when you’ve been given access to beta... at least I read that a few times in other posts over the past few days. Have to refresh the client and check the drop down. Can anyone with access confirm that?
---
Sorry but you made yourself look pretty much a fucking retard with that comment.
---
It would be so cool if they released special hardcore servers where things were just generally more difficult. Maybe player hp and mana regen are slower, mobs hit harder, things are more expensive etc. I don’t know if this would be a popular concept but I’d personally love to replay vanilla on a more difficult scale.
---
I would fear when he got too close, and keep 1 dot up to keep agro. 
---
Hunters could do like Kazak, he was not fearable, but lower guys like in the burning step could be done.
---
Honestly mage isnt hard though. Theres nuances to set you above other mages like being able to decurse and knowing how to maximize your cds but the damage part is pretty fuckin easy as a mage.
---
There, their, they're.
---
Same here.
---
OT - are you subbed curently for Retail WoW? 
---
Wondering if they will let people in beta that are not subbed.
---
Last i was playing retail was at the end of 2018.... 
---
tnx in advance for your answer.
---
My Chat is bugged. I can't get into General Chat.
---
It's not really about performance, it's about what motivates people to play the game. I think that in a classic MMORPG that wanting to have that cool look is part of what drives some people and makes them keep pushing harder content from day-to-day, since it might help them find that next item that makes their current equipment setup look just a little bit better.
---
That said, I agree. It's not always the case. Sometimes you're already in full epics and they're just horribly ugly and don't match at all. I think that's part of how the experience was though, and in my opinion I think that part of the experience was valuable in a way.
---
&gt; Its also important to keep making those threads to make blizzard reevaluate current data on classic to make sure
---
It really isn't. Just because private server players are angsty about Blizzard as a company doesn't mean they should make a Reddit post about every single thing in Classic they think is wrong.
---
Every time a big public outcry has cropped up, it's always been wrong. They are not randomly guessing on these numbers, they are pulling the numbers straight from an archived database.
---
I'll be playing disc priest, but other healers are perfectly viable. Priests don't bring to the table half the utility shamans do and do not do nearly as well aoe healing. Paladins never run out of mana, are incredibly tanky and are the best PvP healers in the game. Druids can decurse which is extremely vital. They're the only healers who can. They also have the most efficient heal (healing touch) in the game. I would youtube: which healer should I play in classic wow? There's a rediculously good video on it I can't remember the channel now but in comparison to the cash cow teet milking you see on classic wow channels right now it's actually good content.
---
Found [this](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1172)
---
Yes, got access yesterday late evening. Still cant believe it:D
---
I was subbed for exactly one month since cata (legion release, that was just before I found out about PS and quit retail again). I resubbed few days ago for one month to have a chance for a invite. Account created in feb 2005.
---
I’m sure armory for classic will be a thing.
---
On garr warlocks are used to banish 4-6 of the elemental adds and then are single target killed and lots of the 4mob trash pulls get banished aswell
---
OP said that?
---
I’ve never had success selling mage food but made a pretty fair amount selling portals.
---
Paladins are vastly better healers in both PvE and PvP than all the other healers. Druids are specialists in PvP so disregard them in that context. They're not really used as pure healers in a meta comp, neither are shamans really but we'll pretend they are cuz they fill a heal slot. 
---
Anyone who thinks different has no idea what they're doing or talking about. 
---
Priests can't break CC put down on top of them for the most part, they are vastly inferior to paladin in PvP without another support abil to make sure they're not CC locked.  Shaman and druid have the same problem. Easy to just have them sit there CC"d while you crush their team if there isn't another dispel to get them out. 
---
Not to mention priest can't deal with poison
---
PvE because of the way paladin talents work they're the most mana efficient. 
---
And because of that they in practice do the most healing because a holy paladin can use his max HPS rotation MUCH longer than a priest. Also seal of light/wisdom are amazing.
---
Best buffs in the game....
---
Priest started out vanilla as a much better healer than Paladin. By 1.12 Blizzard compensated paladins lack of offensive options with by far the best support kit. 
---
It's so bad in 1.12 Priests don't even use their most mana efficient spell. Which i'm pretty sure is heal. They all spam quick heal cuz without it they wouldn't even be on the meters with super efficient paladins playing correctly. 
---
Even the best alliance guilds in p server scene spam quick heal. Wanna know if a priest is playing mana efficient in PvE? Check how many times he used heal then you'll know if he's playing right.
---
everyone keeps thinking i'm a trump supporter cause of this dumbass hat *sip*
---
Yep. Did you get lost?
---
Generally speaking yes, but how much people you are willing to leaving behind?
---
I mean, if one day i wake up and see that i have a time limit to complete something before more is added, i'd rather quit. The greater good argument i guess, but is it? Well...even if we shake hands in the end, you better prepare for the 100k people and their ideas. This is where the fun begins. And lets not joke ourselves, OSRS is an insignificant ant compared to WoW. We arent talking about a game with niche community, we are talking about a giant that had over 100 million people going through it. The drama about changes and additions will be glorious. 
---
No offense to OSRS fans, but that's how things are.
---
Blizzard has never viewed corpse camping as griefing. They have always said it's within the rules of PVP.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10184
---
&gt; The following actions may be considered dishonorable but are considered legitimate PvP tactics and will not be addressed by our Game Master staff:
---
&gt; * Corpse camping
---
&gt; * Killing players well below your level
---
So, if you can't understand why corpse camping for hours on end doesn't waste someones time, there is nothing I can say about it.
---
If you want transmog, you have BFA. Nobody wants transmog in vanilla.
---
I played on Frostmane(US) alliance and I never saw anything more than ZG/MC pugs &amp; played right up to TBC launch.  Only one or two guilds were even attempting Naxx at the end..
---
To be fair, regardless of how people feel about a certain streamer the math is there for Spelladin, and a lot of good work has been put in to figure out the viability of the spec.
---
You can call it bad private server emulation, but its not that simple. Most of the mechanics we assumed to behave a certain way has turned out to behave exactly as we expected on the Beta, and there's not that many unknowns left.
---
Worst case scenario regarding scaling and coefficients for what we still dont know is the Spelladin spec will still perform more than well enough to hold its own in raids.
---
Will you be able to DPS in a guild minmaxing DPS and stacking classes? No. Not really. But the majority of guilds are not like that.
---
Not worth tbf, most people have a mage friend/guild mage and tbf if you sell it for high prices to actually try and make a profit you'll become the scumbag of your server.  
---
And remember reputation matters on classic no phasing or shit, so better to have someone owe you.
---
I miss humorous GM's/devs/players...etc.
---
Interesting that sound quite plausible. I wonder if that's the case.
---
Good playlist but if you don't pause whatever's on and blast Fortunate Son for the ride into STV then I just don't know what to say to you.
---
I didn't play on a private server. If that's the way it was, then I just don't remember. It was a long time ago.
---
Drood. I don't care about convenience or viability.
---
Easier to get the pvp nightsaber
---
Two encounters that immediately come to mind are Garr (banishing adds) and Twin Emperors (tanking).
---
In general, summoning, healthstones, and soulstones are always super useful.
---
&gt; This is something, everyone would love to see in classic I believe
---
This is why Brack said "you think you do, but you don't."
---
Blizzard isn't dumb, they knew just how wrong private servers were. Pserver players don't want Classic back, that game was braindead easy. Blizzard as a company has always been about taking a genre and dumbing it down to reach a more casual audience.
---
All pserver players want is Blizzard to host Nost core officially. They never wanted Blizzard to make their own version of Classic. That's become truer now than ever.
---
Wow really? That’s wild, I haven’t played since Lich King so I’m not up on the current state. 
---
I can see how not getting stronger (relative to the env) would be frustrating. That’s a good point. My biggest gripe was wanting to really thoroughly go through a whole zone, all the quests and everything, and feeling *too* powerful by the end. But that’s obviously a super common RPG issue. Probably pretty hard, if not impossible, to balance both sides,
---
Anyways part of the issue when I leveled up alts was the hugely magnified xp gains and reduced level cap - just the accelerated leveling process in general. It’ll be nice to have s bit more grind in classic! As weird as that sounds.
---
Literally bought it bc of that and the OW skin.
---
Good thing I had tons of WoW gold left over
---
No, that is not your job. Players aren't required to give any information to other players. Not to mention about correct information. And if you already seem to know everything since you corrected his BS time after time after time why do you even need info from him?
---
Lol I remember getting yelled at by my raid lead (best friend irl) for peggle during boss fights. Buuut I can get in a couple rounds while KT just sits there.
---
Well no, but actually no.
---
Beta over? Cool. Let's just push that release to june
---
Big streamers on beta actually beta testing lmao
---
In vanilla I refused to summon people for raids. My guild leader backed me up on it too. If you’re dps be on time. Only summons for pivotal people who make an effort but for being late ? Nah no summon.
---
Hehe, that's cool!! :))) 
---
Brings back memories of me and my guildies farming Silithus during the pre-opening event of AHQ... We were farming some carapaches (or something) to house music i was blasting through ventrilo channel :))
---
100% yes. Not even playing with one of my buddies because he insists on using questie.
---
I didn’t wait 15 years to Zerg 60 and ignore everything along the way
---
Undead rogue, pvp focused, sword hemo spec
---
If the your MT losses all his buffs its better to just go with an off tank who sill has theirs, most groups preff you SS a healer
---
fyi /script and /run do the same thing
---
The quests for the gear required going to Dire Maul too, so I can't see them being attainable in classic until that phase of dungeons are released later on. Which is rough, because Soulforge is the best source of +spell damage/healing gear for paladins before the T2 Judgement set from BWL or PvP gear.
---
If you haven’t touched a pserver since TBC went into play, you’re hardly a subject matter expert.
---
or how about... maybe... pservers are actually tuned higher than vanilla was?
---
Everyone agree Pserver aren't accurate, but they all seems to think that means Pserver are easier than vanilla... why can't they be tuned wrong in the other direction?
---
I clearly remember being able to solo same-level elite on a shadowpriest, mage ( if I had kiting room), warlock and hunter. Or remember doing that elite village in silverpine forest with only 2 people...
---
Sure it was slow... but quite honestly DM/ WC don't seem undertuned so far... we just know what we are doing.
---
Agreed, but it's the best I could find and PS devs spent years trying to get numerical data to be accurate and for their servers to feel "blizzlike."
---
&gt;&gt;any cloak deleters?
---
my sides.
---
no ffs
---
1g for 3-4 stacks of the level 55 water (only way to get that water in the game) isn't unreasonable. Similar pricing for portals.
---
You don't "sell" portals, you offer a portal service and you get tips.
---
Well we know this is wrong because pservers have SFK elite damage wrong, but there is a video on YouTube that was posted in 2006 of a full SFK run. They didn't even bother to double-check.
---
The fact is, because Nost was so successful and because pservers realized they could *monetize* Classic WoW, they stopped caring about making sure every single thing was correct. And besides, if anything was changed in the "easy" direction, most pserver players would absolutely flip and claim the Devs of said pserver were trying to make the game easier.
---
The most "hated" pserver (starts with a K) actually is the most true in terms of damage values, but was laughed at for being "too easy". Funny how things change.
---
Sitting to be crit was a thing in vanilla ...
---
I did not know this. How did this come to be common knowledge? I'm not being passive aggressive or snarky, I really want to know.
---
I was planning to sell it for less than shop value obviously and because everyone needs to eat/drink i thought i would make some extra gold with a mage.
---
Well I guess Im just that bored.
---
Yeah you had to have a certain mat that cost a bit, right?
---
trust is earned, not given
---
I'm probably going to go with either LW or BS and pick the least used specialization. I just like being That Guy on my server.
---
I chuckled have an updoot
---
The price of low level gear that should be available to poor, low level characters will skyrocket. That also sounds like a nightmare for blizzard to program for very little benefit.
---
Getting your day ruined by getting camped truly is a part of the experience. I totally agree, how else are you gonna get that hatred for the opposite faction that Vanilla wpvp is all about
---
well said!! :)))
---
Thanks! Thought it would be handy to be able to read all abilities from a single class at a glance.
---
I wouldn't be surprised. The values in the beta are either on par with the ones in private servers or a lot lower making things easy. Regardless, it's funny seeing people try and shit on pservers for not being "the real thing" when Classic isn't even going to be the "real" thing.
---
This was also a big ask of mine for wow since I also loved the 19/29 pvp twink brackets, and I wanted to keep grinding dungeons to finally get fully BiS, without getting xp. But I thought WoW added a way to do that - to “turn off” leveling - at some point. Is that not the case? Or did they maybe add it then remove it?
---
How much would you say you can make?
---
Not my creation. Just what I found, on the forums long ago. :)
---
I see the words non-streamers but that’s about it.
---
95% of the popular streamers in the wow sections right now have been wow streamers for a long time. This is the big thing many have been waiting for.
---
It is both. I had well over 100 days played in vanilla. Even if I was just as into it now, I just don't have that kind of time without neglecting my family. It will take me over a month to put in the hours that I put in every week back then.
---
I do love playing with people who used to be hardcore yet have mellowed, though. There are a lot of people like that on p servers who know their shit while still being chill. My favorite kind of player to nostalgia out with during a dungeon run.
---
Everyone wants it. And blizz should do it. After naxx I want supplemental content that scrapped that doesn’t affect Outland journey. Make it adventures that don’t affect story but are at places that existed but weren’t complete . A grim batol dragon  sealing event , stuff like that
---
In classic gear is recognizable and means something.
---
&gt; It is technically linear.  Just not with respect to damage reduction. 
---
I was talking about linearity with respect to DR, because that's what the OP questionned in his comment. However it can't really be linear for effective HP either because it's capped at 75%.
---
&gt; It is linear with respect to effective hit points. Every 400 + 85 x lvl gives +100% base HP added to the effective HP. 
---
Indeed, if we forget about the cap, and if you note **A = 400+85.(Attacker level)** and you consider a player amor being a multiple of **A**, say **Armor = k.A** with **k** a random constant, you get **DR%=k/(k+1).**
---
So if tou have exactly **A** armor, **Armor = 1.A**, so **DR% = 1/(1+1) = 1/2** \---&gt; you take 50% damage, so it's like multiplying your life by two.
---
If **Armor = 2.A**, **DR% = 2/(2+1) = 2/3 =66%** \--&gt; You take only the 33% = 1/3 damage (what remains from the reduction), hence your life is multiplied by 3.
---
If **Armor = 3.A**,  **DR% = 3/(3+1) = 3/4 =75% = DR%Cap.** You take only the 25% = 1/4 damage (what remains), hence your life is multiplied by 4, and that's as far as you get.
---
However it should be noted that this is true for attackers who are between levels 1-59, as the formula changes a little for attackers lvl 60 or above (bosses). See :  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor) .
---
 (I'm not writing that for you, I'm sure you understand seing your comment, but maybe people are interested by that for the sake of clarity).
---
And dungeons have been horrible ever since. More and more spectacular bossfights with cool mechanics, interesting locations that are (sometimes) within scope for what a dungeon should be, yet all made irrelevant by how easy it is.
---
Portals cost real mats in Classic, its natural there is a material coverage fee.
---
They won't change the costs. They are what they are for a reason. 
---
That being said, I do plan on playing a utility class this time around so if you asked me personally, I wouldn't mind the respec cost being halved lol. 25g seems fair. 50 is damn steep, but I do think that's the price you pay for being able to fill multiple roles.
---
But if you don’t play with music and ambience noise at max volume and get lost swimming in the middle of the ocean for 6 hours how are you ever going to enjoy the game?!
---
Amazzzzzing
---
I hope this happens . I am avoiding gathering and will just make stuff from cheap ah flooded prices
---
Lmao, clear and straight to the point.. love it.
---
That's more a strawman than anything - you brought in the idea of corpse camping, not I. That IS a waste of time, I agree, but the OP didn't declare corpse camping, and I sure didn't. I was saying that the idea of experiencing death in a video game (even by another player) is a waste of time *in* what's meant to be a waste of time is ridiculous. But you're right, eventually it crosses over from "shit I died, oh well" to "I can't even play the game right now, what a waste of time".
---
I only play real authentic WoW, I stay away from shitty free games that are fan fiction.
---
Well no one except him, said a invite. So he was 100% just delayed. Otherwise reddit would full of already.
---
OP you really aren't that bright, are you?
---
I prefer horde, alliance races are kinda boring imo. Only race I like there are the dwarves, they are pretty cool, but altogether the ally feels like being the generic good guys (and yes I know there aren't really good or bad here, hence I said "feels like")
---
All in all the "horde feel" really gets through to me, like these ragtag bunch of outcasts. It just gives me a stronger sense of affilation from the get-go.
---
“Just got that in my mailbox, seems like first waves of non streamers are out”
---
Last time i did a proper pug raid was in TBC and it took hours just to get the people together to even start clearing trash, though to be fair the server was mid to low pop, even when we got going it was a cluster fuck because people didn't have a clue what they were doing.
---
Other than the time it takes to get a group together i would expect much of it to be the same (though better addons would help a lot....people STILL stand in shit, and do they even remember where to position themselves on a boss?)

I was in VC at the time. We barely had enough time to kill and loot VC. It was intense and fun.
---
I played in 2004. History only shows 2008's 4-year anniversary challenge. Transation history only shows as early as 2012.
---
&gt; Razorgore the Untamed. - DPS
---
In addition to DPS, we always used warlocks to keep the dragonkins feared until a hunter could pick them up on their kiting path.
---
&gt;Chromaggus. - Shadow DPS
---
We also had the warlocks use their felhunters to help remove debuffs with devour magic on this fight.
---
&gt;but the damage values in Classic Beta clearly don't match 2005.
---
Probably because this game is based on 1.12 which was released in 2006.
---
But assuming you meant "2005" to be analogous with "Classic WoW", there are dozens of threads in this subreddit showing damage numbers are *right*. All the threads that "show proof" that damage numbers are wrong have top-level comments showing that the OP was wrong and that, surprise-surprise, Blizzard has it right.

I started playing at the end of Cata and love the xmog system ever since it was first added. I don’t want it in classic because it’s part of the original MMO experience of having mismatched gear and looking like a total clutz. Also people can look at your gear and see you have BIS, so it adds to the immersion and reputation aspect of the game
---
Easily
---
A twitch account was never required. What is your point?
---
Not arguing against the numbers not matching exactly right now - this is why Blizz is doing a beta test in the first place. I'd take a database backup from the company that actually ran the servers we all played on over "we watched some old youtube videos and came up with some formulas" any day in terms of accuracy. Old Youtube videos are the frosting when Blizzard has the whole cake. There are growing pains due to the conversion and these will get smoothed out as the beta goes on.
---
U dense bro? Or just being annoying on purpose?
---
Thanks breh

I think people avoid PvP servers because they fear feeling inadequate or inferior to someone else who beat them. It's very similar to people who have "Ladder Anxiety" in Starcraft and avoid playing 1v1 games, they fear losing and knowing they aren't as good as they think they are. The best advice I can give you is get over your ego, dying is apart of the game and is often one of the best learning experiences available. Get out there, PvP, die a lot and have fun :D
---
I can quit whenever I want!
---
Just trying to hear what your point is.
---
&gt; it had a CD of 3 mins (? som1 corrected me if this wrong)
---
The buff lasts 10 minutes and it has a 30 second CD :)
---
they suck but the 0.5 upgraded versions are nice for pvp gear if you dont play alot / raid alot by that point otherwise you will probably have better stuff from rolling on pvp gear from raids
---
Tanking 5 end game dungeons as resto would make it pretty rough and not very fun.
---
Okay bye
---
This is so wholesome!!!!
---
that would happen anyway and it dose not effect the "point of the game".
---
Most of the playerbase do not like speed runs, it’s the most commonly cited complaint. They have had to make multiple changes to the + system to try to increase interest in running keys beyond the cap, suggesting most players just do the +10 for the chest and stop. Some players just buy a carry every week. Most players can even do + because they don’t meet the .io requirements (you have to grind rating equivalent to gearscore or pugs won’t accept you).
---
That's seriously one of the best leveling areas I have seen in any MMO. That run from the abbey to Goldshire with Stormwind on your right, it was like being born again into a new world. Everything was so memorable, the Murlocs  with their distinctive sound and 100 yard agro radius, the Kobolds with their phrases and unexpected respawns,  the Defias Brotherhood, your first overarching storyline that was going to stay with you all the way into Deadmines. Every experience in Elwynn Forest was a defining element of World of Warcraft. And then... Stormwind, going through the gates and into the bustling trade district felt like an in-game baptism. The heroes around you, while towering above, stepped on the same ground as you, they had business in the same place as you did. Oh sure you felt small and clueless, but you were now prepared, you had a taste of the danger to come, you had a taste of the glory to attain, you were now part of this world.
---
Was means "retail" ?
---
Does it look different from the red and yellow ele set?
---
My early vanilla-wotlk interactions with GMs proved to me Blizz had the absolute best customer service I'd witnessed from any business ever. Lately it's hit or miss. I've talked to some pretty cold disinterested GMs more recently. Thankfully there are still good ones.
---
But it is fun to kill lvl 50s trying to gank you if you are in a party of 2-3 questing.
---
Sure, that only works against horrible players but usually good players arent ganking low levels either :)
---
I was almost certain I added Fortunate Son. Thanks!
---
Good god, I'm actually going to be playing with retards like you aren't I OP? 
---

I intend to play a Holy Paladin. My goal is to find a group of people who are down for a laugh who are interested in casual-semi serious raiding/PvP. I haven't raided in Vanilla, but I consider myself a reasonably skilled player. I've been playing on and off since the very end of Vanilla. My old gaming buddies have quit, so I'm so stoked to find some new people to play with come August!
---
Yup. There's a reason the first batch of beta invites is small. There's more than enough bugs to go around and they're probably swamped with bug reports as it is.
---
Well considering nobody has any idea what any of the servers are going to be named, no.
---
The goal is always as few as possible, I have no idea what that number is. Blizzard will always want more subscriptions. They will probably check their statistics and see how many people are coming and going from Classic and make their plan based on that after some time has passed. I only hope that whatever they do, they consider carefully.
---
Yeah, OSRS and RS3 are very different compared to WoW and what WoW Classic will be. I think that the experiences of OSRS are probably the closest related experience we've seen though. I think that learning from what worked and hasn't worked for them could possibly help the design of Classic down the road. Not that it will, but it might.
---
Certainly, there will be drama. It honestly depends on what the changes are though. Maybe a year and a half after Naxx has come out Blizzard asks the players, "Would you be interested in a new raid?" I think a lot of people would be interested. I think a lot of people would also be worried and skeptical. People will obviously fight over it on a level that wasn't seen before.
---
Apparently saying streamers seem worse every day means they are scumbags now? Quite a leap you’ve made there. 
---
Also you failed to miss the point of the post in general, and I’m not convinced some of this won’t continue into Classic. Just from this sub alone there are tons of people here who do things I would call ninja looting (rolling need on a blue boe that you sell on AH when a member of the group could actually equip as an example) and so I am not at all convinced things like this won’t carry over.
---
Seems like Blizzard is even having fun again
---
As a lock that raided vanilla, this is truth lol. You could throw Twin Emps in there as a unique encounter, if your guild is using a lock to tank the whole fight and not just initiate the pull.
---
I don't even know what you mean. Like Tichondrius?
---
Good for a Warlock, terrible for a Rogue.
---
Yes. I already bugged it when I ran into it. Please bug report it.
---
Why would you rush to 60 if you never playd wow before? Take your time and enjoy the ride. You're gonna miss out on so much.
---
Thanks for sharing, that was awesome!
---
Understood, but when it comes to filling raid spots it's more about having competent players than min/maxing everything. There are definitely raid-optimal specs, but a lot of specs that get dumped on are raid-viable with the right consumables. Ultimately what matters most is that the bosses die and the guild stays happy. Except Moonkin. They're worthless in every regard.
---
Had this happen a couple of days ago in WC with another hunter, not using a crocodile pet. Every call pet and revive pet gave the group a lag spike.
---
Fan fiction implies they’re fabricated stories. As opposed to a real server people are physically playing on. “Real authentic wow”. Real authentic vanilla hasn’t been around since you were knee high on a grasshopper. People have been min maxing the game since then. While many things will be different, and many things we don’t know the answers to yet; world buff timers being shared, weapon skill giving hit rating, etc, 90% is accurate. Those who’ve been playing private servers will definitely have the advantage. Quests didn’t change. Raid strats. Spec viabilities, and more. Good luck using your classicDB for every little thing ya need to do lol.
---
You’re out of your element, Donnie.
---
Not everyone was 12 in Vanilla. He also said first Warrior not first character.
---
Makes sense, thank you.
---
I'm surprised they haven't tried already. Or if they have, I'm unaware lol
---
I hear this a lot, but having raided from vanilla to now I really don't think players are better at all, I think they just have easier access to information.  There is no mmo specific skills that weren't required far before warcraft was around.  The same people who missed the jump in WC will still miss the jump.  WoW does not and never did require any arcane knowledge only today's players are aware of.  LFR is a far bigger joke than anything Classic had IMO, and the people I got world 2nd nef kill are still among the best raiders now.  Was MC "easier"? I guess, but I hardly expect the playerbase will all have it on farm anymore than they used to, for the exact same reasons.  Guess we'll see.
---
Aye I saw the post scrolling further on and felt like a dumbass but decided to let the comment stay to showcase dumbassery.
---
I rolled 100% of the time on chests during Vanilla and I’ve actually never heard anyone argue against that. It was VERY common practice in Vanilla so your first sentence is just flat out wrong.
---
About that dazed change i don't think that's a loss overall.
---
On Nazjatar you'll have to run through tons of mobs on the edges of the map (the center was mostly empty when i played in the PTR) and for Nazjatar i think the mount equipement preventing dazed is the best. 
---
It could be an unintented change and should it be the case the community response to this is great, but should it be intended by Blizzard i wouldn't really care.
---
You get a daze immunity at the cost of what, an immunity as long as you don't suffer 5 or 10% HP ? Worth it imo, even if you take into account the other mount equipements
---
As a paladin player....
---
You ony wear the dress when you pvp
---
You should have your plate in your bags most of the time and swap it on....Welcome to vanilla
---
Troll Warrior most likely
---
I disagree, expand you mind.
---
yeah, those two should be gone too
---
but i'll take 2/3 over 3/3
---
I swear these things had double the aggro range of every other mob in the game, lol. They were terrifying.
---
L O L N O !
---
Yy61 fz
---
I was a mage. I never once charged for food/drink... anyone who does... good for them I guess. 
---
I wouldn’t charge for portals either though. I’d like to think I had a good reputation on the server, so tips from people out of thanks more than covered mats cost. I’d say something like 50s per was pretty common tip (20s vendor price).
---
It's good for all classes.
---
Sending mail between characters on the same account with an item **and money** is not instant. Items by themselves with no money should take a while and is working as intended.
---
You are for sure. Streaming isn't going away anytime soon. If you think these crazy no lifers who have been practicing on private servers for years zerging together aren't going to be a problem, you're fucking delusional.
---
Heh. Good luck.
---
Between catching up on sleep, cleaning up, and doing housework, you think you'll have time for no-life WoW?
---
Unless the SO is going to be doing all of that, in which case... jeez.
---
Undead Priest. 
---
I plan to level with my good friend from college on his Undead Warlock. DOTs for days, his pets and my heals should make this a very efficient process.
---
You can choose to respec or go restobear.  You won't heal as well but you can tank way better.
---
Didn't blizzard say a long time ago that they DON'T have a backup of the old server-side code?  I thought this was one of the main reasons they used to say they would never recreate classic, because they simply didn't have the data anymore.  Now everyone acts like blizzard has perfect backups from 2004 so either I missed where they said they miraculously found this data, they were lying when they said they didn't have it, or they still don't have it and people are talking out of their asses.
---
;) I will 100% be stealing this in August.
---
Who were you? A bunch of the old crew from Notorious/Fallen Hero/Ascension on Alliance will be returning.
---
I believe blizzard has acknowledged there was an issue with damage mitigation/taken
---
Oh clever for the Chromaggus great use of the locks time while just waiting for a good spell weakness. We used to do something else with the dragonkinds to get them to the hunters, don't quite remember.
---
Druids get most of their threat via attacking, rather than damage, so you can shield them if you want (and should if you know a big hit is coming in), it'll barely do anything.
---
Warriors get most of their rage from taking damage, so shields can hurt them unless it's an absolute emergency.
---
I think this would be more helpful if you did
---
Horde PvP
---
Horde PvE
---
Alliance PvP
---
Alliance PvE
---
Tauren or Orc warrior, not 100% sold on which one yet. I like tanking, DPSing, and PvP, so it's hard to pick since I like both races already.
---
Deep wounds is a low priority debuff meaning that it cannot get in the way of important things, so yes you should take it no matter what so that you can get impale.
---
Being a leader is often about hard decisions. You can't please them all.
---
How could you be 9 years old in 2004/05 when you were born in 98/99?
---
what is the point of calling acitivison blizzard when blizzard is dead
---
All fury warriors spec into deep wounds since it's necessary for Impale (20% crit damage talent.) It will be fine. Just don't be rending the target like a scrub.
---
My 2 cents:
---
Priests are certainly the most versatile!  They are kinda the boy scouts of healing, because they are prepared for any situation.  They truly have a spell for all your healing needs:  Need a HoT, a fast heal, a big heal, a damage mitigation, an AoE heal?  You got it all w/ a priest! 
---
If you want to top the healing meters w/o topping the overhealing meters then paladin is best.  A paladin w/ the right gear and spec are also mana batteries.  But you gotta love being a plate wearer in dress.  =)
---
Shamans and druids are also strong healers and still perfectly viable options, plus they bring lots of group and situational utility.  I like to think of them not strictly as healers, but as support classes (which also can be said about paladins to an extent).  
---
Hope that helps.
---
Source:  Well, I've played and healed on every healing class that WoW has to offer.
---
You sound mad in this comment...
---
&gt;Yeah man, basing Spelladin on Corrupted Ashbringer having a 100% coefficient on its proc with no proof that it ever has is completely correct math. There is no possible way the pserver that Theloras plays on has incorrect values on all proc-based spell effects scaling with SP, right?
---
Thats not being fair. The current best in slot setup does not even include this weapon. You are free to look over the data yourself in our discord and point out if there's anything we are missing. 
---
I am just asking you to please not dismiss the spec based on your opinion of some poster. Jumping to conclusion like you do now without even looking at the data is how misinformation spreads and I would prefer the people dismissing the spec does so by pointing out errors with the actual math and estimates and by finding flaws in our research.
---
Even in WOTLK 3.3.5 some dungeons are quite long and difficult. And all the impatient warriors and DK-s not waiting for mana make it worse
---
Nope. Blizz still hates me.
---
Vanilla is such a classic flavor.
---
Likely a 8-10 gold if you’re advertising daily from 42-60. But that will eat up a fair amount of your leveling time.
---
I mean, adding naxx would complete the guide. Unless it’s all DPS in Naxx. And anything else for AQ40?
---
How does the off-tanking work in those fights? Briefly, if possible. I’ll just watch videos when the time comes for full details.
---
Thanks a bunch!! Super helpful
---
Its also crazy that ClassicWinds managed to get this info in like 3 days of having the beta, while all these othershitbags are trying to win the gurubashi arena every time its up for e-celeb status.
---
i advertise portals with "tips appreciated"....95% of people tip 1g-5g. more on the lower end...
---
anyone who doesnt tip, gets put on my ignore list. ;)
---
This isn't vanilla. Vanilla happened in 2004. This is the remake, in 2019, called classic. Get this weak shit out of here
---
I dont think its just elite damage either, mobs dont seem to crush for much damage.
---
🍿 &lt;- not the kind with sugar.. but with ??
---
Yeah, I use the word "Tank" in off tank very librally lol
---
Riiiiight. I'm not saying its not a good idea or good etiquette. But not every server, group, and player did things the same for the entirety of vanilla.
---
in before mod deletes this
---
This is amazing, just amazing
---
who gives a shit about streamers?
---
I am having the same internal struggle.  I just don't think I can love a dwarf.
---
what value do they add? they just get in the way
---
Lol for real I would pay top dollar for it!
---
Everything is fine and everyone is the problem.
---
Ya knew what they meant didn’t ya.. then who cares
---
I believe deepwounds  is a low priority debuf just like rogue poisons and will be pushed off by anything higher prio 
---
Highest:
---
CC / Roots (Sheep / Seduce / Sap / Gouge / Frost Nova etc)
---
Taunt effects (Taunt, Mocking Block) 
---
High:
---
Curses
---
Sunder
---
Thunderclap / Thunderfury
---
Demo
---
Faerie Fire
---
Hunter's Mark
---
Medium:
---
Vulnerabilities (Winter's Chill, Shadow Weaving, etc)
---
Ignite
---
Gift of Arthas
---
Vamp Embrace
---
Hunter Stings
---
Deadly Poison
---
Mortal Strike
---
Low:
---
DoTs, Longer duration = high priority
---
Trash:
---
Fireball Dot, Deep Wounds, weapon proc debuffs
---
Just play a human, the difference is minimal.
---
No, blizz shouldn't fix them. They have their place.
---
Awesome! Thanks man.
---
biggest advantage?
---
Very good healing ability
---
It's not worth it.  Feral is the best and balance is meh. Resto is terrible to level with.  I'm sure it was for a instance or raid or something along those lines since cap is 30.
---
Computer says no
---
Classic? More like idiot
---
I'm a little confused by the question to be honest, I'm rolling Undead Rogue though.
---
I don’t drink soda.
---
Lot more sperg posts lately.
---
I guess I shouldn't say terrible but a Rogue will have trouble keeping up with the guide one for one. It's better for a rogue to out level the content a bit. Joana has you go do many quests while they're still orange with mobs 3-4 levels higher than you, which can become a pain in the ass for melee.
---
You are dumb and should feel bad
---
This. Even if you just want them to cover cost of mats. 1g/portal isn't going to break anyone's bank if they're highish leveled. If it's a new player trying to make the Darn-SW run (or vice-versa) for the first time, I might do it for free as a courtesy, but most people can at least afford to cover the mats.
---
The elites outside if RFK were hitting waaaaay harder than the ones inside from what I saw
---
People can be there and not know what they are talking about. Vanilla WoW had around 10 million players. That's a lot, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to games like Fortnite and League. Playing video games back then was a big deal because you had to build your own gaming rig, pay a subscription, and have a constant decent internet access. Additionally, it has been 15 years. Do you think most of these people commenting are 45? Nah, they are likely in their 20's. And they remember playing this game when they were a little kid. Most 11 year olds were not legendary end game raiders.
---
can also get ghost mushrooms in mara stealth runs 
---
for killing bosses especially princess u need good gear tho
---
its a beta, its for testing the game to make it ready for launch. If you dont feel the need to do it then dont
---
&gt; Do you actually believe that vanilla raids are harder than a modern hc raid?
---
Raids were tuned different then, mechanics were easier, but gear was much worse, and bosses rarely had enrage timers because healers manapool served as a natural time limit.  
---
Twins in AQ40 were one of the first bosses with enrage timer from what I remember, they enraged after 20 minutes. When we cleared it first time we had healer rotations with spirit gear so they could walk away and regen for a while, and that 20 minute enrage timer was tight, unless all DPS fully buffed with potions and all we lacked the dps needed.
---
I remember BWL was released unfinished, but blizzard hid it by tuning the bosses so hard that they didn't expect anyone to beat them just yet. And when people beat them anyway, they were greeted with a locked door and no bosses on the other side.
---
Naxxramas top guilds at the time only attempted the harder bosses when using all raid world buffs (zg, onyxia, nefarian). Whitout them they didn't stand a chance, wich means they basicly got 1 attempt per day, assuming they could coordinate with other guilds to give them onyxia and nefarian buffs.
---
Regardless of the possibility that people misremember 2005 vanilla, elite mobs never did less dmg than their non-elite counterparts. If that’s happening, then something is off.
---
Advantage ? Little 
---
You can go feral , slap some cloth and heal dungeons if you need
---
Gonna be farming out the Wildheart (cause must collect all the druid things), and then pissing off the rogues for the Shadowcraft set cause Feral =D
---
What a sperg lol
---
Why should they fix them? Survival hunters and ele shammies are good in PvP.
---
Not every spec is amazing at everything! That’s kinda how vanilla was designed! 👍😀
---
Embrace of the viper is the original dungeon set...
---
&gt; Who the fuck calls it classic?
---
Blizzard..
---
.. oh, and r/classicwow.
---
You're not special for hating on streamers
---
There are a few. Best one when ZG hits.
---
The logo literally says World of Warcraft : Classic
---
There's an element of that to it, it's just how gaming works. It's new and streamers have the chance to pull in an audience, more so if you're a lower to mid end streamer trying to get bigger.
---
But when they leave everyone else will? Nah.
---
Omg. Just wrote a big paragraph to explaine and accidentaly deleted it...
---
Can I be somewhere between these two?
---
As someone who never played classic this mindset is baffling to me. Why wouldnt you want classes to be viable?
---
so you're telling me him dying to a campfire isnt funny?
---
I definitely agree with that, except I’ll point out that actually not knowing how “to build correctly” was so much more significant back then. I’m talking about people running dungeons using the wrong armor class, gear with the “wrong” stats, significantly lower level, or even just not having slots filled at all.
---
It sounds like the numbers are indeed undertuned. An complication is an overall general better understood sense of how to gear in the first place. Totally anecdotal, but my memory is that people were *awful* at gearing and understanding even the basic mechanics that affected how damage worked, especially in the beginning. And that’s one way being more skilled will lead to getting hit significantly less hard.
---
I do? What’s your point?
---
HAHAHaaawwww I made myself sad.
---
Oh, I did play Alliance in pre-BC, I had a Warrior on Stormreaver but I didn't PvE much.  I wasn't really a fan of PvE, so I re-rolled Horde.
---
There is no tichondrius in Classic all realm names will be new . If you can be bothered try reaching out to old tich players via the find wow friends tool
---
r U a GeNIuS ?
---
(&gt;v\_v)&gt;
---
Yea I know, the person I replied to said he hoped since people know more will be able to pug zg and aq20 and confirmed this was happening 15 years ago.
---
If you really want to make some "Spare" Money, I would try to do/offer something that really sets you apart and makes you stand out.
---
The first thing that comes to mind could be offering the Service of traveling to the person that needs to be ported from ANYWHERE in the world and Advertise as such.  Charge a standard rate of like
---
1.50-2.00 Gold for a port to any faction appropriate city from anywhere in the world or something along those lines. (Note, I would have all of your FP'S ready beforehand) 
---
I know that sounds time consuming. But the idea here is to make some extra gold so time wouldnt be an issue if you found a happy balance between how much time it takes you to travel to the person vs how much you charge. 
---
Just an idea though.
---
Faerie fire is good too.
---
Fuck. Same.
---
All classes are great and have their utility. There are just a few bad specs in the various talent trees. The only one that I can honestly say has little to no use anywhere is a Moonkin. It's basically a one button rotation that makes them go OOM very quickly, and the spell crit aura in a caster group isn't all that useful. Survival has some decent talents in the tree that boost trap effectiveness so the tree isn't completely useless.
---
I don't think Blizz should "fix" anything until guilds are regularly full clearing Naxx. Let's breathe in those no-change vapors for a bit.
---
5-6 days is very doable as long as you get ahead of the pack.
---
What's your argument here other than a snide remark against retail? Retail and private server bugs are bad for different reasons and are not comparable. Private server bugs are bad because they aren't accurate to retail.
---
He leveled as feral to 30 and respecced at 30 for PvP.  He didn't level to 30 as resto.
---
Just playing the game is beta testing. Not everyone has to be like, testing damage values.
---
Feral DPS really struggled at a lot of stages and I’d say didn’t really become viable until firelands in cata. Wrath saw some but only with damn near BiS gear in ICC
---
We read your post. It's stupid. If you want to look at a toon in specific armor that no one else can see, use [this](https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room) and leave the rest of us alone please.
---
Because classic isn't a game about looking however you want while having any stats that you want to go with that look.
---
You won't hit exalted before you run out of quests.
---
I don't expect a beta key, because it's only available to active subs... and i'm not subbing just for a chance.
---
This is actually a really good point outside of #nochanges
---
Haha. More of a pepsi/coke kind of guy myself. I probably havent drank more than 10 cans of mountain dew in my entire life lol.

What a absolutely trivial thing to whine about. Its been proven that it worked the way it does currently on private servers in vanilla. It's not griefing, its clever use of game mechanics. Instead of crying like a little baby bring opposite faction friends to kill / cc the mage because the mafia sure will.
---
Devilsaur leather is very valuable, you should expect people who try to control it to use every trick in the book to keep it under their control. Stuff like this is a slippery slope, next they will remove snowballs stunning and other "toxic" behavior and eventually you can't even have fun anymore because of fear that someones feelings will be hurt by your actions over the internet.
---
This is not retail, vanilla is a game of extremes.
---
If I get the beta I will try it out, mainly to see how it looks on my PC and how much smoother is runs than private servers. I really don't care that much though, the gameplay in the beta is still 99% the same as private servers except you are capped and limited to what you can do.
---
Because most people will be playing the OP classes. Warrior, (who's a hybrid with no hybrid tax, best/only tank and great pvp and pve dps) Rogue and Mage.
---
The game is made for them, of course they don't want others to compete.
---
The water disappears though, I never paid for food because I was in a guild. You’re better off doing it free and accepting tips
---
It’s funny don’t worry I laughed.
---
PVE ONLY:
---
Paladins will out heal Priest on about %25 of certain Endgame Fights because of simple mechanical differences in the kit. Also I don't remember which- but Druids outpace Paladins and Priests on a certain BWL fight because of the Rejuv. spam.  So while you're right a Priest healer is the "best", the other two are still needed just in a smaller number. The reasons why they are needed are things like: Bubble, Innervate, Cyclone, HoJ, Thorns  etc etc. Plus the fights I mentioned above with the mechanics that cater to Druid and Paladin Kits. 
---
Hope that helps!
---
That's not really what I mean, I was wondering what server Tich players would be migrating to.  I'll keep an eye on things though so I know which server to pick.
---
What makes this hard is that you need to make sure the video is actually from 1.12.1 Undocumented patch changes might mean that something doing X in a video doesnt necessarily mean it wont behave like Y on the Beta.
---
I'd recommend the prot paladin take up engineering for bombs, ranged pulls and for a nice big initial threat dump on packs, as well as to help interrupt spell cast. You could probably make a macro for casting Blessing of Protection on target of target for a poor man's taunt. Put all your talents into holy until level 20 so you can have consecration, and have multiple ranks of it on your bars. There's a lot of fun you can have with a paladin tank to make up for your downfalls.
---
No changes hype boys
---
i always read read as read first, instead of read
---
PvP much?
---
How could you not notice that your shadowbolt only did 20 damage? 🤣
---
Yeah it's totally not like he ran into it on purpose or anything.
---
Doubt it
---
From reading other comments on /r/classicwow over the last week my suspicion is that it was more common to roll, and either the server I was on or the people I knew did it oddly. I was just stating that I don't remember doing it that way.
---
I don't think I'd have ever argued w/ rolling for chests. It sure sounds easier.
---
As long as everyone in the group isn't a jerk, it works out. :D
---
That is a probably a big part of it. The last time I really played vanilla was around the time blizzard was releasing new servers. Long before 1.12
---
That guys inbox looking for a Dps for RFC is going to be blown up
---
atleast someone has a sense of humor. not sure how this post is seen as hating.
---
oh yeah deff, I remeber being in 10-15 man pugs of ZG and it going mostly fine back in the day, I just don't think were going to see many naxx pugs, that are not "naxx trash run!"
---
Incapacitation is NOT a stun. Thus, damage breaks it.
---
same, these streamers are the worst... we need to have like a website with clips of them getting ganked
---
the whole party is almost BiS for level 30. is it that outrageous that they stomp through a dungeon?
---
Done. Thanks.
---
Herbalist gloves (alliance BoE vendor pattern, level 33 leather gloves with an innate +5 herbalism) + Advanced herbalism is +10.
---
so herbalism on tauren with a pair of enchanted herbalist gloves is 325.
---
How do I delete someone else's post.
---
I haven't even played on any private server for years, I've been playing retail instead (I know, weird). But I definitely agree with this.
---
I get his point and agree with the principals of it I just think it’s an over reaction since it’s a beta. I see people in comments saying it’s the same as getting an upgrade later and replacing it. It’s all going to be wiped and the cap is 30 so no it’s not the same thing. I’m not here to try and encourage ninja looting in any way but I don’t think someone doing that on a beta where everything gets reset is that big of a deal. You can not compare it to the same thing as someone taking an item on live servers.
---
&gt; Would have an impact on PVE and PVP. 
---
Nope none at all
---
I remember watching my Grandpa play Diablo 1 on his super old computer when I was 3 or 4. One day he let me play his maxed out wizard and I loved it. Been playing Blizzard games ever since then. I've played WoW since mid vanilla off and on. Didn't have stable internet during beta and early vanilla but I kept up with it. I bought the atlas and the strategy guides and planned out my routes and imagined what the areas I hadn't been to looked like. 
---
I know there are tons of people with similar stories. I still don't really feel like I'm owed an invite, I'm just so excited to play. It's like meeting up again with a fond friend from middle school that you lost touch with. I think people are so frustrated with retail and classic is a way to have the game they love back. 
---
I understand not being invited is also frustrating and having to watch streamers, influencers and a select few have fun while we're stuck with the dumpster fire of BfA is disappointing at best. People just gotta have patience though. I know in my heart that this is gonna be an amazing experience and it's worth the wait.
---
It’s a stress test for 2 hours, not a beta.  The people they are “letting” do the stress test aren’t getting into the beta to actually play the game.  Blizz is just allowing them to have a frustrating 2 hours of trying to login and server crashes without rewarding them with any sort of beta access, what a deal!
---
Because XP can be determined by a lot of different factors like group bonus, level difference etc.
---
Honestly the best evidence for XP values is looking through Joana's unedited 1-60 speedrun and compare.
---
it's really lame that's why. i mean fuck really??
---
I've not seen a single person gatekeep anyone away from anything on your list.
---
the 31 elites hit him for 60+ damage which is not out of the ordinary considering he is BiS for level 30
---
Gnome mage 👶🏻
---
Look I'm not here to talk shit, everyone levels and plays at there own pace, some people have more time than others, but 1-60 in 5 months? And it sounds safe to assuming you used lvl1 shadow bolt (and probably your other spells too) the WHOLE time leveling? DEAR LORD JESUS, that's a World class Fuck up if ive ever heard one ROFL.
---
There's an heirloom mount. You sit in the sidecart of a motorcycle and some Orc butler "chauffeurs you around".
---
Yes, it's exactly as retarded as you're imagining.
---
Actually those sets are one of my most important reasons to pick a certain class. I would love playing a warlock but the priest set looks so great in my opinion. I know I will never get full tier 1 or 2 because I won‘t have enough time but maybe I can achieve this
---
If I would have to pick one favorite set rn it would be... Plagueheart for robe and Heroism for chest and legs (note: I almost never wear helmet (and also almost never back)).
---
This. Day one acct here, played religiously until end of Legion. Canceled due to the disaster that BfA was. Blizz will 100% get and keep my money for years to come on three accounts if they succeed with WoW Classic.
---
Then if that's the case they will know how to play and will be a part of a progression guild. The streaming is just the times.
---
Awesome thank you. Any specific link to the build you use?
---
retail is basically just videogame-facebook at this point lmao
---
I was 15, and I recall plenty, I had two 60 mages, and a 60 rogue, I completed all the content except PvP grind past centurion because of school and I have hundreds of days of raiding experience outside end of mop/warlords(end of college break.) 
---
To assume I’m “out of my element” is absolutely absurd. My credentials far surpass whatever private server noob that was was too poor to play the real game.
---
Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat ass
---
I can't wait to do this. Idk what class to play I think I'm going rogue. Who knows
---
But it does.
---
The whole concept of gearing and raiding/PvPing in vanilla is also to look good. Transmog threw that away. Back then you could recognize people from the gear they were wearing, you'd know he was a hardcore raider or pvpr.
---
With transmog everyone is more unique, but at the same time, there's no way to know what that guy achieved.
---
(of course you can now say "achivevments!" and then we get another retail thing that, at the first glance, wouldn't affect the social aspect of the game, but it did, just like transmogs and mounts)
---
Colorblindmode is mandatory, they can get sued if they are not colorblind friendly.
---
Battlenet existed before WoW just saying
---
Who cares what they do you ask? Like what kind of question is that. Think about the stuff you say 5 minutes before you say them. This is literally the same behaviour we face with esfand. Hes the one talking out of his ass the most ouf of anyone i see, not being careful about what his opinions bring to the community.  And yes people do care what he does, and no this conversation isn't about what Theloras does. The problem with this is the public opinion getting shifted towards unreliable information, which is hurting the classic experience.   
---
I mean one fix would be to not have the public be full of people like that, but you know look at our world and society. The biggest, loudest and most social power gamy voice has the most impact, the intelligent carefully written and research opinion has the least. Thats the behaviour of an ape when you put him into modern society.
---
Meanwhile, Im over here with my beta key but will likely take the next two months deciding what to play so I will never get to enjoy it...
---
Hey now.  I didn’t read the manual and I recall that the yellow messages said you learned shadowbolt level so I ‘assumed’ that it was automatically moved to your bars like in command and conquer where you get a new unit to build when you have a new structure
---
Oh well 🤣
---
He's playing a hybrid build for lvl 30 PvP
---
Then I guess you haven’t seen the threads saying that if someone plays on a PvE server then they’re playing a “half game” and classic isn’t for them. Or the post that hit top of the sub the other week saying that questie needs to be banned as well as anyone who uses it.
---
Classic is not supposed to be "Vanilla 2.0" that fixes it's flaws.  It's supposed to be as close as we can make it to a time capsule, or a preservation piece.  Make no mistake, crappy class balance *was* a flaw of Vanilla -- I think that is pretty objectively bad game design by a bunch of devs who weren't quite sure what they were doing yet.  But it was what it was.
---
I didnt get it, can anyone explain pls?
---
I accidentally used the wrong healthstone for awhile, people thought I was just being an asshat lol and giving them bum stones so I wouldnt have to anymore. Well thats exactly what happened and by the time I switched over no one rly ever asked me anymore!
---
I'm sure. I would play it off as purposely if I did it as well.
---
I am aware, its not like theres anyother reason for blizzard to do it. Especially with the whole "you think ypu do, but you dont" comment
---
Hunter=easy mode always and forever.
---
You mean Tier .5
---
Moonkin is definitely shit especially since the better pvp build for balance does not even get moonkin form
---
PvE wise, probably mage. You basically just spam frostball for the first 2 patches.
---
They are (generally) at the low end of pure dps. Its just that people on reddit obsess over O P T I M A L.
---
And it is all useless unless they actually report stuff, or at the very least encourage their viewers to report what they see.
---
You will probably be able to do this with some sort of Tmorph program.
---
i fully expect to be rolling against warlocks to get a Cruel Barb. we in 2019 now
---
No explanations needed, just opinions, which yes is a clear one.
---
The 101 hit could be a crushing blow or something. Those might not be indicated properly in whatever combatlog addon this guy is using.
---
They are being a pedant. Just ignore them.
---
On a fresh server no one will have or be willing to spend gold to save them a little bit of time.
---
There's a mountain of middle ground between no changes and 'before you know it we have BfA!' that people will ignore to argue their points.
---
It's a huge unknown. In an ideal world? If they could do it 'right' and make it a hugely positive experience for everyone? Yes please.
---
Alliance music is better.
---
Hunter and rogue
---
If I go to the gym with 4 other pre-chosen people, and we meet 5 other people who came together there and decide to play a game of basketball, it's still a pick-up game...so two established raid groups would still be a pickup group by that measure.
---
&gt;You should have seen the smile on his face when he quested through Northshire on his new human rogue. He was extremely slow, having to look a few seconds at the keyboard before pressing any button at all, and more or less keyboard slamming when he got into combat.
---
All you had to say was that he rolled a rogue.
---
look i can down vote too lolololol
---
Thanks! Added :)
---
Too many variables for a new player. The amount of time he would spend searching for shit would outweigh any advantage he would get to get ahead of the pack. Where's his mount trainer? Did he actually turn in that quest at the same location he picked it up at? Is he going to tab out and google the answer? All of these factors are going to eat away at the time. I would be shocked if the over-average players were getting to 60 in less than 100 hours played, much less someone new.
---
Nah, I'll keep using pirated windows, watching pirated streams and playing private servers with old wow expansions.
---
I'll be playing classic when it launches, but until then pirate servers were our only option.
---
I was about to click in to here to make fun of you for riding the streamer hate-train, but I legitimately laughed when he died at the end on that fire.
---
Orc.  25% stun resist is just tooooooo good.
---
Guess i'm the virgin min-maxxer.
---
It would be one thing if it was a small %.  But 25%? Gimmie Gimmie
---
Classes should have their own niches. Who cares if you don't pull amazing numbers if you bring something valuable. No class as a whole is trash. I'm playing shaman, because; I love having utility and don't care where my numbers fall, however I may be playing resto shaman so maybe i'm doing FoTM? MoP had great class utility all around and classes were their own thing. Homogenization arose because everyone hated that blizzard made people bring the class and not the player. Except when you homogenize everything raids took the class and not the player anyways.
---
Leave classes alone, leave them in their niches and touch absolutely nothing.
---
Classic.db is a private server database of guessed values, comparing it to beta is moronic.  
---
Also lets look at 154-183 (again, pserver values).  
---
Simply Devotion Aura + Bearform is around 28% DR on its own.  That is to say, if the tank has 0 gear, his buffs will reduce 183 to 133.  Lets say the druid has like 300 armor, which would turn into 840 in bear, combined with 770 from devo+bear, and we get 1,610 armor.  1,610 armor vs 19 lvl mob is 44% DR.  
---
Lets take (183+154)/2 = 168 avg dmg * 0.56 = 94dmg.  
---
Then we look at the video, and what do we see.  58-89 damage.
---
Mage is very easy for raiding and leveling. The skill cap for PvP is pretty dang high though. 
---
Hunter or warlock gets a pet to help save them from stupidity and makes solo content dead easy.
---
No one is questioning the strategy that they used, and you really don't need to whack me in the head with your econ101. But classic -&gt; TBC -&gt; WotLK is not where people were "turning away". Hence why I said "part", not "parts" where it's wrong
---
Because even specs that are considered shit overall have moments of glory. And when you have those moments of glory that no one else can experience, you’ll understand.
---
BFA has corrupted your mindset because all roles have the same goals and only judged relative to that. I’m not going to downvote you because you have no reference point, but play the classes in classic before you make suggestions.
---
One button class, exclusively defensive.
---
I started to finally interact with other players once I hit 60 and was invited into a guild because they needed warlocks.  When asking them how much their bolts hit for, I told them mine and it was then said, uhh you need to drag your new spells onto your bar
---
AHHH fuck.  From earlier post, no I didn’t play wow every 8 hours a night.  I only got to play 1-2 hours after work.  Military hours sucked when I joined, the war in Iraq was still a hot topic so 12-14 shifts I go!
---
Just put a post-it note on your monitor where your character is with a drawing of what you’d like them to look like, easy.
---
Dude, Aspect of the Pack is really high maintenance to keep off.
---
Yes 100% they should fix them, as someone who spent a lot of time playing vanilla and private servers it honestly sucks being forced to play certain classes in order to enjoy content.
---
I’m not saying an overhaul but a little buffs here and there to atleast make classes viable. 
---
Druids are a useless class, that are only useful for a single ability. That is stupid.
---
Take the osrs approach start off vanilla and then fix to support the community. Don’t dumb down classes, but vanilla to be truthful was awful as far as optimization, even BC sucked as far as that. 
---
It’s stupid to have play a quarter of the classes if you want to participate in the game. And then having to play a different class if you want to participate in pvp. 
---
You may disagree or agree but the same people who are saying no change probably play warrior mage, warlock, or rogue. 
---
If you want to game to last longer than a year this needs fixed.
---
There's one reason and its a good one. Because then it wouldn't be vanilla. Vanilla is a game of flaws and weird game design decisions. The point of Classic isn't to fix them, it's to bring them back.  
---
Blizzard could make a cool version of vanilla with tons of stuff fixed and rebalanced. But it wouldn't be anything like vanilla that people remember.
---
Chad! Chad! Chad!
---
People have been gatekeeped all their lives without realizing.  Its tough to expect someone who currently gatekeeps to suddenly become introspective, realize his wrongs, and come back to reddit with a new perspective.  Most people who try classic wow will be more openminded
---
I legit thought for a second it was serious since the stress test is coming. Tbh
---
Dude it’s not live severs and where have they said that once vanilla is “over” that they are going to shut down the severs. You’re being ridiculous with your everything gets shut down eventually meaning beta and live are equal. Everything you do in a beta essentially doesn’t matter since none of it transfers over.  Your logic is so flawed trying to compare taking a cloak in a live game to taking it on a beta. I get it’s a bad practice but in the end it doesn’t matter since the cloak is going to end up being erased as well as everyone’s characters.
---
Holy shit, this is great. I don't even remember the last time GM actually wrote some message like this on retail.
---
Yeah and you were the best player ever, too! Your credentials definitely surpass those of us that have done both. Too poor? Is that why I got a beta invite? For being too poor to have a sub since release? Lmaooo. Take care Broseph. If you can’t understand that someone who has been playing the game in its OG state in that time frame, may have more knowledge than a guy who hasn’t played in 12 years then so be it lol.
---
pls stop already with this shit. for real already. yes it might be that base dmg is a slight bit higher on classic then it is on private servers. we are talking like 1-2 dmg more. but this doesnt factor in ability dmg. and for most of the mobs on private servers, they have just 1 rank higher then they have on classic. also you miss way more on private servers then you do on classic. how do i know all this? i spent the last 3 months leveling on private servers to get better at it and the difference between private and classic is night and day. go to any private server and kill vile familiars in the orc starting zone. on classic the fireball does like 3 dmg. on k3 they do 18 dmg. also the best lore stuff doesnt show armor values for classic. you cant just go and see that on classic mobs do 1 more dmg then they do on private servers and then go WELP CLASSIC IS HARDER
---
Yes, you seem very smart indeed
---
if he has never played wow he will have a hard time getting ahead of the pack.
---
I remember every zg run though skipping Jindo, like he didn't exist.
---
Soda just mentioned that until 30 deep feral has 0 ability which is better then nature swiftness and the dot talent. Only receive the faerie fire😒 I’m a bit confused 😭I thought feral I cool but I just don’t know the vanilla an mainly Druid in and out😀
---
you won't get kicked out of dungeons for not having a raid-viable spec. it's just dungeons.
---
luckily, the hybrid classes don't really need to be a healing spec to heal raids until like AQ40/Naxxramas. i remember healing in my feral spec in BWL after the talent changes moved Innervate to a baseline ability with just the talent that reduced my HT cast time.
---
I am restarting bnet every 30 minutes come oonnn
---
Feral was plenty good in Ulduar.
---
No this is a terrible idea. The reason for the "huntard" meme is because of shitty players playing the class, not that the class is easy. The huntard comes from the amount of ways you can fuck over your party by being bad, like leaving up aspect of the cheetah, ninja pulling, pet pulling. The class is not new player friendly and simple to play like mage.
---
Very true
---
Thanks bud
---
PvE = You can have either factions on the same server if you want
---
PvP = Only one faction per server.
---
while is goals are ambitious and dubious, please refrain from telling other people how to find enjoyment
---
Neither of these dudes know what they’re talking about. It’s just getting viewers by saying shit that’s wrong to generate controversy and make people watch their clip.
---
Jeff Kaplan has earned my steadfast respect in the industry, and I'll happily follow whatever path he blazes next.
---
No it wouldn't. I don't see why people just want the same select few OP classes. They must play them or something. I see no harm in wanting updates and active work on classic instead of set and forget. Having a stagnant server where absolutely nothing changes is incredibly boring, and everyone will be playing the same spec/class. 
---
Why wouldn't they? They KNOW it's going to be OP indefinitely, and the flip side, there's no hope if their hybrid class sucks because it will stay bad. I completely want classic the same, but keeping everything exactly the same is just stupid. There was a reason you never saw ret pallies, enh shaman's, feral druids, etc. And it's not a good reason.
---
It also leaves no excitement to patch notes, or an authentic classic feel. In classic shit didn't just "stay the same", it was always changing. It's kinda ironic that people want it exactly how it was, yet no class balancing updates. To be clear, I don't want today's balance, I want the rock-paper-scissors balance.
---
Starting area is 0.1% of the game
---
Hyperbolic statements all around otherwise the real side of the situation could come through, you only know that you apparently don't care. And the fact that out of all the people not caring you took your time to care and reply, that shows a big statement already. Theloras has one of the biggest reputations for being very knowledgeable on paladins, and while he doesn't know everything, he doesn't try to claim by just talking out of his arse(if you weren't as lazy to read up on what you care about you'd see the situation yourself)
---
I got roped into the warlock with the cinematic.  I was like where’s my infernal? I want my rock pet!  Ugh I am dreading the ashenvale quest to get your succubus.
---
I played way more real vanilla than pserver vanilla and I remember elite damage and tanking being much harder than what we've seen from beta.
---
The no-email situation seems to only have applied to influencers and those on the Friends &amp; Family-list, as for the rest of us, at least according to this sub, an e-mail seems to appear 2-3 hours after you've been granted access.
---
Excuse me fellas
---
Mage or Hunter.
---
It was a reference to Pservers. Hunters have smaller dead zones on Pservers.
---
Is there any indication on how easy it is to get a beta key? 
---
I currently don't have an active subscription, so I obviously won't get an invite, but I have considered subscribing just for the chance to get a beta key. I don't have any interest in getting back into BfA atm, so the question is the odds good enough for the investment. (Like 50% of the old accounts etc)
---
&gt; Just playing the game is beta testing.
---
If we were talking about some unfinished product instead of completed game that needs polishing then yeah, you could find crashes and lots of stuff randomly breaking just by playing. Classic is already 99% stable and polished, to actually find the incorrect stuff you have to be on the lookout for it and report it, which streamers don't, they only care about making money from the massive viewership.
---
he's a streammer so he's obv entitled to that loot
---
Just wanted to mention that we did look into this and the damage by elites in WoW Classic is matching what we have from the 1.12 reference client once a character is setup with the same gear/abilities.
---
Thank you for the report!
---
Looking for a guild that will be raiding early Saturday and/or Sunday mornings EST. Something like 7:00/8:00am - 11:00 or so. Haven't really found anything like this.
---
Lockpicking is not a profession, it's a skill the rogue brings. If the rogue wants to be greedy, he won't be getting free food and portals from me.
---
If only the engineer can open, he gets first pick. But I would expect him to share anything he doesn't need. It's a team effort.
---
Paladin or Hunter
---
Which is a big indication of don't talk about something you do not know, a lot of them have streaming wow for longer than most people have played wow on this sub, I would bet on that.
---
But then again I could just generalise some sentence about the lot of them and not be bothered, why use my brain when I could just spout nonsense on the internet.
---
&gt;and you plan to equip it right this second in the case of BoEs
---
I wish rolling Need  turned a BoE into BoP.
---
Rolling Greed should leave it as BoE, so it can be sold.
---
Ah well being tired from being a soldier is a good excuse.  Thanks for your service.
---
Orc Hunt/ Undead mage
---
also as a lock or a hunter you rely less on gear, rogue very much relies on weapons
---
Did you see his face ? Lol... dude is a retail baby
---
Survival hunter is viable in raids, brings a lot of cc and utility in dungeons (you can cc 3 mobs for 20+ seconds), and is exceptionally scrappy in duels and pvp.
---
Survival hunter is my favorite hunter spec in vanilla and I took it through aq40.
---
TOS cannot supercede law.
---
I hope everyone gets that chance!
---
fear ward is so significant - I would urge you to go that route if you can get over it even just a little.
---
11/10 not the quality of meme we deserve.
---
Thanks for confirmation :)
---
By banishing on a boss fight, I mean banishing on literally one easy boss fight in MC and then never again. And by occasional off-tanking, I mean there's a single boss in AQ that is immune to physical damage, so one potential strat is to have a lock that's decked out with shadow resist tank it. The majority of guilds stopped doing that afaik and just have the lock do the initial pull. 
---
There is no real "active" raid utility other than those 2 very specific bosses. That's perfectly fine though. I loved raiding as a lock in vanilla and I might roll it again. 
---
That being said, if you are looking for a class with actual raid utility in the sense that you will have varying responsibilities on different encounters (not on 2/33 bosses) then I honestly think mage and hunter both provide more nuance than warlock.
---
I guess my original post was too ambiguous, or even wrongly worded, is that's the issue? I was referring to the act of wpvp. For the, what, 3rd time? I wasn't talking about corpse camping, whether it's what blizz considers fair or not. The "fair interaction" I was referring to "red ambushes blue, blue dies, red and blue move on". I also agreed on the stance that in the case of corpse camping that, yes, it's frustrating and therefore a stressful waste of time in what's meant to be a FUN waste of time. Not sure where to clarify beyond this point.
---
Man wish i could be a bad ass pirate like this guy.
---
You can easily do it as druid given half the resto tree is useless for healing anyway. 0/0/51 meme specs.
---
same, i dont hate streamers, but funny is funny /shrug
---
Or maybe, just MAYBE, blizzard have it right and a bunch of people who reverse engineered a custom server based on pure guesswork are the ones who have no clue. Or are you going to post bug reports for your broken /sit macro not working as well?
---
&gt;Theloras has one of the biggest reputations for being very knowledgeable on paladins
---
On private servers, which have been showing just from 1-30 testing to be inaccurate at just about everything. He can be the best Paladin he wants on pservers, but he needs to stop trying to stir up drama because people who actually care about Classic don't hold his "theories" to any credibility.
---
fun fact, you cant let people do anything so regardless its all pointless
---
i did the same thing, good luck to you!
---
Yeah, you are the one that has to deal with the character you choose every day, pick what makes you happy.
---
Do what you want cause a pirate is free
---
good
---
I will be playing a Resto Druid. I played one during retail Vanilla and three different private servers. I like the utility aspect of: 
---
-Keeping Faerie Fire on every mob
---
-Using soothe beast to allow all casters to precast on beasts
---
-Keeping up MotW on everyone in the raid + Thorns on tanks
---
-Battle Resing, innervating, decursing as needed
---
But I also like how everyone is under the impression Druids cannot keep up on the healing meter and proving them wrong. I've never had issues pumping out similar HPS to the other healers. That said, I'm use to being the only Druid in the raid (so I can HoT freely) and my guild's have always leaned toward stacking as much dps as possible, which results in less heal sniping. 
---
The reason many people seem to think Druids cannot keep up on the healing meter is they are bringing way too many healers to their raids. When you have too many healers, HoT's get sniped and Healing Touch is a slower cast than every other class's "primary" heal.
---
It's entirely possible..
---
My bet is that the population of the servers will die down heavily once the next hot game comes around and whatever guilds are left will be in need of consistent raiders - if I make it that far.
---
Its going to matter as the changes we see to classic over time will be driven by the community as a whole.
---
Streamers stream Classic because it's popular, or Classic is popular because of streamers.
---
I am surprised you chose the latter.
---
Thats the problem i need a well made guide where every move is consider and not random
---
All classes are viable. Class doesn't mean spec like it does in modern WoW, where every spec gets different spells. Some specs are specialized for certain types of content.
---
They probably forgot to crank the ezMode property all the way down.
---

Go play retail if you want transmog, quit trying to change our fucking game before it's even out.
---
Alliance, only because of Dwarves. They're so great.The flavor of Dwarves and the city of Ironforge, their culture, and the snowy hills of that first zone tells you everything about them - Dwarves are team players, they are hardy, steadfast, friendly, and fierce all at once. Keep yer feet on th' Ground!
---
it's not really, but cool man.
---
Too true. I've been like, "Maybe if I play 30min of retail it'll make my account look more active and more likely to get chosen..."
---
"Maybe if I create a new character and play old content it'll show I'm eager to playtest classic..."
---
"Maybe if I log into 3 characters, swap realms, log into 2 more, delete a character, and bang the keyboard 3 times, it'll refresh my launcher with beta access"
---
GOGOGO!
---
Yeah, I mentioned that early on when nost dropped on their bug forums, I was told I was wrong \^.\^ so glad I decided to report it!
---
&gt;Well if that raid gives better gear than the rest, you know at that very moment the game is screwed, so lets assume its not like naxx, but easier with weaker gear. Therefore its within vanilla.
---
It would probably start there. There's a lot of room for exploring raids for different size groups. The hardest 10-man content isn't very high tier.
---
&gt;What is you opinion on people that Want "true OSRS vanilla". If that number one day becomes big enough, will you give them that server.
---
I think what they want is perfectly normal. Provided that it's feasible to provide it (in terms of server costs and such) I think they should get that if there's enough interest. Years down the road, I think it's natural people will want "the way it was" to come back once again. I don't think that that means OSRS did the wrong thing though. The people playing the game seem to enjoy it and OSRS has grown larger than the game it was born from in the process.
---
&gt;This is 2019 blizzard and they are part of ACTIVISION. I mean... that alone should be enough to make people think twice when they ask about possible new content.
---
Let's focus on enjoying Classic as it comes to use for now and worry about the longevity of the game (if at all) later. Maybe two years down the road we will have more faith in the Classic team. Maybe we'll feel the opposite. I think being purely skeptical of Blizzard because of Activision's role in their decline is doing us a disservice. Developers are human beings and they want to deliver the best content they can. Corporate might breathe down their necks to implement changes to make more money, but I think in the case of WoW Classic that they will have to back off if they want to succeed. If they don't and the game turns out for the worse because of it, then people will vote with their wallets and cancel their subscriptions.
---
To add to this I played a shaman in Legion and BFA. In Legion I had zero issue finding random m+ groups. In BFA NO ONE would invite me. Shamans were (are they still? seems it to me since i resubbed last night) broken as fuck in BFA and Blizz said they had zero intention of a remake to fix it so no one would invite shamans. This meant that my io rating was signficantly lower than my actual skill level should have had it at which even further added to my not getting invited to groups. 
---
Literally just because of Blizzard class design I wasn't getting invited to groups because the timer mechanic makes it so hardcore people won't fuck with broken classes/specs or low ios (or both in my case). It snowballs fast and you get stuck only being able to 2/3 chest low keys or do higher ones as a wipe-fest not making the timer because those are the only groups you get invites to.
---
Hey look, a post about streamers
---
You can if they sold it to you.
---
I mean this was a thing all the way up until WotLK if I remember correctly. Why do these people go on the internet and tell lies?
---
Tauren shaman. Was one of the first characters I made back in the day, rogue being the first, and I'm looking forward to having my totems back. You can't imagine how dissapointed WoD made me when they culled all my totems.
---
I get your point. How about, "I was a red ridge roof, and astranaar ganker, till I took an arrow to the knee"
---
Hoes Mad
---
If i dont rush lvl i  gonna be behind ?! and join weak guild  cuz there will be no place in top ?
---
Why are you even here?
---
The entire point of Classic is to have a copy of vanilla to play with like-minded people, not going down a slippery slope to vaguely readjust things to "simulate" how hard it felt 14 years ago.
---
Like what are you going to do? You can double the health of every boss in the game, but people will still know the fights. If it's numerically possible, poopsockers will do it within a few tries because they know the encounters so well.
---
If you haven't accepted the fact that people who mastered this game over the last decade are going to blast through it, you might want to get out now, because that's the reality of relaunching a game.
---
i just want to get Beaststalker  2 Bone Slicing Hatchet and Ancient Bone Bow in Classic its probably the most time i spent in any set
---
Level 19 bear with devo aura and thick hide only needs like 280 armor on gear to hit that DR level, easily achieved.
---
&gt;Just because private server players are angsty about Blizzard as a company doesn't mean they should make a Reddit post about every single thing in Classic they think is wrong.
---
Please don’t listen to this. If you think something is wrong bring it up, we are in a testing phase for a reason. It’s okif your wrong or mis remembered, Blizzard has said on multiple occasions they need this type of feedback to make sure they get it right.
---
&gt; I don't see why people just want the same select few OP classes. 
---
Because I want to see how Classic *was*, not how it *should have been*. That includes botched class balance. I want to experience the original game, but since it doesn't exist anymore, this is the oportunity to go as close as I can to that version. If they try to fix it, they are going against their design directives.
---
I feel like I have to point out that Hunters are complicated. Trying to manage a pet and a dead zone in a dungeon with tight quarters is a nightmare. (Looking at you, Uldaman!)
---
Default casting bar is too high on the screen, in vanilla if you didnt have a pet up it would be very close to your action bats, if you did have a pet up it would be higher on the screen, but not as high as it is now.

Generally, large streamers go by PServer directions and rulesets. They barely test bugs.
---
If you want a streamer that actually understands, and uses good referencepoints, tune in to Joana at twitch.
---
It's imba
---
“Big yikes” - your entire guild hearing about your 25 damage shadow bolt
---
Every class is viable, not every spec is viable for every situation, that's what we basically have today in BFA and one of many reasons why it's such a boring class to play.
---
Every class had something to bring to the table in Classic, and starting to open the door to class changes will change the game entirely, it wont be classic anymore, the meta will change, it's just never a good idea.
---
None of the class design is changing in classic. Is this what you are asking?

Please do enlighten me on what changes we will see.
---
Only when soloing. As soon as you do group content it's a different story.
---
5 months to 60 is not a ludicrously long time. I have heard leveling times for the average player quoted as anywhere between 7 and 12 days of /played. Let us say it took 10 days. Thats 240 hours. 240 days divided by 20 weeks is 12 hours a week. That is a couple of hours each evening, or a reasonable chunk of each weekend.
---
If you are also levelling alts, or playing low level battlegrounds, or messing around with friends, or farming particular instances for gear it is easy to see how the time to 60 can be inflated even further.
---
There will be a fair number of people that hit 60 in the last month of Phase 1 or later in Classic just because of the time they have available to play.
---
Most of the classes tend to flip
---
The easiest ones in PvE tend to become teh most complex in PvP.
---
So classes like healers, warlocks, and mages are very easy in PvE (although there are some things that require skill, and healing difficulty is all dependent on raid/comp, very easy in a good group tho)
---
Warlocks have extreme complexity in WSG
---
Paladins while slightly more complex because of the oh shit buttons is more about reaction in PvE. BoP, lay on hands, maybe a clutch freedom or something. But there is very little to do reltaive to a hunter or warrior in PvE when things are going as expected.
---
In PvP it flips. Paladin/Shaman/warlock become the most complex from a decision standpoint. There is rarely a perfect pixel to place ur totem. Hard decisions make constantly by shamans. Warlock cursing alone is more complex than most classes in WSG. And paladin's have to dance more support CD's than anyone in the game in PvP. Just deciding how to use ur blessings optimally is only really matched by the conundrum of what is the perfect curse at teh perfect time for a warlock.
---
After playing years of Pservers the biggest tip I can give by far is to never do a single dungeon with randoms. Always full guild group or nothing at all. I've lost so many single digit drop chance items to literal imbeciles we had to drag to the last boss by force basically. Doing 50 runs of a place only to lose the item you need that FINALLY drops to some random just because you gave in and thought to yourself "he wont be a piece of shit right? come ooon its not that bad". Don't be weak and always either guild group or master loot the boss. Obviously inform the people joining that you are after x and will master loot the boss to be sure. 
---
Always wanted a mark of the dragon lord on my druid... never got one. Lost both rolls to some randoms who I never saw again. Actually added them too and they both stoped playing like a few weeks after winning the roll. Depressing really.
---
Oh, hehe - makes sense then!
---
feelsruralman
---
I remember 3 manning him in vanilla on my priest with a lock and an afk tank. Good times
---
We can have different experiences but I've never once heard of or associated a PuG with anything but randoms. 
---
You do you, boo. 40 randoms still ain't doing shit.
---
Fastest way to learn is by having the group correct you.
---
This is the race/class combination guide I have bookmarked :
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Race
---
Mage has a good balance of being easy to learn / hard to master. She might struggle with the low life pool early on, but it will be a good intro for her to learn to CC properly and work on her spacing. 
---
Hunter has a low barrier of entry too, but high level hunter play is actually very complex and requires a lot of knowledge about all the available abilities. There's lots of variability when it comes to knowing what your pet can do too since different beasts have different abilities. 
---
Warlock for the same reasons as hunter, but with less variability in the pet department and more variability in the player's ability pool. Tons of dots, control abilities, and a bunch of curses that can make fights easier. 
---
Rogue could also be good if she wants to melee. She'll have 3 jobs in any given situation: DPS, "unlock this for me bro," and "sap that target." The energy bar fills at intervals so you could pitch it to her like a rhythm game.
---
Bad class balance in raiding does not a game make.
---
There is only one reason to roll dwarfs:
---
They are better because they are dwarfs.
---
NO, FUCK THE HANDICAPPED
---
i think they mean for post naxx
---
Omg I forgot about the naxx trash hype hahha
---
That's not really how it's gonna work. Guilds will always sack players and look for new blood.
---
If you rush you run the chance to not grasp basic class abilities and rotations, hindering your personal progress and stopping you from getting invited to raids.
---
You don't want to be 'that' person who, for example, only uses rank 1 skills.
---
Who keeps letting the retards out?
---
Good one Asmon. Nice reaction bait.
---
Honestly, while not the least bit scientific, I really thought the damage was extremely low while watching twitch streams the other day.  Good to know I wasn't simply misremembering.  Hopefully this is not intentional and it gets fixed.
---
Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks mate! :)
---
Blizzard said in their official classic beta forum post they don't send out emails, if you receive one, it's a phishing link?
---
I watching hes videos atm and he uses A hunter soo he no need gear to def himself, is it really efficient guide for  Rogue since without good gear you will do some quest too slow   ?
---
Keep on dreamin bud
---
don't worry about it. Fear Ward isn't that big of a deal. it just lets tanks be lazy.
---

says added patch 1.13.####
---
its supposedly added with BWL?
---
I was looking into this prior for other reasons, since it is BIS and GREATLY out ilvls everything else.
---
Hi, /u/bowlpax
---
Look, it's as same as retail.
---
If someone who isn't in the endgame meta wants to do endgame content, they can create their own group. Otherwise, they gotta submit to the others' will.
---
This isn't a WoW problem. This is a Gaming Community problem. Fighting games, race games, etc. It's everywhere.
---
Oh, you mean TBC?
---
From anecdotes, it was mostly people who had a retail account that was created in 2004 or early 2005.
---
Warlocks are absolutely disgusting at lower levels. If you don't have a way of removing the bubble don't even bother tbh. I remember destroying everyone on my druid 1vx but every time I ran across a warlock I'd spend all my mana wrathing and doting the guy up only to have the shield still holding up. Then he just casually summons another one while I yell "what the f is this?" to myself.
---
What's up guys, I'm always super hesitant to post my content anywhere and especially reddit but if anyone does watch the video I'd love some feedback on what you thought. Cheers.
---
Just search for Joana's leveling guide.
---
People that say that you can't do it in under a week are wrong. Even if you can't be as efficient as a "speed runner", you have a lot time to dedicate to it, which already puts you ahead. People tend to exagerate how complicated leveling is. I've seen people with no experience reaching 60 with great /played time and they didn't even try hard. You do you man, good luck.
---
You also probably didn't run Deadmines with a full party of level 20's like they did.
---
I know I ran it at 16-17 most of the time.
---
Every streamer I've watched actively reports bugs.
---
I mean, claiming private servers are inaccurate isn't the same as shitting on them. I've played on private servers since Nostalrius, and while the experience have been great, it's a fact that they aren't completely accurate.
---
Some of it is by design, since certain bugs or glitches discovered to have existed in vanilla would break the game if exploited, some of it is due to missing data, since old youtube videos or whiny blogposts from 2005 will inevitably contain inaccuracies, and some of it is simply due to the difficulty of implementation, it's a huge game after all, with many difficult interactions.
---
Does this mean i think the teams of volunteers that have implemented these servers have done a bad job, or that it lacks any value? Of course not. However, that's not what i'm saying either by acknowledging their limitations, and realizing that they can't compete with blizzard's internal data.
---
hunter or lock. if she can figure out pet its easy mode
---
IIRC, the reason the hunter deadzone isn't on private servers is due to a difficulty in implementing it correctly. I mained hunter in Vanilla and as much as I want to be more powerful, the deadzone is real and it should exist in classic.
---
Did I play the same game in Vanilla that you did? Maybe everyone I knew was just terrible at the game which explains wiping on 40 man content.
---
Do another on the 5 reasons you’re regular excited.
---
i see alot of people leveling ret pallys, anyone have an idea what state they are in currently in beta?
---
One more - I currently see no drop down at all. It's just the big play button.
---
I assume the drop-down will show up if I get an invite?
---
I like that you added a map though... that is pretty cool. Not sure if i would have the patience to do that as it was annoying enough getting the damage type information. 
---
Hopefully it gets you what you need.
---
Like people said he leveled as feral, but resto is not totally worthless. 
---
Furor is very good. A common leveling build is to get feral charge (from feral) and furor (from resto) and then you can go zooming around and it’s rad af.
---
But they didn't sell you the copyright,  they sold you a disk/download and a license to use it based on the terms and conditions you agree to in the EULA.
---
This is really not that complicated
---
I mean, I asked a yes or no question in which most people are in favor of yes and I even provided an agreement to the yes mindset in my post and yet its being downvoted, the sub truly seems to go against their own interests.
---
Damn, salty about not getting an invite? It's not like their beta entry required anything of them.
---
If Voting with wallets ever accomplished anything, then Blizzard would still be what they were 12 years ago, EA would be out of business and wouldn't have ruined every single company they acquired.
---
So in the end, if i want to take my time with the game, i get the short stick, and should either quit or adapt. Assuming it actually happens ofc. 
---
In the end its nothing but speculations, and i personally would never touch anything blizzard ever makes if im to be forced on anything but Classic. Then again it's just me.
---
Honest question, when is the beta over?   I still have my fingers crossed I get in.
---
Some of them barely have it. And even if they do have a niche, the itemization and respec costs push them out so heavily.
---
Indeed i watching hes videos as hunter and indeed its soo ez for him to do any quest since he doesnt tank and no need gear to tank stuff
---
I was going to make a joke with a 1-5 list of "it's not retail" but that would also probably be super excited territory. I'll give it a think and get back to you though
---
This.  They didn't even get mob abilities correct.  As in, mobs were completely lacking certain key abilities.
---
If they missed this binary obvious example, how can you even say their other values will be correct.
---
Orc hunter, could change within the next few days.
---
Good job, you out here doing gods work. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't. This is exactly why Blizzard is having a beta.

Frost mage all day. I did a ton of time there and you can kill them down before they get a swing at you. And since usually you will be farming alongside somebody, the timing is pretty solid. Two pull? Frost nova and repeat. Three pull? Okay use some cooldowns, but no sweat.

I think it will be faster to stick ro NE zones. Human zones will see the most traffic

He got excited that he got an email from Blizzard because he thought it'd be about him getting into the beta, but instead it was an email promoting the new Diablo 3 season.

I must be crazy why is everybody talking about alt tab that just switches windows.
---
&gt; The bigger question for me is whether I put meta over aesthetic and pick dwarf over human.
---
fuck the meta, seriously. don't play a race you don't enjoy because of "muh meta". if you like a human more, play human. i'm gonna be playing a Night Elf Priest 'cuz i like their animations more and they're the "worst" race for Priests.
---
Examples? And, to be honest, these few moments of glory aren't worth the punishing experience everywhere else. There's a reason the most played classes are the ones with less issues with such specs.

Other than the T0.5 Helm, I don't think I really have any reason to collect the T0 set as elemental.

5 Thunders does look amazing, though.
---
How about attack speed? Does that not mess all of that data up
---
hear hear
---
I guess at some point I didn't know it either.  But it was something like 3 years ago.  The values are off.  It becomes really clear once you try and theorycraft with tanking on raid bosses.  The values don't match the actual values and sometimes can be off by 50% or even 100%.  However I based this off private server data so I might be wrong.
---
Great post! I hope you guys get beta invites soon. 
---
My mom plays retail but she prefers leveling an army of alts and their professions (even maxing fishing on all her toons) to doing end game content.

That’s the way she has fun,  the slow pace and planning what she wants to do each day and executing it gives her more joy than any dungeon or raid ever will.

I’m guessing she’s gonna love classic also.

Is there a good private server I can play to scratch my classic itch in the meantime?

Pretty dumb to not be able to attack orcs and zombies you’re at war with, but that might just be my opinion.
---
&gt;What boss was one shot in vanilla and how? I hadn't heard of that before. Genuinely curious.
---
True, a video from vanilla might not be 100% accurate unless it's 1.12.1, though reports doesn't have to be 100% accurate, if there's good reason to think it's a bug then that's fine.
---
Private servers are wrong.
---
I remember once getting a summon from my server's top guild's GM and MT. I was ported into some ship at the bottom of the ocean surrounded by folks laughing while I tried to find my way out and up to the surface before drowning and failing. They all had underwater breathing and were getting a good chuckle. Seeing all of the dead bodies around mine I realized this had been going on for sometime.
---
If you read my post, I stated that I played that all of classic in tyr's hand, and want to try something else.

It depends what you mean by easiest. Like easiest once you get to Raiding easiest to level easiest for casual. I’d say for a casual player the absolute easiest is paladin. You have heals you wear plate and you can do damage. Don’t forget lay on hands...

    Each week if enough people are interested, set a second flex raid time - attendance not required.

    Fixed raid times not set in stone, but will be weekdays only. The alternating nature will remain the same to accommodate shift workers
---
I'm not asking to optimize for raid damage, I'm asking to optimize for leveling.
---
Anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of the damage you do leveling as a spriest is wand damage, so any increase to wand damage significantly increases clear speeds.

Steady on, not looking for a fight. No need for a personal attack, when someone is just voicing their opinion. For clarity sake, I started playing WoW at 12.30AM on day 1. When I stopped playing, my main had a /played of 900+ days. I even got sent a statue of my main from Blizzard. It's been around LONG before YouTube streaming was a thing. I'm not bad mouthing the streamers, more just stating that as WoW is as ingrained in the industry as it is (some say, the defecto standard for MMOs), it would flourish regardless of it being streamed by people.

PvP is too general of a category.
---
In WPvP I'd say Rogues and Hunters are always good choices. In Battlegrounds though, Rogues kind of suck. Druids might not be what someone thinks of when they think of PvP, but they're gods in WSG. 
---
A Shadowpriest with good gear is amazing in 1v1s, a Warrior with a pocket healer is a juggernaut. 
---
Idk asking whats the best PvP class is too broad of a question
---
With a broken chest, but yeah.
---
Yeah but paladins in vanilla were one of the least fun classes because of the lack of instant attacks. Overall they are GREAT but the skill needed in pvp is vast and varies depending on spec for pve. Healing might be rough on her this expansion, prot is... limited in most guilds and holy isn't bad but she'd have to be on top of keeping bad players alive and that might be rough.
---
Right, so TBC.
---
PvP servers in wow adds a layer you won’t see in any other game. It can be aggravating at times but it goes like this. Say you are leveling in barrens and you get attacked. You type in general chat “alliance are here just north of the crossroads” soon you will have back up. If they out level you and still kill you, people will hop on their mains and it becomes even more interesting.
---
It even works vice versa you and a group of guildies/friends can go terrorize an opposing factions lower level camp. Then of course there will be the 40 man stormwind/org raids and that’s an experience like no other.
---
PvP was not forced back then or shoved in your face it was a way to see new and exciting things that added a feeling of unity when your faction over ran the opposite side.
---
Ideally, you'd think voting with your money works. However, I guess companies survive because people still buy their products.
---
Even at its best, Blizzard is still perfectly capable of making mistakes. I think that's what we saw between the end of WotLK and from Cata and beyond. They've lost more and more money since then because people are less interested in their game. When they produce good content, I hope they succeed and it pushes them to make more good content. If they fail, I hope it pushes them to re-assess and try to fix their problems.
---
Anyway, I'm going to take my time with Classic. Even if I'm interested in new content, I don't want to be rushed through a game I didn't experience back then and I wouldn't want anything new for a while. I hope it lasts a long time.
---
Excellent point. The druid tank actually shows his armor without covering it with his dumb face: it's 1428 at [3:02:02](https://youtu.be/jsdydXEyDP0?t=10922) with Devotion Aura and MotW active.
---
1428 armor is 41% damage reduction against a level 19 mob. This druid is using Demoralizing Roar a lot, so it's a little hard to see exactly how much damage the boss is doing to him, but it looks to be in the 50-70 range with Demoralizing Roar active, and 70-90 range without. That certainly looks about right to me.

Why the fuck would other people leave if a streamer stops playing, do you take everyone here as a fucking sheep or something?
---
A lot of people in this sub are toxic and immature. Don't expect decent discussions out of that kind of demographic.

 &lt;***Not Today***\&gt; - NA - Horde - PvP - PST - Casual
---
**Introduction**: Not Today is a *casual* PvP guild that plans to do a little end game raiding. The guild is comprised of members who played together from Vanilla through WotLK. Unfortunately, we are no longer in our 20's nor can we skip work like we did our college courses. Most of us are happily married and have families to provide for.
---
**Expectations**: Our typical atmosphere is light-hearted and laid back, all the while being competitive (as far as our time restraints permit). We expect everyone to be respectful, but if you suck at being teased every so often, then this probably isn't the guild for you. Raiding is not a requirement, though it is highly encouraged. We will be utilizing Loot Council. In addition to some end game raiding, we plan to spend a majority of our time engaging in PvP.
---
**Schedule**: Raid nights will likely be Tuesday and Thursday evenings, 7-10 PM PST. This is tentative and can change. The core of us have raided Vanilla through WotLK. Core members are predominately West Coast players.
---
We are looking for like-minded people. Causal, fun and laid back. Albeit short, if this sounds like a good fit, please apply below and we will get back with you shortly.

\-***Not Today***

Hunter or duo is all that’s left- I wouldn’t expect much from rogue or feral. Too risky.

I’m EU and got my invite at 530 today. I played the original beta, loved it so switched from SWG to wow. Honestly I’m not sure I’m gonna love it again. I wish I could remember my /played time when I hit 60 with my rogue. I think that would be enough to put me off 😂
---
Lolerskates
---
You are reading the situation all wrong. It is because they are friends that they can dick about with each other knowing that it does not matter. The point is don't dick about with people you don't know, what you think if funny they could see as rude. If you know someone well and play practical jokes with them in game then that is not an issue. Also remember the streamers intention is to entertain so they they get viewers, so if they means ninja looting a good friend for a joke they will. 
---
Why do you assume that people are not intelligent enough to see the context of the stream and know not to ninja a weapon from a melee class or a wand from a cloth class e.t.c. ?
---
I agree. I’m not saying that people should invite off meta players to their raid groups if they don’t want to, and if someone chooses to play off meta then they should know that they aren’t entitled to a raid spot. But if someone wants to level off meta because that’s how they enjoy the game then I don’t see why others are trash talking them for how they want to play the game.
---
It's great advice though
---
Arent you telling me I cant enjoy letting others know how to best enjoy the game, thus gatekeeping me from one of my favorite past times when not playing???
---
Just squint your eyes tightly and imagine the greatness of your new armour!
---
Which server would be located with Los Angeles that the Tich playerbase would most likely be on.
---
&gt; Blizzard has said on multiple occasions they need this type of feedback to make sure they get it right.
---
And that is what the in-game report button is for. You do *not* need to make a Reddit thread because you noticed something on a stream that contradicts what a private server does.
---
Even shadow weaving? It's a debuff on the target increasing shadow damage taken, I thought if anything that would stack with shadow wand damage.
---
But otherwise, you're saying nothing increases crit, damage, or speed? Does haste affect wand speed at all?
---
Youre saying there are things enh/survival/shadow can do that absolutely no other spec can? You dont think all dps classes should be able to compete on the dps meters? Again, this mindset makes no sense to me. If you have specs that are dead on arrival in raid content, cant solo anything, why not just remove them from the game?
---
Asmon and soda have been wow streamers since the beginning, they're not going anywhere bud.
---
&gt; The idea that we were good enough to call out CC targets, control our attacks so we don't break CC, etc. But weren't good enough to think of healing the tank is frankly absurd.
---
THIS! Why do people think our skills are so much better? At level 19 you literally have like 6 fucking skills. How much more perfectly can you play with those 6 skills to turn it from a game of "CC 2, kill1" in a pack of 3 into "Pull all 14"?
---
I never knew I needed this in my life so badly
---
People are butt hurt
---
Fear porn is great isn't it?
---
My friends been talking about doing this for months. I always knew aggro wouldn't be the problem it would be survivability so if this is really elite damage he's gonna be fine!
---
I think I legit have 256 days of wow (not counting alts) /played and I quit playing 8 years ago so this meme resonates.
---
&gt;Maybe everyone I knew was just terrible at the game which explains wiping on 40 man content.
---
Compared to EQ1 and 2, DAoC, and SW:G? WoW raids were a joke. Doesn't mean they weren't hard for the people who played WoW, but the straight numbers are way easier.
---
that exactly my point, just disable the API calls that are too powerful
---
/s ?
---
Or is that really what it's come to.  We can't actually express the things that give us joy? Gimmie a break.
---
yea got removed for violating rule 7 which it didnt
---
Pre 2.3 or whatever, tbc had mostly untouched old world stuff other than to nerf key items that were still too powerful at 70.  The values are probably still accurate.
---
One of the first things I seen posted after his death was screenshots of his tweets telling other people to get cancer before he was diagnosed. 
---
Cancer sucks.  And people suck too.
---
&gt; Its been proven that it worked the way it does currently on private servers in vanilla.
---
Prove it.
---
Oh no.
---
My account is from launch day in EU, didn't get invited.
---
looking forward to repeating that yes, i do not want devout armor as a priest and yes, I will be rolling on the dreadmist set.
---
Really? I didn't know this. But yes, sometimes his way of expressing his opinion was weird, to say the least.
---
you ASK YOUR MOTHER LULLLLL (ps im drunk as fuck atm plz forive me &lt;3)
---
My heart stopped for a minute. Losing my character on beta isn’t the issue. It was the thought of not playing classic all summer.
---
Rogue and Spriest are the best for 1v1.
---
Mage and warrior are also top tier.
---
 I use to do this with the mage trinket.  I think the trinket swap out c/d was like 30 or 60 seconds, and the actual spell on the trinket c/d 5 minutes or something? 
---
It made it so it was still viable in pvp or in raid to swap them, i think.
---
They'll be complaining about me capping all the flags in WSG as soon as it comes out.
---
Lmo why do you have to be 45 to have played Vanilla?
---
Did you even look?
---
&gt; https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427272471?t=1h27m
---
There is no room for debate, the damage numbers in the beta are wrong.
---
Some of it has been updated apparently, but not all. And there are artifacts from porting the data from their main database still present. Loot tables haven't been finalised. Several pages still list the source as 1.12 or earlier. All the Naxx Boss pages are still using the WOTLK descriptions and values. Wowhead doesn't seem updated currently.
---
Two-ish months I thought.
---
The light hurts skeletons eyes more because they have no eyes
---
Journey before destination
---
That gives me an idea. I should put up a website where you can enter your email address, and it will send you a fake beta invite email. Just so people can feel like they've gotten something.
---
On the other hand, hunters and warlocks can very easily screw up their group becaus of their pets.
---
im pretty sure everyone on the beta is submitting bugs via the ingame tracker. Those who arent arent....
---
First you need to be invited, then i assume it pops up in the launcher and you hit 'install' like everything else.
---
My only problem with it was that BC heroics were insanely harder than most Karazhan encounters but the heroic dungeon loot was much lower quality. I think the loot quality should have matched the difficulty better.
---
o7  all in a day's work, citizen!
---
To infinity, and beyond! 🚀
---
Battlegroups are way more important for BGs compared to arena, since that is interfaction with smaller groups.   
---
Nerfs to dungeons seem to be completely unrelated to BC. Or you have to explain to me where the connection between making changes in ZF/Uldaman and BC is.   
---
Balance changes seem to be completely in line with what I would expect towards the end of Vanilla: Buffs to bad performing classes, nerfs to good performing classes. I dont see how this is not though and through changes made towards improving Vanilla balancing.   
---
Technical changes are irrelevant either way.   
---
The thing that looks interesting to me is the honor/pvp rank change. This really looks like something that is supposed to help more casual players get decent ranks. But then again they completely removed the restrictions on the BC prepatch, so that looks like some very half assed and pretty much pointless change if they allready had BC in mind. Overall really hard to say and it would be cool if the devs were looking into that specific change.
---
It's literally what the beta is for dude. It's all a "waste of time", and if enough people notice something and Blizzard looks into it then it's a good thing, whether or not it's wrong.
---
give that guy attention
---
You have to compare to the original patch 1.12. I don't have time right now to research it but is there a chance elite damage was reduced in instances by 1.12?
---
don't even warn people. if they don't know the basic common sense principle of "don't be an asshole" let them learn by experience.
---
My point never was that the end of classic was the culmination of active players, it was that wow needed rebranding. We were already getting very content filled patches before TBC, yet it still happend. You think that was because blizz are a bunch of cool cats? 
---
That was a great comment about econ101 by the way. Really impressed.
---
so reverse engineering a range o possible values from videos where is now better than the actual values. dude no offense but you are delusional.
---
Blizzard completely change their design path midway through WoTLK. It's not only other games, they themselves screwed up big time. 
---
Gonna copy a post from before.
---
I mean, i'ts not just Blizzard, i don't trust this community as a whole. The only people i trust are them "purists", hate them or not, they know EXACTLY why they want classic.
---
I'm assuming you meant WC as in Wailing Caverns. If you meant DM (Deadmines), then I'm not sure how you can be "in VanCleef" and also "kill and loot VanCleef". Sounds like you were making love to him then killed him.
---
quest xp is not affected by group and you usually dont outlevel the tutorial area :P
---
The amount of time people are wasting trying to find examples of damage discrepancies blows my mind. Blizzard has the original game running internally to compare against, data and formulas were imported from that codebase. The damage is correct. Stop beating your head against a brick wall of stupid.
---
Top right. Second row.
---
Warrior with big bad pauldrons, lionheart helm and vendorstrike.
---
ZG and AQ20 will be pugged 100%
---
The good news is that Ion has said that Classic will retain the two hour loot trading period that they implemented in WOTLK
---
&gt; If you role a shit spec you knew what you were doing
---
I agree they shouldn't change classes/specs.  But there are gonna be people playing classic who have never tried the original game, so how would they know?
---
&lt;insert comment about Campfires being not the same as in the day&gt;
---
Theres been mission tables doing this exact fucking thing for the last 3 space lmfao
---
Makes you wonder though, if the private servers have recreated vanilla so completely, why are all the shitlords from those servers scrambling to get into the beta.
---
Wasn't even just a server admin. It was Todd :)
---
wait, they did WHAT?
---
remember when people read pages made of paper in a book?
---
is this 2007?
---
roflcopters
---
I'm not saying you especially didn't play for a long time but talking about a subject you have no idea about isn't something that should be done. You didn't talk about wow flourishing wether they stream or not your comment openly criticised wow streamers as just opportunistic (some are I won't deny it) but a lot (if not most) have a /played comparable to yours.
---
There's nothing wrong with voicing an opinion but that doesn't mean that you can put uinformed statements as "opinion", have the decency to do some research, thank you.
---
What do they bring to the game? They are not developers. They're sitting there playing it while other people watch. The game by it's own right is the content. With or without them it'd still be the same. THAT is my point. It was blatantly apparent what I was saying.
---
Shadow weaving increases shadow spell damage taken. Wand damage is not spell damage.  
---
There isn't a single stat in the game that benefits wand damage. What you see on the tooltip is what you get.
---
They were almost non-existant. Of course they COULD tank, they had a tank spec, but almost no one used them.
---
so is it safe to say that that helm is from the beta?
---
Rofl so many retail players completely missed the point of this post. It has nothing to do with whether pservers had accurate scripting or bugs. It has to do with the fact that the tens of thousands of players got blizzards attention.
---
Lord Kazzak. He was one shot (in the video it looks like multiple hits due to lag) by abusing the exact sit bug with reckoning we were talking about in this thread.
---
It's ironic because somebody was saying private servers are unplayable because of so many unblizzlike bugs. Yet the very same thing he references was abused even worse on actual vanilla. It was also changed a few times on actual retail vanilla.
---
A dumpster fire dies to a campfire. How poetic.
---
Cata heroics were never hard tbh. I think I wiped once ever in them during the few months I played that expansion (the first few months). Wasn't in a guild so everything was a pug.
---
Did they bring back Tseric for the authentic vanilla feel?
---
I just don’t see how they can make classes like ret paladin be on par dps wise with other classes and still have them balanced in pvp. Then you’d run into the issue of balancing classes different for pve and pvp with such things as “judgement does x% less dmg to players” and next thing you know, it’s no longer vanilla
---
* I'm actually using the new season in Diablo to help me ignore the fact that I can't play classic yet &lt;.&lt;
---
&gt; We can't actually express the things that give us joy? Gimmie a break
---
he expressed what gave him joy. and you told him he was wrong....
---
I can't tell if I do or don't miss Alterac Valley lasting all weekend.
---
lol glad they have a sense of humor again.
---
Ofcourse it would have an impact, that is why it would be fixed, thanks for the heads up friend of the shaman.
---
faking being a CM is scummy and not funny
---
It's entirely server side. 
---
In fact this is true of all logic in WoW. When you hit something nothing really happens client side. Your client sends the hit to the server and the server responds with what happens (miss, resist, damage etc). 
---
This is extremely important because everything that's client side can be fairly easily hacked. If Beast Lore data was readily available client-side, then it would be relatively easy to create extract such information.
---
But isn't this the same mindset that leads to the super streamlined, watered down, "every class is the same" game that we currently have with retail WoW?
---
If you want hybrid class balance wait for Wrath Classic.
---
Kaplan is the man.
---
I mean honestly lmfao retard if I'm not pointing out flaws then what *am* I doing in your little mind?
---
Personally the best approach to this is the tbc one. Pure DDs still pull the big numbers, but these hybrid-support-dps have a niche and are worthwhile to bring. 
---
Pures will not complain about *that druid stealing their gear* or *druids can do it all, what's the point of bringing a pure?* as balancing it all equally would do. I used druid as an example, but any other of them (hunter has a different issue, though, as a DD-only class, but it's a design+itemization issue as well) fills the bill.
---
if they go TBC, then they didnt learn the lesson and are just being greedy
---
who knows, ask your mom
---
If I recall, deep feral was garbo for pvp.  The best specs took resto to at least NS, grabbed Feral charge from feral, and nature's grasp/natural shapeshifter from the balance tree.
---
No it isnt, that's what I'm saying. Not everyone played these op classes then. They will now with the info we have.
---
what's the point of having download be avaialble for the whole day if you need to be invited to download it and they dont send out invites until the last minute?
---
I'll go back to private if this shit doesn't get fixed
---
I exacly know how its gonna work on top pvp server ppl will get all in day 5 50-60 lvls ppl in to a 1 solid guild and grind hard to achieve as fast they can   soo they will be first in everything. Just becouse i never played vannila doestn mean i never played WoW and i dont know how to play classes and fallow builds. 
---
As far i know raids in classic are easy with a correct gear form dungs soo if  i get in to dungs as first person to grind items i will be  invited to raids without any hesitation whats so ever since i got the items first
---
Awesome to hear from you directly. I know you have an addon that scrapes data from the game as players encounter it, is that currently compatible with this beta? Also, is there a way to mass export the sites data for personal use? I think I know that the answer is 'no' but I thought I would use the opportunity to ask.
---
I swear Blizzard would screw everything up if they dumb down elite damage. For goodness sakes no one wants Classic to be a breeze. That's the point of classic, to return to the glory days when the game was harder and also required more player to player interaction
---
That was my assumption, but i just flat out wasnt sure.
---
I watched Sodapoppin’s stream and he had a group trying and failing to kill Narillasanz but they were way under leveled
---
People here seem to think you need to do damage to be the strongest in PvP. Wrong.
---
Roll a priest and heal. Find a friend, any class, and you can 2v3/4/5+. Everyone will want to play with you and you can still kill a fair amount of players 1v1 as a pvp healing priest spec.
---
That would be helpdesk
---
Only place you will see people wearing this stuff is in Capital Cities. The stats are god awful
---
Name checks out
---
99% of people complaining about this weren’t invited to the beta.
---
This has to be a troll
---
But those are the bad guys
---
Example: shadow priest is an absolute monster in pvp but they are just average when it comes to pve but it is necessary to have one in your 40 man because of the shadow dmg buff they bring to raids. 
---
Example: hunter is great at leveling and bringing cc/utilities to raid but they kinda fall of late game dmg wise but you still need them for a raid. 
---
Just because a class doesnt match up to a warrior or mage in pve doesnt mean they aren't good. 
---
When you play the game you will realise this and see how amazing it is. 
---
Not everything needs to be balanced.
---
Holy shit the streamer envy is strong in this bunch.  I pay little to no attention to streamers and they have ZERO impact on me as a result.  If all you idiots that have your thongs in a bunch over streamers did the same, you’d be far more content  and would have a shot at actually enjoying Classic. 
---
They’re only an ‘issue’ because you’re making them one in your own mind.
---
This is not needed. The streamers are screwing with their friends in the beta. The only people who will follow this example for live. Doing it to strangers and, what not are going to do it with an example or not. This for me rings pretty much the same as sexual harassment training at work. If you got to the working world still not understanding you shouldn't grope people. Chances are a 5 minute video isn't going to change you.
---
I dont disagree about the BC heroics and reward structure.
---
Specifically I was referring to the difficulty ramp up from late Wrath heroics to Cata heroics.
---
Well, that depends on what you mean with "a lot of specs".
---
I am fairly certain that enha shamans, prot paladins and elemental shamans are not comparable to the rest. It is of course possible to clear all content with these specs, but at that point you are getting carried by your guild. - Which your guild may be fine with doing.
---
But no amount of consumables will make enha shamans or protpaladins as good as other dps or tank specs.
---
Bro, we don't give level 20 dungeons preferential acronyms LOL.
---
DM goes to the dungeon we'll be running for the next 3 years, and it won't be deadmines.
---
I believe the Anubisath trash mobs in in AQ (such as the trash in front of Ossirian in AQ20)  spawn nodes of Small/Large Obsidian Chunk when they die. They require 305 mining skill to be mined.
---
where did you find the peggle addon? I search it everywhere but I did not find a 8.1.5 compatible version.
---
I hope I get in tomorrow, 5 lvl is enough for now but please let me join the Beta..... please Blizzard please..!.!.!.!.!!.!.!
---
stop ... you're just making it harder than it already is 😭
---
Our definition of 'last minute' is apparently different.  Its still over 24 hours until the stress test happens...
---
First of all, I'm not even the guy who made the original commnet.
---
Second, he didn't even tell him he was wrong.  He just asked why he feels he needs to play that way, and offered an alternative way he likes to play with his reasoning.
---
If anything, it fosters discussion.
---
&gt; please refrain from telling other people how to find enjoyment
---
I understand not wanting people to shit on others for the way they like to play.  But not even being allowed to express what brings you joy?  That's just silly.
---
&gt; Oh wait that was actual retail
---
Give context. Or I'll give it for you, since you obviously didn't play back then:  
---
BC pre-patch came out. Kazzak was raiding cities. Ret Paladin grabbed this new BC talent called Reckoning, allowing you to stockpile a windfury-like effect every time you're crit, with no cap. Paladin duels his buddy and sit-spams to let his buddy rack up hundreds/thousands of stacks of Reckoning. He walks in and 1-shots Kazzak. 
---
Within hours, servers are restarted. Hotfix is out.
---
New players, more hype around the game, free advertising for blizzard to name a few. Why do you think they get beta first?
---
That title goes to Phantasy Star Online 2
---
Different setting, but the cosmetics are god tier.
---
https://i.imgur.com/9JblgFZ.jpg
---
Just because one guild clears MC, doesn't mean that no other guilds will run it. There is a cap on 'ilevel' until BWL and pvp gear comes out. But hey, if you wanna rush and destroy the game for you, feel free to.
---
Why the fuck do people think a private server is more accurate to vanilla vs the beta????
---
&gt; However it should be noted that this is true for attackers who are between levels 1-59, as the formula changes a little for attackers lvl 60 or above (bosses). See : https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor .
---
That's actually TBC information. The formula is the same for all mobs in vanilla, ie. `DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * AttackLevel)`. Or alternatively there's a bug in the vanilla UI, but I think that's unlikely.
---
just did my first DM on the beta.
---
didn't have to heal for half the packs.
---
finished VC with 20% mana left and no potions used.
---
highest in group was 20... VC being 21.
---
think we're good...
---
My email arrived 530 today. I only changed my settings the other day to say I’d like to try Beta so pretty surprised I got it. I did play the original Beta though so maybe that helped
---
Maybe there should be some sort of "rules of the road" for the guys just entering classic and not understanding how brutal it can be.
---
Balance was cool for healing tho
---
Hi, /u/BownerPvP
---
Where did you find this information? I thought you just needed active time on your account. Doesnt a token count as active time?
---
Have an upvote man. Nice troling
---
In the dumpster with the rest of the Alliance scum!
---
Why are you being downvoted for asking a legitimate question based on an opinion you hold (you don't like playing with pets, you didn't say people who play with pets are mongoloids, you said YOU don't like playing with them)
---
fuck reddit sometimes
---
I would imagine medium
---
The reps told me, token count as long as you have a active Sub, so a Automatic Sub, not just the token itself.
---
Haven't been following the classic scene until a few days ago.  What's wrong with Asmongold?
---
I mean, as easy as it is i’d love to see a modern WoW players go through to 60.. 
---
My little brother is part of the iPad generation and made it to level 3. The attention span was short on that kid. He is more into games that reinforce you with dopamine / seratonin every 30 seconds with flashy shit.
---
Then you hit T3.
---
My take on it is that Classic is the first "passion project" Blizzard has done in a long time.
---
The good developers are putting in a lot of hours into this project because they want to get it right and they are not controlled by some corporate guy telling them to maximize profits for shareholders.
---
100% not the point.
---
He could have leveled with no spec. Sperg army anyone could level fast.
---
I love how these guys get a three months head start to try to “get gud” before classic launches. What a trash can.
---
he didnt really express. If he were to say "I took my time leveling and had a lot of fun" that is expressing.
---
there are enough people telling everyone how to play. However there are also a lot of people asking how to play. You can simply go and give them advice. People are now going out of their way with disclaimers because the overwhelming amount of advice goes against what someone wants to do
---
Decades?
---
lol i remember when this guy convincved me to download a dupe program and it dropped all my gear and i was stuck running in a corner and hes like whats wrong bro while picking all my gear. it also gave my computer a fucked up virus
---
Threw it *on* the laser ;)
---
aoeing lvl 30 mobs as a 60 is probably better GPH than portalling, its a free tip every now and then, or good to combo with enchanting in cities
---
hell yeah brouther
---
human warrior, gonna facepull, get 1 hit, run back, wait 5 minutes for hogger to respawn, rinse and repeat
---
24 hours
---
...or they are listening to the thousands of players that want to play TBC just as much as classic vanilla?
---
There was nothing "post naxx."  Things were brainstormed and some assets were hidden in vanilla just in case, but they were never implemented.  Many of those things were actually moved to TBC (Hellfire peninsula), or saved for other expansions (Hyjal).
---
So no,  there will NEVER be any post naxx content that is not TBC.  Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
Even with in the context of PvP, you're gunna need to be a bit more specific. What are you trying to do with this spec? 1v1? WPvP? Run flags?
---
The benefit of FFF is not as much about armor as it is about keeping rogues where you can see them. To that end, having to shift out and back in not only takes more time, but costs a high amount of mana. I would drop thick hide before FFF tbh, if you want a better stun.
---
&gt;Excuse me fellas, but this would not be happening if it wasn't for Vanilla private servers, mainly Nostalrius, and that is a fact.  
---
This is happening because Blizzard figured out a way to run the vanilla data on their new client and server infrastructure, so they can give us the actual vanilla product and not a garbage hacky emulation of it like Nostalrius was. If Nost had any "influence" on Classic WoW at all, it was an example of what NOT to do.
---
Bear claws*
---
Especially since it's faster to fly to tanaris and walk over. Not a place you want to be at 36 lol
---
Heroics were easy later in TBC and they still gave badges which were still used for catch-up gear that got up to Black Temple level stats (in the Sunwell patch). Kara &amp; ZA gave badges as well later on.
---
Oh nice!!!
---
I wish.
---
He's toxic as fuck honestly
---
Whhhatttt
---
You are correct. You could not swap trinkets that were on cooldown and the trinket you swapped to got a short 30 sec cd before you could use it.
---
At least thats how i remember it :d
---
Here is a list: https://classic.wowhead.com/spells?filter=75;1;0
---
I don't give a shit about retail, enjoy it if you like it. I'll be in Classic and TBC/WotLK when it comes out.
---
thought i was on the [art sub](old.reddit.com/r/wow) for a sec
---
100% a factor
---
Not huge at the high skill levels, but you will be more slippery in anything chaotic or group based
---
not an important distinction.
---
I don't have the source but it was confirmed ANY kind of game time on your account counts. Sub/Time card/one month/token.
---
What a truly fantastic list! Granted if there was any playlist I was liable to play during classic, it honestly would most likely just all the zone music.
---
I wasn't planning it to be my main money making but just like skinning to add up some extra gold and get that mount at 40
---
&gt;Ret Paladin grabbed this new BC talent called Reckoning
---
You sure showed me context. What can I do in the shadow of such knowledge.
---
Human Paladin.  Cleanse is king. Gonna sic my warrior friend on anyone and everyone. And also i dont trust anyone else to heal.  
---
Didnt get past 27 during vanilla, i remember the scourge event starting just before we moved back to Sweden (i was like 11/12 at the time) 
---
Got my own Acc when TBC launched and rolled blood elf paladin (Big yikes) - paladin is currently lvl 120 in BFA and untouched since October.
---
Dammit Todd...
---
*2 hours
---
Yeah, that is what my ticket say, except, that if you have Game-Time from a Token, you need have Sub active (even if you never pay with the Sub)
---
if you're rolling a healer purely for PvP, Paladins are better. more survivability, equivalent/better healing, more utility. hell, Paladin Healers are pretty much unkillable 1v1... sure, it'll take you a century to kill someone, but hey.
---
Same requirements as BFA except disk space which is about 9GB for the beta.
---
Cow Tree with a side of chicken :) I'm also gonna buck the system and play a NE priest just like back in the day.
---
I meant it's a waste of time to report that something is wrong when you have zero evidence for it being wrong. These fools are pushing agendas; not trying to find or fix bugs. They just can't accept vanilla wow was incredible easy and not the hardcore game, fantasy image they have created in their mind.
---
&gt; But it wouldn't be anything like vanilla that people remember.
---
I'd argue that starting with the 1.12 patch have the same effect. Vanilla changed many times during its time. I spent most of my time in Vanilla before the 1.12 patch. While it will be similar, it won't be the exact Vanilla I played.
---
Can you do elites?
---
I use a potato of a laptop with a broken keyboard to play live wow and a pserver. I run it on low graphics and never encounter lag (unless internet related) nor major frame-drops. I can play for hours strait with no issues. Mine also says my pc is outdated every time I run the game but have been doing it for over a year on the same machine. I’d imagine your laptop will do even better.
---
Dreaming of what? They said they will make changes based on feedback and in my post I said I agree with those who think it will ruin their experience. Not sure what point you are making.
---
Stress test users will stay on the realm for 24 hours. I'm unfortunately not a beta champion yet, so I'll be stuck on the server, abusing hogger while I have the chance.
---
we're supposed to get the download before the day of the test is the problem
---
This is WoW. The virgins are the chads here, and the chads aren't even in the game.
---
Wondering the same, its technically build upon BFA but the old world isn't as detailed. Im pretty sure it shouldn't have any problems outside raids, but once inside, it might be a different story.
---
The PC i will be playing for a while was high end back in 2009 and ran WotLK/Cata flawlessly but legion raiding was horrid. Wonder how it will fare in the old world.
---
I was so let down that they kept the M+ system for this exact reason.
---
Not that it changes your advise. DPS warriors should get impale. But being pendantic, it's 20% crit BONUS damage increase. So only a 10% overall damage increase to crits.
---
No they didn't but nice try.
---
hes toxic as fuck then cries when his chat calls him bad.
---
I have watched a decent number of beta steamers and all of them have reported at least a couple of bugs. Pretty sure you're exaggerating this issue.
---
 (・\_・ヾ) ?
---
Rogues def do not suck in WSG they are the best defenders by far
---
It's just for fun.  WF is amazing when it happens, even more amazing when you get other multi-attack procs; but they line up so infrequently it not really worth it other than a meme.
---
The thing that a lot of the Enh pvp vids don't show is how many times they DON'T get a WF proc crit, and they guy is just sitting their auto attacking.
---
Elemental does similar amounts of damage, and is WAY more consistent.
---
But don't let me tell you how to play.  You do you.
---
Mage, Rogue, Shadow priest, Warlock
---
I think it looks super cool, but I’d say your username is what made me comment, I lold.
---
Ahh, reminds me of an interaction with another one of the warlocks in my guild.
---
We're working on Ragnaros progress in MC, still haven't killed him. Party is getting into position for our first attempt of the night.
---
Guild leader says to the warlock over ventrilo:
---
**Guild Leader**: "Hey, [warlock]. You forgot to summon your imp."
---
**Warlock**: "Not really worth it... It barely has any HP, the AoE will just kill it right away anyways. Plus, like everything in here is immune to his firebolt, anyways."
---
**Me (another warlock)**: "Uhhh.. just turn on Phase Shift and don't have him attack. He won't take any damage and your party will get the Blood Pact buff still."
---
**Warlock**: "...what are Phase Shift and Blood Pact?"
---
(entire raid losing their minds laughing in Ventrilo)
---
**Third Warlock (through laughter)**: "THEY'RE SPELLS YOU BUY FOR YOUR IMP AT THE DEMON TRAINER."
---
**Warlock**: "THERE'S A DEMON TRAINER?!"
---
I was mostly impressed that he stuck it out and leveled to 60 without ever buying pet spells.
---
It is the year 2019. I am a bit that reminds people what year it is. I only reply to losers that made rhetorical what-year-is-this jokes thinking they are clever. 
---
You are a bad human. Don’t bother reporting me as a bad bot. It’s 2019, motherfuckers.
---
Why did two lasercut wood pictures got posted at exactly the same time? 🤔
---
Hope he says kazzak, bc that was not a bug but an oversight
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brdthp/check_your_mailbox_beta_invites_are_out/eocwamu) comment says that it requires a subscription *or* active game time.
---
If it does require an active sub on top of a token then that sucks.
---
Isn’t that bizarre? But I’m pretty sure the other one is routed, you can see the back and forth lines.
---
Would windfury stack with Ironfoe and Hand of Justice though?
---
Same.  I don't care about beta at all.  I just want the day to come where I can actually sit down and play.
---
This isnt lasercut, its CNC machined!
---
The tooltip on shadow weaving just says shadow damage taken by the target, not shadow spell damage. The tooltip could be wrong, but I'm seeing other people from old Nost forums saying otherwise. I might do some testing on PServers later today, but unfortuantely I can't check on the beta or anything... It'd be real interesting to know how it works on the beta.
---
Match vendor price for 1 stack in exchange for 3-4 stacks of water. It's very fair pricing and a good deal for any1 who knows they will be online long enough to take advantage.  
---
For instance Melon Juice is 20s per stack  @ level 15, so 4 stacks of lvl 15 conjured for 20s is solid. @25 it's 40s, @35 it's 80s, @45+ it's 1g.  
---
Portals for 1g is pretty standard since the rune to do them costs 20s by itself. Pretty much always 1g in city but in level 40+ zones you can bump it to 2g if it feels right.  
---
Make sure to play the opposite side of the card to keep your brand name strong. In dungeon runs you give every mana user 3 stacks free without them having to ask. Give the healer an extra stack or 2 near the end of the run if he was chain drinking to help him out in the wild. Don't EVER trade anyone a mere 19 waters because you drank one after conjuring; that is just disgusting behavior. Free port at the end of dungeon if applicable. This gets you on everyone's friend list. Tell them to hit you up for the goods if they see you around and to like and subscribe for more water.
---
Night Elf Priest with Alchemy / Herbalism. 
---
my original character was a Night Elf Druid with Alchemy / Herbalism. i... really didn't like raiding as a Druid in Vanilla, so.
---
Oh you're are delusional, that's not healthy.
---
Yes, WoW and Blizzard games in general run pretty well on low spec hardware. I'm guessing it has a 8000 series -U i5 and 8GB of RAM? If so it'll run just fine.
---
do we know when stress test invites are going out?
---
You mean like this?
---
and it has been around since forever. Twitch didn't start it
---
Retail is the current version of the game, in this case Battle for Azeroth
---
One of my earliest and most fondest memories of WoW (started Mid-BC) was seeing people putting together Level 1-5 raids for Hogger. The insane amount of people joining in, all the death, the priests and druids attempting to heal through the endless "tanks" getting 1 shot into oblivion. 
---
I have not gotten an invite into beta yet, but my fingers are crossed for at least a stress test invite so I can have a few hours of fun getting punted by Hogger!
---
"Crushing Blow" is a good explanation for that higher damage. Crushing blows are +50% damage, and would put that 101 hit down to around 70 - a far more typical number, under the circumstances.
---
Yeah exactly, and he takes advantage of Hunter's leveling strengths by soloing some very difficult content. I think to how many times I barely scrapped by on some of the tasks (as a hunter) and wonder to myself how a non-pet class, especially melee, would be able to do this.
---
&gt; With that said, it does seem weird that elites do very similar damage to non elites.
---
Being a nerdy math guy when I was in my teenage years, I remember explicitly saying once to a friend during vanilla that elites seemed to hit as hard as non-elites and just had a lot more HP.
---
&gt; The same people who missed the jump in WC will still miss the jump
---
You can actually test this accurately on both retail and in classic. Just queue for low level BFD instead, as the jump is slightly harder.
---
Side note, we also have better internet connexion overall. My ping averaged 50-100ms back then, now it's around 10ms. Those tenths of a second and widespread voice chat use clearly add up across an entire party for correctly reacting to situations.
---
exactly
---
No idea, possibly tonight at 6pm PST. I know Stress Test begins tomorrow at 3pm PST.
---
&gt; If you roll alliance priest and don’t choose dwarf, yikes.
---
yeah, fuck people that like playing a race they enjoy. gotta adhere to the meta. ^^/s
---
1 week to late
---
Ill be leveling about 10 different characters. Some including NE priest , ret pally, and firemage. Everyone will be playing classic differently and with different goals. The toxicity and gatekeeping is the minority as not every player in classic will be from reddit.
---
**Looking for a fairly competitive guild for classic.**  
---
* Intended server type: PvP

* Intended raid/play times: Weekday Nights, Weekend Day / Nights Central Time
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild: Raiding / Occasional PvP (I plan to push rank 10 at least)
---
* Any pertinent rules: None
---
* A preferred form of contact: Discord,  [Revs-Umgak.edu#8952](https://Revs-Umgak.edu#8952)
---
* Preferred Class: Rogue
---
* A bit about myself:  
---
Returning classic vet, I played an orc rogue in Vanilla, on the US server Mal'ganis, and raided with a few guilds including EJ, Aurora, Sword of Storms, and numerous others. I cleared raid content up to KT, in Naxx, who unfortunately I missed out on due to some real life complications, I have also played enough on private servers to be aware of some of the post classic meta shifts. Thanks for reading and hope to hear from you all soon.
---
&gt; So no, there will NEVER be any post naxx content that is not TBC. Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
its not my bubble to bear.
---
I feel thje important lesson hear for blizzard to learn is people enjoy the overall design of classic. Even TBC starts to go against. 
---
TBC while being the expansion with the softest of resets, still added a lot of QoL changes.
---
If they add TBC it will splinter the playerbase even further, unless they shutdown the classic servers. But i dont think what people want is for blizz to just re-release all of their expansions.
---
I see two routes if blizz wants to really give the players what they want.
---
They go a new path after classic wow, and keep things vanilla like as possible.
---
or make a new MMO. I dont think they can save retail, you have to many people who rely on the QoL changes and would quit if they were removed. I dont think they can reasonably remove flying and transmog, too much time invested by players for example
---
Why should they ban people for talking to players on the other faction? That is super hard to enforce.
---
Is reading a news article on IGN from someone who plays the other faction "collusion"?
---
If these people put that much work into controlling devilsaur leathers then all i can do is say kudos. And frankly i think there will be people attempting to do the same with other things like Black Lotus.
---
Best thing you can do to counter it is either become mega strong and gang them or gather a group of people to de-throne them.
---
This is where epic world pvp battles start.
---
Hi, /u/ItsRevan
---
Tanking raids is the highlight of my WoW career.
---
Well, the reports on this sub have mostly been that the invites go out towards the end of the work day (PST).  It stands to reason that a big wave will likely go out in 2-3 hours, and then those people will be able to set it to download overnight.
---
Ew kick these plebs from my precious server!!!!1111
---
I believe so, since those are all different effects.
---
&gt; Do you like Shoes
---
That one hurt. Why can't we have shoes Blizzard? Why can't we have shoes...
---
Which is hard to do on a PvE server. This is probably Nostalrius PvE.
---
Imagine finding out the random noob guy from your group is actually a lead game designer acting like he's a casual player. Awesome they actually did these things
---
&gt;you're are
---
And you're dumb
---
&gt;Classic dungeons were never 'hard', just long and challenging
---
You do realize the stupidity of that ... right? "Long and challenging" is basically the definition of "hard".
---
&gt; TBC Heroics were damn hard 
---
Well, that settles it. You are a TBC baby, talking about Vanilla without even playing it. TBC heroics were EASIER, in every aspect, compared to lvl 60 Vanilla dungeons. Tank aggro was no issue in TBC, mana was no issue in TBC, AoE was basically the norm in TBC, crowd control was much diverse in TBC, mob damage was lower in TBC.
---
Sometimes? OSRS always has 2-4x the amount of active players compared to RS3
---
haha nbd that went right over my head.
---
Deadmines is VC because Dire Maul is DM. Context matters of course, but VC is a very old acronym.
---
8 yards, if I remember correctly.
---
All of this info has been stated publicly by blizzard many times.
---
Google it.
---
Can priest heal by lvl5? I’ll be that!
---
Is there though? I feel like most of the resentment against pserver people is also from the same people who hold resentment for vanilla itself. I didn't play on pservers, played back during vanilla, and don't really hold any animosity against them. You can't really deny that we are getting this because they showed Blizzard there's an audience ~~willing to give them money.~~
---
Pretty sure people are already getting them, from other posts I've seen here today.
---
Frost Nova, Cone of Cold, Lvl 1 Frostbolt - any of these will work tho :)
---
It’s a blood elf haha ;)
---
Finally someone reading between the lines
---
still think you are better than people and know whats best eh?
---
You assume to much, like he wont catch on...
---
Professions actually being important is good though. In bfa it doesn't matter what your profs are at all
---
my game time for BfA ran out today. told my guild goodbye, won't be playing until Classic.
---
won't be giving Blizzard any more money until August 27th. not even to reserve character names.
---
take your streamer-infested beta and SHOVE IT, not paying until you gimme the real thing!
---
Random is....wAit for it.... random
---
&gt; don't play a race you don't enjoy because of "muh meta".
---
It's less about being "optimal", and more that I like to exist in that niche of: "Oh hell yeah, we have X with us." I probably won't raid hardcore enough for racials to be the deciding factor, but the dwarf racials are significant enough that they're a factor in how desirable I end up being in a general sense.
---
IIRC Priests, Paladins, and Druids all get heals by level 3
---
Active sub for sure, ive had an active account since Dec 04 and active sub, no invite yet.
---
DM is not Dire Maul because no wing is denoted. You will never see anyone refer to Dire Maul as DM alone.
---
He means maybe the mobs were supposed to output say.. 100 dps, they were programmed to output 100dps, and the new live version has them attacking at 100dps, but maybe the old version was bugged causing them to attack at 200dps and nobody noticed.
---
&gt; They said they had problems grafting the data to the modern game engine.
---
I wonder how much of it involves CPU speed on the server blades, or the massively increased power and effeciency of today's servers.
---
But also, I never did like comparing some old video to a modern fight. Gear on the group isn't the same, buffs aren't the same, debuffs aren't the same. Unless you got exactly the same classes doing exactly the same talent trees and rotation. Saying a monster hits for 85 now and 125 in an old video is severely lacking in relevant information.
---
That's not a given fact. In situations, sure they are better. In situations they are not while also being super hella boring too. Priest's have a much larger toolkit, with proactive and reactive playstyles. Paladins for the most part can contribute zero damage but they generally survive better.
---
Haha if only
---
THIS is the Blizzard I know. The one I grew up with. Happy to see everyone is enjoying the classic beta, even the devs!
---
I haven’t gotten an email from blizzard since 2016, starting to wonder if I blocked their email but I can’t seem to find anything that suggest they are getting blocked so just assuming they haven’t sent me anything! Check the launcher a couple times a day though just to be certain I’m not missing something!
---
As a sysadm, 70% it's and old guy in ADM or some intern who has enough privileges, either way I like his/her sense of humour.
---
same
---
there is no criteria. just need a sub lol.
---
Oh man same, I've never liked Twitch but I've been following Perplexity, even subbed. It's great.
---
Okay fair point actually
---
You mean DM:E, DM:W, or DM:N? No one will ever say DM unless they want to be asked "Which wing?".
---
&gt;  it's such a massive advantage
---
It's really not. It's a good ability but it's also one of those things that took on a mythical, legend-like quality far beyond what was actually happening at the time. Any competent tank will stance dance fears and most bosses don't have a fear effect at all. 
---
The Human Racial, on the other hand, is good 100% of the time. 
---
Screw elves tho.
---
„Stack“ is the wrong word.
---
Wf proccs can trigger hoj or ironfoe and other way around too. Each effect could trigger another, chances are low though but it still happens. 
---
I remember times when windfurry could trigger windfurry 😄
---
5ever alone.
---
There’s also the fact that all these streamers have bis gear in groups of players all with bis gear best enchants all the buffs and pots..back than you just grouped with whoever no enchants no pots mostly terrible gear that has to play a factor in all this I would assume ..
---
Well? What did you find out about me man? Cmon im curious :)
---
"The Devilsaur Mafia" has been used to refer to many different groups, but the main one was on the Nost PvP server.
---
well have you subscribed to r/wowbetamasterrace?
---
Lol I guess I did. Text does not relay tone well sometimes.
---
Hmm, that's unfortunate.
---
The ones with the most viewership certainly aren't reporting anything. Some smaller streamers are, and this subreddit has already made threads praising them.
---
Some people insist that DM is Dire Maul. But DM for Dire Maul is a useless abbreviation, since no sane group will ever run all three at once - even though they're technically one big instance.
---
Thank you !
---
Nice, a guy prone to conspiracy.
---
I'll also let you know that the world is flat. Obama is a member of Al'qaida. There is no "space". The holocast did not happen. 9/11 wasnt caused by terrorists, it was caused by the US government. And of course Jeses was the son of god and died for our sins.

In PvE thats true but definitely not in PvP...
---
EQ and EQ2 both regularly set up progression servers that start with the core game and add the expansions in sequence over time.
---
All the GMs I've interacted with have been the creepy role-playing ones.
---
I gotta go (considering only tier 1-3) with Bloodfang. 
---
My second favorite is druid tier 3 or frostfire
---
Least favorite is Judgement.
---
It can lead to that sure, but it doesn't necessarily have to.
---
None of that stuff matters. They've said they may use account characteristics to make sure they're getting a broad sample of different types of players into the beta but that it has no affect on how likely you are to be selected.
---
It's ridiculous that gamers can't find ways to just enjoy a common thing.  It always resorts to bickering.  Nerds aren't what they used to be.
---
Do bear tanks take much less damage? First time I ever did WC right after vanilla release I was a druid leveling and I had no idea about MMO roles (tank, heals, dps, etc) so when a guy asked me to tank WC when I was around 18-20 I was like...WTF? He was like just go bear for and take hits for us and I did and we full cleared the place and I don't remember him being that hard, but maybe I just had a lucky good group or did bears just have much more armor?
---
It still works on retail (or at least it did during Legion, I haven't played in a while) so I imagine it could be made to work on classic. Or maybe that was bejeweled. Not sure. One of the two worked recently.
---
I remember the video on an ICC 25 man and they did a GM ticket and the GM started to turn them all into animals and giraffe's etc.
---
Not everyone's getting invited to the stress test either by the looks of it. But if you do have beta already, they share the same client download I think?
---
You assumed and, as the proverb predicted, you made an ass out of yourself.
---
OP, what do you think about the BIS list listed on  [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)   for Humans?  
---
Doesn't mention most of the items you linked.
---
As someone else said it's a very broad topic so just saying good for pvp is a hard question to answer. Character level, level of gear, and mode of play all dramatically effect the answers.  
---
**Levelling**   
---
Hunter/rogue/druid are kings at least up to lvl 40. After level 40 you get specs like spriest/frost/lock that become strong as well. If you stack stam you'll be pretty powerful on really any class except warrior in solo pvp. Warrior is a very sad solo class in poor gear.  
---
**60 Blues BGs** 
---
Mage/Hunter/(Holy Pally/Warrior)
---
These are the classes I think of in phase1 and 2 that aren't super gear dependant that will dominate the early BGs. Warrior/Healer (pally is best but really the important thing is just having heals) can easily wreck pub groups of 3 or 4 uncoordinated players. Warrior is the stickiest melee with high burst, MS debuff and plate armour. Pair it with a healer for success, pally with cleanse/BoF/bubbles and plate for the dream team.  
---
Mage and Hunter just don't need that much gear to function. They are hard targets to train and have high damage even without gear. Hunter is good at controlling melee and has high damage vs cloth/leather, mage has high control against everyone and good damage vs everyone.  
---
**60 High End Gear (AQ+)** 
---
Mage/Warlock/Warrior/Ele Shamy/Holy Pally
---
At this level damage goes through the roof for geared players. Casters melt everyone if they free-cast and physical dps like warriors/rogues/hunters shred anyone not in plate if they can stick to them. The only good healer is now a pally because bubble is just broken.   
---
*Rogues*

Rogues are really pretty good at all levels, just not amazing. They suffer in vanilla because end game pvp is all about group combat and they just aren't designed to be great at that - in most(not all) situations you'd rather have a warrior that isn't cooldown dependant to stick to targets. They are fun to play though and great in the open world.  
---
*Druids*  
---
Druids suffer as well from just not having a role in end game pvp. Yes of course they amazing FC but that's just another way of saying they're good at running from fights and avoiding fights constantly. While that is handy in WSG it means you only ever want one of them in WSG and won't ever be first pick in AB either. Druids are strongest when everyone is in blues and in low level gear. Here their mobility and survivability matches up well against everyone else's damage. Into AQ/Naxx where everyone's damage goes up a lot they really start to struggle. Even classes like warrior/rogue/hunter/mage become big problems for druids because their healing and mitigation doesn't scale as nearly as well as other classes damage.
---
Deadmines is DM because it came first.
---
It's actually the best thing about druids. You can browse reddit while the priests and paladins are ressing the raid.
---
There are definitely bottom-feeder specs like prot pally / moonkin druid that just flat-out don't work, but there are players that can make enhancement shaman and ret paladin work. The point I'm trying to make, is that unless the player/spec is putting up abysmal numbers that hinder the guild's progression - people don't need to be the spec police.
---
It would be nice if they could give 2-3 standout specs that are almost totally unusable a little nudge to make them more playable.  Having said that if you start playing with class balance you open up a giant can of "changes" worms, so probably best to leave it alone.
---
Personally I thought Burning Crusade's approach to class balance and utility was amazing so fingers crossed they revive that next.
---
It’s truly awful.
---
The dungeon set 2 questline was one of the most fun things I did in vanilla. Yeah, it was a lot of running around, but if you'd farmed up the full dungeon 1 set, it was so satisfying completing the 45m Strat run and the UBRS stuff and all the other crazy steps to get it. 
---
I still have most of the the unique quest items on my warrior that completed it eating up space in my bank. I was a little disappointed when they offered "replica" versions of the tier 0.5 gear via the Darkmoon Faire, because it felt like it diminished the accomplishment a little bit. 
---
I have a warrior bank alt transmogged to the warrior 0.5 set, and every once in a while someone will inspect me and notice it's not the replica gear and they'll start talking about how fun that quest chain was. Kind of nice that it occasionally seems to attract vanilla players.
---
No one said everybody from 2004 got invited, just that most people who did that aren't streamers were from 2004.
---
No but I'm about to check it out now lol
---
&gt; Who would you say is more bursty, Rogue or Hunter?
---
This is an old post, but for anyone browsing I'd like to point towards [Rentaki's Charm of Beasts from ZG for Hunters](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19953/renatakis-charm-of-beasts). With this trinket you have unrivaled burst potential and can destroy most clothies in one burst.
---
I think almost nobody has any idea just how much work went into tuning these vanilla parameters right on any good private servers.
---
Some people started to refer to some comments on some wow based tools and social media from more than a decade ago.
---
*Good private servers have better quality requirements than that.* Almost any detail is meticulously sourced and evidence has been found through the most obscure videos possible.
---
Their bug trackers are huge knowledge bases. If you give yourself the task to look up stuff that you feel is not tuned right, *check out their databases first*.
---
Sure let me go watch every press conference since 2017. Brb.
---
Many consider TBC to be the best state WoW was ever in, even more so than vanilla.  One of the biggest gripes about vanilla was the lack of class balance, and TBC fixed that perfectly, with almost every spec being viable.
---
I agree that how to implement a TBC expansion is a major issue.  But that's literally years away from being anything that we have to worry about.  Same with potential post naxx content.
---
I even levelled to 10 without heirlooms the other day, it was so dull on modern WoW
---
Awesome thank you and will do
---
Agreed. The difficulty is a huge part of what made Vanilla fun and it's not something to gloss over. If the dungeons are a face roll, I'm honestly not interested. 
---
I want to feel the pressure of having to calculate each pull and work together, actually use the tools the group brings to the table, rather than having everyone just mindlessly dps and cruise through all the dungeons.
---
One thing I forgot is that cost of learning the portals spells is pretty high compared to regular spells. I’m not sure if the websites I’ve seen online are accurate but they’re pretty expensive.
---
When they announced classic wow, they explained how they got the data in their hands. On an old backup of wrath (i think) they found a backup of the 1.12 server. This was found because they started looking for a backup. Also the 1.12 version is from 2006 and not 2004. They don’t have anything from before 1.12.
---
I mean your not wrong with your premise, the only point I'd like to make though is that ALTS were NEVER mentioned by OP so while you're right leveling alts will extend the time of leveling 1-60, but he wasnt leveling ALTS, he only mentioned this ONE character so it's kind of a pointless comment...1-60 in 140 Days even taking people schedule into account , IS in fact SLOW. Sorry not sorry you're wrong. Leveling 1-60 with level 1 spells in 5 months is INSANE, as I've previously stated, I'm not here to be an asshole but I stand by my original comment 100%  I mean FUCK the polar ice caps are MELTING faster than this guy can level....at this point he would have DROWNED by the global level of Sea rise before he hit 120 playing retail.
---
I did get an email. Tho there was no key in it, but they said i should login and download the client.
---
Received the email today at 6:30 p.m. (gmt +1). After getting home i could download the client :)
---
If you are playing a class that can roll Orc and you are going to PVP, be an Orc.
---
He assumes a pretty toxic persona on Twitch, for better or worse. Most of us see it as him just having fun in his own way, but others take legitimate offense to it.
---
In general, if you enjoy things, best not come to this subreddit. Someone will surely shit on your enjoyment of things.
---
I would like to see this proof, because i played a mage in vanilla and i've played 9 years on vanilla private servers and i strictly remember not being able to poly tagged mobs that are not yours.
---
&gt; This is not retail, vanilla is a game of extremes. Stop trying to dumb down the game because of feelings.
---
Perfect example how "dumbing things down" can be misused. You are telling people to bring other faction friends to kill or cc the mage. Well why do you not say the same thing to the mage? Shouldnt he instead just bring other faction friends to kill or cc the guy fighting the devilsaur?
---
And no vanilla is not a "game of extremes" that is something that stupid people say because they need a cool catchphrase to jerk each other off with.
---
Ok, we'll see in a year when everybody is level 60 what we call VC. ;)
---
shitty gear if you ask me
---
Nice, thanks for the info. Makes a lot more sense
---
Its called a time saver idea, instead doin worthelss quest you go somewhere else and achieve goal twice faster
---
Currently not ingame  maybe Blizzard will change their mind on it.
---
So I decided to go ahead and get some actual evidence on this.
---
Here are some videos of vanilla dungeon runs: http://progression-annexe.blogspot.com/2016/02/videos-of-retail-sources-for-vanilla.html
---
I checked this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQY5ma9Jg-c
---
The dmg reduction formula is Armor/(Armor + 400 + 85 * AttackerLevel)
---
It's a lvl 35 rogue fighting Rhahk'zor, I counted all hits from him and averaged it to 77.6 dmg.
---
A lvl 35 rogue with leather armor has about 650 armor, which means the raw dmg number would be 102.6.
---
A lvl 19 warrior with mail armor has about 1000 armor, which means the reduced dmg number would be 68.6.
---
Sounds about the same as Classic Beta.
---
blizzard gave me an extra free name change a couple years ago because i was baked and spelled my name wrong :D
---
Honestly, fuck Total Biscuit. He was the biggest advocate for shit like LFD, LFR, flying and removing the talent tree. People like him is what made WoW garbage. I dont care if he died of cancer. He was no good for classic and no good for the game.
---
Because it is very clickbait. 
---
&gt;A Seasoned Classic Wow Warrior Veteran Guide to Warriors planning on going Hardcore
---
Contains: very basic information for someone who wants to try out warrior for the first time, otherwise very common knowledge for most warriors who have ever been at 60.
---
Yeah this was badically the exact thing I wanted to do.
---
I am a 30 year old family man thats super giddy about this release. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about this. Not sure how the kids now-a-days will act compared to back in Vanilla. I'm was an old soul(back then) so I was pretty good about sharing.
---
Yeah crushing blows that was it!  I was a priest so I tried not to take damage but I knew there was another mechanic.
---
Thats bullshit. Blizzard didn’t give any shits about Nostralius other than the threat to their Copyrights and intellectual property. They had been saying no for years, there were even outrages prior to Nostralius, especially when they shut down the first private server that got popular in like 2009. 
---
Omar is the reason we have Classic. That’s it. Community interest has always been there, not because of private servers, but because that’s how nostalgia and good games work. Without the engineering feasibility, classic is just litigation Blizzard takes care of once a year. 
---
Thank the engineering team, not the pirates.
---
&gt; What is special about Classic is that it is (hopefully) forever.
---
when subs drop, they will announce TBC or something
---
So far, Blizzard has made the decision to not introduce the oldest mounts. So they won’t be in the release.
---
can't wait to PWN some n00bs amirite
---
Except they don't view themselves as players like everyone else. They are essentially celebrities in the streaming video game world.
---
Is there a comprehensive list of all debuffs and where they sit on the priority list? This is good info.
---
If the target is "white" aka tagged by anyone not in your group then you can not poly it.
---
And no polying someones target is not world pvp. Polying the player on the other faction however, thats world pvp.
---
If he gets xmorg i want my mount at lvl20 for free.... kek
---
I can’t remember, maybe a couple damage points, but not much variation.
---
I remember 100 years ago in osrs I got scammed by a guy claiming he would trim my rune plate armor with gold
---
i.love.lightforge  
---
I'm so excited, I just cant hide it.
---
Yeah they're usually pretty good. Only thing I kind of dislike is the fact that lately the GMs type in a... more "cutesy" way? Not really sure how to describe. Just seems like you're talking to a kid sometimes, but they've always been super helpful so I can't really complain.
---
I clarified this already: I didn’t say warlocks have more utility than other DPS classes anywhere above. In fact I said almost that exact sentence. I like acting as a utility PLAYER, when I get the chance. Doesn’t mean I want to play the most utilitarian DPS class.
---
Also warlocks are underpopulated on the alliance side therefor you get more opportunity to contribute when you can.
---
But I do like playing casters and have more experience as a mage then I do as a warlock. I’m open to playing a mage during classic. What types of utility could I offer in raids, as a mage, and would it be more frequent than as a warlock? 
---
Off the top of my head, I’m just thinking kiting and sheeping.
---
I've run Legion on a 2013 Macbook Pro without much issue and its CPU and integrated GPU are fairly out of date at this point. I didn't set any performance records but it was very playable on lower settings.
---
Classic should be a little bit lighter than modern WoW given that the textures are less detailed and animations are less complex. You shouldn't have any problems.
---
Tig ole bitties.
---
If your goal is to discourage others from killing devilsaurs, chaining banish while your guildie gets the other spawns is a way to go.
---
Amazing how nobody speaks about system speccs. Yes, its their 8.0.1 client but it had a lot of bandaid work done which has to be tested on as different systems as possible.
---
Vanilla wasn't all about dps meters. Sure, numbers mattered, to an extent, but that's not all there was to it, back then. Now, it's all about facerolling through content as fast as possible. Old content, we had to actually strategize to complete tasks. Every class, even the "non-viable" ones bring a different piece to the puzzle that, when used properly, contributed in their own way. It was on the players to figure out how the pieces fit.
---
If you want to sit and stare at a dps meter, Classic may not be the right version of the game, for you.
---
My memory of it is essentially every spell/talent in the game that effects 'shadow' is just for spells. If a mob has shadow resist then that effects wand damage, and casting a spell that reduces resist would in that case would improve wand damage. I think that's the only interaction where a payer can improve wand damage.    
---
Private servers have notoriously wonky wand mechanics (quivers- seriously?), and people have a way of coming to accept it as normal and vanilla like.
---
Better report them for using the new client as a base then. They've explicitly said that this is what they're doing, but it wasn't in vanilla so it's a bug.
---
Not in vanilla does not equal being a bug. You need to look up the definition of what a bug is.
---
I agree with a lot of that post. I think LFD and LFR did a lot of damage to the social aspect of the game. I think world quests with instant-grouping tools, excessive instancing, sharding, and lots of server merging did a lot of damage to the game socially. I feel like the sense of RP and personal pride in achievement has fallen a lot too.
---
I'm not a purist, but I get why they want the game to stay as it is and I respect that. I hope they get as much Classic as possible, but what I want most would expand on that experience. Anyway, kind of useless for me to debate too much about since I don't know what the future holds and I still need to experience Classic as it was.
---
Yes, it would ruin vanilla. Because then it isn't vanilla. If you want to raid as a fun spec, find or create a guild that allows for it.
---
Wait who are you quoting?
---
If it is such a widely known "fact" then surely it is documented somewhere other than offhand Reddit remarks?
---
What about just straight up game time purchased with real money does that still count?
---
It's obviously a fucking bug. You do realize this is beta, right?
---
I'm playing a hunter on the beta and have reported this. When I call pet it seems the world lags, the game basically freezes randomly until my pet is actually out.
---
If the lag doesn't occur,there is also like a 5-8 second delay on when I actually use call pet and also revive pet before it comes out. On retail its instant and I feel like it probably was in vanilla? (not actually sure, only had low level hunters) I reported anyways.
---
*unzips*
---
I wouldn't expect them to be on par dps wise, because that was huge about vanilla - DPS classes (pure) always higher. 
---
Feral is completely pointless for example. Complete shit. 
---
Enh shaman is basically useless, and in PvP is kited til the end of the earth. They might be able to heal once before going oom, but I doubt it since shocks cost a ton.
---
Ret pallies were imo the stronger of the bunch in PvP just because they had bubble, which is a huge CD let's be honest. 
---
It's risky balancing things because they can screw it up, and I honestly agree with that, but having played Vanilla onward, I can pretty much guarantee it's not going to be a good idea to remain exactly the same indefinitely.
---
To add to the other guy, in classic, if you sit, you will still get crit. But that crit doesn't proc things like enrage etc.
---
Intentions matter.  Retail WoW players who have never experienced vanilla leveling, are going in thinking that they just wanna blow through the leveling content and get to 60 as fast as possible.
---
The journey is fun, by doing this, you undoubtedly miss out on a lot of what makes Vanilla great.  As long as you're not being an asshole about it, I don't see anything wrong with someone saying "hey, maybe you should think about slowing down and enjoying the leveling process".  At the end of the day, we all love this game and we want others to love it too.  Just don't be an asshole about it.
---
Gnome warlock, ah yes finally some of refined taste.
---
Am I the only one who doesn’t want beta? I’d hate to have the experience ruined for me by getting burned out prematurely. Yeah beta can be fun, but all that work you do will disappear.
---
They dont want the streamers getting gank untill they have gear so no incentive to pvp other then "fuck that guy" witch is always my reason
---
Kinda unfortunate that the post directly under you has wood looking way better lol
---
Played mage up untill 4 hoursemen in Naxx. Can confirm that "white" or "tagged" mobs could not be polyd as i remember it.
---
I remember it because i was farming in Tyr's Hand, a lot, during retail vanilla and sometimes you wanted to save a stupid rogue that pulled too much shit but i had to cast rank 1 frost bolt because poly didnt work.
---

oh hey another "should they change class balance" post, how about leave it the fuck alone for the 1000th time
---
It could be, depending on the size of the dungeon. Skinning is a 1.5 sec cast, double that to account for movement, say there are 40 skinnable animals in the dungeon it would add 3 minutes to the run in total time. Is anyone really waiting around that long?
---
Saying shit that's obviously not bugs is just retarded though. "The damage font is wrong, it's a bug".

No, the damage font is working exactly as intended. It's not the font you WANTED, but it's not a bug.

As a Vanilla hunter it felt like I reached a level where I was just plain unstoppable in PvP.

Pug life is the only life in raiding for me

TotalBiscuit was very much against Classic, but he was also a dude who always admitted when he was wrong. He was a man of character, and it's very sad he couldn't be around to partake in the hype of Classic.

EU-PvP GMT Casual Alliance Rogue Looking for Guild.
---
I intend to play relatively casually, with an aim to get at least one evening of raiding in each week. I have a 9-5 job so can usually be online any time after 6pm. I'm hoping to be online 2-3 evenings per week. I originally started playing towards the end of vanilla and raided throughout TBC and WOTLK.
---
Level 10 (?) to start a guild

Lok’Tar Ogar
---
The guy he said it to was also pretty annoyed that people kept bringing something up from years ago, since he and TB already came to terms with it and moved on with their lives, "like adults do."
---
He most certainly knew that the people who ragged on TB for it years after the fact don't actually give a shit about him personally or his feelings, but are just pushing their character defamation narrative.
---
Make sure you don't turn into purist yourself. I'ts a Heavy on the RPG aspect game. Raiding is but a single part of it. Maybe if you go through it, you will see why so many are afraid of potential OSRS model. It takes one slip, one.
---

What the fuck does "jebaited" mean? They've been saying it in Yogscast videos recently. Christ, please don't tell me it's another retarded twitch meme like "kappa".
---
I'm not sure that's true.
---
Most older MMOs have had "vanilla" server launches when they get past a certain point, people flock to in for nostalgia and then a certain amount stays to create a certain number of healthy servers who generate good revenue.
---
Whether it's Everquest, Everquest 2, Rift, etc... Vanilla server aren't a novelty, and not all games gauged potential success on private servers.
---
Yea, this is a big misconception. Rogues only suck in BGs if you run around mindlessly without any kind of strategy. They are really strong in BGs in the right hands.
---
Confirmed source here saying all private server players don't like blizzard.
---
The (wo)man in the seat. Pick a class. Get gud. Pwn.
---
I was 12 when wow released and also had an older cousin that would let me watch him play. Once I got the game my self all he told me was not to look anything up and figure it out on my own. I was such a noob, all I wanted to do is be good enough to play with him and his friends. Now I am, but he doesn't play much games anymore.
---
As for being bamboozled: I quickly learned that typing /camp will not set up a nice little rest area for myself in Stormwind.
---
Exactly. Idk, it seems the Nochange crowd are mostly people who haven't played it, wanting to get the real experience. I get that, but it's not going to be the same. Like I said before, not many people are leveling a shit spec when they know it won't be buffed PERIOD. They'll level a sure-thing and be OP along with the others.
---
Monkeynews didn't receive a single heal besides Blood Craze during that boss. There is just no way not needing a healer in a dungeon that you are slightly under leveled for is Blizzlike.
---
Why does anyone even want an invite to a stress test?
---
Do you get beta access as well or something?  
---
Why would you want to spend 2 hours constantly trying to login and then deal with server crashes/restarts repeatedly?
---
You're right... this seems to be the only plausible explanation for a non-crit 101 hit, if we assume values are correct.
---
What if I told you, your guild didn’t have to deny anyone because of spec. And I highly doubt you were denied a kill because of raid comp
---
bingo
---
There are two important factors to consider when looking at database sites.
---
1. The information was gathered using addons, and so the data only represents a fraction of what actually dropped.
---
2. The information is for "what actually dropped" and not the "chance to drop". An item with a 5% drop chance may have an "actual" drop rate of 1%, or 10%.
---
Think about a 6 sided die. Each side has an equal chance of being rolled, but if you were to roll it six times you may end up rolling a "1" six times.
---
Me too and I'm having fun. Takes the edge off a bit.

---
this is my whole poiint, read the conversation they had, he is being an asshole, coming off as elitist in a sense.
---
There is literally no problem with rushing to 60, you can always get an alt. So fear of him burning out has a natural remedy in the game itself
---
Nah, that might actually be true. Kr*n*s is notorious for high HP and armor value on boss, for example. Private servers are wrong, but that doesn't mean they are easier, it depend on the mob/boss.
---
Not a chance they can fix everything in three months lol. There's WAY too many things *already* that are wrong
---
1-10 anything that can heal. Then warlocks, soon getting overpowered by hunters. I'M anyway, cuz what's OP anyway.
---
Literally had people try to bash me when i said this isnt a bug or a change lmfao.

They literaly HAVE A WORLING ORIGINAL VANILLA CLIENT AND SERVER FOR TESTING. BUG REPORTS AS A REFERENCE LMAO.

This is So true.

Is Cthun so hard sitting one player really made a difference? I've never gotten to that point seems awesome that one guy could fuck everything up lol
---
member naked gnomes with different hair colored  would die infront of orgrimmar and log off so you had their dead naked bodies around for a while .
---
"We worked really hard on our own project so please believe us"
---
That's not enough rationale to go against the stuff Blizzard is using for a template.
---
Druid tier is that Dreamwalker? That's cool as well yeah! Frostfire not my thing.
---
Hmm interesting I think Judgement is kinda cool.
---
My least favorite would be... Nightslayer for chest and legs (because of the shoulders alone) and Nemesis for robe (also something off about the shoulders).
---
didn't 315 engineering give you a lvl 63 arcanite dragonling or am I misremembering.
---
What memes did we have in the mid 2000’s? (00’s?)
---
First off I am in no way a fan of retail but atleast you can play whatever class you enjoy playing. 
---
Second off I simply said buff abilities, retail has taken 2/3rds of your abilities and 80% of your talents. There’s a huge difference in changing a class completely and buff your abilities so you can participate in content
---
As someone who is rolling a hunter for the first time and wants to mainly pvp, how do I subscribe to your newsletter? :D
---
We all want to go home. Even blizzard.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Once you get to 60 as a warlock you basically stack shadow damage because you have infinite mana with life tap+heals
---
Funny, I remember the exact same thing happening in our guild.  (US) Mal\`Ganis?
---
Lol, in Vanilla if a piece of loot dropped, it wasn't uncommon for the Raid leaders to tell a hybrid class that they weren't getting it. You have no idea what you're talking about if u think that's wrong. It happened legit all the time, a mail agility piece dropped, enh shaman wants it, a lot of the time it'd go to the hunter.
---
I dont have the number's ill try googling but even at 300 in herbalism some things can still fail. You can get passed 300 tho to get a no fail rate.
---
Rogues are underrated in group combat. Not because of damage, but because of control/peels. A rogue can do a lot to peel for a healer and help him survive, or can lock-down opponents to allow bigger damage dealers (lock/ele/mage) to freecast on it, and they can remove an enemy healer from the fight.
---
Yeah I agree. It's really weird that they haven't fixed a bug that literally makes you unable to progress through the game. Such a game breaking bug should surely be a top priority.
---
because they are viable. just not in 1 aspect of the game where people want it to be.
---
prot pallies are great at farming, moonkin is the go to pvp spec for druids.
---
warriors crush everyone in raids but cant level or farm for shit.
---
every spec is great at something and shit at other things, also every class has a raid spec and no class isnt included in raids.
---
being imbalanced in different aspects of the game is what makes it balanced as a whole, having everything be good at everything is how BFA happens
---
If Blizz had the info, damage numbers wouldn't be so wildly inaccurate. Vintage vanilla YouTube footage easily proves this
---
Uber pwnage
---
I’m just explaining what we know so far, it will be 1.1 mount system and 1.12 AV as of right now, they listened to the community and went with the old mount system so I’m sure they’d listen if everyone was wanting the older AV system as well. The classic dev team has been very open to these types of discussions
---
I was a Hunter so I little to worry about. Rip if you were a druid or shaman that wanted to dps though. Maybe if people wanted to go to MC when it was on farm and while healing for prog on bwl but changing specs wasnt as easy as opening a new tab and clicking activate back then.
---
Chad casual is clearly the superior race
---
Heart of the Wild isn't a proper pvp spec really, it's just one that works ok and lets you pve as well. No proper druid pvp spec will go far enough down feral to get FF. It main use in pvp is just to prevent rogue stealth.  
---
It is super handy while levelling to pull things in form without having to shift and waste mana.
---
Oh I never said Psychopath, I said getting a complex.
---
Feral FF saves an out-of-form gcd and mana. Important in PvP and PvE.
---
We didn't have streamers back when I played Classic.
---
I'm not a #NoChanges guy, but #NoStreamers is something I can get behind.
---
When have these schmucks ever been a good example of anything?
---
are you talking about the post by the dude that showed Joana getting hit for 1-2 instead of 5-6 due to a bug with Stoneskin Totem? you can look at Alliance runs and compare the damage elites in dungeons are doing and they're nearly identical.
---
This sub became infested with retail players that don't know shit. It's just a giant circlejerk at this point
---
Fine, don't believe me. Ain't gonna keep me up at night.
---
The actual record back in vanilla was 4 days 20 hrs /played. And that was from Joana himself. Every improvement since then has been on private servers, which we know aren't accurate. Also worth noting that was as a hunter with specific builds and skipping tons of content you normally wouldn't want to skip. Coming in under 6-7 days will only be a handful of people who really know what they are doing (and didn't just watch some YouTube videos).

Doesn't look fake at all. The account is 4 months old and was involved with a /r/wow giveaway thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bjvsnp/rwow_1m_subscriber_giveaway_megathread_part_1/).
---
[It's happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0bbm2bKjIw)
---
Which one?
---
Won't belong before 125k!
---
I get that you're farming karma but you really expect people to watch an hour long video just to hear his opinion? Use timestamps or something dude.
---
dude people bring like 6 pallies up to 8 shamans and tons of priests to raids. in what world are hybrids not worthwhile to bring
---
Gnome Rogue. Engineering/Mining. Stunlock double mace midget with bombs like i used to be.
---
It was in the middle of despawning I presume
---
why is hunter wearing shoes. fake news
---
Do you have Esfand's point of view?
---
No problems!
---
Yeah I just posted it
---
Really ? That's interesting, if it was true it would lower what I thought was the Vanilla lvl 60 armor cap by a couple thousands, thanks for the info !
---
I haven't been able to keep up with all of the info coming out. Did this get resolved? Was the dmg in dungeons (specifically Asmon just mongoaggroing everything and living) correct?
---
Who do you think was playing Vanilla? A bunch of 11 year olds or a bunch of 20-30 year olds? It has been 15 years.
---
Time to delve into the depths of albinoblacksheep and ebaumsworld.  Like frog, suck flies and end ze world.
---
Literally theres hundreds of videos of people from pservers from the last couple years who kept on insisting that they and their thousands of fans would pay the subscription for classic. I've watched them. If you wana go find said clips, go find them yourself. Or if you're open to common sense take my word for it.
---
Don’t get your panties twisted over something so trivial god
---
Thanks for bringing these issues up
---
Why are you talking as if raiding is the main aspect of Vanilla? You realize hybrid specs like Ele, Spriest, and maybe a few others are disgusting in PVP. Vanilla isnt templated so you would just be taking 2 already nuts classes in PVP and just making them even better.
---
Hogger raids.
---
So, Alliance Rogues spending all of the game in mid aren't doing it right? oof
---
Can confirm you do NOT need a sub. I have a token active and i received a beta invite late last week.
---
I participated in the open beta for original wow, as well. Had over 100 days played before tbc.
---
Yeah it’s interesting on the classic beta was killing Murlock oracles some would heal, others would cast lightning bolts tell death, and some would just melee me half the time.
---
Might be an age thing but only 1 person I know who's interested is watching streams and I'm the only one on here. Every one else is just waiting and getting their info through us every couple of weeks.
---
That has been my experience on retail servers as well. I have played both PvE and PvP servers over the years.
---
I think that PvP servers promote a mindset of competition, that everyone around you is a competitor and so you should do what you can to put yourself ahead of them.
---
On the other hand my experience on PvE servers has been that people are more helpful and altruistic, doing things for the benefit of community even if it does not benefit themselves directly.
---
That is not to say that you cannot find selfish folk on PvE servers or helpful folk on PvP servers, but I think it is more common the other way around.
---
You could be right, I made a dwarf on the beta and ran to Elwyn at lvl 3 and I remember that run taking so much longer, and also dying more along the way.
---
So, dis iz Earth. ROUND!? okay.
---
same here, gotta stretch this season out as long as i can!
---
Hmmm, I agree it went in an asshole-ish direction there towards the end.  When I replied, the comment thread was not that long.  I didn't think he was being overtly asshole-ish in his original comment though.
---
Let's just agree not to be assholes. I'm of the mindset that you shouldn't rush to 60 and just enjoy the ride as not to miss out on anything.  If you wanna play differently thats cool. Just think it's worth mentioning when people talk about blowing through 1-60.
---
1. Deadmines DM was before Dire Maul even came out
---
2. No other dungeon is ever abbreviated to the final boss' initials
---
3. Nobody ever says "LFG Dire Maul". It's Dire Maul East, or Dire Maul Tribute, etc.
---
Would have probably been good for the ol vitamin D intake tbh
---
Oh so you're not intending to heal with full strength and stam gear like esfand did without needing to drink?
---
I was on a Pserver and the GM started playing c'thun noises over the entire server before a reset lol
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2X2lw7DSbk
---
It's so much easier finding a premade spot as a PVP healer than undead mage number seventy two. PVP healers are always in demand.
---
&gt; you can play whatever class you enjoy playing
---
then you're playing the wrong class.
---
Speak for yourself
---
&lt;&lt;&lt; Nightelf hunter
---
Yes they are nice for locking down one target. Their problem is mainly they are very squishy when targeted by a hunter/warrior/rogue, like many times more squishy than a warrior that can go def stance + shield in one global. That is a huge weakness in group pvp.    
---
And yeah stopping 1 healer from healing is nice by a rogue, but putting MS on the kill target and halving all healing done by the entire enemy team is even nicer.
---
hmm, shame you had to jump to the TBC baby thing, pretty much discredits your opinion straight off. 
---
I'm a Vanilla player, started just before 1.5 I believe. 
---
I don't know why you're arguing this, it's pretty much established that TBC Heroics were harder than Vanilla dungeons, that was the whole point of them. 
---
Classic dungeons were challenging for sure. They were long in that they largely required a lot of time to clear (BRD, Strath, ST) and required smart pulls. 
---
But, you ask any one who played actively in Classic and TBC which was the harder dungeon.
---
BRD vs Shattered Halls Heroic
---
Scholo vs Arcatraz Heroic
---
ST vs Shadowlabs Heroic
---
The vast majority will say that the TBC Heroics were harder.
---
I'm 100% certain this guy is wrong.
---
The top WoW streamer is a known pos, need to make sure people are aware of it.
---
i just dont wanna scare people off, this guy literally has never played wow before. Everyone thought it would be pure nostalgia and die out. We need people like him, if we want classic to succeed.
---
Got cocky and wasted blink b/c laziness. lol GG
---
Also its good to see Seal of Command is working properly in the beta (it was fucked on most vanilla private servers).
---
3 months before release, some of you already are trying to snowflake it. STOP!
---
I wanna know the hardest dungeon that can be done at level 30. The only issue i have is im watching a horde of level 30s take on skull level monsters without much trouble. Like shouldn't even a level 30 tank be getting one shot by the mobs in Deadwind pass which I'm pretty sure are lvl 56-60
---
What if I NEED the gold?
---
Hi, /u/amijustamoodybastard
---
Considering you were in SM and able to equip it, then it was probably night blade or flurry axe I suppose.
---
Have people been getting invited by email? People keep saying here to keep check the launcher?
---
Nah sorry his face is to round for me looks like Russian doll :D
---
He passed away last year to cancer.
---
I don't doubt that people who played on pservers are willing to pay for an official Classic, but that is not the debate.
---
OP claims that if not for private servers then WoW Classic would never exist, and it is presented as a **fact**. I would like to see the evidence that supports that claim.
---
People do rfk at 28+ minimum, yikes.
---
Have fun carrying along a fresh 60 through DM. I'll be farming it with my MC geared friends for gold. So sorry that I don't give a fuck. 
---
Wanting to play with people of a similar experience level as you is so horrible lmao. I love people who think that classic will be this oasis where everyone wants to waste their valuable time hand holding people.
---
I believe they already have based on the blue post.
---
People love ripping into celebrities as if they're perfect themselves. The hypocrisy on display after TB's death was massive. 
---
Truth is the people posting those screenshots didn't like his political stances and that's all there is to it. People do, indeed, suck.
---
Never played classic, what was the usual pecking order on who gets the chance at tf first or second?
---
Freeroaming in BGs to pick people off is fun and all but the Rogue's true strength in BGs is peels/control and defending flags.
---
are you a gnome? it happens to my gnome in live because of their +engi skill isnt applied until after they are logged in or smth
---
Its a fairly common term.  Server instance is a misnomer in most cases because you can have 5 Instances of a Server Client running one one Virtual Server.  
---
Saying a 'Server', or a 'Server server' makes even less sense.
---
What does that have to do with denying guild applications based on spec? 
---
You have no idea what your talking about if you honestly believe you needed 40 geared competent players in your raid group. 25 geared players and 15 mouth breathing keyboard turners is plenty to get thru most of the content
---
All I'm saying is that as a warlock YOU WILL NOT GET TO BE A UTILITY PLAYER except for on 2/33 boss fights. If that appeals to you then definitely go for it. If you're looking for a dps class that provides more "active" utility in fights, then you can look to mage or hunter. 
---
Locks aren't/won't be underpopulated on alliance. They are actually much BETTER on alliance and given what we know now, the majority of hardcore locks will be rolling Gnome for intellect boost, and alliance because Pally's have salv. Playing a lock on horde is a shittier experience for that reason alone. 30% threat reduction in vanilla is godly, and warlocks need that threat reduction more than any other class.
---
I never raided as a mage or hunter but based of memory mages were used fairly often to decurse, and for slows/kiting. Hunters use tranq shot and are used for kiting (a lot of BWL comes to mind). I might also be forgetting about other utility mechanics. Maybe someone else could list all the encounters with special mechanics for these classes. 
---
At the end of day, you're still a dps class first and foremost, but I can say with confidence that mage/hunter have many more fights where they are required to provide some form of utility.
---
Played hunter in retail, mage on pservers. It took me ages to find the deadzone, which is practicallly non-existant on pservers, on the mage.
---
Buff Shred. Ferals rape you in 2 GCDs worse than rogues.
---
Buff ele mana regen. Shamans roll ele to heal.
---
Buff retri autoattack. People complain about retris being able to literally afk 80% of the raid while topping charts.
---
Thanks, mostly want to get ppl down in 1v1 and wpvp
---
My brother told me I could fish up epics and that I should do it on his char cause he had higher skill which invreased my chances.
---
I probably have every quest memorized due to all the alts I leveled during vanilla.
---
I’ll be fucking all the guys during phase 1.  Every guy I see is gunna end up with a prolapsed asshole.
---
&gt; ...Rogue's true strength in BGs is peels/control and defending flags.
---
We're in trouble then, all of them run off thinking they are Rambo and try to 1v4, every time. &gt;.&lt;
---
Did you post your discord info or am I just blind? Lol
---
Aimed shot broke shadowmeld once the shot went off in Classic, not when the skill was triggered.  Made it so a NElf hunter could aimed shot, auto shot, multi shot before the other person even knew what was going on.
---
Awesome video man!
---
Yeah this is huge. Ran inti this so many times when it was fresh asshole mages. Glad its gone
---
An on level bear would have substantially higher armor than the average Warrior at that point, if I remember correctly, and also benefits from having more stamina. Their major weakness in end game content didn't really apply to on level content because of how hit tables worked. 
---
Also, in a group that knows what to expect the healer can just spam big heals knowing the fight ahead of time. It's just a significant jump in damage compared to the other bosses and enemies you've been fighting up to that point if you haven't encountered him before.
---
Ya it was decent but for hard modes not all that viable still. And the poster was talking about vanilla as well
---
We're home.... \*wipes tear\*
---
Okay waffle boi, let me shift the burden of proof to you. Prove that pservers had absolutely no influence on their decision to re release the 15 year old version of the game.
---
&gt; because they’re putting in mount equips
---
No one ever said that. It’s an assumption wowhead made, nothing more. 
---
In previous expacs devs have said that the absorbs preventing daze was a bug, but they’ve never decided to fix it for some reason. Why now? Who knows, but it’s a fix, not a nerf.
---
nou
---
No you both
---
Go check out the Classy Friday posts in the sidebar.
---
This is exactly what I did except on a different server, including making me own guild.
---
Calling people nubs or scrubs. I hail from the counter-strike side of the mid 2000's online gaming era, though.
---
mass media certainly accelerated it. Twitch by itself is jusz one of countless forms.
---
Yea that's a fair concern.  I was one of those who thought it was all nostalgia.  But after thinking about it more for a game design sense.  I'm growing fairly certain that the game was just way more engaging and immersive due to a multitude of reasons.
---
I refuse to even look at Overwatch solely because I demand he comes back to the WoW team
---
id say in terms of speed against all classes warrior will be the slowest.       
---
If u care about getting ahead and solo questing, warlocks and hunters are both exceptional levlers, considered 2 of the best. There definitely are some growing pains before you get your pet as a hunter though.
---
Also have to remember it's in a beta. Ultimately, none of this will last so they are having a bit of fun with it.
---
Gimme that full Droo gear already!
---
Now so it by hand!
---
Night elf bear.
---
Imagine being this dumb
---
Video footage doesn't mean shit unless there's proof in it as to what patch it was recorded in. Recorded, not posted. Have you found proof of this being possible in 1.12? If so, you really should link that.
---
There's such thing as search. Try using it next time you have a question that been discussed million times.
---
If you don't want to read, here's a video I like: 
---
[VANILLA FLAVORS 🍦 Priest Vanilla WoW Class Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ5Z33ZYAec)
---
This ain't it, Chief.
---
Appreciate that, thanks for watching!
---
The irony
---
I like the part where Kaplan retells the paradigm shift Conquest caused for WoW raiding.
---
In-game music is still the best.
---
Leveling 1-60 in vanilla is a great journey and imo best part of the game. I wouldn't rush it.
---
idk yours looks cleaner which i prefer. what would it look like if you stained it?
---
Like it.
---
This. I play on one currently that actively works to mitigate bugs as they are discovered. They have an active dev team that goes back to old YouTube videos to try to verify or dismiss a bug. They work to make vanilla as close to original content as they can. To make a statement that all pservers don’t know what they’re talking about is BS. Also, I don’t hate blizzard, I don’t like what the game has become, I’m excited for what blizzard can do for vanilla. I’ll pay my $15 and enjoy it all!
---
same with shammies so all healers do
---
Here's how the vanilla UI calculates your armor (in the character sheet tooltip):
---
```
---
local armorReduction = effectiveArmor/((85 * playerLevel) + 400);
---
armorReduction = 100 * (armorReduction/(armorReduction + 1));
---
Simplify that (and remove the 100 multiplier that turns it from decimal to a percentage) and it turns into the `DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * AttackLevel)` formula.
---
My account is from day one 2004 and i just had a sub running and not touched BFA for 4 months. I got in to the beta. My 3 friends who all have accounts from 2004 got it
---
the ones with newer accounts didnt
---
Pretty sure you could not play without the expansions. Not even low level bgs.
---
So if didnt have TBC you also didnt play twink bgs during TBC.
---
Yes, we should trust the devs but help them out wherever we can by filing these reports. I mean, they are human and it's like 15 year old data they would need.
---
Numbers can be off obviously but that's the point of this beta, so devs can get feedback and fix stuff.
---
They WILL check and cross-reference data points, they will try to make it as close as possible to the original 1.12.1 but there WILL be things that aren't quite right ... yet. 
---
Give them clear feedback and trust in their experience and knowledge.
---
I'm not Nochanges, but I'm always up for harder content.
---
The way I see it, #NoChanges is so that people capture the exact Vanilla experience that people experienced. The general playerbase skill level was really low, so things were harder for everyone. Because of that, in order to capture the same *experience*, the mobs should be set harder to encompass the current skill level of the playerbase.
---
Yep, there's plenty of bugs to report by just playing the game, which is honestly what is expected of most players. There's a lot of critical judgment coming in from players who are salty about not being in the beta. Not that I blame them for being upset, but they're also being unreasonable.
---
Wasting time?  We've waited a long time to get a legitimate version of this game, I don't think a bit of research is time wasted.
---
God I love wildheart and light forge so much
---
It would break functionality of things that would be scripted to target based on name.  This is less important with the modern macros compared to the old script macros.  
---
This just stops the ultra try hard macros, like if you duel the same people over time, they might make a macro to target your pet by name to CC it.
---
Yeah, I drink maybe 1 soda a year. A drink here and there is good enough for me lol. I used to slam coke by the 24 pack though. God so terrible looking back on it lol.
---
No, spir and int is better for enhance while leveling because mana and regen is more efficient
---
http://progression-annexe.blogspot.com/2016/02/videos-of-retail-sources-for-vanilla.html
---
Nice list, it should help if someone is still looking for sources.
---
&gt; I could be very wrong about all of this
---
Comments in this thread point to a very resounding "yes".
---
It all depends on the community. Warriors generally get dibs.
---
I read the beta had started and restarted my bnet client and the beta was there in the drop down. Never got an email... Not an influencer or friend or family member of anyone at Blizzard
---
never seen a 113 and I never will
---
Vc is NA
---
DM ia EU
---
Usually when you talk about dire maul its  east west etc,  and people are high level so no confusion. VC is just weird
---
That is because the final boss is level 33. Not because a 27 would struggle to kill the level 25 elites at the start of the instance.
---
And it kinda proves my point. If a 28 can fight and kill a 33 elite boss, then do you really think a level 30 warrior is going to struggle to kill a single pull level 25 elite trash mob?
---
Hi, /u/Child_ish
---
If you want, go do the same math for the other mobs if you can find them in the videos.
---
I checked Defias Overseer too and he should be hitting for around ~30 on avg.
---
Quality pasta 5/7
---
&gt; If you want to sit and stare at a dps meter, Classic may not be the right version of the game, for you.
---
More like Id like to be able to play my retail class in a decent guild without being told to gtfo because said spec is a joke
---
1. The burden of proof is on the claimant.
---
2. Please refer to the following link as to why your request is ridiculous: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance
---
You can keep your insults and condescension, I am here for facts.
---
It doesnt matter what u CAN do, it's what people will take.
---
I am almost certain all of this 'mobs are weak' stuff is just all of the streamers over-leveling the dungeons.
---
I figured. I didn't start maining Horde-side til after Cata and my only Ally sham was a Draenei I only got to 35 so I wasn't really sure when they got theirs.
---
The funny part is you can still buy these on Amazon. I'm surprised the prices haven't jumped up a bunch yet. I half want to get it for just photos. (Love the old WoW/Warcraft Art)
---
Jeff Kaplan died in the Omnic Crisis so we could finally get classic wow PepeHands
---
Ah good call on the healer, I didn't realize he was only getting off heals (had to watch a stupid twitch ad every time I wanted to replay that kept locking up so I stopped trying to rewatch it)
---
Rogue/Hunter are top tier in WPvP ganking, 1 on 1s and just general pvp as a whole. Hunters are still pretty good in BGs, though perhaps not as strong as they are in wPvP. Rogues...my personal experience as a rogue was "OK" in WSG, and "awesome" in AB and AV. So, I guess it depends.
---
Mages are great at BGs and also mass wPvP like hillsbrad
---
Warlocks and Spriests are fantastic in BGs as well
---
Priests (bonus points if horde) and especially Paladins are great healers both in wPvP and BGs
---
Warriors are wrecking balls if pocketed - probably no scarier class minute to minute. An extremely well geared warrior is fearsome even when not pocketed.
---
This is about what I recall from my experience in Vanilla some 14/15 years ago, and zero private server playing in between. That is not to say that other classes weren't good. They just don't stick out in my memory as much.
---
You do realise Blizzard flew out the Nostalrius team to Irvine, where they did a presentation on how they made Vanilla WoW servers possible in the first place in terms of scripting and programming the old content.
---
Blizzard wanted to know how possible it would be for them them to recreate the game and this was certainly a huge stepping stone for them to change their mind on Classic servers.
---
Im sorry but this cant be a true story.
---
There's an entire build around this in Sword rogues, and is why you add a shaman to the melee dps group in raids.
---
Nope, they have for example: 38-47 and it can be any number between that
---
Found the streamer
---
i can tell you right now even if blizz put right damage etc theres gonna be people complaining about it simply because noone knows what is right or wrong... but dungeons looks easier then on private server wich brings a question if it has to be like before or even if its gonna be too easy or just buff it same as private servers to make sure it is challenging
---
Sorry I didn't mean to be rude. Was more meant to be funny, yours is cool too, I'm sure with time investment you could reproduce the same thing!
---
Yeah, they have twink-tier gear from getting handouts from their fans. In addition, early level dungeons are easier by design. The difficulty starts ramping up around level 40.
---
Sadly it is xD
---
Ahh, I remember that happening after servers crashed while we were raiding MC, too.
---
&gt;My life long dream in WoW has always been to wield Benediction, but healing is not really my bag, nor is PvP
---
Then flush those dreams down the tubes... don't play a class for a single item when you don't like either of the only 2 things it's good at. Would wielding a cool looking staff really be worth playing a class you don't like at all?
---
Shadow PvE is not great, it's just sub-optimal to almost any other DPS with few upsides that a standard priest doesn't bring. There's shadow weaving to buff warlocks, sure, but you could get the same thing out of a SW/Holy or SW/PI spec spamming low ranks of SW:P without losing out on a good DPS class.
---
They'll likely get brought to raids occasionally, but expect to put in a lot of work to show that you're worth bringing and make friends who invite you. And expect hate from any other priests who need the eye, and don't want their BiS staff going to the SPriest.
---
The Butterknife of truth, maybe?
---
Can we kite Azuregos into Orgrimmar ?
---
I already tried giving you facts. Blizzard heeded the call from thousands of people, but apparently it wasn't good enough for you. Go to r/atheism with your burden of proof and develop some common sense.
---
Cata-Rogue babies lol. Sometimes they gotta learn the hard way.
---
It is. https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jebaited
---
I'll be making damn sure I don't end up playing on a server the popular streamers are on.
---
Use this and calculate dmg values based on the armor formula. Only accurate info available.
---
You can see my calcs here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/eodbf5o/
---
I did it for Rhahk'zor and the dmg range is accurate.
---
Did you watch the video where alot of values are different?  There is one on the front page.   So almost every damage and life total in this beta is a bug?
---
Went with a GM in a flying saucer, later fighting a giant chicken that would 1-shot people back on sunwell isles, TBC. All this over an item I deleted by mistake. Great fun!
---
I had it posted, then removed it. Rather have people message me and inquire about it rather than having it open to the world! ahhaha. want the discord link though?
---
[Bingo!](https://gyazo.com/edde815b11989eb25a282c20e7ce2f68)
---
Only for raids
---
I think the error is that base miss is 3%. Then you do def skill calculation. 
---
3% + (15 \* .4%) = 9% 
---
Although that might be tbc calculation.
---
I hope we get gms in the game world from time to time just like in vanilla.
---
imagine wanting changes in classic for no reason other than being too cheap to respec. good thing you wont get it
---
It’s a popular twitch emote just like kappa, PogChamp, etc..
---
Corrupted Ashbringer isn't even that good for the spec my guy. We use Manual Crowd Pummeler for boss fights, which is confirmed to be working exactly the same in the beta currently as it did on private servers. [Here's a link to the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hbgtnA7SCAB7u2otYCiQPwaovv0L9bfn1B-VrWvhmKA/edit?usp=sharing), where I've input **Spelladin full Naxx BiS** gear. Can you point out what is wrong about the calculations here? Is **1117 dps** with no world buffs somehow not viable? The uptime of the rotation is **5 minutes straight**, and can be increased to **2.5 hours** by downranking Consecration for a **loss of 17 dps**.  
---
Just because you dislike Theloras doesn't mean this spec is bad, and a lot of people have put time and effort into theorycrafting it, not just Theloras.
---
Is T4 rank 14 gear?
---
If any of you dudes/dudettes wanna learn how to pwn uberly like the best of the best then head on over to this guide https://youtu.be/QPCDoANDkl4 Be careful though it's only for the most epikest of pwners.

Good warriors are gods in BGs, I'll definitely agree to that.

The stress test doesn't start until tomorrow, and the beta account has been temporarily renamed to "Stress test and Beta"...

If you can log in and play a character, congrats!  You are in the actual beta!

&gt;  TBC heroics were EASIER
---
Please. The orcs in Shattered Halls would *one shot* me as a Priest. *One. Shot.* When they got nerfed, they would two shot me, it was great. 
---
Saying the heroics were easier and even going as far as saying "in every aspect" is absurd. I pugged every single Classic dungeon at the time it was relevant.  Pugs would regularly do UBRS, Scholomance, Stratholme etc -  I remember running Stratholme both in the popular class raid format and as a 5 man after it was changed. 
---
Were there wipes? Yeah sure. Sometimes.
---
Shattered Halls or Arcatraz in the early weeks though? Fuck that. Guild runs only. 
---
Classic dungeons had more consistent difficulty while there was a much larger diversity of difficulty in TBC Heroics. You had dungeons like Mechanar which were much easier and then you had Shattered Halls where you'd get creamed.
---
Some of us are altoholics and will be running deadmines more. 
---
Also how many 60s are going to be spamming "LFG VC"? Literally zero. So by your own argument no one will use VC and everyone else will use DM.
---
That’s blatantly not true. It’s well documented that they flew the nostralius team out AFTER they did proof of concept on the 8.0 client and the information they asked nostralius for was marketing data and user engagement
---
Wasn’t Joana’s vanilla record ~5 days? I would say a first time wow player most likely isn’t going to hit 60 in 6 days let alone 5.
---
Nothing.
---
Depressing. :(
---
The beta has a world channel?
---
Tears are the best lubricant.
---
This happens to me constantly, I'll put a bunch of time into a character and be like "yeah this is my main I love it". Then a few hours later I see someone else do something cool on another class and I jump ship to level that class. It's pretty annoying but I do it to myself I guess.
---
Yaaas downloading now.
---
I've healed lots of dungeons on LH and I could tell right away how easy these dungeons in beta are. I know LH is overtuned supposedly, so I'm not saying Classic values should be like that, but I'm just concerned with how easy it's going to be if this is what we can expect from higher level instances as well.
---
I trust Blizzard to fix things that are obviously bugs.  I don't really think that qualifies as "picking and choosing" content.
---
And while I understand and even agree with the idea that LFG has definitely harmed the social side of the game and is a bad thing.  I also feel that in some ways this is regressing from better to unequivocally worse systems.  
---
For instance, the Runescape-like "tap" mechanic, which WoW adopted for Legion? (maybe before, I wouldn't know), where multiple people can tap a mob as long as you are the same faction, regardless of group status, is 1000% better than the classic system.  The only purpose of the classic tapping system is to slow down questing and the only thing it contributes to the game is to enable griefers to harass other players.  
---
In fact, as a classic player, I'm a little flabbergasted by some of vehemence in advocating for the crippled, sad version of WoW that is 1.12.  Most of the systems that people seem to be clamoring for had only a singular purpose, namely to force players to waste time.  Whether it's the unrewarding loot system which could necessitate hundreds of dungeon runs to get specific pieces, or not getting a proper mount until level 40, or forcing us to run all the way to the dungeons if we couldn't find a warlock to group with, none of these things make the game more sociable or harder.  
---
Running BRD for your 150th time isn't going to be any more challenging, in fact, it'll be boring.  Spending 15 minutes hopping on various griffons and boats in order to reach a remote point in Desolace isn't gonna present you with many new friend making opportunities.  I just don't get it.
---
Yep, just confirmed ***ONLY*** Stress test invite for myself. I can't access the Beta realm, only the offline Stress test realm.
---
Hunter pets were normalized in 1.9.
---
Explosive trap was fixed in 1.6
---
Freezing trap duration was normalized in 1.7. I think fixing the glitch you're talking about.
---
Aimedshot was fixed pre 1.12.
---
Raptorstrike is not on the gcd.
---
Haven't seen anybody test Tanaris or Hyjal yet.
---
"hidden"
---
Did that hole get patched at some point?
---
Fun vid though.
---
Is it possible that the beta was under tuned that way players could venture further in the beta and in turn beta test more than if it was not a beta? Seems common sense to me.
---
I don't doubt that, but I do doubt they ever take down Classic servers. Maybe give you an option to carry your character into TBC-Classic.
---
Thanks for this. I just checked and I'm also in.

Looking for Guild  
---
Intended region: NA
---
Intended server type: PvP / RP-PvP
---
Intended faction: Alliance (Holy Paladin) but open to Horde (Healing Priest)
---
Intended raid/play times: 7-12 PST
---
Any priority you may have in a guild: Raiding, PvP
---
A preferred form of contact: Reddit PM or Discord "Merlinix #1570"
---
This needs to happen. There was a time when GM’d or admins would troll the hell out of people..spawning elite world bosses and such in capitol cities. Just overall having fun. Because everyone was having fun. We need this attitude back.
---
I got in and the only server available is the stress test one. Better than naught!
---
Yeah there’s plenty of changes people can agree on. Green healing numbers, auto loot, movable unit frames, auto bag swapping, better nameplates, better tan targeting. These have been in the beta and no one is trying to get them changed. Classic is it’s own game. That’s still a world away from deliberately changing end game spec balance though.
---
I don't think most people think its more accurate, but there is definitely some curiosity out there to know what the differences are now that we have Blizzard's official Beta build. People have been on Pservers more than a decade using all types of resources to try to get as close as possible to original Vanilla, it's interesting for some to find out close they ended up being.
---
He's clearly joking
---
All mobs should be bound to their zone since 1.10.
---
I think staysafetv mentioned how his enslaved demon despawned when he lost control of it in another zone.
---
Definitely favoriting this to come back. I want to get to 60 on my first toon as quickly as possible so this will be huge.
---
Mages and Hunters aren't bad with a Warrior, they are simply handicapping themselves if they are speed leveling. They both level faster alone.
---
D00D grats
---
2006 account. Nothing as well
---
What faction? Either way paladin or shaman
---
Terrible quality repost
---
Does it show on the website for you?
---
Normalized pets no point in Broken Tooth.
---
The problem is not and never has been respec’ing?
---
Deadmines was never challenging, people were just really awful. 
---
It didn't even occur to 14 yo me to wand when I didn't have to heal and I had been playing games for as long as I could remember, can't imagine what people who hadn't played many other things were doing.
---
If shamans had dual wield then this might actually do some decent damage but unfortunately it’s just a meme
---
1.12 paladin is best healer. Best oh shit buttons. Most mana efficient, which is really what vanilla is all about. Being mana efficient and keeping it moving. Especially in the later raids which take a while over and fights relative to MC/BWL. And the 15 minute greater blessings really turn paladin from a dog support into a god in a 40 man. 
---
Warrior is far and away best DPS with rogue in second early
---
Mage is shit until ZG when they get some hit % gear added into the game (although on p servers they do progressive itemization, there may be spell hit available, melee gear will get better too tho so not 100% on how that shakes out)
---
Warlocks tend to be much rarer, so often you will get one who is borderline BiS for the patch and does a shit ton of damage cuz there are many mages and they have to save council clout/points for big things. Warlocks get just showered in gear. Again get stronger with ZG
---
The raids in P servers were not using the correct armor/resistance values because tehre was almost no data on that. So some fights should favor this or that class more than others. Higher armor on some bosses, more magic resistances on others.
---
So there may be more balance than there was on P servers dependign on how it all shakes out.
---
On a dummy tho, all what I said applies
---
&lt;TBD&gt; {Alliance PvP} {West Coast Semi-Hardcore} {LC}
---
**What are our goals?**
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We expect to clear every 40 man raid first. We intend to be the top guild and compete for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server.
---
We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and groups will be encouraged. We plan to start premades when the first BG's are released.
---
**Why should you join us?**
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released. Our guild will have competitive raid spots and as such this will foster a guild that will excel at all aspects of Classic. Raid times are favorable for all NA timezones. 
---
Raid times will be Saturday and Sunday from Noon PST - 4 pm PST.
---
**Want to know more?**
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information please message me (Kicharan) directly.
---
We are currently closed on Hunter and Druid applications for raiding, but are accepting all other classes.
---
VERY MUCH LOOKING FOR FURY!
---
We will accept any class for casual raiding; and PvP.
---
Any class that has a heal is great with a Warrior. 
---
Another warrior as well would be good. You can trade off agro and what not.
---
Honestly it's a kick in the face to get invited to the stress test.
---
Nice speech!
---
If you end up finding that post, I'd love to see it. Or if you recall enough for me to hunt it down myself.

---
Actually, its funny that you would mention moonkin.
---
I am actually going to play moonkin in Classic because i think there is a way to make it work. Not in any kind of "hardcore server first progression"-way but enough to make me good enough for a slightly more casual guild to bring.
---
Most of the damage is arcane, you are fine wearing cloth, you bring an extra innervate and combat ress and buff the group with spell crit.
---
Will be interesting to see how it works out :)
---
Enha shaman i dont really see working tho, the best argument for enha shamans that i've seen is that they can use Nightfall (an axe with a proc that increases shadow dmg taken on the monster). But so can prot-warriors that are not needed to tank the boss only trash.
---
And enha shaman dps will be a lot lower than all other melee classes without adding anything extra (except improved wf totem, improved str talent is used by resto as well).
---
&gt; The point I'm trying to make, is that unless the player/spec is putting up abysmal numbers that hinder the guild's progression - people don't need to be the spec police.
---
Of course! I hope i didnt make it sound like some specs should not be played. I just want people playing these specs to be aware of what situation they are in. People in hardcore guilds will be very negative towards your spec so you probably wont be able to join their guild unless you have a great personality and know people in the guild. And you probably wont be considered for most of the loot at first.
---
But its possible to still have fun with these specs. I am planning on levelling multiple characters to 60 and one that i look forward to a lot is a ret pvp paladin. Running around in 4/6 blue pvp gear and The Unstoppable Force will be fun as hell (but not amazingly good) :D
---
Thanks, I'm glad at least some people enjoyed it. Really nice to hear.
---
Are BGs confirmed to be xrealm?
---
I appreciate the private server people so much. 
---
But I think people got tired of a lot of people with the "classic is easy rag down in month 1 by most guilds!" shit based on an inaccurate private server experience
---
Does that mean everybody can play the stresstest?
---
"monster zero ultra" lol my sides
---
I'm pretty sure they're sending out random invites, the other night, a few people mentioned they got their invites around 7:00EST.
---
I linked a bunch of posts talking about this but apparently links from private server subreddits get auto deleted here, so do a Google search and you'll learn that it's a common occurrence.
---
Wow. I'm at the point where my negative stereotypes of stupid internet fads and the kids that use them are actually true.
---
A part of me hopes it'll be so bad that Blizzard will offer transfers to non-infested realms once the streamers make their nest.
---
True, but "The devilsaur mafia" exists on almost every server in some form and on PvE servers they cant call people to gank you :p
---
Probably about accurate then.  DM is only really hard when everyone is underleveled and you can barely even DPS VC because nobody can land hits due to level difference.  If everyone is at least 19 then it should be a cake walk which is good for an introductory dungeon.
---
you're in, emails are delayed about 6 hours.
---
Yes. Emails are a bit delayed, but if you can download the client, you're in the stress test. Source: I'm not in and can't download anything :(
---
Gotta love the wrath spam for 10 levels and bear smacks for the next 10 &gt;. &lt;

---
You are the hero this game needs brother.

We'll have a bunch of young minded people join too. Some people just learn the hard way. Better to say it. At least once.
---
This time it will be different so help me ...
---

LFG Dire Maul North buff ran out
---
Druid is pretty solid, good balance with the warrior; major drawback would be the pace. Druids move considerable faster post travel form but the gap is short before mounts. Just make sure you can get it at 40 and be ready to heal.
---
 If you don’t feel like healing rogue could also be a solid choice. Having a big boi to take aggro for you while you sit and backstab is nice, also moving around adds and dealing with pats is made easy
---
'clearly'?
---
You and me both, until August 27 my friend.
---
There was a person on Spinebreaker called Knivesshadow (a rogue obviously) who was on a  lot of people’s kill on sight lists. Not because he was a dick, but because he was insanely good. Legend has it he never turned down a fight, and almost never lost. Granted I was like 12 at the time, but this person was cool as shit in my head.
---
Didn't get in. Honestly is just so disheartening.
---
Let's also thank Everquest and Everquest 2's progression servers for showing that classic servers can be very lucrative for the business as a way to monetize your IP.  EQ TLPs account for as much as 50% of Daybreak's EQ revenue which would allow classic supporters inside Blizzard to estimate their potential ROI to the executives and get the project approved.
---
Private servers show demand sure but we can't forget the comments Blizzard once made about "people only play it because it's free".  Daybreak's breakout TLPs started in 2015-2016.  It's no coincidence classic wow was approved in 2017.
---
From those of us who played in original Beta, it was just about like this. No server announcement, just that the world was going away or something. You knew you were about to lose everything and start over again.
---
Man I miss 1up. Especially GFW Radio. Funniest podcast I ever got to listen to. Would listen to almost all the 1up podcasts when I played wow.
---
Nice; Nostalrius was my first time playing so I had no idea that players weren't supposed to be able to do that.
---
So, fuck that Nostalrius GM tbh.
---
Deleted the post until I can get the account verified. Sorry about that!
---
Yeah, once I have one of each of those, plus shadowfang, I'm just going to spend all my gold buying the ones that show up on the AH and resell when BGS are released.
---
Lucky you. I merged all my accounts over to 2 bnets and neither have my correct transaction.
---
Plenty of servers have fucked around with balance for dungeons and raids it's difficult to know exactly what the original was like. 
---
If they make it too weak the neckbeards will complain its too easy and vise versa. Everyday there are kids arguing about whats closer to retails version and whats not, nobody actually knows.

***Raiding*** \-- Suicide Kings / Loot Council  
---
Raid Group 1 will start Raiding *one month* after launch.  
---
Looking for Class Leaders as an active leadership role.  
---
Most raids in vanilla thankfully do not take a long time to clear if well prepared. Know your pre raid BiS prior to 60 we will help you, ask questions!
---
***Raid Group 1*** \--Suicide Kings / Loot Council  
---
*Tuesday/Wed 8:30 PM - 11:45 PM EST*
---
This will be our **progression** raid comp with only our Mains BiS + consumables. Players are required to maintain an attendance of 80% (Every 5 weeks you can miss 1 raid group. Min 2 hr notice)  
---
After every raid people will have the option to stay in raid groups for World PVP as a full raid, Premade PVP or World PvE. *Every 60mins Raid time will be a 5 min break.*
---
***Raid Group 2*** \--/ Loot Council  
---
*Time -TBD Thurs/Fri or Sat/Sun*\------(RAID GROUP 1 UNTIL PHASE 2/3)  
---
Between phases 2 and 3 there will be a second raid group formed. (Raid Group 2)  
---
We expect every player at some point in phases 2-3 to have an alt level 60. Group 2 runs will be used to help gear up Mains in group 1. Swap out players who go on vacation, play and practice with new members, enjoy meme specs, create more gold for the guild, farm more recipes and just fuck around. We can also sell loot to PuG's from group 2 when it is no longer needed and split the gold equally across guildies. This has a ripple effect as our group 1 and group 2 no longer need gear we could start 3rd alts or sell more loot and everyone will profit.

Same. Malfurion very frequently had raids at TM/SS, XR, Astranaar, and cities.
---
This has nothing to do with the accuracy of data from private servers.
---
Everyone always talks about 1 shadow priest being brought to raids and the reality is you can be that guy if you dedicate yourself. Vanilla Spriest isn't a choice, its a calling.
---
Hey I liked it, got yourself a subscriber!
---
Still more fun than world quests.
---
I agree with others that every class is strong in pvp in different situations but I’d say Mage because they are strong in all forms of PvP
---
Talks about being hardcore, bring up duels.
---
Easy to tell this guy is mad when he talks about using hamstring instead of slam. Even if what he said was right, he's only including 50% of the playerbase.

Turns out Rhahk'zor had indeed the correct values, but gj on forming a good, valid counter argument and not just resorting to insults.
---
BoEs won't unless you're crazily lucky :) And neither will Ironfoe.

---
Here are some quick and dirty tips:
---
Feign Death takes you out of combat and drops enemy target.  Use it to place traps that you can only do out of combat or interrupt a targeted spell cast on you.  Or freezing trap someone then just FD and sit and eat and drink next to them. 
---
Don't use dots of you plan on using freezing trap.  And make a pet stop attacking macro when you FD and freezing trap, otherwise the idiot pet will break them out almost instantly.
---
Crit is your main stat to focus on.  Critting aimed shots, multishot, and Raptor strike is your bread and butter. 
---
Learn to kite.  Put your pet away and just practice kiting mobs. Players behave just as stupidly and will chase you till they die.  Learn to strafe and shoot behind you.  Zoom the camera way out so you can see your targets while kiting using side step.
---
Research the melee macros.  It will make your life much easier.  Raptor strike + wing clip is amazing since it pretty much adds a slow to your Raptor strike in one swing instead of two.  Counter attack and Mongoose bite is no joke so macro them together so you just have to spam a button and not think about when to use them up close.
---

Serious question - how much time and dedication does this take? Was it only possible because you were young, or also possible if older?  
---
I've often thought of trying to learn (or, really, expand) my second language by playing WoW in it, but I've had doubts about whether it'd really work.

Not sure what you mean, do you mean PvP? Twinks? Leveling speed? WPvP? Ease?

Varies heavily depending on what metric you want to judge them by.
---
It's just blizzdrones swallowing everything blizz gives them.
---
Private community gets removed from their own game, turn into influencers instead, now suddenly shit on the very own thing they come from? Naturally the brain dead followers will adapt their opinion.
---
Privates made stuff harder that much is known, but if it's much easier then by lord the game will be something you can afk in.
---
huehuehuehue. Pepperjack, Toasted please.
---
"Significant discrepancies" - aka. one or two damage either way... If anything this shows that private servers were WAY more accurate than people gave them credit.
---
I doubt it would still follow the 3yr cycle that they do on retail.  I'm still on the fence about WotLK, but I deff want to see TBC someday.
---
Idk some said the same about the actual beta, so I would assume you still need an active sub even to get invited. So greedy.
---
Yikes dude

You need 10 signatures, no level requirement, but it costs 1g.

This is why I hope new content will not be made for like 8 years. I want to play all of the classes instead of having to choose 1, and not feel rushed by those who only play 1. "No content" just means the people don't have alts.

I just checked and my account has it now as well. Downloading for what is probably only the stress test.
---
&gt; To make a statement that all pservers don’t know what they’re talking about is BS.
---
They don't know what they're talking about though, they're making educated guesses on whats correct. I mean fuck one of the biggest servers running off one of the most developed core was found to be using TBC quest values YEARS into its development. 
---
Some servers are trying but they're not even close to a standard or benchmark for data.
---
We already lost this fight I'll upvote anyway. Version 1.12 and on are the BFA of AV.
---
You could. Might want to factcheck before calling people liars.
---
I ran it today with everything cranked up to the maximum settings on 1920x1200 and worked flawlessly. I'm so happy that it runs so smooth. Takes a lot of worries away when the game launches I don't have to resort to a temp windows install on my second SDD to feed my upcoming wow addiction.
---
Honestly, it's not as bad as people make it out to be.  Play what you want, but be prepared to switch it up if needed.
---
Stay strong, lots of time to get in before August
---
I remember once I was running some lowbies through Maraudon for NR gear and the Blade of Eternal Darkness dropped from Princess. Even though it was way low level I thought it was neat and the party just said I could have it as a thanks. Be nice, what goes around comes around.
---
I think he was just done with WoW. Who knows though, he might have booted up another Troll fire mage and hunted down some gold farmers for old time’s sake
---
&gt; The whole concept of gearing and raiding/PvPing in vanilla is also to look good.
---
But, you don't though. Replacing your full, shiny, good looking T2 set with one of those upgrades from AQ40 that look like something someone barfed on feels bad. 
---
When transmog was first introduced, you could only transmog items you physically owned on that character. The account-wide armory that saved all your earned appearances was introduced later, WoD, I believe. 
---
I don't think it would hurt anyone if I could make my new T2.5 shoulders look like the T2 shoulders i earned a month ago, but I know people around here are super sensitive about this shit.
---
Yes, clearly.
---
I like to think his Overwatch position is just a placeholder title until he reveals the next MMO he's working on. 
---
You have to remember Kaplan failed with Project Titan, even though Overwatch covered any of the financial losses. He doesn't seem the type of person to accept failure. I think for his next MMO he will go back to his roots in medieval fantasy realm.
---
What if they added mythic content so the end game isn't a total steam roll?
---
As much as people talk about camilla being hard the end game content really isn't. Its nothing compared to what they developed in expacs later on.
---
Man, a lot of these streamers seem to leaving a bad taste in the mouth of the Classic community.  I know that's a bit of a generalization, but I think this whole "it's beta, I can just do w/e" isn't translating too well to the audiences.
---
No kidding. I feel pretty stupid now being one of the poor saps that pissed away $15 to not even get invited to a stress test. Lesson learned! Guess I'll see you all in August.
---
I don't believe they are done. Just saying.
---
Hi, /u/saxon2626
---
&gt; I already tried giving you facts.
---
I must have missed that. Where was the part where you proved that Classic would not exist if not for Private?
---
&gt;Also it's funny regardless because you either a) play retail or b) didn't play. So.... shoulda played classic with us.
---
I played Vanilla WoW since Open Beta. I played a few expansions but did not pick up BfA and so do not currently play Retail. I got in the second wave of Classic Beta and am enjoying it.
---
You could have just said "I don't have any proof to back up OPs claim", or simply not said anything at all. All you've done so far is proven that you are a fool who assumes too much.
---
The opposite
---
It helps make a better game.
---
16 slots . 
---
Makes raids prioritize importance of buffs, and adds an extra layer of strategy to the overall raid... from a single unit perspective it seems lame... but seeing things from a single unit perspective is why modern WoW is failing... zzzz
---
Yeah it’s stress test only. But at least we get to participate! And I’m hoping that those of us that help stress test get invited to the actual beta
---
LMFAO I also got scammed all the fucking time in D2. The classic bait/switch scam where a shako got swapped with a chipped emerald cap after an "oops, my inventory was full" double-take.  
---
As well as "alt-f4 to duplicate items" and countless others. I got my fucking ass handed to me as a 12 year old on D2.
---
Be sure to hit that notification button so you know when my conjure water spell level is upgraded!
---
 a simple search of this reddit will reveal that it was a actual feature until wrath
---
I'm fine with adding more difficult versions of the raids
---
Bah, that was one reason I was thinking about playing a hunter for the special pets.
---
The website shows a second PTR account labeled WoW 5. I have 4 other accounts and a PTR WoW 1.
---
Totalbiscuit absolutely hated LFD and other changes brought at the end of WoTLK that started the dumbing down of the game, what are you talking about? Listen to Badge Plz (WoTLK badge episode) and you might change your mind
---
Couldn't just hearth out?
---
Bro Taurens hunch like a crazy
---
Yep good luck touching my mage fc with engineering while I'm peeling for him

Thanks.

That’s sweet dude, never heard of a GM flying saucer.

Damn, this game is going to be a joke easy. Boringly easy. I have honestly lost interest playing, which is probably a good thing, I get back 100's of hours of my life. Thanks for confirming though that this is how the game should &amp; will be.

Welp in the Bible it says call no man a fool so jokes on you. I'm sorry you didn't understand my perspective, you're right classic just resurfaced out of thin air.

Not to toot my own horn, but in the other front page thread about this I ended up doing a fairly in-depth analysis on the first boss in Deadmines (Rhahk'zor): https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/eobuhab/
---
The TL;DR of it is that in both the videos presented in that thread (Warrior from Asmongold's stream and Druid tank from Baroncstrike's stream), Rhahk'zor was dealing damage comparable to both archived Allakazam/Wowhead comments, private server databases and an old potato quality vanilla video. It was within 10% of what was expected, and given the margin of error involved in all the sources (we don't know the armor for comment&amp;potato video, and private server database is private server data) that IMO means that it's almost certainly correct.
---
The reason the damage appears low in the case of Rhahk'zor is quite simply that Asmongold has pretty good gear for his level, and druid tanks have very good armor at this level even without great gear.
---
I can't guarantee that there are no bugs with any of the other mobs, but in this particular case I'm pretty sure the damage is exactly what it should be. We also know that [the damage in Shadowfang Keep is correct](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq6mdt/difficulty_of_dungeons_on_the_classic_beta_vs/), and that the big tree guy in Wailing Caverns is dealing appropriate damage.
---
Because I'm a developer that likes pushing the envelope and breaking expectations. I think a lot of people are not prepared for how much addons are going to change Classic away from Vanilla just based on the sheer amount of resources available to learn LUA now and the skills/experience of current developers after 15 years.
---
I'd gladly accept that kick in the face. Better than looking at my launcher and only having access to my Legion account.
---
The old school /camp scam reminds me of the *You have been flagged for being AFK. Type /afk to clear this warning* scam from BGs.
---
Definitely. I remember I used to whisper people to have them send their T2 Gear just so I could see how my character would look in that gear. It gave me something to work towards.
---
The campfire was the breaking point.
---
If you look at raiding as a social experience where the fights are something to do in the background while you shoot the shit with 39 other people, then the combat pacing makes sense. In my experience, this is what raiding was about back then.
---
Yeah I think it is 0,0. The death grip glitch later on in WoW's life took you to the same spot. After 1niquity mentioned it I remember a server crash as well, so probably after a server crash it set the position of everyone that was in certain instances to 0,0 (or, probably more accurately, didn't know what position to set and defaulted to 0,0) leading to this.
---
It's very clear he's being ironic in this clip
---
I had very bad luck with GMs since MoP, I had maybe 2 major issues since MoP and both of them went unsolved, One of them I even had video proof of me doing a quest and not getting the reward, but the GM still just send automated responses and treated me poorly...
---
I got it too, only classic stress test tho no closed beta
---
The deadzone in reality is more severe than it is on private servers. No doubt the Hunter's Achille's heel. But good Hunters can deal with it and kick ass anyway... all classes have some kind of weakness.
---
WoW Radio was amazing in its prime. Athalas, Medros, TB, Slanik etc etc. It was great listening.
---
TB was entertaining but also challenging at the same time. Critical but always had a reason for it.
---
Wish there was a way to hear the whole of the WoW Radio era, especially with Classic inbound.
---
Drop rate for boe greens is generally high. Don't think I've seen it done right anywhere. 
---
I actually think a different core loot functionality is needed. Which is actually a lot of work.

Brother one of the biggest cores were using TBC quest values in vanilla....not to mention every server has different raid and dungeon values....You're just incorrect.
---
I did not receive an email, but I **do** have the Beta on my Launcher now.  Installing!
---
Those fucking videos show the damage as being off, you tosspot.
---
&gt;  no expansion would have been needed

Why would they not want to make another big pile of money on game boxes on top of those subs?

Also in! My account was created during Warlords of Draenor! I'm so happy! (I used to play on my Mom's account before then)

---
&gt;just did my first DM on the beta.
---
You made it to dire maul already? Damn.
---
How's the drop rate on those horns? I feel like this took me an entire day back in vanilla.
---
Man I need to remember that. When a customer reports a bug, I'll just tell them it's an oversight in future.
---
They think the same. All classes have drawbacks and cool things.
---
I don't find the combat boring or slow
---
I personally love the combat in vanilla. 
---
I cant stand the combat in retail wow, everything is so fast that I can barely tell what is going on, especially in pvp I cant tell what people are casting or doing, every ability has some crazy effect to it that makes it difficult to tell what is happening. 
---
I think vanilla is perfect the way it is.
---
Ninja looting was around long before streamers and will always be around. It’s a part of the game. 
---
Server reputation matters in classic and if someone is willing to risk getting a good group of people to advance with for an item, so be it.
---
I don‘t even have a drop-down box. Any idea why?
---
Pokemon Quest is what I think they are referring to.
---
I got in yesterday but got the email today, roughly 24 hours after :p
---
I got "Beta &amp; Stress Test", thought I got into the actual beta.
---
Downloaded, got in-game, only Stress Test (offline) server shows.
---
I guess my fear is never reaching 60 lol
---
This
---
I mean blizzard doesn't like merging servers so it does matter how high the playerbase starts and how much it declines. 10k on one server is a healthy population but divided over 10 servers it isn't.
---
Thanks, I appreciate the detailed response!
---
As far as i know they didn't have to sit as it was rogues auto attacking him with grey daggers for 3 hours.
---
Early 2005 Account, they don’t even want me in the stress test -.-
---
I'm in as well! Anyone know if stress test participants will get to continue playing the actual beta?

I just got in my self. Dropped everything I worked on and installed the client (actually watching it download lul), only to see the only realm was a stress test realm that was greyed out. After a google search I found this:  
---
 [https://devtrackers.gg/warcraft/p/a4ae083f-wow-classic-stress-test-1#112359?utm\_source=twitter&amp;utm\_medium=warcraftdevtracker](https://devtrackers.gg/warcraft/p/a4ae083f-wow-classic-stress-test-1#112359?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=warcraftdevtracker)   
---
So tomorrow they have planned a stress test from 4-6 pm. Hopefully the paricipants get a chance to play some beta as well.
---
Yeah. It's important to remember that pretty much all the streamers are essentially playing twinks.
---
&gt; and a lot of people have put time and effort into theorycrafting it
---
Theorycrafting something predicated on pserver inaccuracies such as everything scaling with +spell damage despite no proof of it ever being the case. :clap:
---
Wow, this might be the first time we’ve heard of non-Vanilla accounts getting in. Exciting!
---
I'm sorry that you felt the need to delete your account after such an inconsequential debate.
---
I also feel like if they do this right, your 100k number is way low. I am sure you are just being conservative but in reality they could get a ton of old AND new players to play Classic if they continue to do it right.
---
I actually didn't look through your profile you dense fuck. Stay on that hook tho.
---
non stop sub since 04 without getting in, so much for that theory
---
Same. But then I got in. It's gonna be the first season in a while I don't get conqueror, rather be playing beta than finish the journey lol.
---
Refreshed and depressed.
---
They're sending out more Beta codes. Keep your head up bud.
---
Word! I also posted on the wowservers subreddit a whole thread I found on resistance on EJ from pre-3.0 if you're at all interested. 
---
I'm pretty sure that they did and are supposed to stack (Gift of the Wild and Demon Armor). Since they're different types of buffs (self-buff-armor and buff-other), GotW should only conflict with scroll-type armor buffs, not class-specific self-buffs.
---
this subreddit is more cancerous than my times of playing league back in the day.
---
1.12 client sir. Pet system still better than live from an RPG perspective
---
That's totally not why he said it. He goes on to explain what he meant by it, and it was LITERALLY "there's no dungeon finder in classic, and some bugs that we fixed for the modern game are still there".
---
Thanks for the info! Much appreciated
---
This duel is basically going to come down to landing CS or not. You miss cs like this and you lose (although it's tough when warlock has a .4 second cast corruption).    
---
I think the warlock might even be better off with CoT and immolate/searing pain spam. You would probably win like that without ever casting a shadow spell. Then if they CS your fire school you can just spam fear/drain life.
---
wait you an do random things at work ? its your own work ? still have free time at work hours ? which server you live in real life ?
---
Amen to more non-templated Blizzard interaction.
---
I think your problem with warrior, or similar like paladin, is that you are rolling on the same gear.
---
Yes, but you can start it and players won't have time to react while you unstealth aiming at their heads.
---
The inflated health values of the private server mobs is where the difficulty spike comes in
---
Actually it is.  Look up “Contracts of Adhesion” sometime. You’ll find that while parts of a EULA might be enforceable, other parts most certainly are not, and it would depend on the terms in question, and overly restrictive or one-sided EULAs might well fall under the concept of Unconscionability, another term I suggest you look up.
---
Blizzard stating that you may no longer use the software you purchased even when you are not profiting from it and Blizzard no longer provides servers that will interface with it could well be considered an unconscionable contract, which would void the entire EULA.
---
Didn’t get in, so fucking stupid
---
There was no dropdown at all for me too, now i have it and installing Classic! YEAS! I have resubbed yesterday just to catch beta invite :D It was worth the euros :D
---
So if you abuse a mechanic its a bug?
---
Try Hards: When severe autism met Vanilla World of Warcraft - A love story.
---
Addons can no longer just cast spells for you. You can put /cast into a macro, but not into a /script () portion or straight LUA.  
---
And since macros don't allow for buff presence, you can't recreate decursive in a macro.
---
Ooo shiny
---
No you will not get to play either of those in a raid with competent people
---
Empty raid slots are viable....
---
It was not “the way the game was meant to be played.” PvE servers were called “Normal” in the server selector, implying pretty heavily that they were the default experience, with PvP being a separate rule set for those that wanted it, just like RP.
---
The overwhelming majority of it isn't.
---
I'm not worried about my main reaching 60 and getting substantial investment, but I do want to level almost every other class as an alt.  Currently planning on just rotating through them so that I'm always on rested XP.
---
&gt; He may have changed since then
---
Seeing as how he stopped streaming for a very long time, came back after he "fixed" himself, and is now acting the way he has been with McConnell, Soda, and others.. I'd say yes.
---
You know for a fact that it was our boy Omar!
---
Do you see the OP editing his post claiming he's already been proven wrong on things? You're actually retarded.
---
I just got invited for the stress test, active accnt since 2004 so who knows man
---
Maybe the mods can help clarify; why is my ss of a WC3 lossing screen taken down, because it's not related to Classic, while this stuff (which I love, by the way) is allowed to stay up?
---
Copy and paste for those unable to see it:
---
&gt;We tested this issue in our reference environment today.
---
&gt;First, we looked at a video from the WoW Classic Beta, where the player was tanking Rhahk’zor in Deadmines at level 20:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPSDVj0mNcY
---
&gt;If you look at his portrait while he’s getting hit, you can see him receiving 65-83 damage from Rhahk’zor. The average hit is ~75.
---
&gt;We then recreated it in the WoW Classic Beta-- a level 20 human warrior with similar gear, with Defensive Stance, and with Mark of the Wild. Here’s what that looked like:
---
https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/J62P4NV0PXHT1558473362677.png
---
&gt;We then did the same thing in our 1.12 reference environment. There, the test looked like this:
---
https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/WRMLQ1YPJZYJ1558473362591.png
---
&gt;Conclusion: the average damage taken is identical.
---
No word either way yet. I’m hoping so!
---
Great to see them with some screenies of the reference client. It's a small thing but easy to do and shows they take the concerns seriously.
---
Yeah I have no idea what these dudes are even debating. It's a known fact that iron will + hardiness = 45% stun resist after the 5% base.
---
People have said they got into to the beta as late as Cata, they have an older account bias but it’s not exclusive.
---
&gt; Come Wrath though, I think in Patch 3.2 or so, they nerfed dungeons,
---
I recall Wrath heroics being not so heroic from launch.
---
Why blink towards him lol
---
Didn’t realize it was you. My bad.
---
That's for private servers, they use tbc rep values. In classic it'll be using proper vanilla values which are substantially lower.
---
What a thoughtful contribution to the discussion
---
&gt; literally a meme from 2016
---
&gt; it's an old one
---
https://i.imgur.com/KA5GaEv_d.jpg
---
I did this so much in vanilla and BC. That I didn’t reach level cap literally until WoTLK!
---
Actually it's not free. It just links you to GOG to buy it.
---
BOOM GOT EM
---
wasn't this this changed in wrath?
---
I will update the OP to include the reverse.
---
Didn't get invited, I've just accepted I won't play this till launch now.
---
well its not that its slow, ff14 is really slow and have spells to use. but when a class have dots, they should be able to use it, why have 15 different spells when you only can use one
---
Blizzard has my full faith at this point. They are doing everything they can to ensure things are accurate, stable, and good for this game and community. 10/10 would subscribe again
---
As a dwarf I just FD in a bush or behind a rock.  Unless they are constantly tab targeting they never see it coming when I jump up into aimed shot.
---
&gt; 1g
---
fuck
---
Grats Na or Eu?
---
Anything with a Rez
---
That mechanic was bugged. Yes.
---
I don't really care about all that, I just really want this sub to realize "viable" and "optimal" don't mean the same thing.
---
You think the debuff limit is why classes play the way they do? The only class that is actually effected by it is shadow and warlock, shadow doesn't even have the Mana to use their debuffs even if they wanted to and warlocks rotation would only change slightly by reapplying dots every now and then, and that's depending on if it's even worth casting them over just a shadowbolt that would likely do more damage and be more Mana efficient anyway.
---
And that's why they go after and shut down private servers,  ya know because they can't
---
Private servers on suicide watch.
---
I love their promptness and thoroughness
---
Potassium
---
same actually, thats one reason I really want to this time around, its like I am getting a second chance to see what I missed endgame wise
---
You're confusing graphical fidelity with visual design &amp; style. BDO looks like every other Korean MMO in existence, I'd even argue it's less inspired than most of those, it has more of a 'bad Skyrim mod' aesthetic. It just has big textures, lots of polys and heavy post-processing to make it look visually striking
---
And people dislike the new character models because they look like rejected Kung-Fu Panda extras lmao
---
humpback, lunchpack, trump snack. yeyeye, I see what u mean
---
I vaguely remember hearing that the changes to shield slam in 1.12 basically make threat a non factor in raids. I could be way off on that.
---
There are some exceptions to this. Rogues might go Forsaken over Orc because wotf is better than their 5m trinket and opens up two trinket slots. Rogues tend to play solo making them less reliant on healer dispels than a warrior or other class might be.  
---
Priests, if they can be orcs in vanilla (I can't remember), probably prefer troll. Berserking is good and their troll priest ability (the lightning shield one) can proc blackout stuns akin to molten armor mage impacts, which is actually nanners on a spriest.
---
Can you show me what in that sheet scales with spell power when it isn't supposed to? The only things that assume SP scaling are Shadow Oil, Dragonbreath Chili, both of which are pretty reliable. We're about to test shadow oil on the beta soon, so we'll know for sure shortly. Unfortunately with the current level cap Dragonbreath Chili can't be tested, but we'll be on it as soon as we can.
---
Don’t expect anything different. People will be people just like back then. Most people never ninjas anything but most people also either had it done or saw it done to someone they knew. Streamers are just doing what everyone wanted to do at one point or another because it just doesn’t matter and makes for funny content.
---
People forget it’s a game. It’s about enjoyment, and that’s what these people are doing. Enjoying the game even in its idiotic glory.
---
Anyone ninja looting in live classic is going to realize very quickly that they really could have done without that piece of gear when they can’t find anyone to group with them or trade with them.
---
Dammit
---
You know that the difficulty scales up when you level up?
---
An entry dungeon like deadmines was never meant to be super hard.
---
Just saw a post on the blizz forums stating that stress test users will not be guaranteed into the regular beta.
---
For PvP, warriors are stronger, and rogues have their updated talent trees.
---
Paladins are quite strong in this patch while shaman windfury is nerfed to the ground as historically this was right before shamans got their class update in TBC ptepratch, making 1.12 one of the worst times to be a shaman.
---
So people who played Private Servers moaned that damage was wrong on Classic..?
---
Colour me surprised.
---
Pleased Blizzard cleared it up swiftly.
---
You can be super casual and still complete MC/BWL imo. Not at first but once ZG/AQ20 is out, it will be fairly simple. 
---
If you could only ever complete BWL, then I recommend going Hunter. Full Tier 2 and Zin'Rok(ZG).
---
TODD FUCKING HOWARD RUINING CLASSIC AS WELL
---
I got one too! Are these for the stress test or real game?
---
I had a notebook of shitheads I kept.  If a name rang a bell I would  check it.  If they were in it, I kicked them, no questions asked, no explanation given.   Don't be a dick, don't get on the list, and we all run the dungeon like decent humans!
---
Like what? Besides the stuff on their known issues thread I really haven't seen that many bugs on streams. Like, maybe twice over what's in the known issues list. I don't see why they wouldn't be able to fix that by launch.
---
Thanks for the reply. What about Hunters? and will certain specs still be dogshit for PvE like Ret, Balance, Shadow etc
---
My understanding from reading posts here, was the **bosses** were fine, but it was the other elites within the dungeon were were off? Anyone able to chime in?
---
im almost certain EU wave hasn't hit yet
---
Got a mail for Diablo 3 17 season...
---
The trash elites are too weak, you should not be able to tank that many elites. Can you check them? The ones in Deadmines. Please
---
wow such a devotion from the developers.
---
I love you guys and I´m hyped for freaking Classic &lt;3
---
No, Legion beat it out of me; I only leveled 4 chars.
---
&gt; We got badges in late TBC. Tiers of badges came later.
---
Badges were in all of TBC.
---
Same here tbh
---
I wouldn't be opposed to it if it was done extremely carefully and tested first, but i'm in the minority here on REEEEddit. 
---
I wanted classic servers because I love the Vanilla design *philosophy*, not because Vanilla itself was flawless. It had many flaws. My ideal scenario is launch at 1.12 and eventually go the OSRS route with new content and adjustments...vanilla Grim Batol, the underwater dungeon off the coast of Azshara, Hyjal etc.
---
Yea! I am amazed! I legit was losing hope after seeing so so so many 2006 and older accounts showing up. My Gmail didn't even exist before like 2010 so I can 100% confirm that my account is absolutely not even a tiny bit that old. My Transaction History doesn't seem to go back to purchasing my account though, so this is all I have to go off of. I should note I was in the BFA Beta, and I have reported a ton of bugs on that and on live.
---
I should also note, though I SERIOUSLY doubt it matters, I do have a toon dating back to 2007 that was transfered off of my mom's account onto my own about a month and a half ago. Just have to mention that JUST IN CASE it matters
---
What about elite mobs that arent bosses tho? Wasnt that the bigger issue at hand? Apparently they were doing half as much damage as they possibly did?
---
To the top
---
&gt; Something I definitely wasnt use to see on private servers
---
Uh, I did that all the time on private servers, no problems at all really as long as you didn't chain pull more than those 4-5 elites.
---
I just downloaded beta myself.. but i can see only 'Classic Stress Test' Realm and it is Offline. BooHooo
---
&gt; They are not cherrypicking. They are excluding changes that should have been in the BC prepatch. Completely different than AV.
---
It's called rationalizing.
---
&gt; and rogues have their updated talent trees.
---
Did that fix something or buff them?
---
I speak 3 languages, my brother 5. We learned most on our own. Here's our perspective:
---
The only way to truly learn a language is by complete, relentless and absolute necessity.
---
You want to learn french? Go live in France. In a year you'll be fluent.
---
I know about more than one korean language learner who spent 3-4 years studying 1 or2 hours a day, go to Korea for a 3 month course and they hit their cap by the end of week 6. It's ridiculous.
---
Wow helped me learn English, because I absolutely adored the game and I NEEDED to speak English to do dungeons and raids and pvp. It was necessary for my life at that point.
---
PS: Even so, I didn't learn it with only wow, I just acquired a good base. I then spent 1 more year watching movies and tv shows and reading English all day. That's when I became actually fluent.
---
Hope this helps! What language are you trying to learn anyway? The approach is largely the same, but if you're trying to learn a germanic language it's going to be so much easier. I don't want to discourage you at all.
---
but it also strip away the uniquness of every class and spec as everyone is using the same thing, only the visual is different (spamming shadowbolt is no difference from spamming frost bolt). vanilla was also so extremely unbalanced so it was always the same 16 debuffs every single time, i personally dont see any strategy in that. some things make sense, for example only one curse, or only one sting, but it doesnt make any sense that a class sucks because they cant us their spells that are ment to be used
---
Hmmm who woulda thought pservers are wrong
---
There are surveys and actual server data online that would disagree with your second paragraph. Even stuff posted on this sub. Also my own anecdotal experience from vanilla and private servers seems to be at odds with what you’re saying.
---
I’d be grateful for more details about mage utility.
---
Feel like I have addressed the other stuff you said. Just going in circles at this point mate.

Yup i've always been an altaholic and right now idk what i want to play at launch. just praying i get into the beta so i can make my decision before launch.

I got in! Sucks that it's not the beta though, but I'm going to hope that getting into the stress test puts me on some kind of special prio list for beta...
---
I'm subbed on an account that was made in 2011 if anyone is wondering, my old account is still connected and that was made in 2007 though, no clue if blizz takes that into account since it's not subbed.
---
&gt; It very well may have been done with arenas in mind, but it was also solving a massive issue with vanilla at the time.
---
Well the mount system may very well have been done with BC in mind, but it also enabled collectors to buy multiple mounts at a cheaper rate since the price was transferred to the skill instead of the mount.

Don't cherry-pick and rationalize.

Out of interest, have you only looked at Rhal'zhor or was he the only example given in your post and you looked at more mobs and bosses?
---
He has stated that he plans on using the old zones for videos and content.
---
who the hell said that I needed info from him?!? lol
---
he's spreading lies and misinformation to his viewers to the point that the lead dev for classic wow literally had to tell him to STFU
---
also, if I'm so off base with this thread here...then why is he deleting his twitch clips?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggyClearButterDatSheffy
---
- the clip where he says that Brian Birmingham told him he was wrong about Seal of Command not having a delay in vanilla has now been deleted
---
That is not what I want do not speak for me.
---
Aw man that's definitely not the norm, at least from my experience anyway. Sorry that happened
---
means they were stress test invites only then .. rip
---
i see them as separate things.  private server devs have done unbelievable amounts of work over the years and i salute them for it, and im glad we get a second shot at an official recreation with a couple of nice little additions
---
i'm very happy with how classic is looking so far and i just thought i'd throw my positive opinion into the mix haha
---
Its called logic
---
Usually happened on the PTRs, once was standing next to lady onyxia then Magmadar spawns.
---
I am!
---
Can you check non boss elites as well?
---
Was this full beta or a stress test invite? :)
---
Nah we want classic. Would we mind harder dungeons/raids? Of course not but just because of that doesn't mean we don't want classic.
---
i am stressed BLIZZ RELEASE THE GAME
---
Priests Druids shamans Paladins
---
LOL Projection is strong with you.
---
I know. 
---
I'm asking why people like the pre 1.12 mount system because I can't understand it.
---
Loool and to think I got downvoted for saying its not wrong and people just dont remember vanilla well.
---
Wasn't the question in regards to "normal" elite mobs rather than bosses?
---
Came here for this observation. This speaks to the legitimacy of the photo date.
---
I do agree that every group should bring a paladin into strat if they can, not neccesarily because of AoE tanking, but rather for AoE. That AoE excorcism thingy + Consecration + strat holy water + a grenade will more or less singlehandedly kill an entire pack of mobs, and they can bubble out of the overthreat afterwards so they don't keel over and die.
---
One of the few real moments of glory for spellpower ret in fact, it feels really fucking good to pull off.
---
But strat is pretty much the only 5man dungeon with pulls that are large enough they can't be tanked with sunder armor, or even better a dudu with swipe. They pretty much have to focus the elites and let the dps's soak, only making sure to keep stuff off of the healer.
---
Also, a warrior with engineering probably has as good threat as consecrate, or at least close enough that the additional benefit makes up for it.
---
Finally, mentioning Tclap and tanking in the same sentence triggers me very much, pls no.
---
Why haven't I thought of these!
---
I would deff keep FFF on if your intent is to actually secure kills. It's an extremely important tool and shifting in and out of caster form not only leaves you very vulnerable, it is extremely mana intensive.
---
Yes, people were generally agreeing that boss damage looked/felt correct.
---
Well that sucks
---
Fuck Robert!
---
Shaman is great fun, but the shaman will be a bit annoyed at how slow the warrior moves until it's mount time. Totem buffs, ranged damage, healing. All the goodies.
---
This is a good list, thanks
---
Non-streamers were invited in the first wave too -_-
---
Oh boy there goes my hope of anything in Pve besides AQ40 and Naxx not being faceroll easy...
---
Yes, it's an oversight. Because, an oversight in computing terms is also a bug. In fact all genuine bugs are also an oversight. Unless you're suggesting programmers deliberately put bugs into their code. Hint: We don't.
---
I am wondering if we get to a BC classic if it will be another fresh server or one we can transfer a classic char to.  I've played hunter throughout every version of the game and do not really want to raid as hunter in classic but would die to raid as surv hunter in BC again.  Wish I had more options that feel good to play in classic.
---
They won't ban for small scale talking to the other faction, like you say that is super hard to enforce. However larger scale mafias are obvious, and actually hurt things. Those are the kind of thing they would ban for. 
---
You colluding with one opposite faction guy over a quest is hard to see, much less get in trouble for. 20 people on each faction sitting in ungoro never killing each other but ruthlessly killing anyone else who touches a devilsaur or gets too close to a spawn is easy to see. Will be reported as it's impossible to keep quiet and will likely end in bans if they don't stop.
---
I hope you understand that in his story he was likely playing with people who didn't speak his language, not just playing the game in English.
---
OwO whats this?  A voice speaks to you fwom a puff of smoke!  Hail, travewer!  Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
Another day, another disappointment.
---
Ok good to know. Thanks. I’ll start refreshing my inbox every 10 seconds instead of check my client constantly. Haha
---
Awesome thankyou
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Dude from the little joke they pulled earlier with the server reset to these quick clarifications I agree. They are proving themselves time and time again, it is great. I cannot wait to finally play, god damn.
---
/signed
---
Yeh this is what I'm wondering too. I would assume it would be easy for them to just do some checks on a random assortment of elites from the game and test the damage.
---
Something that originated in pservers, /join world is a player-created chat channel for everyone.
---
I imagine that it's more that the players in the beta have a much better idea of how to gear.  Therefore, their gear is quite a bit better than your average player that's just passing through wearing whatever they can find.
---
Remember, information back then was pretty sparse, and due to how complicated modern wow has gotten over the years, the average player is much, much more skilled than in the past.
---
Enhancement shaman will be my second main, theyre really fun.
---
Naxx was not made easier in any meaningful way by 1.12 talents though and it will be cleared day 1.
---
They are comparing it to their 1.12 reference client, which is 100% correct because it's the original version of the game.
---
Each major private server has hundreds if not thousands of discussions regarding mob damage, cooldowns, behavior, armor etc that are far more indepth than anything i have seen on this subreddit so far.
---
And "guesses" Yeah, to an extent. You do the math on 3-4 different known sources of damage, kick being a good example, and you can get a pretty good estimate.
---
Usually unless your in a Semi-hardcore to hardcore progressive raiding guild, you can play any spec or class and have fun with it. There’s still tonnes of class identity. I do see where your coming from though, it’s not perfect! But I can almost guarantee you that you will love classic if you play it.
---
Boy I sure love running Dire Maul, the dungeon with only one version that I'd definitely advertise in chat as "DM"
---
The only faction you will get to exalted with purely through leveling up is your starting faction.
---
Yeah so I have a stress test install, but when I load up the game the only server option to join is the offline stress test server.
---
yea having actual pics and side by side comparisons is much better at giving us full confidence in blizzard
---
Also: applying, implying
---
You had me until these two points. 
---
&gt;Your offspec is not a priority to take the item from him. 
---
&gt;
---
As a hybrid player who likes playing a hybrid spec I don't have an off spec. My druid can be tank or dps or heals with a simple gear change and I'll do which ever is needed to get the group going asap. 
---
As such I need 3 sets of gear and will be running each dungeon at least 3 times as often as you already. I'm not going to pass on a good set of cloth healing shoulders just because I'm currently tanking because the group couldn't find a tank because all the warriors are dpsing because of your stupid ms &gt; os rule forcing them to so that they can roll on dps gear they need to level.
---
So the many multiple things theyve gotten correct.... guess we just overlook them so we can be rude.
---
I would really like to see Blizzard do this with the wolves in shadowfang keep.  Asmonfold has a run of that recorded - https://youtu.be/rQI3mMqUgGw around the 27:00 mark.  That's one part where the incoming damage is very different than I remember.  As others have pointed out it's dungeon trash mobs that are being remembered differently and this is a good one to look at because so many remember those wolves hitting like brick shithouses
---
seems to be stress, just got one also
---
Great advice, thanks
---
I'm a 2006 account and got in.
---
The 1.12 client is an copy of vanilla they are running internally as a comparison
---
Thanks for putting in the work man. When you get back, you should just put it as an edit to your original post so others only have to read the first comment.
---
Literally nothing should be able to be automated with macros. It was the right move the kill it even if it's not Vanilla.
---
&gt; the people stop doing it because it's not necessary
---
I still feel like that only applies to DF, or maybe just very casual players who want to play solo.
---
I remember this happening at one point during vanilla too, everyone was freaking out xD
---
Very accurate point of view imo
---
&gt;Yeah man, basing Spelladin on Corrupted Ashbringer having a 100% coefficient on its proc with no proof that it ever has is completely correct math

*"Corrupted Ashbringer isn't even that good for the spec my guy. We use Manual Crowd Pummeler for boss fights, which is confirmed to be working exactly the same in the beta currently as it did on private servers."*

*"Is* ***1117 dps*** *with no world buffs somehow not viable? The uptime of the rotation is* ***5 minutes straight****, and can be increased to* ***2.5 hours*** *by downranking Consecration for a* ***loss of 17 dps****."*
---
TLDR - git gud bro
---
&gt; They need a full minute to kill a player by just hitting it.
---
An overgeared warrior, yeah. Haven't checked exact values, but pretty certain normal dungeon elites don't hit much harder than that on private servers either.
---
&gt;otherwise very common knowledge for most warriors who have ever been at 60.

Most of this should be obvious by the time you try Berserker Stance for the first time.

Bonus attacks are good.

Crits are good.

Attack power is good.

It seems to be only for the Stress Test

I think both of his options are solid and have been brought up before. However what I havent heard addressed as much is if character copies are allowed to a TBC expansion server, should there be a grace period for players to catch up from lvl 1? Blizzard should hold off for 3-5weeksish to allow new players coming only for TBC, or those that would like to re roll their class for TBC to level to about lvl60 so they dont get set super far behind from the horde of character copies. This would also alleviate the pressure people would feel to play their Vanilla character even if its not the one they would like to play in TBC but they dont want to be left behind.
---
Looking for group of people to play with / guild to join. Primarily interested in PVE progression. I will be most probably playing a priest looking to heal at end game. 
---
Not looking to no life to end game, just want to enjoy exploring the world again :) 
---
Servers: EU
---
Location: United Kingdom
---
Focus: PVE (raiding / dungeons)
---
looking like it may only be the stress test not sure if i will be able to make on the normal testing realms after the stress test is over.
---
Yea man, people are on suicide watch because the game ends up being much easier than emulation.
---
Hmm you may be right about that, but it's still the same ability being abused.
---
A lot of encouraging conduct from them to be sure, but i would ask that we please don't go that far. They are a company with a lot of faults (You think you do, but you don't, dont you guys have phones etc), and we need to be vigilant to make sure they hear the message loud and clear: that we want an authentic recreation and that we will tolerate no micro transactions or mechanics that aren't in line with vanilla design philosophy (lfg etc).
---
The moment you start thinking of a corporate entity as your friend you are in for a nasty surprise down the line.
---
It's incredible they're current with what content creators are saying and what the community at large is talking about.  It's so reasonable, so logical.  What have they been doing since MOP?
---
I was a hunter main during vanilla, TBC and wrath. Been playing on private servers ever since. I quit the retail client forever the day they announced hunters were getting the focus rework. I remember it vividly, I noped the fuck out so hard. 
---
I was mostly BM for all of TBC, but by the time my guild made it to SWP I was allowed to respec and be the guild's one survival hunter. Definitely a lot of fun.
---
This was posted not long back. You just karma whoring or?
---
I mean, any class can equip their Dungeon 1, those items got no "Warlock" mark on it.
---
And the way Vanilla itemization works is that you get more and more secondary stats like hit, crit, AP and so on with each tier upgrade, there's no raw stats boost. 
---
That leads us to the conclusion that you simply can't get spd AND the stats at the same time, you have to choose one.
---
Same here, almost exactly. However when I log in I only see a Stress Test realm available that is offline. Maybe I just got into tomorrow's stress test and not the beta?
---
The drop down menu states "beta &amp; stress test" though, however I can't seem to log into the beta servers. Are you having this same issue?
---
\+1
---
no they arent
---
It was either in this sub or on a Google search. I can put them on imgur or something if you want, when I get home
---
Yeah I just got it too but the server is down it says, do we know when the beta ends? feels like im being baited
---
So i calculated, spent 2k euros on this game since 2006 and no invite, 80 days /played in BFA alone...
---
The devilsaur mafia can still just kill you at any point. I’m curious to see how Blizzard will deal with them when they start popping up on classic (which they definitely will)
---
my account was created day 1 of vanilla launch and i'm on a friends and family list, no beta invite.  feels bad
---
Robert has the stick. Blizzard loves sticks.
---
What do you think people called Deadmines in the three months between launch and the release of Dire Maul?
---
Initiating the fight (entering the room and getting in position specifically) is where a single player can wipe the raid. But positioning is key to enduring the fight, if people are out of position it can kill one/two people. If you lose one/two people you can easily not have the DPS/heals to finish the fight.
---
I remember tank healing on Patchwerk and each of us Priests had our very own Druid assigned to innervate us.
---
You won't
---
More races is not the problem with BFA, and wouldn't be for a "Classic+" option. You'll still have the same number of people on a server. The only difference will be a few pixels and the racials.
---
Oh wow that actually looks really well made. Nice work!

Easily the most deserved gold I've ever seen. Whoever gilded it must've agreed with me :p

(this is a clear joke for you retards)

There is probably add-ons to bypass that. If its something client-side and not server-side, this is definitely one of the things that is going to be worked around and no one can do nothing to stop it, because it isnt 'cheating', just a really cheap unfair advantage. 
---
Granted, i plan to play shaman so it works in my favor, but any pro lock will macro their pets to attack totem first, and if not, there will be an add-on that literally only purpose is to command pet to attack totem of a specific kind on contact.
---
Pre-beta, people were saying private servers had things wrong and content was too easy on them. Now we're finding out private servers actually had things tuned too difficult. The irony is pretty amusing.

I was in high school for vanilla and had all the time in the world to play. I played wow like it was my job and was super serious about raiding (all but cthun and a few naxx bosses down before I took a break). 
---
Now I dont have any kids but I got a job and have shit to do. I'll get home around 5 530 and have dinner do some other stuff and before I know it it's like 8 or 9. Sure I can play wow for 3 hours a day but weekends are going to be rough too with house work and errands.
---
I will play and will go all in like I did but I know I wont be as crazy as I use to be. I remember farming the whipper root tubers for hours for Lotheb and in general. Shit was wild and I loved it. Cant wait to get back into the shit.
---
Still nothing.....
---
That doesnt make sense, they would have the same gear within the same dungeon run. The argument is towards the elites in the instance that arent bosses.
---
wait what, is the stress test starting in 1 hour??
---
Yes, hopefully people stop reporting possible bugs from the Beta! These toxic private server elitists need to be put in their place *snickers*
---
I get your point, but will young people (viewers) make the difference between now (beta) and classic ? « Oh, I saw streamers doing it for fun I’ll do it as well my party mate will be p*ssed ».  As a grown man I think I’ll try to avoid this situation (as much as I can) by playing with friends (mainly)but honestly I would be sad if it happens to me. 
---
But you’re right, beta and live servers are totally different.
---
just got invited.. installing now. EU account december 2006.. think its just stress test tho :(
---
I would recommend going with a DPS, possibly a Mage. Maybe a Priest if she's into healing.
---
I would stay away from Hunters.
---
Hunter has a bad reputation in groups, particularly due to tab targeting and accidentally pulling trash, breaking CC, or forgetting to dismiss pets when jumping and having the pet aggro half the instance.
---
Yep stress test only.
---
I have tried to explain the 36 hour straight rush when I got on to catch up. I have told tales of mining dark iron for weeks just for some fire resist. Dedicated raid times even! She just wants to make sure I still take her to find rocks and to fish.
---
Around the time I got Shivering Felspine from sunwell trash runs I gemmed pure AGI for surv and switched.  Idk why but I loved the utility I brought to the raid with expose weakness and being 100% mana efficient, the 50%+ crit rate may have had something to do with it too.
---
She's a only a keeper if she joins you. :)

They did hit max. Cartman instructed Kenny in the beginning to give them Arcane Intellect. By the end, he instructed Kenny to give them Arcane Brilliance.

IIRC, AB was not obtainable until lv58 (if not 60), so close enough.

Everyone waits patiently for it to come back up.

Server finally comes back up, and as everyone logs in, the Skyrim intro sequence begins.

NA or EU?

Blizz said participating in Stress doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test.. BUT..  i will be in the whole day, testing, stressing like a good soldier would :D

Oh please.

People have been asking for Vanilla servers on the official forums since forever. Not denying that private servers had something to do with it, but this is self congratulatory crap.
---
As someone who grinded for a chopper in WOTLK and then never used it because of the damn engine noise...
---
probably
---
I find it oddly amusing that they test this in front of AQ of all places. Are they accounting for the sand variable?/s
---
Well regardless of how the goalposts get moved, its good to know they are checking these things.
---
It appears in the realm list
---
Hate much? Wasn't the Rahkzor case in particular based on comments from 2006ish, and not related to pserver at all?
---
Even if it was pserver people testing it and thinking it feels off, be glad they are testing the stuff and reporting it to blizzard? Or you don't want pserver players to do any of that?
---
Finally the Pserver blowhards can shut the fuck up
---
I’ve been being bored at work the wrong way all this time
---
Honestly no, there's not great info on YouTube, but there's good minmax guides here, and some other classic forums.
---
And people were complaining that Private Servers were way too easy.
---
If it makes you feel better, my account is a 3-days-after-launch-sub, though with spotty sub history. Straight subscription through the end of WotLK, played half of Cataclysm and Pandaria, very little Legion, bought BfA but never played, and all I got was a stress test invite.

double crit for 700+ damage. Savage.
---
Hi, /u/orangesoda687
---
Except the bosses were never the problem, it was trash elites and just regular elites in the world. I hope they didn't test just one single boss on this issue.

PVE in vanilla was already pretty easy. The only thing that made it "difficult" was not having the gear and organizing a 40 man. The latter will be much easier since most people know what they're doing, and the former will be easier since there's so much more data on min/maxing that gearing up out will be easier. I feel like this was expected.
---
&gt;  idk what the hate boner this sub has for private server players
---
They want to feel superior to someone. That's it.
---
Speak for yourself. I automate half of all my spells on hunter with macros. Examples:
---
1. Viper sting if \[target=mana user\], Serpent sting if \[target=non mana user\]
---
2. Feign death, pet stop attack, cast frost trap
---
3. concussion shot/wing clip on same key click AND i also macro pet to focus on target if i click this
---
So yes, i am better than you
---
:(( hopefully NA gets a wave at the usual 6PM PST
---
If I had gold. Rofllll
---
yeah... today, listening to Scott Hartsman on Countdown2classic and the passion that went into Everquest, a game that everyone loved in the company, and that everyone tried their best, worked overtime for their players and for the game, is truly amazing; and i can see it reflected in that small gesture on blizzard's side.
---
If it makes you feel better I’ve been working 6 day weeks for the past 2 months. But now our slow season hit so I get to sit around all day/take a bunch of 4/5 day weekends now. Thank god I’m salaried.
---
Sorry, you've lost me a bit. If you wouldn't mind explaining it to a moron. 
---
I don't have the game currently installed, so I can't check. My launcher shows beta + stress test, but I think everyone's does, regardless of whether they have both, or just the stress test? Am I wrong, and it's possible to tell from the launcher alone?
---
Well each race got two racials. Both dwarves and human got Desperate Prayer, which is the racial I assume you are referring to as being good 100% of the time. The other human racial was Feedback (spells cast against the priest drained faster mana and dealt 1:1 damage for each mana burned, 15sec duration), and wasn’t good all the time.
---
When min-maxing dwarf was definitely far superior. It wasn’t *required* or *game breaking*, but it was undoubtedly a large advantage in prevention of tank mistakes or allowing a dps/healer to ignore a fear and keep doing their thing.
---
Debunked, this is why we can't compare private servers directly to actual Vanilla.
---
yea hes so epic i love knowing that my character in OW likes stuff up its bum
---
You have to install it and login to check. Only way
---
Keep in mind the average gear a lot of these streamers are wearing is WAY better than what the average player back then was leveling with + no one back then knew how to itemize correctly.
---
They didn't change the goalposts. Before this was posted, the OP of the other thread said that bosses seemed to be fine, but not elite non-bosses.
---
He's not asking for all specs and classes to be made the same. He is asking for the objectively worst specs in the game to be made so that they are not quite so bad.
---
Two completely different things.
---
Can't banish beasts
---
Also don't need on every green/blue that drops because you are an enchanter.
---
Started playing mid 2006. Bought and played every expansion on launch, no exceptions. Been subbed on / off. Never been invited to any Blizzard beta of any sorts.
---
This test is only on a single boss on a single instance, they need to do the same for trash mobs now. And if they already done that, show us.
---
when most people ran deadmines it was early on in vanilla, before the class rebalances and mechanic reworks that occurred.  Mobs doing more damage in 1.12 would probably more 'authentic' in terms of experience
---
Sadistic Intent, Crimson Banditos, Promethean
---
It's internet slang at this point. These things come and go and you might find yourself guilty of some.  
---
Just think back to "owned", "pwn", "lol" (&lt;- yes this one used to be looked down upon too!) "rofl" "XD" "kek" "owo" and many others.
---
Back when twitch blew up and people started using Kappa I was the same like you and despised these people but eventually I just got used to it.  
---
I wouldn't completely condemn a person for using it, though. If the person is really just grossly overusing them I do get pissed myself though because it reminds me of the kind of people that (used to) add "XD" after every sentence.
---
Anyway, if it's used in moderation I don't care. It's true though that the majority of people who talk like that are usually young males. Still, I wouldn't just go on and deem everyone who uses them retarded.
---
You really do seem to hate these people, though. I think it's just a generation conflict, but I definitely understand where you're coming from. It can get pretty cancerous.
---
100% bud 🤨
---
Man I just ran deadmines tonight, and the first fight was actually pretty interesting by classic standards, or it would have been if you couldn't just ignore everything that was going on in favor of standing still and deeps. It's a bit of a shame.
---
BM Hunter is the best choice. Then you can switch to marks when youre better geared. Because at low levels, BM is so much better for world pvp. 
---
The other choices suck and youll be forced to heal in pve. Ret is a joke, and so is feral.
---
A small price to pay for salvation...
---
Oh yeah? Tons of shadow and disc priests brought to raids, you say?
---
Loads of enhancement and elemental shaman? 
---
laugh.
---
You're just wrong.
---
"I fucking hate those pserver guys with all their knowledge and time and enthusiasm put into a 15-year old game."
---
There's a pretty good video of an SFK run here: https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=188 It's from June 19th 2006, which is the launch day of patch 1.11 (Naxx), but could have been recorded before that which would put it in patch 1.10.
---
And a Reddit thread that compares it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq6mdt/difficulty_of_dungeons_on_the_classic_beta_vs/
---
As you can see in the video (and read in the thread), those wolves/worgens are hitting Asmongold for *more* damage than they are hitting the tauren warrior in the 2006 video.
---
Yeah some people are really naive when it comes to classic pve difficulty, even naxx is easy for ppl who clear retail heroic content hell even normal, you just need the grind to pass some gear checks...
---
People have been asking for Vanilla servers on the official forums since forever. Not denying that private servers had something to do with it, but classic would have happened eventually with or without Nost.
---
I agree 100% with everything you've said and they have made a lot of mistakes in the past. But everything we've seen so far from the Classic devs seems to imply great things. 
---
IMO its fine to be happy when things are going right, they've proven that they want to create the original World of Warcraft to the best of their ability, they've told us there are no plans for micro transactions aside from server transfers, I mean everything seems great at this point.
---
They know that if they fuck this up people will just head back to private servers and as you said this corporation wants that money so lets hope things keep going the way they seem to be right now.
---
So lets celebrate when things go right and keep our pitchforks holstered and ready nearby.
---
That was mainly Vanilla/TBC players. I noticed towards the end of Vanilla, people were REALLY pissed at not being able to get into Naxx raids on the WoW General forums. By that point, TBC was mostly complete so I assume that is why things changed in WotLK.
---
It's a beta server, so they can be wrong. That's why we bring it up. I'm glad to see that the issue in question has been resolved!
---
What I remember from the actual "vanilla" WoW our raid guild always had 1 Druid - battle rez "brez" was all we needed from it.
---
Otherwise it was shut up, stand back there, don't die, brez the main tank, you get all the druid purplez.
---
They weren't good for much else for quite some time.
---
Hell you stain that and cut out the unused wood on the sides and I’ll buy one from ya.
---
nope
---
Uh... I was 16, my mates that played were 16, my little brother was 10.  Most people in my guild were 16-20.
---
Youre delusional and trying too hard to gatekeep.
---
bad bot
---
PREPARE ASMONGOLD IS COMING !!!!
---
yeah how dare they, those people who made this all possible. shut the fuck up dipshit
---
Ass Man Bald
---
I think I got in..
---
https://i.imgur.com/Z713cJD.png
---
Did I get in to the beta or "just" the stress test?
---
No but that's clearly the intended circlejerk so just let it rip anyway
---
you are not a ret paladin, you are a paladin, you are not a feral druid - you are a druid. You are not a marksman hunter you are a .... you get it by now. This fixation with "specs" is a load of bullshit from retail
---
Yeah, the stress test time is from 4-6pm PST, but then you get to keep your access until sometime on Thursday.
---
Hunter since the other two were not used as dps classes
---
People who were gonna ninja stuff were gonna ninja it whether they saw a streamer do it or not. The systems are pretty easy to understand. Most of the streamers I've seen making light of it are making the joke in the context that this is beta, none of this really matters and that the humor comes from everyone understanding how scummy it is.
---
The thing that gets me about this is you clearly don't understand that if you have the nice looking gear...you are already wearing it.
---
Transmog has less of a purpose because gear is so rare in classic that by the time you actually have the tier set that's the gear you actually have as no guild would let you have both tier gear AND the other gear.
---
OG Crushridge mods where y'all at
---
I was just thinking the same
---
If we get into the stress, does that mean we get into the beta afterwards?
---
I got in to the stress test beta (I think its the stress test beta). Best of luck!
---
1. no one in 2019 thinks private servers are accurate 
---
2. see #1
---
3. a lot of these posts were in reference to videos from 2006
---
this is just you trying to feel better than someone because they played an otherwise unavailable game lol
---
The loot tables are a result of needing the addon and site configured to handle classic data--and for people that complete the instances to upload data. There's a few steps involved.
---
I'm not 100% sure on what the Naxxramas issue is yet, but if the descriptions refer to the Article tab or things like Four Horsemen dropping Tier 7, that is something manually written by staff which needs to be updated. Been prioritizing the content from earlier patches first though, like dungeons available at launch. If you have any specifics you can send them to feedback@wowhead.com
---
Ye lets just dismiss all criticism with the "private server lul" argument so if something is truly wrong (like the stoneskin totem) it will be missed... 
---
It is a fucking beta. We are suposed to raise these questions.
---
Fuck off...
---
imagine still playing world of warcraft with its current management in 2019. LOL
---
He probably meant that I didn't min-maxing to the fullest overal because I didn't have the best race for my class and Fear Ward while situational was indeed helpful.
---
That being said, when I created my character I didn't bother at all with min maxing, WoW was my 1st MMORPG, I just picked what it looked cool for me...guess I should have rerolled when I found out? Yeah no...I actually like Dwarves but I remember people hating the old Dwarf models, so playing something you hated just for a racial is to much!
---
I'm in NA and I got invited at this wave a little while ago, possibly an hour? I wasn't refreshing at the time, but I noticed it roughly 20 mins ago
---
People have rated private servers in the past by how "blizzlike" they were, but now that the actual original gamestudio itself tells them how it was, they are "in the wrong"? It's a bit ridiculous
---
Same. Anyone have a link?!
---
And you're basing this assumption on...... A few reddit posts?
---
&gt; can't wait to PWN some n00bs amirite
---
qft
---
Right there with ya!
---
It's not a big deal for BiS (or near), but you want to avoid a situation where warriors or hunters are rolling on nearly everything.
---
As I say whenever I see an alliance in-game “101 101 L t A A F”
---
I got it! Installing it right now, and it says "Beta &amp; Stress Test."
---
Unfortunately I work tomorrow and won't be able to do the stress test, but I keep hoping I accidentally got flagged for the real beta as well...
---
I can dream, damnit!
---
&gt; So really what players are asking for when they want balance is teh same kit.
---
That's not what they want, are you retarded?
---
Since when does any ret paladin want to be transformed into a fury warrior? Seriously. Zero fucking people want that. Zero. The number is zero. The boomkins aren't asking to be mages, the enhancement shaman aren't trying to be rogues.
---
Whoops important detail sorry, NA
---
On my internet speed, that's gonna be a real treat, only for the completely-certain possibility that it's just the stress test anyway.
---
But a nostalrius dev admitted to making mobs harder to simulate the initial experience to hit nostalgia harder than actual numbers since they had no way to literally make it for face value, you could only get so much out of old data mining and 240p videos
---
Here's the problem from my brother's perspective who was a die hard raider in Vanilla (I was too young)
---
People are making these claims based off their memories and private servers and the private servers are making their calculations based off YOUTUBE videos.
---
What people are failing to understand is, everyone sucked nuts in 2004-2005. Literally no one knew how to gear themselves even in raids. He gave me multiple examples of bad play that was "common" back then.
---
My analogy to you is, go play an old game you once thought was hard that you actually beat. Tell me how challenging it is now.
---
If you do, make it the opposite faction so you don't burn out and ruin the experience for yourself.
---
Same here, but seems like it only was a stress test invite :(
---
I do not know for certain about iron foe or hoj but, by this patch I do know for certain. You can not proc WF off of SS. So I can't imagine you could proc it off either but, I could be wrong.
---
DM is somewhat interesting when you start it at 16 in questing greens. Everything after that is just boring gear farm tbh.
---
We are talking about hybrids and shit specs. You mentioned priests and shamans. Obviously you're not talking about holy priests and resto shamans, because those are both irrelevant to the OP.
---
Do what you want and then deal with the consequences! Ah free will is such a beautiful thing:D,i personally support it.
---
I am a hunter main, sorry. Hard biased :) but you’re right for sure.
---
I got it too for stress realm better than nothing :)
---
Same here. One server listed right now. I'm super curious if they're only gonna have 10-15k people in there.
---
No one thinks private server values are 100% accurate mate, a lot of these comparisons are to videos from 2006 and official bestiary info, as well as questions about mob crushing blow mechanics which has always been understood.
---
This circlejerk is actually just sad at this point, this subreddit has gone through like 3 separate waves now of "PRIBBET SERBER BAD"
---
you'll be fine. basically all you need is Improved Healing Touch and Reflection to really heal.
---
we live in hope, just got my stress test invite. seems a little odd they have done it like this though, in the other betas they just upped the invite waves to the beta for stress tests but they were full invites
---
Soniis voice is so loud man
---
Sure, I don't mean to discount this specific example, but the goal posts will move on this topic and others.  There is already a post not far below the blue that questions their test due to them spawning Rhahk'Zor out in the open world and not after zoning into an instance.
---
I just like that they are taking the feedback and testing it out themselves, and even letting us see!
---
Loool Blizzard just announced with proof the numbers are right, top post on the sub bet you feel stupid now
---
Those are pretty bad examples lol.
---
You can fix Ele mana issues by reducing damage spells, not just a blanket Mana cost reduction. Same with balance druid.
---
Likewise with retri you can buff their damage and make it more active, like a buff to judgement, or shorter duration on seals, etc.
---
Could you elaborate a little on the second build please? Is it the balance/resto talent spread people recommend for when you are more geared?
---
&gt;She just wants to make sure I still take her to find rocks and to fish.
---
Sounds like she wants to play wow with you, mining and fishing at least.
---
Okay that's actually nasty lol
---
Was rag like a pug stomper or was he just significantly harder ?
---
Let's be fair, he used to say the boss was wrong too until evidence in the thread started suggesting that the boss was behaving correctly.
---
Yup. That's something everyone needs to keep in mind with classic. We are all better players now than we were back then. I bet a lot of players in vanilla didn't even know what gear they were meant to be wearing or understand stat priorities.
---
I can see a lot of potential with a surv/bm hunter spec providing move speed and pet damage. if you are going to duo with a warrior you are going to want for him to engage a mob, while pulling one or two more towards the both of you. The last thing you want to do is force the warrior to have to run around. It could also save you on ammo + free up additional bag space, leading to less downtime. 
---
Not something i've ever seen or heard about being done, but those are just my thoughts off the top of my head. 
---
Mage is no go. You are most likely going maintain aggro and your warrior is going to have to chase stuff, plus if you frost nova a pack of mobs, they are going to instantly target the warrior in range. You won't have to buy food though.
---
If you are running a speed guide, you will probably only add a day or two max to your 60 time, regardless of the duo. I wouldn't worry about it to much.
---
There's no video that shows damage was higher. Not a single one. There was a front-page post just a day or two ago that proved Asmon was taking the correct damage in SFK.
---
Pretty sure wow classic is going to have a heck of a lot more 30 y/o's than in the 2000s
---
MMOs just aren't what they used to be, so the playerbase will not be new blood (imo).
---
Asmon looks like a gopher in the thumbnail O.o
---
It's a tab targeting MMO dude
---
I know the pretty skins are confusing, but the they are all pretty much doing the same thing. 
---
Balance = symmetry 
---
You want a ret pala to replace a warrior? You need more symmetry between the two for them both to be near optimal
---
like everyone said its for the stress test and after that they boot you.
---
[There's a blue post about this already.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/elite-npc-damage-is-way-off-plausible-evidence/178518/81) They're doing the correct amount of damage, assuming Blizzard's official 1.12 reference environment is working right.
---
do you have a link as someone else said this but haven't seen any posts either way
---
It's looking really nice!
---
Take some advice from someone who's never played on a private server. 
---
You wouldn't have classic WoW without them, so pipe the fuck down.
---
No, I feel like leveling in retail is probably the least rewarding experience in the game. You get most of your abilities early on and if you have boe gear have nothing to look forward to in terms of gear. No one is out in the world and you can get to level 120 in a week or two depending on how much you play. The endgame is kinda fun, I like arenas and the occasional raid but leveling is kinda boring unless you have friends.
---
Lofty bit of characterizations based on a few reddit posts. 
---
Literally just seems like you're trying to put yourself on to some weird arbitrary high ground based on..... a few reddit posts.
---
Get a grip mate
---
I’m a 2018 NA player and got invited
---
I just got in within the last 15 minutes
---
Okay, how about this. I want to play as a DPS. Should I go hunter, pally, or Druid?
---
I legitimately thought he meant 1 hour 15 minutes left of downloading until I saw this comment. Stress test starts tomorrow sadly, to give us time to get it downloaded
---
This entire sub should be a study in why eyewitness testimony should not be admissible in court.
---
i'm still pretty sure that people with an active sub to the game are the only ones getting invites.
---
It's good that they're shutting private server nonsense down but it's a shame that they have to. Don't report bugs based on how things work on private servers, it steals precious developer resources.
---
On my server we had a GM be a raid boss outside SW before a realm restart, instance server had broken on our realms busiest raid night and people were raging so one of them just became a giant ass dragon and started melting people.
---
Only lasted 5 minutes but it was amazing.
---
&gt; Wf proccs can trigger hoj or ironfoe and other way around too
---
Wrong, all extra attacks are independent. They can all trigger at once off of a single primary attack, but they cannot trigger off each other.
---
hunter, at least you got tranq shot
---
I just got into streaming and was doing exactly that as an homage to Classic on the stream, leveling without heirlooms, cooking food, not using abilities I wouldn't normally have (on a Druid, I shouldn't have Cat Form at level 8, so I'm not using it).
---
You're right, it's pretty dull.
---
2007 NA no luck thus far
---
There is a post IN THAT THREAD that shows damage is correct.
---
Just got in at 3:13 NA ! 2005 acct ! :D
---
NA, also got the "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic" client, but can only see the stress test realm on the realm list.
---
Asmonbald of course
---
Get the most +healing so your HoTs take priority lol
---
Because you have windfury it's better to just use a hard hitting 2 hander. Ironfoe is a complete waste on a shaman.
---
yeah I was wondering how that was gonna work. bummer.
---
Good to hear post vanilla accounts get access :) See you in the Hogger raid.
---
Sorry to break this to you. But PvE before AQ40 and Naxx was always faceroll easy.

---
If you read on this post I think its being touched upon somewhere
---
Ah my bad I never played Hunter in vanilla, didn't realize this. Kinda neat they have a way to lower threat.
---
its partly the reason, ofcourse the balance problem of vanilla is also contributing to it.  but more or less every dot in the game is useless in raids. rogue have alot of  them but they cant use them. druid have some but they can use them. Ofcourse, druid is more or less usless outside resto but again thats a balance problem, which is also of the reasons why the idea of vanilla bother me so much. why have 3 specs of only 1 is viable. Personally i want balance fixed, it dont really change the fundamental game play of vanilla, it just ad more fun plain and simple
---
ofcourse most of them can be fun (except retro pala because fuck that). And the way i see it if i will be in a group of 5 irl, but them its not really wow im enjoining, its the social aspect of playing with friend
---
Everyone that plays on them, unless you ask someone who doesn't like them, in which case, you will probably be told that everyone who plays on private servers believes all of the number values are accurate and trusts the devs more than Blizzard.
---
Nice Straw Man dude.
---
Top quality content. Very nice.
---
Holy crap, there it is! Installing now, too!
---
2016 NA account got one
---
I leveled a character when Cata came out to see all the changes. It's streamlined, like the rest of modern WoW. You'll be blazing through quests and dungeons with no effort or need to read anything, or pay any real attention to it. It's pretty boring. 
---
I actually started a character the other day after turning my account back on in hopes of getting into the beta, stopped a few levels in. Level 1 characters with full Heirlooms and their level 1 mounts. 
---
Sad thing is, some of the new content is amazing, like the Lilian Voss story in Tristfal. But it's drowned out by all the mediocre everywhere else.
---
Holy shit this website is beautiful. Props to the designer.
---
Is it full Beta access or just stress test access?
---
Well, that settles it then. Thank you for actually showing screenshots from the reference client instead of just saying "This is working as intended" as you did for things like Polymorph on tapped targets and Aggro Radius.
---
Enjoy fwiend!!!!! Cannot wait to join you in 98 days!
---
Are you suppose to be able to summon people inside instances in Vanilla?
---
Elitism and meaningless superiority is the backbone of the reddit community.
---
I mean I get that people are new to vanilla but seriously, by now people should have at least done a litle bit of research on their own. The other day this guy on here was asking people to help him choose the best dps class: "Enhancement shaman or mage for dsping raids? Please help" lol
---
Again, you've probably seen like 5 people being dumb on reddit when the reality is that the entirety of my guild is just glad it's happening.
---
Again, you could still be referring to about 2% of a group but generalizing like that is the definition of asinine.
---
Nah, I got in
---
yeah...  I don't really like tanking, but I know I could do it competently.
---
Though then you'll just get DPS pulling "Why are you GOING SO SLOW?  JUST PULL THEM ALL!  GOGOGOGO!"
---
wait so you want every spec to be good at everything then? because spriests and shamans are amazing in pvp. how much do arms warriors get buffed? and what does fury get?
---
every class is good in raids, every spec doesnt need to be good at everything because thats how BFA happens. the game is balanced around every spec having something theyre good at, which they all have outside of maybe resto druids.
---
Would have been the absolute best if her response was...  
---
"Well that means we only need 38 more people then."
---
Calm down dude
---
Won't you be able to tell by what server you're able to select in the client? Pretty sure the stress test server will be named accordingly and you won't be able to use ClassicBeta-PvP/PvE
---
Some of this is true, lots of it is complete nonsense, and the pserver community still mostly sucks.
---
Downloading. Knowing my luck only stress test but,  better than nothing. Very thankful
---
If you get it pop up in the launcher now, but can’t access the Beta servers, then you only have stress test access.
---
Well remember wow is 15 years old and a lot of the people playing r new kids
---
I hate you, but I say that strictly out of jealousy
---
Do you think that applies to ALL upgrades, or just BiS / near BiS? 
---
You end up with a warrior/hunter/shaman rolling on a upgrade, which might be 1 out of 5 upgrades available. Meanwhile, for the clothie or rogue that item is the only upgrade available. 
---
MEANWHILE, when plate or mail drops, you don't even need to compete.
---
By the title, I thought this was going to be a commentary on some toxic shit that went down in a streamer v. streamer battle.
---
Then I read the post. You're absolutely right. If Nost had never been; if the interest had not been rekindled; if we'd thought we did but we didn't (we did); we would not be here.
---
I don't chime in very often here other than shitposting. I have zero lifetime BWL clears. I had 1 60 on Nost and 1 in retail vanilla. I have played since patch 1.3, though. I'm not MLG good at the game.
---
But I LOVE this fucking game. Stop with the drama and the gatekeeping; all of us. Let's just play the fucking game again. Together.
---
Best of luck Classic friend.
---
ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO TALKED SHIT TO ME ABOUT THIS. EAT SHIT AND DIE. Lmfao.
---
Literally keep trying to remind people private server data is wrong. VERY WRONG...and i keep getting hate for it.
---
I will continue to spread correct info to the masses no matter how many downvotes i get. Internet points mean less to me than retail vanilla.
---
this guy fucks
---
So it’s pointless asking
---
all invites right now appear to be just stress test
---
&gt;Literally just seems like you're trying to put yourself on to some weird arbitrary high ground based on..... a few reddit posts.

Literally seems like you're trying to put yourself on some weird arbitrary high ground based on.... a few reddit posts.

&gt; Also it's pretty ironic that you're whining about a supposed monolithic group of people whining of which I don't even see in this thread

Part of US vernacular. Not saying it's a massive group of people. I'm saying they are massive whiners. 
---
Get a grip bud.
---
lol not even a stress test  invite, blizz hates me.
---
IMO the only character with a fully fleshed out arc
---
That is why i made this post. There are tons of people showing screenshots out of excitement, which im afraid will only lead to disappointment.
---
&lt;3 Teamwork
---
Me too. My bitterness is different though. They banned me for botting in pvp. Which really upset me because I am not smart enough to get a bot working. They literally pulled me from a bg. I was talking to people in to tell me I was botting it and, I'm like I am talking to you bro. i was talking in the bg WTF!? 
---
Then after then banned me. The server got shut down two weeks later. That brought a smile to my face lol. I am grateful to Nost for getting us classic but, I will always hate them for the no appeals ridiculous ban
---
Nah. if you really can't wait install a private server and level a character on the opposite faction and a different class to avoid burnout
---
Enhancement shamans have no place in raids.
---
The two are not mutually exclusive. Rationalization is the act of applying logic to an illogical decision after-the-fact in order to attempt to justify why it was, in fact, logical all along.  
---
You're rationalizing.
---
I think it's safe to say you're a massive whiner based on the lens in which you characterize others.
---
To be fair, if its not an official server. Nothing can be correct.
---
Its basically like... “but a retail server could have had a different stat item drop or a different roll of the dice in the RNG...”
---
 2008 NA account just got in :)
---
Yeah, Blizzard also confirmed NO increased Chance for Real Beta. But I still hope, they "Lie". I feel, I am sure, everyone who join Stress-Test will be converted to a "Real" Tester.
---
I mean realistically that's dumb as hell.
---
i think this is absolutely fucking pointless. where tf is man kirks wife
---
If I don’t get I’m gonna be a little salty.
---
This is just a 2 day stress test, fucking invite everyone.
---
I hope so!

Is probably going to be the spec you go into when you are still a relatively fresh lvl 60 and you are your tanks haven't gotten much gear yet.  With NS and swiftmend, you have two panic buttons in case things go south.

Are both good when you and the tanks have better gear.  These are both primarily raid healing specs, and you will be casting regrowth as your main spell.
---
Hope this helps!
---
An upgrade is an upgrade is an upgrade.
---
Just got off work and checked mine, nothing. I’m starting to get a bit pissed off about this.
---
nice, thx
---
I think Shamans should get the rework they were promised and left out of until BC. Other then that no, at least not for a while.
---
I’m curious, what makes it so good for druids?
---
can someone get the blues to start posting in clear English? i'm pretty sure you are right but this could easily be read as future closed beta as in after classic and the fist post in that thread made it sound like you get into the full beta after the stress test
---
I can not find the blue post this quick, but on official forums there is a blue post stating that there is no guarantee that stress test players may continue the real beta.. 
---
Although I think (and mostly hope) that you're right ;)
---
Another thread already unintentionally confirmed his damage as being correct, but it's good to see Blizzard engaging nonetheless.
---
I too was in a pile just like that at some point
---
thank you.
---
Realistically Blizz said from the start that they wanted players from a variety of backgrounds, skill, and commitment levels. This is exactly what they said they were going to do.
---
I can't deny most of that. I really do feel a special type of disdain towards these people. I've always sought out more mature and older guilds in any online game I played even when I was a teenager in the 90s, which only amplified my curmudgeonly ways.
---
They banned me for botting too, I got MCd while using eye of kilrog, and got insta banned. When I appealed it took them two weeks to respond oops. When I asked for a clarification I never got one lol
---
Closed beta is mainly for streamers and stress tests for players if get lucky.
---
The resentment for the pserver players isn't because of what you are saying. It's because there are a vocal minority on places like here being elitest dickheads to everyone. They feel entitled to being in the beta and are shitting on anyone who is, as well as acting like they are gods gift to the game because they nolifed a private server. I've played multiple private servers and I have no idea why people act like this.
---
blue post confirms it's right for sure
---
If im not mistaken, you can summon people who are in the instance as well, not outside. So if you're very far into a dungeon and someone dies and there is no one to rez, they have to walk through the entrance portal and then you can summon them to your location
---
Yeah, probably. You kinda just took what you could get back then, nobody really knew enough to be picky about it.
---
Remember, this is just the first stress test. As far as i know they planned like 4 or 5?
---
Classic not only got me watching Twitch, it got me to start streaming. I don't care if it gets big (nor do I expect to), it's just fun to vocalize some things while I'm playing. In my head there's ten million people watching even when I have an empty stream.
---
You want a raid boss? I'll SHOW YOU a raid boss!
---
Could be. But every response I see is something akin to another response I saw in one of these threads confirm pservers were wrong saying that the game is gonna be a joke and that they don't even want to play it because it's not as hard a pservers.
---
You also have the 5th highest post in this sub now titled:
---
" **Friendly reminder - this is happening because of private server players playing private servers.** "
---
Where the pserver players are making themselves out as some kind of martyrs that deserve unending praise from anyone who wants to play Classic because they are the reason it's actually happening. 
---
Also, lol at all you butthurt Psever players who are downvoting me because you and your crap servers were incorrect. Rofl.
---
&gt; First off I am in no way a fan of retail but atleast you can play whatever class you enjoy playing. 
---
This is because they are all so similar.  They don't even really feel different.  Every rotation feels like a similar version of another classes.
---
I'm not saying that a few small changes will result in that.  I'm just saying it's a slippery slope.
---
Was just digging through my old screenshots and decided to share one, I have no interest in points.
---
&gt;uptime is still at 30+ days
---
He turned the screen off and on again.
---
Congrats!
---
Did you get in?
---
not neccesarily. According to classicdb, blackrock worgs lvl 54-55 deals 144-167 dmg, while plains creeper l32-33 deals 70-82, so basically you're looking at double the damage for a normal level mob.
---
That's not really that bad tbh, not if you have a healer. The real problem is resists and hit chance, which is shot to hell in the skull scenario.
---
Making the real sacrifices

Oh look. You were wrong. You would have lost all that money. Bummer.

Thanks!

My girlfriend speaks Spanish, almost exclusively. We've been together for about 1.5 years. I went from almost not speaking Spanish whatsoever to being able to converse reasonably both in text and in voice.  
---
But my vocabulary is a bit on the shit side, and I'm not sure how to improve it. It's good enough to converse in, but outside of just going and making a billion flashcards or something I'm not sure how to take my Spanish to the next level.  
---
I've wondered if I could just throw WoW on in Spanish and force myself to read everything in the language, and if that might help my vocabulary, or if I should be reading books or watching netflix in Spanish or what else.  
---
On the other extreme, Korean is a great example. I can read Korean with some effort but my vocabulary is nearly nonexistent and it's difficult to understand what speakers are saying. Even if I moved to Korea for 3 months, I can't imagine how I'd get anything done to begin learning. I legit am not sure where one would even start in such an environment.

🎵 **WHEN THE KING AND HIS MEN**
---
Keep your head up and make sure you have opted in for the beta (different button than warcraft)
---
It's incredibly clear what is meant by this, sure you can read it wrong if you want to intentionally make it mean something else, but when it's in context responding to that post it's obvious my dude.
---
&gt; "Your private server information is invalid."
---
This is true.
---
&gt; "You're not remembering correctly. You're deluded by private servers."
---
This is also true.
---
Private servers being popular doesn't somehow make the information from private servers any more valid. 
---
&gt; If private servers players did not actively play Vanilla private servers, Blizzard would not have gauged significant interest in Classic, and that is another fact.
---
Yes, that's a fact. Why shouldn't we dismiss people when they use private servers as a reference to how vanilla was in 2006? These things aren't related.
---
This post is literally just bickering and getting nothing done.
---

**”SO YOU WANT TO RAID HUH?”**
---
His days of playing MMOs were over long before his death.
---
Paladin is not a DPS class, it's a healer/buff class.
---
Druid is not a DPS class, it's a healer/buff/utility and sometimes off-tank.
---
Hunter has the lowest DPS of all the DPS classes. It's mainly brought to raids for it's utility in Tranq Shot.
---
No one actually knows that. In the past Bliz has let people continue, and most of the keys I’ve been seeing are Beta and Stress. I saw some people commenting that only received Stress.
---
Yeah, that was how it worked on Nost at least, being able to summon people who were in the same instance as you, but not people from the outside.
---
But on Asmon's stream I am pretty they summoned some guy from inside of SM.
---
What? Officiality has nothing to do with correctness...
---
regardless of what they said someone that's never played classic isn't going to be able to tell what is wrong with the server if anything.
---
ret pally feral druid wont get invited to raids. go hunter
---
does the stress test show up in your blizzard account via webpage
---
Yeah I was chuckling about that as well. Wondering why they would do it there.
---
Why would you care about incorrect data when you have the correct data?
---
yeah you're right
---
How many beasts do you know of in real life that has armor?
---
So wait is everyone getting the stress test in the end or is it still select people?
---
Man i've seen a couple of these and I so wish I still had all my screenshots. But that's several computers ago so who knows where it would have ended up D: So rad you still have yours!
---
The funniest thing about this is that there is now an official Blizzard blue post linking a video of Asmongold saying “now we deep dick this boss”.
---
You're totally right about that, but it might aswell be on purpose..
---
Maybe they also want new people (referring to people that never played Vanilla) play the beta to look from a different perspective.
---
Yeah this. I hate it.
---
For me, Beta is a chance to play some classes and races I know I won't be playing at launch, get a feel for some aspects of the game more than streams and news posts could ever do.
---
This, but also too RP.  
---
Sometimes I'm just like "Yeah my shit's broken" and they're like "HARK, ADVENTURER!" and I'm like "dog I ain't on an RP realm just fix my shit and call me bro."
---
We can only hope :D
---
How old is your wow acc?
---
I farmed it a lot as a rogue and it’s not too bad at all
---
What I don’t get is how all these private servers can spin up fairly easily but blizzard is having to mate classic to the new clients.  Why not just make an official version of those private servers?
---
A perspective that lets them test what? This Beta is to confirm numbers and remember quests that are from Classic not from post classic.
---
Human rogues also deal a fair bit more (5-10%) damage than NE rogues
---
Human warriors deal 7-10% more damage and miss less making them better threat tanks
---
Yep, just got one too
---
Well, either that or Stardew Valley, which coincidentally is also a pretty great game with co-op!
---
Well, it just called both, but if you only See Stress-Test Server. That means "Stress-Test" only.
---
This happening because blizzard is seeing the $$$$$$, no other reason.
---
Yes, because zero sugar (don't worry, I'm right there with you).
---
Theres people who pretend to know classic but all their knowledge obv from pservers. Idk why they're ashamed of not playing classic and pretend they did, who cares if you did or didn't but don't try to change things because you of your pretending.. and if you want this to be like the private servers.. then just play the private servers???
---
Mine's 2004 and I just got the stress invite.

"My character can't jump when targetting a certain mob"

"Stfu you didn't play Classic you can't know what's wrong"

**&lt;E X I L E&gt;** 
---
**Faction:** Alliance 
---
**Region:** EU - English Speaking 
---
**Server Type:** PVP 
---
**Guild Focus:** PVE  
---
**About Us:** E X I L E is a guild formed from a group of friends, most of which have played wow hardcore since Vanilla and are currently raiding in the top 100 on retail, we will aim to clear all bosses prior to the next phase of content. All of us are extremely active on Discord be it by playing WoW together or even other games. We have also met IRL multiple times over our years playing together which has created a strong connection and we hope to extend this community we have going forward into Classic WoW.  
---
**Raid Times:** As most of us wish to keep raiding on retail in our hardcore guilds we will raid different days from the norm to accommodate this. Friday/Tuesday CET - 20:00-00:00 (We may add a Saturday night during the first 1 or 2 weeks of progress if there is enough interest)  
---
**Loot Rules:** We will most likely use EPGP loot distribution with additional priority for important roles such as Main Tank etc.  
---
**Recruitment:** We are currently looking for any players who wish to experience all content that Vanilla WoW has to offer at a more relaxed pace to allow IRL time or time for other games. Socials are also welcome to join our community and have fun in dungeons, pvp and other games with us.  
---
**CURRENTLY RECRUITING**

**Warrior DPS - Medium**

  We do not care if you are a veteran at Classic wow or if this would be your first time, we simply ask that you are serious about playing in Classic WoW and our community.  
---
**What we expect from you:** 
---
**Communication.** You must must be able to communicate effectively in English in game and over voice com. You must therefore have a decent microphone/headset. We use Discord as our VOIP. 
---
**Dedication.** We don’t have any insane crazy requirements, we simply ask that you prepare the basics for your character including consumables and enchants 
---
**Attitude**. If you are a total asshole, then this probably isn’t the place for you, we aim to continue and extend our current atmosphere and friendship group. 
---
**Attendance.** Near 100% attendance should be mandatory for all raiders especially since we will only be raiding 2 days. 
---
**Connection**. We expect that you will have a reliable internet connection, we know this is vanilla but that doesn’t mean you should be playing on a dial up connection from 2004! :P  
---
**What you can expect from us:** 
---
A home and community which you are encouraged to be a part of both outside and inside of raids. 
---
A well formed community between players allowing for you to find something to do even on empty days of the week.

2008 NA account, just got in for only stress test so far it looks like.
---
Cross fingers, they convert us to real players.
---
I got an invite today, i opened the menu and I saw an extra selection and got super excited until I noticed it said Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic.  Feelsbadman.
---
Live your dreams and be a chad with big dick energy
---
It is a marketing move to get streamers in first, but i hardly believe it wont be ''plebs'' in Beta aswel in a later stadium.
---
Damn I'll check when I'm home but as a 2009 account rip.
---
Horde does fine with good players. Fear ward can carry less skilled tanks/players through content
---
If you bother (A LOT) to gather your own pug, then why not. Or gdkp.
---
Pretty much. I got pulled into a room turned into a ratt and the GM was like. "CONFESS TO BOTTING OR PERMA BAN!" 
---
I'm like "bro I am talking to you and if I am cognizant enough to confess I am clearly not a bot. Shit dude I don't have deep blue running on my jank ass computer!"
---
"CONFESS OR BE PERMA BANNED"
---
"Really man? Because I am talking to you. How do you think I am a bot. Shit if I was this good at making bots I would be rich man."
---
"CONFESS OR PERMA BAN"
---
"Son of a bitch bro are you a bot?! Because you sound like one"
---
"CONFESS OR BE PERMA BANNED!"
---
"no"
---
then I got perma banned and they said I was free to make a new account. I just sitting there thinking why the fuck would I do that when you just banned my rank 10 priest for no reason.
---
My conspiracy theory is that I played a priest and I get a hard on for dispel magic. It was 90% of what I did. I'm thinking I frustrated a corrupt alliance gm just a little too much lol.
---
If your data is always correct about classic you should work for blizz!
---
I realised you're using the redesign which doesn't support the flairs this sub was using before. If you use old.reddit.com/r/classicwow there'll be an option for flairs in the sidebar.
---
fantasizing about night elves in 2019 lmao
---
Beta invites: immortal
---
As said on the forum, we have more knowledge/information now, cause of that we gear better and play better. Also those first DGs are not that hard so dont go " see, vanilla not hard, u nostalgical potatos, hur dur".
---
Guild charters cost 10s, not 1g.
---
same i was so hyped for a second feelsbadman
---
Anyone who thought it was less has been confirmed as bad players
---
He still discussed some of the big news. You're crazy if you think he wouldn't have at least touched on Classic, even if just on his podcast.
---
I'm currently testing those in beta, but it's a bitch to find a reference for those since people didn't typically record the wholev sub 30 dungeon
---
It was just a theory, which probs lead to nothing. Like what do we know? We can just discuss and hope and enjoy the full game in 3 months :)

Hunter;

No one will expect much from her.  Huntard.

Downranked heal spam
---
Mage; 
---
1 spell spamming. 
---
Dont let her/him play any classes with lots of dots /poisons, she/he will be upset that she cant use them.  
---
Always pick ranged. They can concentrate on pressing there spells or moving. Dont make them do both. 
---
The three classes i mentioned i feel are easiest to play imho. 
---
As for people that suggest druid. They will want to play balance or feral which is not ideal for a noob. 
---
Give them the best class that can do well with sub optimal speccing and miss plays.
---
You're a private server shitter, that's why you brought it up. Now stop wasting their time.
---
You should write a bot to just post this exact comment to every thread where someone says "pservers"
---
The guild tabard looks just like the one Madseason on YouTube uses. I doubt it is but are you from the same vanilla guild?
---
This is beautiful. How do I print this on a canvas with high resolution?
---
Guys, I think I'm having an ORG ASMON
---
Yes, I would have talked about it. But he wouldn't play it.
---
when you realize you have nothing so you immediately run to character assassination
---
would you like to call them nazis too or do you have a preferred ist?
---
Appears you're all right its just for the stress test, oh well I cant complain at least I get to play a little :)
---
Emails are generally a day late.
---
That’s the only way I could contest the mafia back on Nostalrius on my rogue. No regrets!
---
&gt; Players are more used to the idea of crowd control, proper talent tree specs, and that we are on voice chat to call out issues faster lol.
---
1. We used CC back in vanilla. They AREN'T using CC on the bet, just pulling 8-mob packs.  
---
2. How much can talents sway shit when you're a level 15? We weren't all retards back in vanilla.  
---
3. These are often not groups in voice chat.
---
Bit of a tangent but I can't wait to see the raid boss health. If it turns out they're also inflated on private servers, then presumably we should expect encounters to be shorter in Classic, which means certain mana-starved specs become more viable.
---
I mean you could be like me and not even get to stress test lol.
---
This used to happen to me too when I glitched in between the Undercity elevators and D/C.  I'd log back in just like this.
---
"I'd rather their dev time be spent on blah blah blah"
---
I'd rather blizzard spend their dev time however they see fit, considering neither you nor I have any idea what their workflow or priorities are like. Armchair software engineers like you make me crazy.
---
It's a fucking beta test. Not every bug report is going to trace down to a legitimate issue. That's fine. Stop flaming other users for contributing to the beta process.
---
But it does. Otherwise its a knockoff regardless.
---
I'm so torn between lock and mage. I usually always level a mage first for the ease of teleporting. But I never play lock and you get a free mount.
---
Yeah but without the push from people keeping Vanilla alive in the private servers they never would have seen the $$$
---
That's lovely!! I'm excited for her to get to try out classic! It sounds like she has a similar playstyle to my dad
---
Not for pve
---
still hoping there is another wave or something lol, I got nothing here
---
At least if the witness happened 15 years ago, sure.
---
i appreciated his tendency to stay on roads, so he doesn't get killed by random aggro mobs on his way to 1 shotting C'thun
---
Hey man. I just hate seeing people using wrong info to justify changes to retail vanilla.
---
It would be litty fam :ok_hand: :dab: if we stress testers got preferential treatment for the closed beta.
---
This isn’t even a stance, knockoffs can be correct, it’s not mutually exclusive
---
Thanks that would be great
---
yea the plate is terribly optimized for pve until naxx. And even then really not that great
---
so mostly cloth till then, although there are some random pieces that are not cloth. most are not plate
---
&gt; In fact, a whole host of non-elite mobs seem to be have comparative numbers to elites in the same level range.
---
I distinctly remember having a conversation with a buddy of mine when I was ~16 years old about how elites seemed to deal the same damage as a nonelite but just had more HP.
---
I got one today. 
---
I wonder if i will have continued beta access after this.
---
I'm not real good at that lol
---
around how many people are invited to test? anyone have a clue
---
Also the only real issues i can remember was like hit chance. So you'll miss a lot.
---
Pssst, Kaivax just posted on the forums confirming the damage values are correct. I know you thought you could lie a bunch and convince Blizzard to tune this shit harder, but they're not as incompetent as you think they are.
---
We might get someone on the moon again before Blizzard announces a new game.
---
We used to do that stuff in vanilla. Just because the 9 year olds couldn't doesn't mean it wasn't possible. 
---
For example I used to like see how low I could solo dungeons. I definitely did DM at 30 and I think I got it at 27 as a rogue.  There's no way that's possible on a pserver as the mobs just hit way too hard. 
---
The game wasn't hard back then, it was just full of preteens who were bad so they remember it as hard.
---
i wish that was me
---
Aw!! Honestly the news of the vanilla launch has really brought my family together over the past days, it's just such a happy time!
---
eu or na?
---
Apparently another wave just went out... like a minute ago
---
Name one specific thing they've gotten right.
---
Is it the order in which warlock pets are being dismissed when summoning new ones?
---
Is it how crit works when sitting, in regards to abilities proccing from crits?
---
Is it the AI and how mobs aggro in, say, Deadmines?
---
Private servers are an "okay" emulation in regards to how it sorta feels like playing WoW. But they're basically not correct about anything at all. Everything is guesswork.
---
I love the feedback and engagement!!! Very good signs
---
I'm almost sure it's yes, no, no and no. Shadow Weaving is on the mob, if wand does X shadow damage, Shadow Weaving makes it 1.1X. Same with those magic-vulnerable mobs in BWL and Chrom - when there's a vulnerability, you can use a proper wand to utilize it.
---
Studies have been done on this and I agree with you. Here is a link to one of them: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925254/
---
Yeah I checked the little beta box, I fear I'm DQed due to my forum ban lol
---
That is something people certainly need to consider too. When these dungeons were ran the first few dozen times, the game was in a different state of balance. This, surely, would obfuscate one's memory if only slightly.
---
If getting in is a kick in the face what about not even getting invited ?
---
mostly eu it seems
---
I wore intellect cloth gear on my rogue at low level in the first go through vanilla because I thought it would be super smart to help level up my weapon skills.
---
I did it a little differently but this works if for sure want to be a boomkin. I had omen of clarity and no insect swarm
---
This is just categorically untrue. Dont really know how else to explain that but either way I am glad that Blizzard is looking into it.
---
You can read the stickied post yourself, pertly of examples
---
I'm looking at this screen right now too.  Did I miss the window of opportunity?  Will I be allowed into the Beta after the stress test is over?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/IgnorantWonderfulGoldfishPanicVis
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5rxj/can_someone_explain_this_discrepancy_in_mob/eo29ftv/ indicates that dungeon elite non-boss damage is accurate.

Screw this subreddit, I was going to be a rational adult, but now I find myself checking my launcher every 30 mins to see if I'm in.
---
I'll get over it, but its still disappointing.
---
Can you actually use your brain for once and try to read?
---
My original post did not state that Venruki is a SHIT PvPer, I merely pointed out that nothing about this was insane and that OP has no fucking clue about the game. Venruki might be a good player, but if you cannot accept that he barely hit anyone with his double CoCs then you should get your eyes checked. The play was mediocre. It was fun to watch, but it was definitely no showcase of INSANE skill.
---
Second, you have no idea about the pserver community and the dedication of the people there. These guys have perfected their game. I consider myself to be a "good" player and regularly dueled with personas like Greatwizard, Perp and Madscientist. If you think that Venruki, who hasnt played 1.12 on the level as the pserver crowd would actually stand a chance against these players, then you are delusional. Perhaps Venruki has a lot of potential, perhaps he doesn't. However what is certain is that right now he would not stand a chance.
---
Oehh, i don't have any knowledge about that kind of stuff. FeelsBadMan tho :(
---
Turtles have high HP and low damage. That's kind of their gimmick as mobs.
---
Lmao Asmongold actually helping  blizzard and the Community
---
I was here
---
You can still sap opposite faction and steal their skin. Much more fun and more fair. 
---
And besides, no mafia in classic thank god. It's gonna be some crazy pvp for devilsaurs.
---
This is the most classic thing I've seen so far in classic. Asking a GM for a joke at the end of a ticket is an experience I really enjoyed back then.
---
there's a lot of inaccuracies in that site. it's better than it was but don't take it as gospel
---
So, I may have been the bamboozler myself but this is my vanilla story.
---
Being the little fallus I was, with a shiny collector's edition, I of course got the great idea to lie about how I got the pets that came with it. More than once did some innocent soul approach me, seeing my mini diablo, zergling or panda and ask me: "How did you get that?".
---
To this I would almost always come up with some elaborate lie, as a 12 year old might do online. I remember one guy, a human mage, who asked me and I told him that he had to travel from Northshire to Darnassus to start with. He swallowed my lie whole. Through whispers I gave him instructions on how to get there, it took roughly an hour or more if I recall correctly. Once there I told him to talk to Tyrande and this would start a hidden quest you can't see in the questlog.
---
After that I stringed him along, making him run all over the world to locations where I knew of some noticable npc or item. I made him visit Orgrimmar and somehow get to the throne room, blow a kiss to Sylvanas in the depths of the Undercity. He ran all the way to Winterspring to do a /wave to an ice giant. To Un'goro to do the same to a Devilsaur. I spent the entire day stringing him along and for some reason he just never questioned anything but instead got excited with every new instruction. Eventually I got bored, put him on ignore and logged off.  This is just one example of a fair number of similar lies 12-year-old me came up with but by far the most time-wasting one.
---
I have similar memories, we used to run scholomance with a fury warrior dual weilding. Gear makes a big difference, from what im seeing most streamers are far better geared then a player of the same level would have been in 2005....
---
A lot of them see to esentially be twinks....and Im sure most vanilla players remeber how crazy a lvl 19 or 29 twink was back then.
---
Cause its kind of annoying tbh. If you want no changes play on a pserver, but I'd rather enjoy the game and not play on shit servers, input lag, overpowered class that everyone plays, etc.. I'd like to enjoy new fun content and experience how WoW would have turned out if they stuck to its roots and added content instead of constantly expanding the game
---
Hmmm sadly I'm at work but the site shows I have 2 PTR accounts. Wonder if that means I got in. Sadly I work til 10 PM so I'm going to miss the stress test anyway but still.
---
What does everyone’s blizzard launcher drop down say? Mine says “Beta &amp; Stress Test: WOW Classic”... the name implies it’s a beta invite and stress test participation. However, I think it’s just for stress test at the moment. I tried to log in and do not see anything aside from Stress Test Server.
---
I just got in on my NA account, however I've been playing from NZ for a couple months now... No idea if that changes anything.
---
NA for me
---
I am na and got invited
---
conc shot/wing clip probably works actually, it did the last time I cared to try it
---
my acc is from 2016 and i got in
---
I used to do sfk at that level with 3 people, tank warlock healer
---
The great thing about classic is that there is no rush.  We know ahead of time everything that is going to happen with it, up through a bunch of phases.  I'm just going to make a bunch of characters and wander them around doing whatever strikes my fancy.
---
I think you're only able to play during Stress Test and then your access is revoked..
---
What about warriors?
---
Yes, ignore the rest of my post that's actually responding to your points and comment on my little troll at the end. 
---
&gt; pretty sure you're being downvoted because you're acting like a dick, 
---
And I'm pretty sure it's just a few butthurt Pserver players that are out in force right now, mad that Classic isn't a pserver.
---
&gt; not contributing anything to the discussion 
---
And you are?
---
&gt; randomly putting thousands of people into one category based on the fact they happened to play on pservers. 
---
So? Seems like it's accurate so far.
---
It's just got gold!! Never gotten that on reddit before :D
---
Same here. Blizz baiting me so bad.
---
EU here
---
Okay, so maybe gear wasn't as big a factor, but at that level, if I recall, heals, mana, and aggro were the biggest issues, not the actual damage the tank takes. 
---
I feel like people are mis-remembering.  I don't recall the tanks ever getting one-shot (except maybe the last boss of WC, or BFD, those hit like absolute trucks).  The damage wasn't a lot, but it was steady, and CC was that much more important.  If a wipe happened, it wasn't really that the tank was taking HUGE DAMAGE, more like there were a few too many mobs, maybe a dps was taking aggro, and the healer just couldn't keep up, and ran oom with their low mana pool.
---
Yeah I twinked a rouge in every bracket, and I used to be able to farm SM GY at 39, being able to solo everything in there. I was a massive twink though.
---
Am I the only one who remembers that the game gets harder the higher level you get?  Deadmines is the first Alliance dungeon pretty much.  I have my doubts that Scholo and BRD are going to be this easy.
---
Play all three of them.
---
Stress test invites going out. Got mine a few minutes ago, NA.
---
I notice you have changed the subject. I was talking about (a) whether twinking is good for your PvP skills (I think it is not), and (b) whether you spoil the game for others by doing so. You seem to want to change the subject to whether you should be *allowed* to do it. But okay, we can talk about your new topic.
---
&gt; I never understood this argument. People doing battlegrounds at low level without twinking will spend what? A day tops doing it?
---
Per person, maybe. But there are a constant flow of them the twinker picks on. So this seems a lot like saying "I don't understand why it's stealing, I only steal $10 from each person". The fact that you aren't ruining any one person's game for long doesn't mean you aren't spending your whole game time ruining other people's fun.
---
&gt; Meanwhile the same people are whining and want to ruin the fun for those interested in twinking. 
---
I guess the implicit assumption is that not all fun is equal. If I enjoy shitting on your pillow, and you do not enjoy having your pillow shat on, that doesn't mean it's completely up in the air whether it is okay for me to have my fun.
---
&gt; I never made sense Blizzard would listen.
---
It makes a lot of sense to me. A twinker camping WSG with a 19 rogue is one person paying one subscription, who is systematically spoiling the PvP experience for *lots* of newcomers who might then unsubscribe. If 1.1 people decide to quit WoW because of one twinker, Blizzard loses money.
---
&gt;  This was never a fair game.
---
Nirvana fallacy, making the perfect the enemy of the good. There's virtually no such thing as truly fair PvP in a gear-based rock/paper/scissors game like vanilla WoW, that is true, but that doesn't mean that all fairness can be totally thrown out the window.
---
&gt;  If you want an advantage on someone by getting gear and consumes you should be allowed to do that.
---
To a degree, sure. But if you manage to break the game by bringing what is effectively a level 25ish toon into a 10-19 battleground you shouldn't be allowed to take it that far. In my opinion, anyway.
---
Think a new stress test wave went out.
---
What happens in t3?
---
Ooft
---
I'm just tuning in to this whole thing, but yeah, I've known that pserver damage data and droprate was screwy from the first times I played. 
---
I was a teenager when I played retail vanilla, but there's definitely things you remember. Especially certain world elites/trash that I remembered soloing back in vanilla (trying to get certain items) that 3 shot me on a pserver. 
---
It's really not terribly surprising. I doubt the differences will be major enough to significantly impact the overall game.
---
No it’s cus your acting like a big ol baby boi
---
does it show up anywhere in your blizzard account on the website
---
Just assume it means jailbaited
---
LET ME INNNN
---
After they test the trash mobs, people will start complaining about some other dungeon. When will the goalposts stop moving? After Blizzard has provided side-by-side screenshots of every single mob in the game?
---
&gt; always made sure hunters had a spot on raids
---
You need one hunter, maybe 2-3 if you want to play it safe. So not exactly a guaranteed spot in raids...
---
As a mage, which has the rep for one of the more boring pve rotations, I can say that I use every spell in my bag, just not all on the same fight. Literally every one is used in some situation. In retail I can't use any fire as a frost mage. I might use an 8 spell rotation, but it's just those 8 spells over and over from what I've played in BFA.
---
Lol I told my wife about classic and she was like No and walked away.
---
She was there when I played the first time.
---
There is only this Name. The Server list says, no Beta for us, just stress test. I asume if you level every class/faction to 5 we might get converted xD
---
Just saw this as well. Good on them for being transparent and discussing their testing with the community.
---
Just in the launcher I think.
---
I wonder if you'd have access if you changed your realmlist.wtf from the stress test servers to the beta servers. Someone should try it.
---
I actually spent a solid 3 hours dictating whether it should end with him killing C'thun, or if he gets pyroblasted by a level 60 human mage
---
inb4entitled
---
yep
---
It's only level 5 but I wanna go! Report all the bugs for us! And congrats!
---
I don't think its the stress test since I also got it, but my friend didn't
---
&gt;it isn't character assassination because I've DECLARED they use the N word! 
---
if you shake your head really fast can you feel how tiny your brain is?
---
I mean personally I like the combat better. Especially in PvP where u don't have a thousand abilities that are situational. I shouldn't have more skills than I have hotkeys, yet people think retail is somehow still pruned. Classic was more skill intensive than retail even with 1/10th of the amount of abilities. 
---
Retail is ability spam, classic is precise ability execution to the very last CD. Using CDs based on other classes CDs, etc.
---
To think I was mass down voted by private server babies because I said they were fear mongering without evidence, haha. I knew it was private server heroes who were spreading this BS because if you played back in 2005 you knew this was the norm.
---
This is why I want to play WoW again, discussed it with my friend about what we are rolling and why.  
---
Sure, Mage would be fun, Warrior would mean I can MT raids and have an easy time with instances... But really, I just want that T2 Pala gear and Ragnaros' Hammer. So, ret paladin it is!
---
So because a CM, which is a position with no more requirements or insights than literally CS, with literally no qualification or peculiar access claims it's correct, that must be right? Are you trolling, or are you genuinely this stupid?
---
How does pointing out that private servers aren't perfect translate into blind hate?
---
Same here, 2005 EU account and haven't unsubbed ever. Haven't got the stress test or regular beta invite.
---
Got a couple of these on my coffee table, now all I need is my beta invite.
---
&gt; Just think back to "owned", "pwn", "lol" (&lt;- yes this one used to be looked down upon too!) "rofl" "XD" "kek" "owo" and many others.
---
Almost all of these things are STILL looked down upon.  
---
If you try having any conversation with a non-retard and say "XD" they will almost undoubtedly just say "XD" back to you to make fun of you.   
---
Of the list you gave, only "lol" and "rofl" would pass most social circles.
---
&gt;You are characterizing yourselves with all this whinging.
---
Literally "I know you are but what am i?". I guess some pretty basic criticism towards your meaningless contribution to discourse is not welcome. I'll let you jerk yourself off into the ether next time. The distinction between criticism and quantum circlejerking is lost on you i suppose. 
---
&gt;What, 10-20 thousand? Hardly. Barely even a noticeable % of the wow pop at its lowest.
---
It's much more then 10-20k people, and even if it was, that's a sizeable group of people in the context of the conversation. Once again, I guess the distinction between players online and total active players is lost on you. At this point you're just being pedantic because you're looking to be defensive/double down. 
---
&gt;Ah, the intelligence insults. When you don't actually have anything to say. Still love how you were whinging about my high horse while riding your own. Good Stuff. Keep the downvotes coming. Pserver players so butthurt today.
---
I've made multiple criticisms towards your comment and you doubled down/missed the point so I called you an idiot, not really that far off considering your initial comment was nothing more then hurling insults in the first place.....
---
Also, just more "I know you are but what am i", really have to put in effort to keep up with the amount of high quality "things to say" going on here. 
---
Brain worms perhaps?
---
For quick references Thotbot is sweet but for pure nostalgia I’d like to have that old guide
---
most likely just for the stress test, sadly. same thing happened to me
---
Kinda both.
---
The game is 3 months away, I will save my time and play this game in summer in its full version, not may level 30. I still can't believe we got classic wow
---
Me not getting anything PepeHands
---
QQ nub, l2play
---
Yup.
---
I’m in the same boat brother. I wouldn’t sweat it too much, I know it sucks watching others enjoy it believe me, but this large wave is mostly stress. And we don’t know if any of those will be allowed to stay on for beta. We have 3 months till launch, and beta is expected to go through the duration. Hang in there pal.
---
the post everyone is jerking themselves off about has nothing to do with private servers, it's based on videos from original vanilla
---
Hmmm who woulda thought random reddit losers are wrong
---
Same, but only difference between you and I is my account was made in \~April of 07. Sometimes all you can do is wait patiently and hope.
---
Definitely a good change.
---
*stress test
---
But grats! Have fun in the Hogger Raid!
---
Oh that would be so nice! Don't know if the developer behind cartographer is still active but if the code is available maybe someone will do it
---
That's probably my plan too
---
So the admins of this very subreddit and Discord have banned cross-linking pserver Discords for their use of the N word, and that means I am baselessly claiming they use the N word?
---
Who *really* has the small brain here?
---
Got access to beta yesterday. Never received an email. Same goes for Legion beta and BfA beta. It just "appeared" in the launcher.
---
I used to twink at 49 as a prot warrior. Especially against any melee class it's very op, since you can keep them stunned with improved revenge and concussion blow and the damage isn't too bad either
---
HOGGED.com
---
Yeah I wonder how many went to people that want transmog, lfr, duel talent trees in vanilla
---
&gt; No it’s cus your acting like a big ol baby boi
---
Says the butthurt pserver playesr acting like big ol baby bois. One of the top posts right now is literally Pserver players whinging about not getting enough recognition for 'making Classic happen' and whinging about people telling them are wrong, when they are wrong.
---
Sorry, I was unclear. I was actually talking about the **Human** Racial, not the Human Priest Racial. Humans get +% Spirit. That's why I said it's good 100% of the time, while Fear Ward is only good with, well, Fears. 
---
Of course in PvP your mana regen isn't really the issue. I didn't really PvP tho.
---
Streamers only really made up about maybe 25% of the invites.  And that's only because so many people these days stream.  Really, only 10% or less are big named streamers.  There were actually quite a lot of popular private server players, who are very knowledgeable at the game.
---
What?!?! 'Money thrown at blizzard' isnt a criteria??!?!
---
I tested Onyxia by collecting data from Private Servers and Multiple Classic videos from 2004-2006. The damage was much higher on Private servers. Overall disappointing since we've always been smashing content on Pservers to begin with. But we just gotta accept the truth and stick with our ideology of no changes.
---
Yeah man, for sure, I ain't ashamed about what I like.  Give me that purple ass.

I don't give a shit if anyone is using the N word or not bozo, it isn't some get out of jail free card where you get to decide because you dislike someone or they offend you that they're magically incorrect about anything at all. Further, you've clearly been in those discords yourself so you honestly sound a bit guilty of "using the N word!"
---
It's still you, by the way, I'm a bit embarrassed you need to be told this.
---
Nah Spartan rules if they are defective in anyway we chuck them off a cliff.  /s
---
Yup, hope this turns into an actual beta invite at some point!

It will feel better if you and millions of players enter this great game again for the first time

Dude I don’t careeeee, but you attitude suckkkkks... I don’t care about your wow preferences but when your being an ass to people who just played a game I’ll call you out. It’s a beta, look it up if you don’t understand this process of finding and discovering bugs, blizz will know and they did. Case closed...
---
Woah bro you can't say private servers were wrong.
---
Unless you like torches and pitchforks
---
Didn’t the guy in the glasses go to Bungie later? I’ve feel like I’ve seen him in a Halo Reach ViDoc
---
Lol it's just a stupid joke man. I'm not trying to ridicule anybody, or trying to waste their time.
---
So deadly. asmon!
---
Unless they changed it I think you can have mods in that change the way you look if only for yourself. I dunno how to do it though. I do remember a druid video from back in the day. WHere to everyone else he looked like a normal cat but on his screen he had a way cooler lion model.
---
no
---
Nah, addons are just quality of life, haven't ruined anything.
---
Not at all.
---
None of them.
---
Eh....yes and no. I don't think they'll impact Classic too much because the mechanics are already not too complicated. As for the modern game, I feel like Blizzard had to start balancing boss mechanics around addons, thus making them compulsory.
---
Honestly the content will be easy either way. Mechanics only will not be a big challenge to most raiders in 2019.
---
The fun part of vanilla will not be some end game challenge raid simulator, it will be everything else.
---
explain what happened to windfury during this patch
---
WoW ruined WoW.
---
You might like the bloodsail faction
---
Not getting into the stress test is better, because it means you're being considered for the real beta. The stress testers are basically the extras that blizz decided would have never gotten in.
---
Why do people feel the need to post the year their account was created lol. It literally has no bearing whatsoever on if you get invited. Stop whining.
---
When pushing higher keys you do spend a while discussing what route you're going to take and what tactics to use with your specific group comp and personal preferences, and a big part of being good at m+ is being good at adapting on the fly when things don't go as planned. It's not like you just walk in there and rigidly execute a ore-made route.
---
There's a lot of time to socialize with the people in your group while you're killing things. You don't need to take a break to do that.
---
I really like addons. I don’t think they ruin the game unless you completely overhaul the UI or make the game lag from overuse.
---
If it's any consolation, this is basically what twinking will look like in terms of gearing up characters in goofy ways, and also what world pvp will look like in terms of fighting over dungeon entrances/resources. Vanilla twinking is pretty badass and fighting other twinks is a really unique meta in itself at every bracket. Definitely some balance issues (lol hunters and level 39 enh shammies)
---
You CS shadow school. What spell it is is irrelevant. It's pretty odd corruption isn't instant but you get some weird stuff at lvl 30. Burning through fire shield is very easy. It seems the only way a warlock would lose this matchup is getting shadowlocked which sets up two full shatter combos with no fears to interrupt and no fel dom for a second sac.
---
The tokens are shared between classes
---
Mark of the wild tho.
---
I think the numbers are correct, but it's more than just "we were bad back then."  
---
I think it's that we were overly cautious back then.
---
I have 20 active subscriptions spread across 10 battlenet accounts, but I still somehow managed to not get invited for the stresstest.
---
I hope those who got in will have fun and that Blizzard gets some useful data out of this!
---
You dont really play a spec in classic. Base your choice off the entire class
---
Hand of Rag and Thunderfury are not in the same bracket. I plan on manning a warrior for Classic and leading a raid. As a tank I only care about TF and as a DPS I care way more about Bonereavers edge. As it's a way better item then Hand of Rag. With how expensive hand of Rag is. Most warriors are not going to want to spend their savings on a vanity item. The war for hand of rag should be between Shamans only. Maybe paladins too but, I don't know shit about classic paladins other then they aren't people.
---
i didn't start playing wow until 2006, classic streams showing me exactly what i remember.  not sure why blizzard prioritizing 2004-2005 players for the beta when most of them remember a completely different game. 1.12 is not hard.  now who's ready for months of facerolling MC before we get any real raids?
---
People had more complicated UI's in 2006 than they do now lol. Most people I know only download essential addons like swing timer and lazypig and play with a default UI besides that. 
---
I can't think of many addons Blizzard has to step in and break besides gearscore/LFG tools.
---
Original Lightforge helm please.
---
No he is referring to tier levels of strength aka t1 the strongest t4 the weakest
---
Fucking noob
---
Probably Omar
---
Fair enough. I suppose it depends on what class you play, too. I'm not very good at typing in combat, so I usually do my talking between pulls.
---
I'll recommend hunter but then you'd be rolling against me for gear.
---
If you got the client today (like I did) then you are only in the stress test which is separate from the beta. Maybe we get lucky and get the beta afterwards?
---
Only addons I'll use are a threat meter, and pfQuest
---
Lmao no
---
addons have been in the game since vanilla so I honestly can't understand what your talking about
---
No, not every mob in the game. Only the elites inside dungeons. And even then, they don't need to test them all. But they sure as hell need to test more than 1.
---
Hunters who kite and viper sting non-stop.
---
If everyone was jumping off a cliff would you do it too
---
With the exception of the ilvl and gscore addons in wrath, absolutely not. And those ended up getting included into retail anyway, which is more blizz's fault.
---
There's plenty of things that had a huge impact on the game and drove it downhill, addons are not in that category.
---
FeelsFuckingBad
---
From my experience, as well as some of my friends, most people use the numbers at the top as well as rebinding keys such as Q, E, F, Z, C, etc to abilities. Mainly just the buttons around WASD, so it's easier to reach.
---
It isn't common knowledge because you're new. It isn't other people's burden to teach you.
---
Some will be higher some will be lower
---
That's the nature of bugs :P

You wouldn't be able to talk shit about private servers on this subreddit if it wasn't for private servers. They're the catalyst to all of this.
---
You are agreeing with me, but you don't have the reading comprehension to understand that.
---
Tabard design is 10g, subsequent tabard purchases are 1g/member
---
Are you a pserver player? I ask because I notice you whining and making personal attacks.
---
Its ok to do that, using pserver data as proof isnt.
---
Active since December 2006. Nothing. FML
---
brah-tism
---
You should have just gotten in on the first day without realizing it like I did. Way easier. :P
---
It's just you.

🤣🤪🤪🤪🤣
---
Belligerent AND stupid
---
Time for a divorce
---
Ya I agree. These guys are just getting silly with the terms.
---
Remember when I asked what the definition of irony was?
---
ruined.... no. Taken away much of the difficulty, yes.
---
Damn you, /u/UziFoo, now you've got me second guessing my choice of maining a warrior (which was also my vanilla main) and instead switching to hunter. 
---
My alt in vanilla was a hunter. I never got him to 60 until after TBC, but I had tons of fun doing 40-49 WSG/AB on him.
---
My keybinds are QERFZXC for each spell, then I add the shift key on them all to double my buttons. My mouse only has 2 side buttons so I use the front one for stealth/mount, and the back one for auto-run.
---
It gives you a huge attack speed buff. Because druids don't get weapon damage from weapons the actual level of the item doesn't matter.
---
Wait, did the invites already go out?... *cries*
---
What are you talking about? I used to get top 5 DPS in Naxxramas every week.
---
You'd be better off with NS over oomkin form in most situations in PvP. Unless you really just want to beat hunters in duels.
---
There is No realmlist.wtf xD it is old stuff.
---
Bad players with bad connections made it hard
---
&gt; Literally "I know you are but what am i?".
---
Says the guy that started off with "I know you are but what am I?" Do you even think, or just latch onto the first semi-clever thought that passes through your mind at random and go with that?
---
&gt; I guess some pretty basic criticism towards your meaningless contribution to discourse is not welcome.
---
I'm contributing more than you. All your doing is saying "Stop being so mean to pserver players! Waaahhh!"
---
&gt; It's much more then 10-20k people, and even if it was, that's a sizeable group of people in the context of the conversation.
---
It's really not. Nost had a pop cap of 10k right? Which was the highest of any pserver? And I'd be willing to bet that a lot of the people who have an account on any given pserver probably have one on another, or others, as well. 
---
100k people subscribed to this alone. 10-20k is nothing. 
---
&gt; Once again, I guess the distinction between players online and total active players is lost on you.
---
Rofl. Wow. First, you've never said anything about that distinction, second... just no. 
---
&gt; At this point you're just being pedantic because you're looking to be defensive/double down.
---
You mean exactly what you are doing?
---
&gt; I've made multiple criticisms towards your comment and you doubled down/missed the point so I called you an idiot, not really that far off considering your initial comment was nothing more then hurling insults in the first place.....
---
&gt; Not like these followups aren't helping you out much in that realm either.
---
Please, continue your whinging. It seems to be all you know.
---
&gt; Also some more "I know you are but what am i", really have to put in effort to keep up with the amount of high quality "things to say" going on here.
---
&gt; Brain worms perhaps?
---
Rofl. More nothing followed by intelligence insults. Get a new schtick, this one is already worn out.
---
No thanks I'm gonna trust blizzard over the servers that people outside of blizzard just kinda made
---
Probably something like rogue mage druid warrior
---
Then you get to WC and Verdan murders your face! But really, you're exactly right.
---
Feelsrealbad
---
Hopefully we have continued access lmao
---
Don't use the num pad. You'll want right hand on mouse, left hand on WASD. I only keybind important combat abilities to 1-5 on the main bar because 6-0 are hard to hit while maneuvering. Then I will bind the combos Alt+1-3 and Ctrl+1-3, and then will start doing like Shift+Q, Shift+W, Shift+E, Shift+A, etc
---
You offended a toilet soap, you will be banned.
---
The daily picture of a game guide.
---
same fucking boat as you. I'm getting really fucking pissed.
---
The blue post indicated that Rhahk'zor's damage values were correct. Not all the other Elites. That was a boss, now we should really focus on level 20 Elite hitting for 20 to 30 damage. Don't get it twisted, I'm not saying private servers are right or that my memory is better than anything. All I'm saying is that it seems wrong to me, and I feel comfortable voicing it because even the streamers and a great crowd of people feel the same way.
---
Well it’s for raiding too so I might as well bring the aura in situations where I get to dps.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BUT, MY ACCOUNT IS OLD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I NEED IT AND I AM BETTER THEN EVERYONE ELSE!!! CAN YOU NOT SEE THE 04 BLIZZ CAN YOU NOT SEE!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
The sad part... not nearly as /s as it should be...
---
Dear braincells, I hope I'll see you again soon.
---
Modern wow is not compatible with typing in combat as any class, and even pugs pretty universally use discord once you get to anything remotely difficult.
---
The fact that communication is pretty much voice chat or nothing (and no one wanting to use the in-game voice chat) is a big part of why easier content has become so asocial, of course.
---
Ahh, gotcha. Yeah when it comes to the actual race racials, the human one is useful all the time. I guess the idea is what can have a more felt impact. That regen you get through a fight may be really good, but a missed fear that could have been prevented can be felt immediately.
---
Overall, with proper play, none of it matters and it comes down to aesthetics, imo.
---
Maybe the gear score addon? But in general, no. I like addons.
---
Is there a way to check how old your account is? I can't find in bnet
---
Why not both?  Dwarf is both.
---
I've wanted this idea of OSRS style additions to the game post-Nax, but idk if they would do races with that since they would have to have their own starting zone, unless blizz were to just put them in an existing starting zone, but I feel that would just feel weird. However, with other content, I believe this is a good idea.
---
Play on a private server...im super stoked as well, but I really have no interest in leveling a character up to 30 that I can't keep...especially when it's not new so to speak, I've technically done all this before...i already know what it's like, im not really "itchin" for a small taste when ive eaten the whole cake before. Lemme know when i can roll for real
---
Where is the whinging or the personal attacks?
---
The closest thing to a whinge from me is "I wish all these butthurt PServer players would stfu". It's  old. No one cares how many years you played pseudo-vanilla.
---
I'm a tryhard so I will be running an optimized spec for progression raids.  
---
Druids really aren't brought for their throughput though, but for their battle resses and innervates, so you can do just fine in pretty much whatever spec you show up in.  
---
It's slightly different on horde though, due to the difference in dynamic between hpalas and resto shamans, druid throughput is more important on horde than alliance. To elaborate, shamans do excellent group healing which puts priests and druids in more of a single target position, while paladins are the superior single target healer, putting priests in more of a group healing role. This means druids are just second rate paladins unless you go hard.
---
Listen, I totally agree that there is a handful of rabid reddit posters that will act as private server zealots, but that's because most of the people that are playing on the server are grinding consumables for Naxx, or leveling a character, and not posting on Reddit lol.
---
Like, I am totally in agreement with you in terms of private server inaccuracy and trusting Blizzard's beta testing process, but you've chosen to cast a net over me because I share a server with a few big bitch boys. Imagine if you joined a battleground and some guy started talking shit because he just got out of a BG with some other guy from your server who talked shit to him. Just because you share a server doesn't mean you associate with, like, or agree with a group of people.
---
I think they have a lot to answer for.
---
DBM and similar AddOns forced Blizzard to focus on reactive difficulty in encounters, as you couldn't expect players to be required to learn the fight when an AddOn would tell them what to do and when. Instead they had to change fights to be difficult even with warnings of what to do, and later introduce a DBM-esque system so that players were all on a similar level going into those fights. 
---
Gearscore is responsible for iLevel. Players set arbitrarily high requirements for joining groups, so Blizzard was forced to build lower limits into the game, and cut out the need for Gearscore. If you can queue for content, you must have a minimum gearscore, instead of getting kicked for your gearscore being too low. 
---
I'm hesitant to blame QuestHelper for the changed style of quests, but I think it certainly inspired and encouraged Blizzard. If they had witnessed players embracing not being given an arrow, instead of going out of there way to not have to read quest text, then I don't think we would have the style of quests we have today. However, Blizzard's hand was never forced, they chose that design without needing to. 
---
If Omen had not been a baseline addon for any engaging in group content, would Blizzard have eventually added threat indicators to targets? This isn't a negative change, and at the time it was fairly inconsequential as tanking was in its slow evolution from being focused around threat generation to it's current focus on active mitigation, but I do not see that feature as having been implemented if it were not for the widespread use of addons like Omen. 
---
I think WoW as a whole can only be improved by banning AddOns. BfA is by far too far gone to be fixed by banning AddOns, but I think Classic can definitely be improved by banning them. That's not to say all AddOns are awful, and their influence has been wholey negative, but I do believe they design philosophy that is present in BfA was inspired by what AddOns the community chose to embrace, and how that affected how the community engaged with content. I also won't pretend I won't use them, in many cases choosing not to use them results in you falling behind, hence their later inclusion into the base game.
---
Knowing who is starting and running each guild, and grouping with them at high level dungeons so that I can join the coolest crew before their core roster is done.
---
Niiiiice
---
did LFR just turn everyone into toxic assholes since it’s cross-realm?
---
They should really just reboot wow, fix some of the more glaring nonsense, add in the things they worked to put in but never actually did.  I'd play that.  I have low interest in playing 1.12, it's a faceroll of vanilla wow.
---
I'd love to see the unkillable Cthun get released so we can face roll that too
---
Think of it this way. If you pay 300$ for one. At least it's exclusive. Kinda no point to a collectors item when you make infinite copies.
---
Main tank in a guild who gets on every night putting in work to progress the guild vs. guy who shows up on raid night only and doesn’t help out much besides being someone who can fill a spot in the raid

Have any videos comparing private server damage values to classic  beta? Legitimately curious.

True that.

Because that isn't how an RPG should be.  You should look how your items look no matter what, even if it's just to yourself.

Don't like how your character looks?  Get different items.

Probably not enough of us on the beta, or the people on the beta just stopped browsing Reddit.

Hmm it's probably the second one honestly.

No content in Classic was ever difficult.

Imagine the "you think you do, but you don't" statement actually coming true for people who were for some reason expecting a difficult PvE experience.

I don't want the beta either, but I'm not sure you could "ruin" my experience of a game I'd already played...

&gt;but you've chosen to cast a net over me because I share a server with a few big bitch boys,
---
No. You've chosen to put yourself in that net and make yourself a victim. Hilariously,  like the other pserver players I was talking about, just in a different context. You painted the target on yourself just so you could say "Stop targeting me!!". I never said it was "all" pserver players, but the only ones whinging about it are pserver players. 
---
&gt; Imagine if you joined a battleground and some guy started talking shit because he just got out of a BG with some other guy from your server who talked shit to him. Just because you share a server doesn't mean you associate with, like, or agree with a group of people.

I didn't check the Beta and didn't really do research, so ye maybe
---
Could you link some posts by those people? Not that I don't believe you, but I haven't actually seen what you're talking about.
---
I seriously regret reading this incoherent mess.
---
 You're too far gone, I've put in effort to try to break things down but you're not attempting to understand things in good faith nor does it seem like you're even reading what you're quoting
---
Does this mean I am in the beta or just the stress test??
---
Nothing in this game is as powerful and awe inspiring as the Red Defias Mask.

People who talk in absolutes... dont trust their word.  Ret, ferals are all possible.  It depends more on the players mental fortitude and determination.  If you are ret, be prepared to get denied from 4/5 groups, receive random whispers that you should reroll, and will be needed to heal every now and then.  Feral druids do really well on private servers, so there is hope.  The only issue ferals have are that you will find fierce competition from other rogues and furies for gear.  Feral also has a high skillcap because you gotta have situational awareness and multiple gearsets to reach your full potential.  Hunters are great all around, but there are tons of hunters and few spots for a raidspot.  They also get progressively worse in terms of raid dps as the patches progress.  Nobody can tell you what to play, because everything is playable.  The question is not viability, its if you can handle the baggage associated with each spec.
---
If not, it will feel like the ultimate tease
---
\[**NA - any server type prefer PvP - Alliance - LF Guild**\] Currently looking for an Alliance guild (casual or semi-hardcore - raiding at the very least 1x a week) that aims at having a member cap (quality over quantity approach). Not really concerned about world firsts, but more concerned about enjoyable progression within a friendly atmosphere. Before I go further I just want to clarify that big guilds are completely fine; However, I personally much prefer the tight-knit atmosphere of a 50-60 man capped guild where everyone knows one another. I've been a part of both and there was always something that I enjoyed about raiding with the same people every week and growing as a team element instead of witnessing clicks and the like. I understand that a guild like this is not the norm and will probably be difficult to find, which is why I am casting out my line in the hopes that it reaches a guild with a similar mindset.
---
About me: I'm in my 30's and I currently work from home so raid attendance should pose little to no issue. At first I mained 2h fury warrior, but eventually moved into resto druid which is what I plan to main this time around with alchemy/herbalism as my professions. As for raids my experience stretches from MC to the first half of Ahn'Qiraj during vanilla. In regards to PvP I maintained the rank of Lieutenant General during my time as well. I've been in leadership roles before, but I much prefer following directions rather than giving them out. I always try my best to excel in my class and always make it a habit to come prepared with consumables ready ahead of time. I know when to be in a relaxed and chill mind frame vs being serious for raids. My plan is to play an exorbitant amount of hours that I can to obtain BiS pre-raid asap, consumables and the like while helping out others along the way. 
---
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Please feel free to message me if you would like more information or fit the criteria.
---
It shows as a Legion PTR. This is for the website only. On the client it's labeled as Beta / Stress Test.
---
I'd imagine with the charter, I haven't heard of someone getting signatures and then it being failed to make. Guilds can have multiple words and spaces so generally uniqueness isn't an issue.
---
Even when you are wrong you can't admit it...
---
Just say anything about private servers good or bad and the pitchforks are coming out
---
At least its a pretty pink/red face :)
---
You're in for the stress test. Maybe they will convert them to full beta invites after but it's just the stress test for now.
---
[Vanilla on easy mode, btw.](https://imgur.com/DqNBrF6)
---
I'd say so! I'm only hoping we get invited to the beta afterwards.
---
if you log on and can only play on the stress test servers, youre just in the stress test
---
Sometime over the past 3hrs  I received "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic" via Launcher and downloaded the app.  Launched and no realms available.  I'm in NA EST and started WoW in 2004, but didn't have an active sub for about 1.5yrs until a few days ago when I wanted to throw my hat in the ring for a WoW classic invite.  I really hope this means access not just for the stress test but for the baseline beta.  But, if not, I'm still excited, i'll deal with the letdown later if it's not really prolonged beta access.  Good luck to all of you that are hoping for access.  
---
&gt; go against the stuff Blizzard is using for a template
---
I don't really see anyone doing that. What I see is more players saying to Blizz "I remember it being  like this, could you guys double check just to make sure it's right?"
---
No one (or very very few people) who actually wants Classic to succeed is trying to one-up Blizzard.
---
Ah I see, thanks. I'm actually on mobile but can see flairs in other subs so I don't know what the deal is.
---
looks like just the stress test. 
---
I got it too and it definitely does not look like beta
---
Just accept that the private server scene was wrong. This is starting to get old.

Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

1-20 druids suck balls. It gets a million times better when they get cat form though.
---
This community is fucking retarded tbh.
---
They´re still in denial because "it wasnt like this on my private server" while blizzard actually gives you data and proves you wrong.
---
What is wrong with these people
---
Apparently, if you think *literally anything* is off on the beta, you're an elitist private server oppressor.
---
And people kept saying Private Servers are easier than Classic will be.
---
Holdup holdup holdup
---
You telling me all my siblings (I’m so sorry) all became Gms?
---
When did the Druids rise to this power?
---
I’d hope the kids watching would be able to understand it’s just a beta and not live. If just watching their favorite streamer do it is going to make them ninja then they probably would have done it on their own. People act like there were zero ninjas in vanilla WoW. No matter what we say or do we just got to accept that a certain percentage of the population is going to do it. The same goes for griefing on a PvP server. There are always assholes in every game who’s fun comes from ruining the experiences of other people. All people can really do is blacklist and spread the word when it happens.
---
Try to be a raid leader / guild manager then.
---
Thats where 95% of the challenge is
---
Oh the memories. For some reason I didn't want to throw the boxes out "just in case", so I had about 20 of them in my closet at one point.
---
Private Server boomers ruin this subredit, bitch constantly about Classic/Retail. The real thing that made Classic happen is BfA flopping. WoW was never a hardcore MMO, Classic is just as easy as retail with less buttons
---
I see you're watching Asmon too. I'm not in the Beta, I have no opinion on this particular issue. Did you read the blue post? The blue post they tested a boss. From reading the posts I was seeing here, the apparent issues were with other elites in the dungeons, not the bosses. I was just trying to get some clarity.  
---
Way to just parrot the streamer and not have an original thought yourself.
---
Indeed, OP of that thread surely could've gone with something way less clickbaity.
---
don't know, maybe they will change it
---
Somone pls take this onions away
---
I'm 90% sure wow wouldn't exist if it wasn't for addon support.

Go try using the stock ui in 1.1, it's horrendeous and there's no way people would've kept playing if it wasn't for developers improving it.

That's cute that you think the people saying everything is broken played 15 years ago.
---
Anyone who believes that hunters are easy outside of solo lvling is chimp. I have played a 60 rogue/hunter in game pve/pvp and outside of bgs hunter is way harder.
---
If youre a bad hunter who cant kite/trap/maintain range/pet managenent you straight up get farmed. On rogue it is rather one dimensional unless outgeared in 1v1s
---
Oh yeah I definitely think the skill-gap and the knowledge between now and then matters a lot.
---
I'm just glad Blizzard are monitoring the situation and using the beta like it's supposed to in a lot of ways! 
---
I just want classic to be as close to classic as possible to it's very reassuring to see a post like this from Blizz, don't get me wrong - I have a lot of trust in this Dev team and they have earned it.
---
I can't wait for the release and hope to get into the beta to do a lot of testing myself :)
---
Aggro management is probably the biggest differentiation and people are much less likely to have an absolute potato computer today relative to wow.
---
Shaman, priest, paladin. 
---
In that order
---
No, I don't get it for real. Closed beta should be for streamers (marketing) and for select people who actually give feedback. In the betas I've been in for some expansions I spent a lot of time reporting bugs, I don't just play the game for fun, I actually try to test things. It feels like 90% of the ppl want Beta access just to have fun...
---
We've always had jerks in the world. However, it's easier than ever to be a jerk to a complete stranger, and witness shitty things thousands of times per day on the internet, whereas before we could read about them in the paper or experience them in real life. It's not so much that the world is vastly different, but our interactions with people are an order of magnitude more frequent, and those shitty interactions add up quick.
---
Yeah same, from 2006 originally but I uh.....'lost' my OG account. Paying for that now :P
---
Thank you, Boo.
---
Still can't fix shred. 
---
I agree it was mostly a joke. On a serious note, in an ideal world, I'd be all up for careful class balancing, together with raid retuning, buffing crafts so less than 95% of them are useless, etcetc. But we're not in an ideal world.
---
They said that the stress test invites were separate as there is actually a different server they are using and its capped at level 5.  You will only have access to it while the stress test is live.
---
I mean there's a reason Ghostcrawler released the infamous "git gud scrubs" post.  They weren't hard, they just required actual attention to be paid which was a paradigm shift and a very rude awakening for most people.  If you rarely wiped in a pug heroic, you were definitely the exception.  I think I had probably a 60% completion rate for HoO because of how many people were utter dogshit at the game.  When they released the ZA/ZG dungeons it was even worse because I would have people trying to do the bear runs in a pug, wipe 2-3 times and then just leave.  ZG I can't count how many wipes I had in that fucking dungeon because almost all of it was supreme wipe bait (first boss, boulder hill, 2nd boss, panther boss, cauldron boss, Hakkar...).
---
I would go for a hunter. Hunters are annoyingly good in wpvp and battlegrounds. You can achieve so much with your traps and long range. Obviously they are great at leveling, and moreso they are really strong in low level world pvp. Abusing your range and the weakness of your opponents in terms of their gear / level will give you a lot of hk’s while leveling 😊
---
They are also great at farming gold. For instance mob tagging in blasted lands to get elemental earths, soloing maraudon etc. Only thing is their pve raid damage is not the greatest and will always fall short to good warrs, rogues, mages and even locks.
---
One quick question -- do you just not use SS anymore using this build?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq3m4j/why_are_they_letting_people_like_this_in_a_beta/
---
Quick one I just grabbed, an entire thread dedicated to being upset that one of wows biggest streamers and long time player got into the beta.
---
Did you see if it's the beta, or just the stress test? A lot of people have been getting the stress test invites.
---
I have the same mouse, it's really nice.

yea i got mine and when i log in i only see the stress test server but says offline.
---
That was neither real world politics not religion. It was commenting on the culture of the pserver crowd.
---
Weapon damage doesn't change the damage auto attacks or abilities do in cat/bear form from vanilla to wrath iirc. That means they are just stat sticks.
---
The Manual Crowd Pummeler is a mace with a good amount of strength and a minor amount of agi and has an on use effect with 30 secs uptime and 3 charges in total, that increases the attack speed by 50% for the duration. And the mace is farmable in Gnomeregan.
---
That means you could, in theory, have 50% attack speed for 90% of a fight since you could have the buff for 1.5 minutes straight, swap the old depleted mace for a fresh one, wait the CD for switching weapons and activate it again. Remember: you can swap weapons mid fight.
---
Beat tanks generate threat through Maul and Swipe spam in Vanilla (that's literally everything except for fearie fire) and Maul, just like cleave and heroic strike, only gets used on the next auto attack. In raids you get punched hard enough to get a good amount of rage, which means you can basically spam Maul. With 50% faster auto attacks (and therfore Mauls) you get higher threat than warrior tanks could dish out.
---
It's also BIS for cat, since a majority of damage comes from auto-attacks, so it just synergizes well.
---
The biggest drawback is of course, that you need to farm it in gnomeregan and it is one of two items that drops from a boss there. So, if you really wanted to go ham for a whole raid night, you'd need to put in a good farming session to get enough crowd pummelers with your biggest enemy being bag space essentially.
---
Technically there was something similar in vanilla. Where you could change the colour scheme of armour and only the player would see it. (I used to change my hunters T2 armour to black rather than purple/pink). This was done by adding/editing game files and therefore was later removed. I mean if only the player can see it then i dont see why it is a problem. In regards to transmog in general i dont like it. It was always more fun to be able to show off ypur stuff when u got it. I feel transmog removed that since everyone could look cool lol
---
TFW I realized they just added another step for me to check if I'm in Beta
---
Get ya groot!
---
Yes, especally addons like DBM.
---
I'm not a victim at all, I am enjoying World of Warcraft and will soon be enjoying World of Warcraft on a different server. Being annoyed does not imply victimhood or that I feel I'm being attacked personally. I'm annoyed at the general state of a circlejerk, so I posted about it. It's just tiresome to read after seeing this subreddit go through the game cycle like 3 times now. 
---

You’ve gotten some good answers already so I’ll add that all 3 will work if you play casually and you’ll be able to find raid spots with all 3 but if you’re trying to hardcore raid I’d go marks hunter over the others like most said.
---
feels bad luck :/
---
I'm not shitting on private servers dude. I'm just glad that private server PLAYERS are finally being called out on their collective hubris. They were all so sure about how the game should be working and shitting on anyone who said otherwise. There are a lot of private server players that are not raging sperglords. An example is Esfand, who was a vital part of the private server community but then was absolutely shit on for a long time on this subreddit, and only until recently has been getting positive comments said about him.
---
yeah, i cant seem to find a definite answer. Only hints:

patch 1.11 windfury AP bonus provided by WF weapon and WF totem cut by 50%

Why the fuck do you have 20 active subs? That’s impressive lol
---
Yea uh huh says the guys coming 10 years late to a debate...
---
Google is ur friend
---
You think you wanna play classic, but you don't.
---
Agree to disagree
---
That's not proof. Link proof.
---
Got stress test but work tomorrow PepeHands
---
I have it aswell! 
---
And the undead warlock and tauren shaman.
---
Lost all their weapons though :(
---
A lot of things have gotten better. Not just the players and their information but also PC hardware &amp; internet speeds/connections.

Back during original WoW, I was playing on a 1998 Gateway PC with horrible internet.

One offline server shows up in game, what's going on?
---
Really? Cause it sounds like mutliple people in this thread and on other forums are out in full force saying "the game is too easy, something must be wrong!'
---
That's really nothing more than most of those players saying "Blizzard I remember this being hard! (at 12 years old) so why isn't it hard now!? All the casuals from retail are gonna think we're retarded because this doesn't justify that you actually had to coordinate in groups!"
---
Sounds to me like people just aren't old enough to actually remember that vanilla was an easy game. It was just grindy and being a kid gives you goggles that makes it seem like it was actually hard.
---
No one in the past ten years of private servers has ever realized this before.
---
/s 
---
;p
---
I'm not watching Asmongold at the moment, but you do know that people can agree on a particular issue, right? There are cases where Classic had higher damage values. Would that make Classic wrong? Possibly, but the primary people are bashing Blizzard is because they are mad that Classic isn't as hard as it appeared fifteen years ago. People get better. 
---
There's a well known saying about assumptions. I suggest you google it.
---
Enhancement is a lot of playing the windfury lottery. Even good players will be at the mercy of RNGesus.  
---
We're gonna have a lot of unbreakable wannabes in classic, just like we did in vanilla. I should know. I was one of them, and I have to live with that shame for the rest of my life.
---
They still troll the hell out of people, just on a much smaller scale.
---
As a multiboxer, they often times have to “check in” on us, either to just verify we’re still playing legibly, or because we’ve received so many reports again due to people not understanding what we’re doing. 
---
They have a lot of fun with the ones they’ve checked before, and while some multiboxers do find it very annoying, I personally take it as them having a bit of fun. (Constantly moving or causing something to happen to one of our characters, freaking us out is the majority of what they do now). But honestly, a lot of them still enjoy poking and playing, they just aren’t allowed to do the “huge fun” things anymore due to having a “reputation” so to speak, sadly.
---
Some of the chat I’ve seen or have had have been awesome, but I try to not keep a conversation going Incase they have a ticket backlog. 
---
Also - some of them are paid for what they do, others are devs or other people working at blitz that are just wanting to help out a bit that day and take some tickets. So it can majorly change who you end up getting.
---
which would all be fine and dandy if the default raid size would've been 15 man instead of 40.  
---
But taking 2 locks for summons, 2 hunter for tranq, \~3 druids for innervates and then depending on faction, fill up the DD slots with warrior / rogue / mage, and healers with priests and shamans / paladins.  
---
There were raids with 15+ warriors.
---
just get out dude
---
2008 reporting in got an invite.
---
Has it been confirmed that you have to be an active sub?
---
The loudest demographic of people who wanted vanilla was pserver players and now that it's becoming a thing all the \*twitch idiots\* mainly think its high time they go back to pservers instead of embracing each other in their shared love for classic wow. 
---
My honest opinion is that Twitch has created the \*toxic dickhead\* manchild that infests every game and this is just an example of wow's manchildren.  
---
I can honestly say that Twitch is easily the worst/best thing to happen to games in general and these type of interactions are one of the worse things to come from that place.
---
Ah yes, let's not test things and assume that there might be things wrong which could be confirmed to be right or wrong afterward by Blizzard, let's just take the game as it is, even though it's a beta where you're supposed to test things. Didn't we just find out the bug about the Stoneskin Totem?

**Off hours night time raiding guild, 1-4AM EST**
---
&lt;Noctambulists&gt; \[Alliance\] US-East PvE
---
I've got some experience raiding in vanilla and I'd like to raid again. Unfortunately, I work 4 to midnight EST with days off on a rotating schedule so it makes it impossible to raid at peak times like the vast majority of guilds do. So I decided to create a guild that will raid during the night.
---
If there are already any alliance night time guild forming please let me know. At the very least I'd like all the NA-Alliance night time players to assemble on the same server.
---
Feel free to join the team on guilded:
---
https://www.guilded.gg/r/zzaE9KMAaR?i=nm6axoLd 
---
And you can invite your friends too even if they're not planning to raid 40 mans. There's always room for friends of guilds and alts in 5/10/20 mans in Vanilla.
---
? The main pvp druid spec is 29 points balance
---
It started thst way yes but they changed that by 1.12
---
Lmao imagine that.  PRIVATE SERVERS ARE SCUFFED.
---
Blizzard knows what the hell is going on these private servers do not
---
I was in that thread. People were upset that the guy thought that the white piece of gear from one of the first quests should have stats. He reported it as a bug.
---
It was purely because of that. Not because he was a big streamer or anything like that.
---
I was trying not to go so gross lol but this was the most memorable one I could think of off the top of my head.
---
The PvP balance specs don't really use it. One of the main healing specs also go like 24 points into balance with plenty of freedom to pick DPS talents. If you intend to play balance as DPS in PvE, however, I think people will be pretty skeptical if you don't have it. It's already a pretty bad spec and noone's particularly eager to bring them to dungeons and raids, so if they don't even get to look at a giant chicken shooting lasers, they'll probably say no.
---
Healing is easy, just green dps imo. Hunters are more fun, but priests are more needed and wanted in raids
---
What’s more, twice last week I saw people claiming their own enjoyment would be diminished if their fellow raid members weren’t specced a certain way.
---
I hate to use this word, but this was some of the most entitled shit I have ever seen.
---
There's a reason that "Rolling Need - Hunter Gear" became its own meme.

Shout out to everyone who signed the petition 🤗

yuuuuuuuup. lets hope stress test goes well and they invite some of us into the actual beta.

£200 a month? huh?
---
Does anyone know why he didn't use his felhunter?
---
Im sure ill be downvoted for this but I don't mean it out malice (people should play the game how they want) but im looking forward to not having to play with these people. And I mean that later in the game in dungeons. Im not ganna get some guy who just paid for a 110 toon and leveled in 3 hours to 120. It weed out a lot of player I just rather not play with.
---
Nope this is just plain wrong
---
the guy is a popular (in the gold making community) in Retail, dude makes tons of gold making strings for auction house posting n shit.
---
tldr hes rich as fuck in game and can afford a sub for everyone in this thread and their families.
---
There, blue post. Now will you all shut up?
---
What do you know about the «fundamental gameplay of vanilla»? You said in your first post that you haven`t played it.... if you make any changes to the classes it will affect everything, from raid composition to PvP. It will basically become another game.
---
Ah I should have specified pve, where they have a 1 button rotation with extreme mana issues.
---
Don't know anything about the pvp meta.
---
I mean, if you're cool with someone reporting something as a bug that clearlyisn't a bug, go for it.
---
For healers most my abilities are mouse buttons,  while active buttons are things like Q, E and R and buffs are F1-F4.
---
For dps 1-5 are main abilities,  Q+E+R or mouse buttons are actives/interups.
---
Jesus walked on water, Chuck Norris swims through land

Dont most warriors raid as fury?

You were invited to the stress test starting tomorrow, not the beta.
---
how are we supposed to answer this for you, play what looks more fun to you.
---
Classic 😊
---
&gt;He can be the best Paladin he wants on pservers, but he needs to stop trying to stir up drama because people who actually care about Classic don't hold his "theories" to any credibility

Difference between  college and grad school man (had to sell my sole to Uncle Sam for a few years to pay for grad school hence the 10 year gap)
---
No, neither focus frames nor enemy castbars are in Classic. But addons fix that.
---
This is the hardest I've ever been trolled by blizzard I'm actually baffled
---
You can test both and play the one you enjoy.
---
I personally will play both, as I enjoy arena in current wow but will probably enjoy the levelling and general experience of classic.
---
Current wow has a lot of time were not a lot of new content is available so will have lots of time to enjoy classic while waiting for new content.
---
No its actually really easy. I mean it will take a few hours to get use to, but that's it. I also have keybinds set up with it so I have 1-12, alt 1-12, and L shift 1-12. So 36 key binds on just my mouse. It's awesome.
---
yeah! First the Diablo 3 Email and then this xD
---
*Everything* has gotten better (except our memories). I feel like a lot of disappointment is going to stem from people realizing that much of the "difficulty" in Vanilla originated in a lack of skill, lack of knowledge, and technology differences, rather than there being an actual high level of difficulty.
---
Correct. I don't even put it on my bar. Costs too much and does less damage than hemo.
---
&gt; I'm not watching Asmongold at the moment
---
Very curious than that right after he reads my post on stream you parrot what he said.  
---
I'm not bashing anything either way, or arguing either way. Maybe reread my comment? The posts here seemed to be indicating it was other elites that had apparent discrepancies, and bosses were fine, yet in the blue post they only checked the damages on a boss. I was trying to get some clarity if I maybe misunderstood or what. I haven't really cared about this issue very much or been following it very close.
---
Omegalul
---
No one is saying to not test content, but it gets to a point where people should just be quiet. Blizzard confirms something, but then people start saying that they weren't talking about that. 
---
The Stoneskin Totem bug does not even compare. You don't get to use that in the case of elite's damage when Blizzard admitted it was a bug when they said that this was not.
---
I’m really thinking about just sayin fuckit and going orc hunter now to enjoy the ride...
---
you dont CS corruption unless it's untalented (which it never will be) because 1 - you can deal damage during the cast and block the dots after they're applied and 2 - with spell batching a .4sec actually has .2 sec or less of interruptable time.
---
you CS fear or drain.
---
Used to listen to his podcast, and we created a guild from listeners for a while, was fun
---
same story for me
---
Items *with* money should take a while too. Only money with no items is instant.
---
The beta showed up on my launcher earlier today but I can only see the stress test when I launch. No email btw
---
I think it unlocks at 30, don't remember exactly
---
even by this sub's standards that is a stupid comment
---
I suppose it would require an inkling of self awareness to reflect on that one, probably too high of an expectation
---
This was Patch Day for 1.12. I have a lot of very similar screen shots. Teleporting into Ironforge brought you to this purgatory.
---
I want in, but i am not going to buy a wow sub.
---
That's why I and just about everyone on the internet uses /s
---
Be cool and hip. Show that you can be better than others even with ret pala. Own skill is more important than taking the "optimal" class.
---
I love the feeling to overcome "better" classes and specs. I want to beat them with my own style. 
---
And dont fear not getting into raids because of your class or spec. Good guilds will always prefer someone who is reliable and trustworthy.
---
They’re fun to lvl though
---
People who are claiming to know vanilla and didn't play 15 years ago aren't true eye witnesses. The only true eye witnesses are going off of 15 year old witnessing.
---
Give him some space, he's trying to be hysterical.
---
Oh I see, you are one of those pserver people I was talking about.
---
I've always felt if you need addons to win, you shouldn't get the reward. Shouldn't need something telling you to move in 5 seconds.
---
Do you happen to know if it appeared on your blizzard account management page as well or just the drop down on the client?
---
Oh...oh ..yeah that makes sense. I was worried for once, but now i know i am more valued than all the others. Especially because i am not paying a wow sub atm. I will surely get in for the real deal.
---
Gotcha. Just seems like a lot of work for my right thumb when it usually does nothing haha.
---
You literally copy pasted this comment from another thread. just felt like sayin it
---
Night Elf Druid because my guild is going alliance and I can't be an orc shaman again.
---
I'll be rolling one of every class on day 1.  I might not get many of them over level 10 or so, but they'll be there just waiting for when I get the urge.
---
Since when did criticizing somebody's incoherent reddit post constitute at being the thought police?
---
You might be right, and no I didnt kill any adds... I killed him when he spawned, and I didnt see any adds.
---
Here's a random thought, maybe the crit rate is wrong? Maybe mobs in vanilla hit for the same damage, but crit more often?
---
My memories of things being harder are based on live vanilla jot pservers though
---
you could do the same thing with shaman
---
Well man to be fair it's a lot easier to reverse engineer a freaking soup
---
No. I pulled three L7 mobs as a L7 rogue. No CC abilities. Crappy white dagger. Killed all 3. Died when the 4th agro'ed. That is not the vanilla I knew. Hell I never even ate food until level 8.
---
&gt; vanilla
---
Fun fact, reliable enemy castbars were not actually a thing in classic. Addons could just throw in the max rank spell time and just put that as the default, but that was it, it was very limited
---
I got a invite but come to find out its only for the stress test lol.. Feelsbad
---
i love these youtube channels that only exist to steal content from twitch streamers
---
Neat, hope so. I doubt it unfortunately but here's hoping haha.
---
Maybe you should have sent a venruki a msg during the .4 seconds corruption was casting (without any cast bar) telling him it was obviously a corruption not a fear and that you don't need to CS it.  
---
Not all of us are as good at telling what spell is casting just from the shadow cast animation like you obviously are.
---
Thats the stress test for tomorrow. I got it as well but you have to wait
---
hope we don't get 8 million posts about stress test tonight, logging off reddit for the day
---
Most likely just the stress test invite.
---
Did you even open the video in OP?
---
Really? So if you find a spell with the same cast time you can trick the cast bar addon?
---
The carnage Hemet has seen over the years has surely left him permanently scarred.
---
That's why eyewitness observation is the worst evidence in science.
---
Yours say "Beta &amp; Stress Test"?
---
I got an invite, but no e-mail was sent. Make sure to check your clients. For those wondering, account was created a month after TBC launch, currently subbed to BFA.
---
"No changes" like you said. It needs to be accurate to wow vanilla, not private servers.
---
Nope, I'm in the beta too.  I just spent the last hour playing the Beta PvP server.
---
Its a simple discussion. Do sophisticated add-ons like the ones in retail detract from the game itself (immersiveness, group play, rpg elements, wonder/mystery).
---
I was tempted to try to do the whole bag making thing. Since everyone will need bags &amp; they'll always be in demand.
---
Then I remembered I'm lazy &amp; don't want to put in the effort to try to do that. So now I don't know.
---
I do plan on getting some things from the AH early that I can hopefully flip later to make a profit.
---
I got one!!
---
Its completely up to you which version of wow you would rather play. I've played vanilla and every expansion after that all the way up to BfA, and my from my personal experience only vanilla, BC, and WOTLK are worth playing. The current expansion (BfA) is complete shit imo. Comparing classic wow to current wow is basically trying to compare diamonds to a pile of dirt.

Ah sweet, grats

How old is your account?
---
Lol get a life nerd. you need a girlfriend.
---
Error speech is almost no existant. You used to get "Out of range" "Not ready yet" constantly but now you get it once per mob it seems like. If i stand out of range and spam an ability i only get it once. Example of vanilla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7D1BI6u0RQ
---
As you can hear, the error speech is constantly triggered. In the beta atm this is not the case. You used to get it inbetween GCD's even.
---
Someone coming back to retail has also noticed this a few years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4wjqn7/did_they_remove_a_bunch_of_error_speech/
---
And no it is not turned off, the setting is enabled and it does play about once per mob.

January, 2005
---
account made in like 2014, got into the stress test. Sadly it only goes to lvl 5
---
Not made in for that one either.  I thought I have always been cursed when it comes to blizzard and beta but I went through my emails and I found out a few invitation I got in the past.  
---
I got one for woltk that I am not sure I used as I was not interested by wow anymore back then.  
---
I got HS invitations but only after looking around for a key everywhere and getting one by chance with someone.   
---
I got an alpha technical invitation for HOTS and beta invites  but maybe they were showering people with it considering the game was never super popular.   
---
I would trade of all those for wow classic now kek.

Ok, ik and I still think it’s easy as dpsing. If you don’t ok, you don’t have to act like I don’t know what I’m talking about to support your stance
---
Yup!
---
I wish I even got that. This is the only thing I have been excited for in a long time.
---
Maybe the private servers did it better then? Having a greater challenge in the game makes it feel less of a time sink and more of a challenge (which is the main issue with retail, it just feels like you play it on autopilot)
---
I'm sorry. I had almost given up hope until I checked one more time before going outside to do some yard work. I was shocked.
---
I see no problem with this.
---
I *usually* like to get in with a group early and become the Tailor/Enchanter. End up being fed cloth to give out bags and get to level it quick at the same time, other cloth makes greens to d/e. I'm not fussed on dominating PvP so I don't mind taking it up so others can go Engi.
---
That and I'll level my fishing/cooking together as I go, just so it's not such a bore later.
---
Do you know that these sets are terrible for everyone except Hunters?
---
Yeah, same. I wonder if getting selected to stress test has any bearing on being added to closed beta in the future.
---
Sorry man
---
Grats, seems there's no rhyme or reason to these invites, so many of us with much older accounts are being skipped.

private servers always triggered me, like they cant get the NPC positions in the starter areas right or the mobs around there drop half a bag of loot on "blizzlike" its such a joke i cant play for more than 5 mins
---
How many le skeptic youtubers are u subscribed to
---
It's not an uncommon opinion and it's also important to note that he talked about this issue yesterday. 
---
The point that I am getting at is that people will deflect when Blizzard confirms that it isn't a bug. We don't know what elites they tested. It's possible that Blizzard used the boss as an example. 
---
I understand your point, but posting about the same thing despite confirmation gets old. I apologize if it seemed as if I was hostile towards you. I was more frustrated with the people constantly talking about the same thing.
---
its called research you can know alot about space without actually visiting it
---
Nothing has made me what to roll undead warrior more than that photo on the right.
---
To be fair you started with a free 30 day pass that came with the account
---
But when RSGesus blesses you...oh god, does it feel good.
---
They said it would be a variety of account ages to get the best mix possible, it's not going to be old accounts only.
---
Kinda glad, I lost my old account so it's nice to know I'm not discounted from the get go.

Hunter definitely doesn’t have a higher skill ceiling than feral Druid in vanilla

I'm a one toon kinda guy...at some point I've tried most of the classes up to 20 or so, but I've never really felt the need. there's an impossible amount of things for me to achieve on 1 character, much less several
---
Why would they need to look at old videos? They have an authentic version of 1.12
---
Really? Is that why there are so many bugs? :thinking:
---
Classes have less buttons
---
But you have more buttons cuz everything should be bound...Nothing is ever locked off to you
---
I have 100+ on my p server pally.
---
Don't use most of them in PvE, but they're there because horde hippies need killing and I need to be prepared to get to killin
---
That's why there are no successful private server PvE servers. The whole appeal to classic is the immersive world to fight in. Fighting over OP trinkets or one resource node that could pay for a week of raiding.
---
Some world bosses
---
Glorious
---
Depends on the addon but, some of them yes. For instance I think Decursive is too hand holdy. That being said. I have no issue with things like swing timers.
---

Over 9000.

This is literally the only confirmed thing that increases your beta chances. Especially since noone knows how to submit an uncropped screenshot or provide a link to an official source.
---
Wait, the community manager meant to tell us that the devs never created scripts to test for such basic functionalities?
---
Why did they have to create a character with similar attributes and not just run the functions or check some values (depending on how their game engine was designed)?
---
I'm literally disagreeing with you.
---
You asked me if I thought a bunch of 11 year olds were playing, I know they were.  16 is between 11 and 20, so still disagreeing with you.
---
You want to be right, but you're off by a magnitude of "you're fucking retarded."
---
People still disputing it, despite it being the same client they used in 2004-2006, I trust actual Vanilla over a fan made server.
---
&gt; Vanilla data is very scarce
---
It's scarce for you. But you never had access to the databases and technical documentation to begin with.... The company does....
---
you're right.
---
Great video from ClassicWinds disproving the misnomer pservers values. I hope this video also puts the argument to rest.
---
https://i.imgur.com/AQZhPym.png
---
apparently its not the full beta... got my hopes up too
---
Came in here looking for the anti pserver circlejerk and I found it
---
current wow is trash stay away from it
---
This subreddit is already cancerous as fuck. It's unfortunate.
---
Ideally I would say run the Hunter first, you can farm everything you desire for any second class.
---
bumb
---
I pay for these subs using WoW tokens, so I am essentially paying for them using gold, not actual money.
---
There's no way I'd be spending that kind of money on WoW hehe
---
some time tommorow
---
I think they labeled as Beta &amp; Stress Test because both realms use the same client.
---
They could do a server copy and then add the new races/classes and have like a month of patch 2.0.1
---
No. Go to login, you'll see the list of servers you have available, that will tell you if you're a beta player or a stress test player.
---
It says Beta and Stress test because both players are using the identical client, the difference between them is the list of servers they have available.
---
This was all outlined in the stress test information post.
---
I had a pretty geared hunter for 1.12 and helped develop a min/max rotation for both beast mastery and for marks.  Me and the hunters in my guild using the rotations as perfectly as possible could still never get top 3 damage, unless the top 3 died during a fight in MC, then i could usually get #1 by the end. It was almost always a mage, rogue, warrior ahead of us with slightly better gear and much less downtime.  I spent a ton of gold on water/pet food/ammo, so even after trying my best, being pretty good, and doing great damage for the limitations of the class, i was pretty much always broke compared to mages, rogues, and warriors.
---
That being said, hunters are still my favorite for classic PVP, especially a NE hunter with shadowmeld, and an invisible kitty.  So many good times.
---
&gt; it on pservers being harder
---
It could just be because you might've been running with a bunch of randoms (some of which might have no idea what they were doing) vs him running with people on voice.
---
Those are such bitch to get but ugh so good
---
Wouldn't be surprised if I do something similar
---
Hopefully it turns into the full beta after the stress test tomorrow
---
Mindcontroll is a help for priest soloing at tyrs hand, but it is slow going. Teaming with a warrior would make the reward/time ratio for both much better.
---
There might be a problem with regular elite mob damage, we should probably do some research.
---
You dont and wont have access to beta after stress test, they already confirmed it. Look up the blue post from  blizzard
---
I mean there is indeed allot of misinformation, but tanking 5 mobs in SM at level 30 with a 2-handed weapon and getting hit for 50 doesn't seem very normal. Im not saying it wasn't the case...but i believe it needs discussion. 
---
Better implies skill, 5 mobs whacking on you isn't exactly skill related.
---
&gt; Nah, they are likely in their 20's. And they remember playing this game when they were a little kid. 
---
&gt; You want to be right, but you're off by a magnitude of "you're fucking retarded."
---
How can a private server do classic wow better when the game people are asking for literally already existed? Thats fucking asinine I'm sorry.
---
well personally i hate pvp so i think pvp is shit i every game so i cant agree or disagree on that. But when it comes to skill intesivity it is different from spec  to spec in vanilla. warrior could potentially be very skill based with weapon and stance swap. But you also got restro pala and enchansment shaman with was literally auto attacking. Retail is not only ability spam, its about coordinating burst with team mates
---
&gt; skilled paladin
---
No aoe healing?
---
Hi, /u/nekosteiger
---
Stress test only.
---
It won’t. Read blue post.
---
If you weren't on the Blizz forums 2005-2010+ arguing against welfare epics and other dumb shit like that, or actively playing on and/or supporting pservers, you can shut the fuck right up about this community and the people contained within it.
---
If you didn't deal with Retail people and Blizz treating you like a nolifer/loser/neckbeard/incel for 10 years, and just showed up in the past 2 years to play something we fought for, shut the FUCK up about this community.
---
This game would not exist without us. Get on your knees and thank us instead of crying about the way we talk.
---
They are playing in 1.12 patch, of course it's easier than 1.1 genius.
---
I saw this last night as well. Funnily enough on my Taiwan account (you don’t have to buy game, expansion or a subscription) where I had a small balance towards a few hours of gameplay. 
---
I quickly downloaded and leveled to level 6.
---
i guess a mix of both is the best, having the complex but still interesting rotation and skills used for different situations
---
Yikes i feel that :/
---
Dude this shit is not even funny. I get home turn my pc on to check and BOMM!! Same shit beta &amp; stress test! My heart goes crazy as I click to install..... shit! Only tomorrow I guess. How ever I am so fucking happy to be able to get in tomorrow. 
---
So happy, sad and hopeful for everyone.
---
Like /u/Valrysha said, I pay for these subs using gold I make playing the auction house. I don't actually have all that much gold though (in part because I use it to pay for subs ;))
---
I actually reactivated five inactive accounts last week, just to increase my chances of getting access to the beta or the stresstest, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to have paid off.
---
4-6pm pdt
---
You could watch every single vanilla/TBC video in existence at full HD quality (which they do not have), and you would still only have accurate data for maybe a fifth of the game at most. People just didn't use to record all this stuff on video. And when they did, it was in 240p with a big Fraps/Unregistered Hypercam watermark, with more bitrate dedicated to the music than the video, and with the UI hidden half the time so they could zoom in on their character's ass.
---
Private server data by and large does not come from Youtube videos. Please stop saying that it does. Video evidence is used as supplementary evidence for the harder-to-crack cases. It's not used for mob damage, because there's literally thousands of different mobs in the game and you can not find videos of even a tenth of them. Mob damage comes from a formula that calculates it based on the mob's level, class, and damage multiplier. Or would, but older private server emulators (eg. all the vanilla emulators) do not implement this properly and use an incorrect formula that's basically a guess.
---
do you have a link for this perchance? Ex-CQ player thinking of getting back in ...
---
Yep already launched the game a few time after I got the download.
---
Oh it was absolutely [GLORIOUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYShDHKPn6E) (Sorry I know it's not vanilla footage :p). I never managed to finish that video, but I held on to my 2h enha beliefs for so long. So, so long..
---
because its the same install as the beta. install it and launch it and see if u only have access to stress test or not.
---
I cant find the post. Do you have a link?
---
&gt; The point that I am getting at is that people will deflect when Blizzard confirms that it isn't a bug. 
---
Ok, I was not doing that. Asmon commented about my comment like I was, and I got several replies nearly immediately after, including yours.  
---
&gt;We don't know what elites they tested.  
---
We do? They described it and showed screenshots in the post, did you read it? They specifically tested the boss Rhahk'Zor.
---
that seems cool, but how would it tell if they actually need it or not? There's a lot of factors that go into whether you need it or not. I would like to see this addon though i it works
---
he's pretty much the only streamer I like and watch on twitch. he's a genuine nerd not trying to be something else like the rest of the twitch tryhards. and he's funny.
---
Will it blend? That is the question
---
Hi, /u/HappyHolidays666
---
As a new player to wow in general what is the best way to get in to a decent guild early? 
---
I have played a bit of wow but never seriously. IMO I'm a good enough player to learn everything I need to learn pve wise with no real problems.
---
&gt; Blizzard’s data is not coming out properly due to bugs and glitches, like the damage issues.
---
This is just a complete ass pull. They have recreated a 1.12 servers from the original stuff they had back in the day to test all this stuff. There is not nearly enough wiggle room for you to argue with them like they're some private server devs.
---
2005 here, I feel the same way as you :(
---
honestly it's been more than testing, a lot of people from the pserver communities fully believe they are a lot more accurate than they are and mistrust blizzard even on this
---
the aggro radius was a shit show that turned out to be right for example
---
This must be the first time ever someone has said paladin healing in pve is more compex than priest.
---
Here's the blue posts for real information [https://classic.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=178282&amp;region=us](https://classic.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=178282&amp;region=us)
---
Its stress test only.
---
No, it was added when AQ opened up.
---
It's hard to tell someone what they will most enjoy. However, I think there is a solid argument to be made for trying Classic first.
---
A lot of Classic content is still technically in Modern WoW and you will experience it, in a sense. However, you're experiencing it in a game that is not designed with that content in mind. The 1-60 content is now a minor stepping stone. It's almost an extended tutorial to your class before getting to the "real" game. By jumping into Modern WoW first you're robbing yourself of the chance to experience that content for the first time the way it was meant to be played. On the other hand, if you try Classic WoW first you're not really taking anything away from Modern WoW.
---
The OP is stupid. Nobody is dumb enough to ninja from their friends. You're supposed to ninja from random PUGs. This won't typically have any real consequences. You aren't going to be "blacklisted" or "banned". Nobody will remember your name 2 days later, and no one will recognize you at 60. There are thousands and thousands of players per server. 
---
If you get an opportunity to ninja something that will make you rich, it is your fucking duty to roll need.
---
You dont need a fancy mouse with 12 buttons. You can use the numbers 1-5, you can rebind Q,E,R,F,Z,X,C. I also use shift+Numbers 1-5, and dont forget about being able to rebind mouse wheel up+down for ability's. Most standard mouses will have 2 buttons on the side that you can also use. And if you still need more keybinds, you can use ctrl+numbers 1-5 as well.
---
....you’re fuckin kidding right
---
Meh.. I've had beta access since day 1 and have barely played.  Not sure why people are so excited to play a beta that just going to be wiped.
---
So, one thing I would like to say is that Classicdb is based of a Private Server's data, so it is prone to being wrong.
---
I cam back to wow a month ago, last time I played was BC.
---
I was shocked at how mindless dungeons have become since I last played.  Just spec tank and spam aoes, dps spams aoes, walk forward easy peasy dungeon clear.
---
heroics felt brainless as well, it's the same thing except remember to interrupt a 5 second long cast sometimes.. ok.
---
It was kinda fun to make a DH and start going through the content but the dungeons were just.. so disappointing.  Hell, i even randomly queued for a raid and we beat it.. I just attacked shit and got an epic drop w/o having any idea of what was going on.
---
I feel like classic WC and Deadmines takes more skill and effort that BFA raids :/
---
Just checked my account and I got an invite! My account was created in Legion. But to be fair my other account goes all the way back to vanilla. Seems anyone can be invited.
---
Yes, and it is very common for example for mages to use rank 1 frostbolt and fireball in PvP, both which will create cast bars that have way longer duration than the actual cast. But there is no better way to do it in Vanilla. Perhaps in classic it will be different, only time will tell.
---
A problem that can be solved with marginal situational awareness. I'm indifferent.
---
I got in man! Beta &amp; stress test. 
---
Just now.
---
Did you just literally get invited?
---
EU? NA?
---
NA
---
BfA flopping in 2018 is why Blizz announced Classic in 2017? Damn didn't realize time travel was actually real. Dumb zoomer.
---
You probably only got invited to stress test, try logging in
---
Remember this happening to my guild one night in ZG :D
---
This is a combat log of my warrior with an almost identical armor value to the Blizzard example fighting Rhahk on Private servers.

---
They're pretty damn similar.
---
This is asmon fighting a level 18 defias overseer.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/AmericanPhilanthropicKiwiKappa
---
This is my Warrior on a 1.12 private server client fighting the same mob. Take into considering my warrior has more armor and is 2 levels higher than Asmon, it was only made to be comparable to blizzards example.

---
Well, she sounds hideous.
---
It does because you have the constant pressure of movement/timing...Plus a pet. GL playing frame perfect as a hunter. 
---
Feral as melee has a much easier time with that. If you put a gun to my head and said "play this raid frame perfect or die, feral druid or huntard choose". I'd take feral druid every time. If you can't imagine what would have been the frame perfect move you're gonna have a hard time doing it. And juggling your pet, auto attack, and spells is way more difficult than any other DPS by quite a bit.
---
Not to mention feral is a shit spec unless your'e gonna farm enough pummelers to pop on all trash to keep it moving. Which would be insane dedication that deserved to be in raid just for sheer willpower. 
---
Vanilla is all about keeping it moving. A feral tank maybe I would take with pummelers just for bosses just because you can just give him the targets that will be last to die so threat is never an issue. There is 0 reason to bring a feral druid dps if he's not gonna have 100% uptime on pummeler tho. Or is just so autistic about it it's impressive enough to allow it.
---
As tanking knowledge improved, Warriors realized that the key to holding aggro in low level dungeons was DPS. That's why Fury Warriors discovered long ago that you can easily tank with a 2H and temporarily switching to a shield at precise moments.
---
It's all about player skill and min/maxing stances and fights.
---
The longer I’m not playing the beta just means I can spend more time watching those awesome streamers creating amazing beta content!!
---
I have the option in my launcher now, but it's only for the stress test...  Will I get into the beta one the test is over?
---
Is it confirmed somewhere that the debuff limit is 16?  Last year blizzcon they said it will be 8.
---
I certainly think players are better now.
---
That said, you can't skill your way around math. Mobs should be hitting for more than they are at the moment.
---
poor guy. gonna be so disappointed when it's stress test only.
---
dont get why people want to play the beta so bad. Any progress made was will be useless and if . u justw ant to try it out just go . on a private server jeez.
---
I just got home and checked (7:30PM EST). Could've been from earlier today.
---
Dude do you even tier 3 sub?
---
I'm going to try this game on august 27.
---
I just hope all these streamers come together and stick to a few servers together so I can stay the fuck away from them, it's already irritating me seeing 100 versions of the same classic video on my timeline
---
Yeah I'm pretty tickled by it. I was hoping we'd find pservers slightly easier and be pleasantly surprised with a new challenge, but what can ya do lol
---
This does a countdown to midnight on that day in the users local time. But, the actual launch time is Midnight EU time and then adjusted for relative timezone, like so: [https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/RVPR1QJFYYFY1557841233466.jpg](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/RVPR1QJFYYFY1557841233466.jpg)
---
nice. still didnt get it even though i subbed on 2 accounts since 07. very unlucky :(
---
Childish.  Game was released November 2004.  Blizz said it was going to be a small beta.  There will be more stress tests and move beta invites.
---
Yes really, but it's not compatible with their modern bnet infrastructure. That's why they are taking the 1.12 data and art assets and plugging them in to the modern client, that's where the bugs come from.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
You got into the stress test, not the beta
---
Getting invited to the stress test will not impact your standing for future closed beta invites.
---
I'm gonna get an MX Master with the 2 buttons on the side. I think I'm gonna use 1-5, then use ALT + 1-5 since I can hit the ALT with my left thumb. Using left SHIFT for immediate spells/casts kinda is a weird angle to me (eg. SHIFT + 1).
---
Nobody knows yet because Blizzard lazily worded this. I really hope so cause I got in as well but can only see the stress test realm.
---
No offense I agree but until they dont belong to Activision, I say, KEEP THE PITCHFORKS AT THE READY!!
---
This ride is far from over!
---
Are you going to play it? Seems silly they capped it at level 5 I feel like people will just say "well then there's no point in even playing" and they won't get the numbers they need for a true stress test.
---
Based on the whole comment I'm going to assume you're being sarcastic, but just in case you're not:
---
&gt; The real thing that made Classic happen is BfA flopping.
---
Which is why it was announced before BfA even released. 
---
10/10 mental gymnastics right here.
---
It’s a bit confusing that you’re deciding between two very different classes.  Many struggle between choosing Hunter vs Warlock, both being pet DPS classes, or Hunter vs Mage, both being ranged DPS.  
---
Hunter vs Shadow Priest are probably more similar than Hunter vs. Healer. 
---
Either way, it’s tough for anyone to advise you.  If you’re looking for PvP advantages or ease of joining dungeon groups or raid spots, people can probably objectively advise you on that.

Have you played on one? I've had nothing but good groups and mild mannered encounters.
---
No need for an archive - they've created a classic site! :D
---
Just got an invite. Account was created at the beginning of TBC.
---
Pixil  jumps? what are those?
---
Take this upvote friend.  You will need it.
---
Haha perfect comment. 
---
Me too!
---
I'll be raiding hogger first, then swimming to the stv blimp and hitching a ride to durotar for some lvl 5 pvp!
---
You can make an easy test. Make a warrior, if you survive a 2 mob pull, damage is surely off
---
You forgot to take into account Crushing Blows. The Worgs will do much more than double damage.
---
well I will play it! I began 2015 and never played vanilla WoW so I will familiarize myself with the talenttree, mechanics etc
---
I like how you gave this well thought out, structured answer that showed multiple perspectives and the top comment above yours is one word.
---
Never forget WoW was shaped by a guy named Tigole Bitties.
---
I had Devout but I prefer Vestments of Prophecy.  :)
---
the attention and competition for world firsts in classic is going to be insane!
---
Hi, /u/lio-ns
---
Thanks for this! BFD is one dungeon I didn't do a whole lot of, so this will definitely come in handy. Gonna be rolling a lock, so I need to get my hands on that Gravestone Scepter for sure.
---
Nope, just stress test
---
&gt; My problem is I really like balance as a spec
---
The problem is that many specs don't actually have the same gameplay as retail.
---
For example, there's a lot of retail enhancement shamans asking about viability because they love the enhancement “playstyle.” Classic enhancement is nothing like the fast-paced, multi-proccing spec it is in retail.
---
Got my invite. I created my account in Legion. Good luck everyone.
---
Still getting hit for 50 though. And that video didn't seem like "player skill and min/maxing" were at play.
---
Reddit
---
Problem with Rogue is that the Warrior holds them back from being able to use Stealth to it's full advantage. 
---
A rogue will naturally want to sneak by a few mobs to get an advantageous position.
---
My accurate memory of classic is super jumbled from time and pservers, but I will never EVER forget is my mage friend rage quitting cause he got killed multiple times by Verdant while running my Hunter through for Venomstrike. 
---
We didn't even need kill it!  
---
          
---
He just "wanted to try" and then got pissed his gear broke from failing a few times. Verdant really doesn't fuck around, and I never got Venomstrike...
---
2006 account.  no invite. cool.
---
I guess that really depends on your experience, there were whole guilds and communities centered around exploring and finding secrets. As a kid getting to unfinished areas was one of the biggest things i spent time on and enjoyed.
---
A few questions:
---
1. Are those epic gloves still BiS for a human?
---
2. Is deathbringer still worth getting for a human over some blue like let's say Dal'rend, or swords still better?
---
3. How is it pvping in your fury raid spec? I played a rogue in vanilla and want to try fury warrior in classic. Are fury warriors fun to raid with?  I love rogues but kind of want to try something new and be able to tank 5 mans if needee
---
And live on your son's basement
---
Interesting. It was my feeling as well that Blizzard started to change the game based on add-ons.
---
The only spells with a variable cast time between ranks are the very low ranks of:
---
* Healing Touch &amp; Wrath
---
* Fireball &amp; Frostbolt
---
* Smite &amp; Lesser Heal (not used after lvl 10)
---
* Healing Wave &amp; Lightning Bolt
---
* Shadow Bolt
---
The only one of consequence is Rank 1 Frostbolt.
---
Casting bar addons did take the player's level into account when determining what ranks they would have available.
---
It's ironic that you said I am lacking reading comprehension LOL.
---
Bye, kid.  You must have been that 11 year old.
---
enjoy your stress test.
---
What server?

they get below minimum wage bro, chill.
---
you're joking, but the amount of people bittering about DM VS VC in guildchat is getting ridiculous...
---
its the same client just different access so you might as well, for the betterment of the server/game
---
Smart play! 3 of my friends are already in the beta. We all played Vanilla back in the day........ And leveled together..... And now they don't care about me anymore :(.
---
Negative.  I got in today.  I didn't have it yesterday.

*plays RPG*

&gt;creepy role-playing

Idk why people are still disputing it. It was pretty hard evidence in the blue post imo. I edited the post because of it.
---
I am so disappointed right now... I got so fucking hyped just to find out I'm just apart of the stress test.
---
Got lucky I guess. Got into the stress test with my late 2005 account.
---
Still limited to current subscribers?
---
Tell the ol' mannot to forget the pills before raid
---
Yeah, turned out i remembered incorrectly.  My bad.
---
Thanks for the info! :) appreciated.
---
Got annoyed by him clicking his skills...
---
Asinine? Sorry but I don't see how suggesting that, maybe, a private server figured out a better level of damage. You know community driven projects can sometimes outdo the original content? The blood plague for one was one of the defining moments of vanilla wow, entirely community driven. I don't know why I'm bothering to write this comment, you'll probably just reply telling me how I'm wrong because "herrderr stupid private server community"... Asinine... Lmao... Can't even at least provide a reason why my comment is wrong and yours is right.
---
Healing was notoriously boring in vanilla.  Tanking is a lot of fun, pure DPS is pretty boring, DPS/CC can be engaging if the CC is needed.
---
Chuck Norris, Rick Roll, numa numa guy...it was simpler times.
---
I've never been more disappointed to not get into a Beta, and I know that I don't deserve it any more than any one else, started in 2006 here.  But fuck me, it's been making me seriously depressed having to watch it only on streams.
---
Is there any proof that those non-elites in SM aren't supposed to be dealing around 50?
---
It proves it if you completely ignore the fact that a lot of the streamers in beta right now are capped at 30 but still gathering gear and are grossly overgeared for the content. It proves it if you ignore the difference between those old videos and beta players' gear, armor, buffs, etc.
---
I'm not saying it's impossible that the beta is wrong. I want them to thoroughly bugtest this and be extra sure there isn't something glitchy going on. But comparing videos without matching the exact same setup--from the exact same class, spec, and gear as was in that old 2006 video, doesn't actually prove anything.
---
While I can't talk for the other people that commented, I was with a friend in Discord when I made the first comment. He was the one who linked this page to me. It is possible that he was watching Asmon at the time, but that isn't something that I can confirm at the moment.
---
When it comes to the elites, you are correct that they did test the boss, but I am saying that they could have tested other elites and bosses behind the scenes without our knowledge. This is not an uncommon practice.
---
You won't even be able to see the talent tree until level 10 though :P
---
Honestly treating it like a math problem is one of my favorite things to do. It's why I really enjoy playing like Factorio with Angle's and Bob's mods, or Minecraft with Gregtech where I can make literal spreadsheets. I only started vanilla near the tail end of it, and was pretty young still so didn't really do that for vanilla the first time around. But even still I ended up raiding pretty hardcore in TBC and WotLK (and the little bit of Cataclysm I did play). I really do look forward to doing the same in classic. If that's not your cup of tea that's fine, but I quite happen to like it.
---
Frame perfect. 
---
(Just thought it needed to be said one more time)
---
Safe to say many werent leveling in 1.12.
---
Healing is rewarding, but leveling a healer is drudgery.
---
Damn that’s so awesome lol. But super unfortunate on not receiving a single invite for the beta, you’d think with 20 subs you’d at least get one.
---
Mythic, in both dungeons and raids, is the real deal experience. LFR is a joke but everyone has known that for so long... coming back from BC would be jarring.

stop clickbait: he loves that theres no titanforge in classic.
---
God. Dammit.
---
My account was just flagged within the last 30 minutes. No email was sent to me either or at least not yet.
---
No problem, glad that I could help.
---
alt+1-5 puts your hand in a pretty awkward position and thats not ideal if you plan on pvping. Ive pvped in every xpac and i normally bind 1-5, Q,E,R,F,Z,X,C., shift+1-5, shift+Q and shift+E, mousewheel up+down, left+right mouse button, and shift+space (for stealth).

Subscription required?

damn really??? oh man didnt know xD I will still try it anyway ;)

Just got in on EU account. Created January 2009. My mums vanilla account didn't get invited, but she hasn't played since MoP.
---
Jan 2007, Just got my invitation. I'm so excited right now.
---
No one knows, probably not it's own icon considering it's the same sub, maybe they'll change the wording or look of the Region/Account section to make it more clear.
---
GOALPOSTS MOVED LOL
---
Hah yeah I triggered a whole bunch of them. Jeez I didn't know it was that serious.
---
Intellect did help with levelling weapon skills in Vanilla. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill
---
I said the only reason or argument there is to your comment already. We're asking for classic wow. Not a private server.

We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster for Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Vanilla. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing.
---
**Raid Times:** Weekends only. Aiming for two nights a week.
---
We are looking for any **DPS and Healer** at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles.
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H](https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H) (mention WoW Classic)

I see, haven't tried Mythic yet then.
---
Well that's good to know, but I'm happy playing on classic again :)
---
THE MAN!
---
Because the reality of 40 man is you just spam your most mana effecient spells. That's what frame perfect play would be. People play it badly to cheese meters not because they play well. 
---
So priest is more complex if your guild is struggling through soak and has a reason to use their max HPS rotation. Other than that. Which is 95%+ of the time. Paladin more complex. Only one priest is gonna get to renew the tanks and he will just keep that up. Hots are useless in a decent 40 man outside soak/tanks.
---
Paladin has a lot more to do because they're the ones with the oh shit buttons. Paladin with a clutch bop or lay on hands can easily save a raid. Priest in theory if htey were playing frame perfect in most scenarios just spam heal over and over. Just like paladin spams flash of light. And a druid would spam various ranks of healing touch, although they have healing touch which is another good oh shit button
---
Frame perfect play looks very very boring as a healer, lol
---
Could you pretend priest is more complex than it is/ Sure look at p server logs. No one is even using heal lol. But that's not the right way to play
---
Deciding whether to bop, lay on hands, or divine intervention are all much more complex questions than any other healer is ever gonna have to ask himself. 
---
Shaman has an argument if ur raid is sloppy. But in PvE totems are very manageable if ur tanks aren't terrible   
---
Cuz again the actual healing part is all the same. Pick the most mana efficient spell that doesn't put any of your raid in danger of dying knowing what you do about the encounter. Which ends up in the same spell being spammed over and over again
---
They're still speaking as though they are actual eye witnesses. There's no real way for anyone but Blizzard to know if someone actually played in Classic; and even then they might not have had the same account.
---
wtf? I would just be like "You need to stop"
---
Yeah. Again I can feel you though I do try my hardest to not look down on people for the games they play or the way they talk.
---
Still, when I see someone who posts "LULW" and "POG/POGGERS" every second or  third sentence, know they play Fortnite and games like League, I'll still roll my eyes and make that prejudice of "Alright, just your average 14yo Fortnite players, hes retarded" but I do feel bad about thinking that way afterwards.
---
Because I'm sure it's really a generation thing. Back when I was a teen I probably had my own type of slang and made older people roll their eyes and have them think "God, the kids and teens these days are getting worse and worse."
---
At the end of the day, even those twitch memers and fortnite players will grow up and eventually moan about the new youth and whatever slang they will be using and games they'll be playing.
---
I don't know where I'm going with this, but in the end these are still "people" and I do my best to avoid them, but try my hardest to not flame them or show them some sort of disdain. The teens these days are already depressed and suicidal enough I really don't want to make them feel bad or worse than they are.
---
But yeah, it's hard to not be judgemental and stereotyping people, I guess it's just human.
---
They are just short clips of highlights from their streams with their links credited in the description. If anything, I’m promoting their channel and not receiving a single penny for it.  A lot of people have thanked me for saving them the trouble of browsing through twitch and showing them clips they would have otherwise not seen.
---
or they griefed you by polymorphing the opposing faction that was fighting you to get them healed up, or by hitting them to break cc
---
pserver collusion is absolutely shit, and dudes that are getting praised for their testing were involved ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Still harder than retail*
---
Hi, /u/SultanOfWine
---
I've seen a ton of terrible behavior from the streamers in beta (compared with my time in wow).  I'm actually really interested to see how each server community will handle this and most especially end game raid guilds.  I know a lot of the old guard who are coming back for this.  The behavior these streamers are currently doing will get them blacklisted from the major guilds. Also, one good thing about 40 man raids vs (whatever it is now) is these streamers are going to be competing with 39 other guys for gear. Unless they plan on MTing while doing reaction videos to other streamers videos they wont be getting priority. 
---
I'm very curios to see how this all plays out. Personally I bet half these guys wash out in the first 2 months.
---
I guess I'm weird cause if I hold left ALT with my left thumb, it feels more comfortable to hit 1-5 with my fingers than holding left SHIFT with my pinky and going for 1-5 with my fingers.

Hell yes TBC had some great sets. Big fan of season 2 (Merciless gladiator?) sets on warlocks, rogues and warriors.

* No they don't

I mean I played every xpac of WoW. I can 100% say that I did far more "out plays" in vanilla/BC than any other xpac put together. It all comes down to exactly like you said, preference.
---
Druid is complete garbage, it's as useful as ret pala.
---
So the worse off my gear is /less work i do, the more likely i get the better upgrades over people contributing more?  Should i carry around worse gear to link?
---
This subreddit is starting to look like a golf course with the amount of holes left by goalposts being moved.
---
I got in. Day 1 BC account Oce.
---
I think the "dungeons seem too easy, they must be bugged" argument is often because people playing WoW these days are so much better players and have so much better knowledge about the game that they make the dungeons seem too easy. When I leveled up my first character back in 2005 we cleared the dungeons too, a couple of wipes here and there, but we didn't know how to properly gear, CC, make a balanced and proper group. We knew nothing, or at least very little. It still didn't take hours to clear Deadmines, SFK or WC. A mage using sheep regularly on a logical mob would be a spectacular player. A warrior using sunder armor (just having bought the spells necessary to tank!) would be unusual. 
---
I have extremely limited private server knowledge, but my memories are there. Dungeons were cleared and we were still the biggest noobs in the world. I discovered talents were a thing at early level 30ish. I thought warlocks could melee because of the Firestone. I specced demonology because it "seemed cool".
---
So many things wrong
---
your experience will be killing a few boars, sorry mate
---
I had a level 1 on Nost but didn't want to invest the time into something that could be gone in an instant so I quit, I signed the petition that was delivered to Mike Morhaime, I unsubbed after 10 years and wrote as my reason "Give Vanilla please."
---
 I'm in the statistics Blizzard used when determining if this was a profitable business decision. 
---
Who gives a fuck?
---
A lot of these people love to act like they are the reason we are getting Classic and it's just a joke that pumps their ego.
---
If you're not one of the Nost devs, one of the Classic devs, or someone actually relevant you really don't mean shit. 
---
I'm not gonna suck someones dick just because they played on a private server. Their word is not law which cannot be questioned and it doesn't mean anyone is **the** reason we are getting Classic.
---
Out of every answer people come up with, this makes the most sense to me.
---
I hope they repeat what they did in the original beta...  spawn huge infernals/dreadlords/etc in the main cities and let them run amok.
---
This is happening for a multitude of reasons, and Nostalrius did contribute. You're being awfully facetious.
---
There’s going to be way less tier 0 with patch 1.12 blues lol
---
Indeed. Such a great wand for that level! Hope the guide helps. You dont have to do much to get this series of quests, but it's nice to have it in one spot :)
---
 mfw i told everyone on the private server to suck my dick and deleted my character
---
Absolutely and I appreciate you noting that. Sadly, I dont have access to extremely precise data that I am aware of.
---
I loved that one.

He knows that he's just saying it wasn't a good idea to sacrifice gear he could have had with stam or agility for the cloth intellect gear

Hi, /u/VizerDown

While i still pray for any beta/ stress test
---
I tried some retail last year but didn't buy BFA so I was just running through mid level dungeons on my druid. People kept yelling at me for going bear on big pulls because I was supposed to be dpsing and not tanking.

What's the point of being a hybrid if a can't hybrid?

I watched a group do gnomeregan yesterday and it certainly looked more like how groups had to slowly advance through the dungeon in the old days and clear mobs with plenty of deaths on trash or due to roaming mechanics.  Plenty of out of mana situations where healer could not heal through 1-2 trash mobs pounding on tank. Plenty of challenges keeping aggro on tank and several times they had to CC to split up packs of mobs.  Lots of marking of trash.  
---
It looked slightly better than some of the early days when game was totally new to everyone.  But it looked far more stressful than any dungeon run nowadays.   People were saying “go slow” instead of the rush rush rush rhetoric in retail. 
---
Needless to say that it probably won’t take long until people have refreshed their memory or learned the precise behavior of mobs.    But the first months of classic will be fun, I’m guessing.
---
Man, calm down.
---
Has anyone in here ever written "It wasn't like this on my private server" in the context of "Private servers are correct?
---
I feel like people are making things up or are imagining things when it comes to private servers.
---
At least they got invited what the fuck blizz

I've always looked up to Donkey Kong because he's a better role model to me than anyone else in my life has ever been. Kids would make fun of me at school when I ate bananas, or rolled like Donkey Kong, or threw barrels, or wore a red tie, but it didn't matter because Donkey Kong was all I had in my life. Without him, I'd be dead or a drug addicted thug like my brothers.
---
Your account got hacked?

Well first let me tell you about Donkey Kong's Legacy, traveler!
---
All those thousands of in-depth discussions and they're still fundamentally broken in basic aspects, as the Classic beta has shown us.
---
What makes dual-wielding better for it? Do the extra attacks from off-hand procs only use the main-hand?

you are correct, they rolled that out today

Multiple Pet Problems for hunter
---
Delay on reaction speed to commands on pets (this exists in legion/bfa as well)
---
Pet regeneration not working correctly, currently you have to let the pet "come to rest" at your legs before it starts regenerating health. If you just run away after a fight the pet will follow without ever gaining health, even if its shown out of combat
---
If pet is in combat with any mob, and you send it to attack another one, if the first mob then dies before pet starts hitting the next target, it will just come back to you as if someone pressed "Passive" on the pet.
---
I want to roll on both sides, but i want to main the side with my friends. so if i get into beta, i can play a satisfactory amount on Alliance before I start working on my main
---
Correct.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Funny how you write this all smug, but the other comments are saying that it's elites in the dungeon **not** the bosses.
---
While I don't know who is right or wrong, or care, other than just making sure the game is good, an actual comparison for what people are giving feedback on (which is the entire point of the beta, so Blizzard WANTS to hear more stuff like this).

Literally just came back from dinner and saw I got in and have the same question. Downloading now to find out lol

Holy shit I knew I wasn't crazy, I witnessed this once on the server Moonguard. 
---
iirc they were spawning bosses in Goldshire as well as putting the "level up" animation on themselves repeatedly and flying around. It was awesome.
---
My fear is it take me five different 70s to figure out my main.   Really hoping to pick the one and go.
---
Fishing and cooking.  Always neglected it in retail.
---
then a long ass run to whatever is the closest pvp-enabled zone to see if people are doing some silly level 5 pvping lol
---
How come getting him 6 levels made him perma-loyal? Can you explain that mechanic please? I've never heard of it, is all.
---
Fuck it, it's a better explanation than what some of the commenters are here are suggesting.
---
He is zzzz
---
how so? This isn't TBC, so armor isn't normalized. Every point of armor can have big swings in damage reduction, and without knowing what sort of armor value we're dealing with, we can't actually say how much damage reduction the tank has.
---
It's pointless to compare numbers if one tank is 55% reduction (due to being extremely twinked out with blues or bonus armor greens) and the other is 22% since they've been focusing on +stam/str over armor and their gear is 5-10 levels behind their actual level.

Good to know, it probably doesn't effect the principle at hand (potion in human form heals you more than in bear form), but thanks for the clarification.

Subbed?

Gnomes would like to have a word with you!  Perhaps we can discuss how much awesomeness is in our short bodies over ale at an inn over at Ironforge.

Damn grats, I'm jealous dude
---
Just got mine like 5-minutes ago. They are still rolling them out.
---
Classic only exists because of private servers, you ignorant lazy fuck
---
Why not?
---
Whoa, how did you get the new Street Fighter v World of Warcraft crossover?
---
Someone had mentioned having a 2006 edition of the WoW Bestiary, that would likely have the damage numbers.
---
WoW was always the easy MMO compared to Everquest, DAoC or FFXI. Especially level 30 and below there wasn't that much hard content. Maybe you don't kill the alarmo-bot in Gnomer and your group wipes or maybe you die to Archaedas in Uldaman. Leveling and instances were not that hard unless your group was severely underleveled.
---
My issue with alt is you dont have access to jumping while you hit alt with your left thumb. In pvp its pretty important to be able to strafe walk+jump at the same time, which makes it so you are air bound in the direction you need to be going which buys to time to set your hand up for your next ability, if that makes sense.
---
Okay well recapturing *you're* nostalgic high is gonna last about 12 days give or take.
---
What everyone asking Blizz about the damage is saying is that the game will be more challenging and enjoyable if you add... Wait for it... More challenge!
---
But nah just repeat your comment not explaining how my point is somehow less valid than yours, asinine, lmao.
---
So do Stress test players I think. I got access tonight and it says exactly that, and I only have access to the Stress test server.
---
At least you got it, no?
