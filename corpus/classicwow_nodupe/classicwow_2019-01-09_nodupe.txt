You are calling logging in a couple times a week for a couple hours not casual but if you want to do progression raiding or high rank pvp, a couple hours a few times a week is pretty casual.
---
---
---
I don't disagree, but I also don't think people are in and out of the starter zones pretty quickly, and if sharding is left to those zones and then removed after the launch wave of players then it will be fine. If they put sharding in somewhere else then I will be pissed.
---
Same fear here.
---
&gt; First aid should be your primary way to regain health or eating, dropping a health pot actually means you are LOSING money every time you do it as you could be selling that pot.
---

---
Everything has an opportunity cost.  Using a bandage means you're losing money they you would've otherwise had in your pocket if you'd sold the cloth on the AH.
---
Spawn based resources are finite drop based resources aren’t. This is why people say pick up skinning, it’s an unlimited income source
---
and if each region has more than one cluster for each server type where is the issue?
---
Lionheart is BiS throughout the entirety of vanilla and never gets replaced for PvE
---
Wow thanks read through it. Just saw egreg on the wow jeopardy with kargoz! This guide is awesome
---
So.. you get a title and thats it right?
---
Content patches? Is that even going to be a thing? 
---
Yeah, I'd been having some issues with getting a personal 1.12 server to work (trying not to level on private servers atm to keep myself from getting TOO invested in them before Classic's release), but after finishing this video I FINALLY found the problem.  
---
Classic footage is coming in episode 12 ;)
---
I thought they said they’re releasing stuff in 4 stages right?
---
Dont worry guys cant kill myself til classic comes out 
---
i like to buy tolkens and place them on the AH. who knows, maybe not even gonna level and buy the boost to 59. 
---
to each his own, right?
---
&gt;When you make eye contact with a white person.
---
I would say that I don't make such a face. Would it be ok for me to make a joke about which face other ethnicities make when they make eye contact with me?
---
Trinket that turns you into a fish
---
Lag is related to internet connection and not to local client performance.
---
This is the dedication (and tank) I’ll be looking for.
---
Would love to see a MMO with good gameplay tbh. The graphics are already quite good.
---
Did you know the flags in The Undercity are color coded to their respective quadrant on the map itself.
---
I agree 100%. I quit during WotLK.
---
To the original poster’s point: because it was before?
---
The warlock epic mount quest is in DM. Otherwise I'd support DM in stage 2, but months with no epic mount quest doesn't seem tenable.
---
&gt;"Players seeing familiar names reinforced a sense of friendliness and camaraderie"
---
Reading remarks such as these is wonderful. A lot of people think this aspect of the game was just a happy accident but in reality it was an intended goal.
---
I get that, and I have a solid reasoning as to why it wouldn’t be.
---
Being a software engineer, I understand the process of what they’re doing. They WILL have to go out of their way to artificially implement progression gating.
---
To me, the simplest answer is that gating a fishing event won’t be worth their time and effort to do so.
---
Please get glasses. 
---
Yes. The simple days!
---
It is really up to you. 
---
Fishing can be very lucrative, having the best fishing pole improves your chances of catching things. (Less things getting away) It will also make other fishing junkies jealous of you.
---
I have always wanted the trinket since i first heard about it in BC. If i am not mistaken, while you are in fish form you are able to breathe underwater and swim faster (I think). Which in a game where mobility is limited, cutting across water and the ability to spend lengthy periods of time under the surface can be a real advantage. 
---
That being said, the trinket is useless for druids because of their swim form which they get very early on. 
---
Mister Satan is not impressed.
---
adding to your bit about (shadow) priests and warlocks: never forget that you can dispel curses! 
---
back at TBC times, I've seen high rated, full arena geared druids let *fuckloads* of damage ticking on themselves and their partners, because they were too dumb to use that one easy, instant ability and have personally ran full gladiator resto druids oom with a troll shadow priest, just by hitting them with [hex of weakness](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Hex_of_Weakness). while it's a pretty rare spell, it cuts both healing and cat dps by about 20%, completely fucking over any druid... and it is easily dispellable by them.
---
don't be that guy, don't make the people playing against you irrationally angry - use remove curse!
---
also, fear(/mind control) + DoTs (+ mana burn) can quickly take druids down.
---
Boost to 59?!?! Where did you hear that is an option?
---
Bloodfang rogues ate laughing at u.  Of course you can’t see them until they are standing over your nearly lifeless carcass. 
---
You have a good point. 
---
Being a rogue is very fun, and the paranoia created by your presence is very fun to watch. It reminds me of the movie *The Thing*.
---
This is the entire reason they stopped doing merges. You cant imagine how many people just unsub once they lose their name, and I dont entirely blame them, that is your identity, that is who you are, it is your reputation, good or ill. If you arent you anymore, if you suddenly have to be a different person, a different name, you can lose all mental investment you once had in the character.
---
Everyone looks like Christmas tree 
---
Have literally never looked at the bobber while fishing. There was an addon, fishingbuddy I think?, that made it so right clicking fishable water caused you to weapon swap to your fishing pole and cast. It also turned certain sound settings up/down/off, so literally the ONLY thing you could hear was the bobber sound. Mouse over bobber, don't look at screen for ~15-29 seconds, click when you hear the splash, recast, put mouse back over bobber, repeat. 
---
That said fishing was never that efficient in terms of gold/hour, I did it because I found it relaxing. So if you really don't look it, there is no reason to do it.
---
Did you seriously fall for such a basic troll?
---
Looks like u/esfand without hair
---
this is what i always bring up an my friends never know what I'm talking about.
---
in vanilla, you were just an adventurer trying to become a hero. you weren't some big commander or anything special at all really you just existed in a fantasy world and had to make your own story.
---
i cant play these new mmos that have like main storylines and shit. i really loved just living in the world without constantly feeling like i have to move a plot forward.
---
PM me if you want somebody to talk to.
---
Where's your Judgment bracers?
---
I am truly glad you're doing well today. Hope it continues so.
---
Lol that book.  Yeah, again completely derail the discussion and avoid understanding any point I try to make.  The original point I made was very simple and has been made many times before and is nothing new and the majority supports it as evidenced by the publicity of Diablo mobile.  Keep writing books though, I'm sure someone will enjoy thumbing through it.
---
Level skinning. Vendor everything. Prioritize leveling fast.
---
Don't stockpile anything for resale until you have absolutely everything you need for the immediate future (pre-raid BiS, fully enchanted, consumables for a month of raiding, epic mount, etc). It takes a very long time for average prices to significantly change, and by the time they do the money will be worth less to you.
---
I cannot believe that people would rather have this sort of solution of **merging 3+ servers into one** instead of just having high population servers that can survive losing half their pop.
---
You speak of community, but which is worse for community feel? An 8k server cap that falls down to 3-4k which is still a healthy pop? Or merging 3+ 500 pop dead realms into a single one **where LITERALLY NEW PEOPLE appear on your server out of fucking nowhere.** Not to mention your entire economy randomly merging with that of 3 other servers magically and instantly..
---
How the hell is that better for community than just having more people to begin with so merges arent needed? Its amazing to me that people feel mergers are a better solution.
---
Spotted the Mage.
---
Ah... Mr. Rapeface himself. 
---
I love Nemesis personally :D 
---
I ignore professions while leveling then go back and level them once I hit 60. All my gold comes from quest rewards and selling to vendors.
---
I love monopolising markets on the AH. I might try it while leveling. I'd obviously have to start small and sell for little profit. Perhaps pick a  leveling herb that's high in demand. Definitely fadeleaf if I were on a PVP server.
---
I'm so confused how people think Classic being made is some exception to the goal of Blizzard making profit. Blizzard saw demand for Classic servers, determined it was possible and would be profitable, and are now doing it. It's really as simple as that. Why do people think they'll sabotage demand for a product they're selling?
---
Newsflash, neither of them look practical, that mace looks so incredibly practical indeed
---
That actually does sound familiar. Which is surprising since I don’t even remember the name of my guilds back then. 
---
Warrior first. 
---
In the starting zone if you are using charge on CD as you farm mobs on route to anywhere then your covering a large amount of ground. There is no movement like it till later levels - Healings a slight issue if you overpull but most of the time you can pull easily manageable groups! Combine that with bandages from level 6 onwards, and hitting hard you have a winning combo.
---
Shaman Second
---
Rogue Third
---
Rest is so close it doesn't even matter.
---
I would argue Rogue is the most iconic Vanilla class, purely from a gameplay standpoint, at least if you were on a PvP server. They completely change how you should be approaching open world gameplay as they could sneak up to you at any moment. Their combo points and energy system have been copied by a trillion games since. Sure, Druid has those mechanics too, but they are loaned from Rogue. 
---
They'll almost certainly keep it at 2.5k
---
You will want every single weapon in the entire freaking game!
---
You don't need anything but your pet!
---
Send him in! Scatter shot! 
---
And then feign death.
---
Weirdly true, though I guess I didn't realize it until just now. Now with transmogging and gear being in these neat box sets, it's difficult to tell who has what level of gear at a glance just by looking at them. In older MMOs, you could say "Oh fuck, this guy has the slightly salmon colored bracers of bumfucking" and it gives you motivation to be that nerd with those pointless bracers. 
---
I mean... I'm a total #nochanges advocator but if your think drain soul/drain life or mind flay look in any way weaker in retail than they do in classic then I don't even know what to reply! 
---
There are definitely some animation changes that have added to spells. Even things like the water flying out the hands of shamans, the roots swarming the druids when healing add a bit more flavour. 
---
&gt; As a good tank you get a lot of praise and make friendships quickly
---
This. The game just got easier every dungeon I ran
---
Yeah but it's in the same area and makes the grind down worth the walk. I always do it regardless
---
I must be an absolute moron but some dark rose tinted glasses of me really likes these type of clusterfuck UIs. It makes the game feel a lot more like this complex management system rather than just a rotation of 7 different types of fire at an enemy. 
---
i was just trolling, but with activision you never know :)
---
A little saying I jacked from the cesspool that is 4chan, but it helps me and my close friends keep our chins up when things are shitty.

"We're all gonna make it."

Look up "thats the world of warcraft taht you play" and also "boomchicken song"
---
Because these players are all actually 13 years old, or they're 30-something NEETs who have the mentality of 13 year olds? Fuck if I know.
---
That's the only reasonable explanation to me for some of the faces behind these comments, lol.
---
_Every_ action has either a monetary and/or a temporal opportunity cost, including picking up skinning as a source of income.
---
Thanks. I hope things look up for you in the future too.
---
The only class that doesnt add anything in Vanilla is the One who is offline
---
Can we all just face reality for one moment. If this game is to survive, it needs updates and new content. Re: Old school Runescape. Poll vanilla style updates, game will thrive and overtake retail sub numbers, like Old school Runescape did to RS3. 
---
Hey thanks for the awesome reply! I appreciate it, sounds like I might try for the trinket on my main because I want to roll a warlock! But now the decision seems harder because having the bonus to the fishing skill seems really enticing. This is the best part about vanilla, choices that actually matter and have consequences!
---
&gt; Why would a fishing event, with a fishing pole as a reward be gated behind content progression?
---
The same reason they're making hundreds of other arbitrary design decisions that don't make a lot of sense when considered in a vacuum:  Authenticity.
---
I love how his meme even uses ~~old~~ young jaina
---
Thats why the updates should be polled, following a vanilla style of the game, perhaps just minor QOL updates or raid tiers that offer rewards without devaluing other tiers, whatever the community wants should be polled. WIthout this the game will die, much like Old school Runescape did before they released polled updates.
---
I see lots of people complaining about how ugly current gear is and I honestly can't even blame actiblizzard for that.
---
Imagine designing multiple gear sets for 
---
My guess is whether it not will be there will have nothing to do with whether or not it belongs as part of ZG patch, but rather whether or not the event data and code imports correctly when they import the 1.12 data into the modern WoW services.
---
If it doesn't work out of the box, I can see them shelving it and dealing with it after launch, as they will have plausible justification for not prioritizing it.  But if it does "just work" when they port over all the calendar events, I don't see them spending any time to remove it.
---
Reminds me of the good old days of me not knowing shit about the game and being impressed by everything, the feeling of such a big world and knowing nothing about it felt cool. I know I won't ever get that feeling again, while playing Classic when it comes out, but it'll at least somewhat help make me remember these old memories, because I'll get into similar situations, places and so forth.
---
I would literally give huge amounts of money if I could go back in time and tell myself to backup my old screenshots from Vanilla/TBC. I got my first laptop some time into TBC and I still have those two harddrives from it, but sadly I've reinstalled WoW so many times that I can only find my latest install which had late WOTLK screenshots on it. (This is by using a free software).
---
The highest Warrior dps ever made - is performed by ppl not using swing timers (dw fury) u will get crazy trying to time stuff and in the end - u will lose dps on saving CDs for not clipping. Trust me - DW, fuck swingers, 2h fury as Horde, PvP or leveling - ofc, its useful
---
Why would they add sharding if they planned to keep Vanilla realm caps. 
---
That wouldn’t make sense. 
---
They’re going to go much larger than Vanilla server sizes. 
---
Same (till end of wotlk tho).
---
Warlocks are truly unique in this game. There's no other game with a class even remotely like them. Believe me, I've looked.

It does healing well. It provides no real benefit over other classes in the tanking or DPS role. And since they don't have anything absolutely necessary in the healing role either, we could do just fine without them. There's no real situation in a PvE environment where you need specifically a druid, you could always make do with another healing class. 
---
PvP is another story though, where they provide a lot as flagg carriers for example. 
---
fanmade overwatch porn is better than anything blizzard has done the past decade tbh
---
druids is one of the gimpest class before 10. 
---
as hunter you need to hit and run, and its fine.
---
rogue arent that bad at all. save money buy white weapon from the vendor, and just dont go for mobs higher level than you to avoid glancing blows and misses. same for warriors.
---
mage is one of the easierst for sure, frost armor lets you just run from everything if needed, mobs die before they get to you. nova, sheep if in toruble or two mobs. super easy class.
---
You're too low for darkshore, lowest mobs there are 19. Loch Modan is where you should go although solo I'm not sure if you can solo the last king's defence chain (fighting a level 17, 18 and 19 mob together). You're going to need the IF and Thelsamar flight path anyways.
---
So what you are saying is that we don't need paladin or rogues?
---
Ok, but who do we ship him with? I need more info here.
---
&gt; Being a software engineer, I understand the process of what they’re doing
---
Heh...  If I had a dime for every time someone tried to pull the "software engineer" thing credibility on things that they couldn't possibly know anything about...
---
No offense, but there are _millions_ of software engineers out there and none of them have any useful insight into how Blizzard is going to approach content gating, save for those working _at_ Blizzard.
---
Furthermore, being an engineer yourself (ostensibly on some kind of team), you'd know that this isn't even a decision that the _engineering_ team would make, at least under any kind of professional team model that I've ever seen.  They could provide feedback, but ultimately this decision would lie elsewhere-- usually with a producer/PM/product team/whatever.
---
&gt; They WILL have to go out of their way to artificially implement progression gating.
---
Well, yes, but the _entire_ project revolves around "artificially" implementing things in such as way as to emulate how the game existed a decade and a half ago.
---
Aq gear always had that awesome look and feel that you literally killed a big and decided to wear it. 
---
Me too.
---
They have a huge and rewarding skillcap.
---
You can be the top DPS in every raid. Or you can be the tank. There's alot of options to minmax on both specs.
---
Levelling is challenging and rewarding. You need to carefully plan every pull and be prepared for PvP. If played properly, you can level quite fast and outplay others in wPvP.
---
It's easy to do dungeons since you can just tank, even when you're dps. Being able to tank means you control the flow of the dungeon and allows you to clear it as fast as possible with efficient pulling.
---
Music wasn’t bad
---
I mained a hunter back in vanilla. I was OK, I knew how to kite, I knew my 10 sec(or w/e it was called) rotation. I knew to not clip auto attacks with shots. 
---
But I wasn't good at much else. I geared badly, I raided badly, I farmed badly. I did everything badly
---
I will going Druid this time around. I won't be perfect, but ill do better than I did before.
---
Bars son. Every warrior needs 12 or some shit and a TF is like 100 or something fucking stupid like that.

WoW dUdEeE look at this warrior who ninja'd all the splinters of atiesh and the staff head from his guild AND he stole their GM's ivory raptor right out from under them!  
---
HOW HE DO DAT?  
---
In all fairness; I don't feel that I want to re-live that part of my life. While there are a number of excellent memories from that time and associated with WoW in particular... all of them were followed by a heartbreak that even now, 12 years later, haunts me from time to time. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There will be certain places, like the Inn in Tanaris that will be particularly painful to see. But I'm coming back for the community. Because it's not just me, but a lot of other people who played the game years ago and I want to talk with them and play with them.
---
Also bars are the only one with a consumable outlet, even if tossing out an Arcane Bomb is the WoW equivalent of tossing a stack of hundreds in the air.
---
You mean what. Not how. 
---
Deposits aren’t lost unless it doesn’t sell.
---
Ah true. I hadn’t heard of that. 
---
I dunno about gold, but I know there used to be a way to power level. I just don't know if it was nerfed in vanilla though.
---
The set up was something like 2 people in party. The max level gathers the mobs by body pulling, and doing no dmg. The low level aoes all the mobs once the mobs are gathered, the high level player then leaves the group and kills the mobs once they get the kick timer. This allowed the lower level player to get full exp as if they killed the mobs, and not have exp be sucked away by the higher level.
---
How they fixed this was by adding leashes to the mobs, so the whole dungeon couldn't be cleared in a single go. I suspect this is how they nerfed the gold farm, in terms of making it slower to clear the whole place
---
I was working in my late teens and early 20s making $13 an hour. Somehow in about 1.5 years. Living on my own I saved up $17000. That money was used to buy a service truck to start my own business and I had to quit wow while we were ending sunwell in TBC.
---
Still some of the best memories of my life. And yes after I started real life I became very unhappy for about 7 years until I changed careers.
---
It was May of 2005 and I had just gotten to my first duty station in Okinawa, Japan. I saw a bunch of barrack's rooms with their doors open and about 5 guys packed into each room with computer monitors . I was getting introduced to the different Marines and we went from room to room and I noticed everyone was playing the same game. I finally asked a guy what they were playing and he told me it was called WOW. I had been a big PC Gamer and played TFC, CS, SC and Warcraft 2 so i was familiar with Blizzard, but not this game. I got to my room and my roommate was playing WOW. I walked to the PX (couldn't download then) and bought the game. I had some of the best memories of my life playing this game and leveling with about 10 other Marines in the barracks. When we would be at work it's all we talked about and we would stay up until 2am playing. We all had to be up at 5am to go to PT and do it all over again. I lived for this game and I can remember the camaraderie that we shared and how we bonded due in part to the common goal of getting loot. We would raid ZG weekly and had an alliance with a bunch of Australians who were on the same time zone as us for a 20 man. We all played on Uther with the Northern Cross and later on Muradin where we all rolled as different races and characters. I can remember so many nights talking on Ventrillo and thinking how great life was going to be when I got out of the Marines. At 1 time we had 12 Marines in the barracks at max level and would run UBRS, LBRS, ZG and que up together for world pvp and WSG.. It was an amazing part of my life and it kept us out of trouble for the 2 years we were stationed in Okinawa. Once we all rotated out of Okinawa we all went our separate ways in life. A lot of us kept in touch through the game for a few years, but ultimately lost touch. I will never be able to relive the "LAN" parties that we had or the feeling of getting a piece of gear to drop from ZG and hearing the whole first floor barracks go crazy. I loved the community that each realm had. I found out that my roommate fell into drugs after getting out of the Marines and took his life not too long ago. I immediately thought about spending so many hours of our lives on this adventure and immersing ourselves in this fantasy world. I specifically remember duskwood and leveling there with him and discussing how we are gonna come back and kill the skeleton elite who walks around the graveyard 1 day. I got out of the Marines and am happy in life, but there's not a week where I don't think back to all the guys in the 222 on camp foster who I played this game with. The Marines was the best time of my life that I never want to live again. I would love to do it all again but know I won't have the time to be hardcore like I was. 
---
They still do regarding classic, sharding is only in the starting zone, also its to ensure we dont end up with 1k pop servers (cause ever retail player leaves)
---
I thought the rare spawn meta of MoP was really enjoyable. The timers were actually pretty long on them and some of their drops were hotly contested. They also did a shit load of damage and some had 1-shot abilities. It's one of the only things I enjoyed about MoP actually.
---
Thank you! 
---
if reddit hates something then its good, that is my number one rule
---
Just keep the old style of the game, I think polling updates is the best option. Perhaps the community only wants small QOL updates or balance changes. Perhaps we want a whole new raid tier, or perhaps just minor tweaks. Regardless the game needs some sort of update structure or it will surely die.
---
That made me laugh lol
---
We need a dev team that understands what the players want, so that any potential updates can retain the "classic" style of the game, keeping the game dfreh but not turning into retails
---
I’m worried about blizzard listening to the demands of people who “want” classic as is. Not including the scenario of retail “dying”.
---
Graveyard had non elite mobs that dropped stuff as if they were elites.
---
I made about 3k in there one weekend pre Nerf. (This was also before Max instances per hour)
---
So you could clear it 20 times an hour
---
This isn't funny and has typos. 2/10.
---
They could be talking about the doan nerf.  His acerage drop used to net a hefty amount of gold and stealth classes  could easilly just  stealth to him and solo him if you were high enough level. it was easilly the fastest way for stealth classes to farm their mounts back in the day, 
---
I didn't play Legion, but I followed the story.
---
If I'm correct, Argus was a hostile planet populated by demons of the Burning Legion. In that case, it would make sense to have mobs on the footpath.
---
Could we have a pic, please? 
---
Gotcha, I figured the bars would be best. On that note, do you think the limiting factor in making bars is the amount of Arcane Crystals available or the amount of transmute cooldowns? I'm guessing crystals are more rare than Felcloth (and Deeprock Salt, but duh).
---
The mob tagging your referring to was nerfed at the start of WoTLK when athene used to it to cheese lvl 80. Since they are using a legion client however it might not be possible to mob tag anyway just like jumping charge and tauren melee range being huge probably won't be a thing.
---
Soldier 76 has been gay since the beta but not for this reason.
---
Maybe I'm way out of line here, I didn't do Naxx60, but wouldn't you really struggle with Maexxna without druid HoTs???
---
And wherever your server's population settles, it'll only continue to dwindle as the patches progress. You have to think of the initial population hit and the residual population fall-off.
---
With a 2.5k CAP, that's not 2.5k players at all times. You might have 2k concurrent at peak hours until late BWL, but it'll slowly fade as you move to AQ and Naxx. This is supported by every Vanilla sever that's ever existed. 
---
Apparently Ahead of the Curve isn't prestigious anymore.
---
I have to admit that im pretty jealous
---
It have every locations of venders and quests also a bestiary with locations also. Bring back memories.
---
First off I hope it didn't come across as terribly rude peop I get really pissed off thinking about what happened because the community back then was like nothing I've ever seen. I definitely think it can work, obviously it won't be like the old days but there's key factors that'll attract people. What roleplayers need to thrive is workable lore more than anything.   
---
When Cataclysm came the night elf community literally disappeared over night because of how drastically the race changed with the new lore, Blizzard has homogenized quite a lot of the races and made them very boring. Wrath certainly had it's moments but people were able to ignore it because it was mostly contained in the books, Dave Kosak, Knaak and Metzen's stuff following wrath really drove a lot of people off. Just about everyone resents the Alliance turning in to the blue Horde with no real identity, races being humanized etc, King Varian suddenly being a High King of indepedant sovereign states. There's a lot I could touch on but the short of it is the lore became quite unbearable for the 'old guard' after wrath. The old world revamp did a lot of damage too. Many great areas were just ruined. In the original E3 trailers they showed roleplaying off. There was an emphasis on the RPG part. They built it as a world to be explored and interacted with. Cataclysm destroyed a lot of interactable objects, removed a lot of cool things and made the areas with only the PVE in mind. It's hard to explain exactly but before the developers seemed concious that it was a living world not just a way to max level to raid.
---
I honestly think GM's policing is important they don't have to be around 24/7 Blizzard just needs to change the rules to what they were back in the day, zero tolerance, no lenience and have the GMs follow the punishments through. Even if it's tied to the auto report, the new rules aren't fit for purpose. A lot of my friends want to come back to RP in classic most of them play FF14 because the GMs there punish you for breaking the rules. Don't get me wrong we do have a sense of humour its always a laugh to see someone messing around occasionally but most of the trolls, they literally spend months, weeks, 7-9 hours a day harrassing people, disrupting events. Once they know they can get away with it, that there's no consequences, it really gets out of hand.  
---
If you speak to anyone that's ever tried to manage RP-PVP events in current WoW they'll tell you how extreme it can get, we need volunteers from the community to literally camp people to stop them from ganking, they'll come from other realms to disrupt the event and we literally we have to keep counter ganking them just to keep the event running smoothly. Infact on Defias Brotherhood EU a ganking guild specifically moved there to chase roleplayers off the server, most of them came to AD EU because they couldn't get any peace.

No joke, I made $1600 on my account right before TBC launched. That was a lot of money for an 18 y/o. haha

Probably saved my college education too.

Reading your post at night time, 3:30 AM here. It moved me a lot. Although, your story is the exact opposite of mine. For me WoW Classic (Vanilla) was a refugee when I was young, I got bullied, didn't know who to talk to and cried a lot on my own. Diving into the game and the atmosphere it presented was amazing enough to wake another side of me that I needed to get through the parts that was hard. I went back there several times on private servers at different points in my life when I needed it, and it helped me a lot then too. I have the game and the community it brings with it to thank for that.  
---
However now, looking upon the launch of classic, my life is in a much better place. I function well, learnt to deal with panic attacks and anxiety, managed to keep a job for years and an amazing girlfriend. But, to be able to experience the original WoW again. The thing that made my younger years so much better, when I now am at a better place with myself.  I can barely wait to be able to experience that! Bless you, hope the release of classic will give you the peace you need and the time to heal that goes with it. See you in Azeroth!
---
This made me suddenly realize why I don't play many new games anymore. With my limited time I'd rather play something I know. So currently I'm waiting around for Classic, testing some P server stuff, and reading The WoW Diary.
---
Razorgore and vael are two bosses I'd never even try to pug.
---
Mained warlock vanilla-wotlk. Thinking mage this time. The lack of mobility on warlock always bothered me, and you had to sacrifice burst to have any sort of defense in PvP outside of deathcoil -&gt; fear. Too bad SL/SL was really boring to play compared to SM/Ruin or full Destruction... Mage sort of resolves all of this and comes with a ton of other benefits as well like teleportation, food/drink, aoe farming, helpful raid buffs and decurse, and more... it's an obvious choice for me.
---
I played tbc and wrath on an inspiron 1520. Great little laptop that lasted me several years. Vanilla was done with a dell optiplex something or another that everyone owned back then.
---
Duuude, thats gonna help alot!!!!  Good for planning a leveling route i guess
---
God I hate this mindset. Yes, there are significantly better desktops for less money and their displays are typically better as well. But some people have to travel a lot and kind of like to play games while on their trips. Some people don't even travel a lot but they like to have only one computer that they take to school and also use at home.
---
Did you ever hear anything about Cath/Armory being nerfed?
---
And then a few short months later they added cross realm BGs which instantly destroyed the community and turned WARCRAFT into mindless grind against random people from other servers you would never see again.
---
I know those.
---
Not true. Tauren, on the other hand...
---
Relatable about your life and aging in general. I'm now 30 and have started to develop at least some tolerance to my demons, but they're still there.
---
Ages 20-30 seems to be the time where all the latent mental problems breaks loose for those disposed to it, and you realize some things are beyond your control. I become more like my grandfather for each day. Depression and substance abuse runs on his side.
---
Classic can offer maybe the best escape you can think of from reality that can be used to contemplate in your own pace while filling the void many of us have after quitting. I sometimes listen to WoW music at bedtime and it triggers my soft spots immensely. Just the announcement of Classic made me more energetic and it still holds. Come summer.
---
So Hunter is a class I'm strongly considering as my main. I currently have a level 40 Hunter on a private server (cant afford my mount lol) and the leveling process has been *SHOCKINGLY* easy. I knew Hunters were good at leveling, but I didn't know they were *that* good. Once you're past level 10 you're really only going to die to PvP, and if you learn how to manipulate your pet as a second character you can really run amok on some mobs while grinding. Or you can send your pet and go take a shit because the thing is literally that overpowered. Mine can solo 2 or 3 mobs consecutively by himself with no downtime.
---
Thing is, I'm expecting alot of Hunters. And PvP is pretty involved at 60 from all my research. And your rotation is make or break as far as performance in PvE goes, and guilds will certainly be shaving Hunters from 4-6 in MC to 2-3 by the end of AQ. All of that is to say you're going to either make the cut or not, but if you're one of the Hunters to make it to Naxx you seem to ascend to some kind of God tier in PvP. 
---
So from what I understand, if you're a casual player looking to experience the world and have some fun, Hunter is for you. If you're hardcore and want to be on the highest available tier throughout the servers lifespan, or you're willing to go to Rank 14, Hunter is for you. If you want to play semi competitively, dabble in raids and hit Rank 10 in PvP, there are better classes for you to choose than Hunter.
---
I'm personally leaning stronger back towards being a Gnome Warlock at this point.
---
We have a great group of players so far. Looking for some more to fill our roles to help conquer some early release milestones. 
---
Blizzard have become JK Rowling. Announcing a new gay character every time people forget about them. 
---
Next up, roadhog is trans and sombra is jewish
---
The knight that gives you the quest to kill him. “ if I can’t have him nobody can” 
---
No clue. I think in patch 1.3 they added raid timers and the number of instance resets per hour to prevent farming. 
---
I’d pay to see that live 
---
Just make sure to sell all your items to vendor and buy bags when you got the chance 
---
Okay so I'm not going to hand hold you enough to link the valuable items directly, but I am going to give you the skills to find them.
---
Go look at raid guides. Check out the Consumables that the guide considers "required" for certain encounters. Check out those items' ingredients. Farm and/or Buy them until the encounter is available, begin selling your stockpile, and move on to preparing a new stockpile of the next tier's required consumables (if MC is at launch, I'd say start transitioning to the next release patch items at about 2-3 months after launch). 
---
You will end up slowly bleeding off a cheap stockpile of mats into the AH for a significant profit and/or on yourself for raids, avoiding a major expense, all the while farming without much competition. Yes, other people will have this idea, but the vast majority will be too caught up in the rat race for an epic mount and min maxing right out the gate for an easy ass raid, and you may feel behind at first, but after 6 months of being dedicated to farming for tomorrow instead of today you will have enough gold to do whatever you want in the game.
---
TLDR certain items will increase in value exponentially over a server's lifespan, buy up all those items and wait, poof you're rich. I wish IRL investing was so foolproof
---
I loved camping a spot for a rare spawn pet as a hunter
---
You have to *want* to heal to play a healing class in Vanilla, that's for sure. Wanting to be a Shadow Priest that tolerates raiding for the gear and is Holy most of the time, you're going to really be gimping your fun factor.
---
As a shaman the one thing I loved seeing were ret paladins decked in T2 gear with rag hammer. I'd spam that purge button every sec I could just for the lulz. 
---
&gt;So Classicwow, does anyone look forward to playing Classic because it reminds you of the good ol' days of your life? 
---
No, rather the opposite. The reason I'm still struggling with if I should really play classic or not is because I only really play games when I'm having a shitty time. Like right now. Otherwise I tend to have better things to do than sit in front of the computer all day. I tend to have a lot of shitty times though so I'll probably be there when it releases, but maybe not. Hopefully not. 
---
On the other hand, if I'm going to have a shit time anyway at some point then it's great if I have classic to play. So it's not all bad. 
---
It would be a fucking disaster for me. I don't want anything to do with the new animations or spells. 
---
You won't ever get a name you want for your character if you have multiple server clusters. That in itself sucks.
---
This
---
Everything is relativd. That set doesnt look badass because there are a billion badass sets 
---
a Blacksmith?
---
Whichever server Asmongold, Sodapoppin, and Esfand are rolling on. 
---
You don't need to sit all day you could stand also. 
---
Yes pretty much.
---
I had just graduated college and started working full-time as a software engineer in the US.  Basically fifty hour work weeks and ten days of vacation a year.  None of my irl friends had jobs so they could do whatever.  I had to be responsible and go to bed at a reasonable time.  I frequently had to work seventy hour weeks too. Wow was the only way I could socialize on my terms. 
---
Even though now my life is better by every measurable way I'd go back in a second to relieve those days.
---
I've been stressed out about which race to pick.  Do I pick human because that's what I originally picked....do I choose dwarf....or do I go horde with Tauren.  I know I'm playing as a prot warrior though.
---
How is Ahead of the Curve prestigious... Since it is for any heroic or mythic to people that just means that you cared enough to actually be in a heroic or mythic raiding guild and raid that specific raid before it became not worth doing unless you were just getting gear since it's not current content.
---
Fangore, obviously
---
And as was shown by another video that Star Wars Galaxies was destroyed by Jedi being added to the game.
---
I came from a smaller server called Garithos. Our AQ gate opening had [like two guilds present.](https://youtu.be/Qkr4w3FxAbk?t=16) Nostalgia excluding, I think back on my time there with less excitement than most of the private servers where I've committed time. 
---
But, *lower populations boost your immersion and sense of community!*  Yeah, I knew absolutely everyone on that server, had my rivals and guild beefs. This made the *world* feel incredibly small, unlike a world at all - more like *Village of Warcraft.* 
---
These same people who want 2004 server populations will be the most vocal towards Blizzard when their servers are ghost towns outside peak hours. 
---
There's already a lot as in 2 not counting the locks? Lmao
---
Rogue pretty clearly.  There's lots of other DPS in the game and rogues don't bring anything other than DPS to the table.  Just bring in more DPS warriors and you wouldn't even notice they were gone.
---
Before you make this decision I suggest you watch this vid
---
https://youtu.be/Ev-cy000SaM
---
Or look for someone who is moderately popular so you aren't fighting to log on to your character.
---
That may or may not be the best idea
---
Although i played a Paladin in Vanilla, i never did end game. By the time i hit 60, the majority player base had already moved onto TBC content. So im super looking forward to reliving the glory days of nostalgia, but then also having a fresh raiding experience that will be brand new to me. Cant wait. 
---
Just play a class you will enjoy. Kinda pointless to roll a class just to farm gold as your first priority. 
---
As far as in demand classes go? Tanks early on for sure and they will always be in demand.  But Shamans and duids are by far the lowest played class according to those population stats. 
---
[here's a video showcasing the method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqoXOQHh1wY), and yes, in classic, SM would seem like the best place to do this, a paladin or druid (barkskin+hurricane) tank and a mage could easily bump someone up to level 40 or so.
---
Then again it could just be that most people don't think much of Ahead of the Curve because it wasn't something that only a small number of people successfully did because of what is considered today to be abnormal in terms of goal design for players. Since Ahead of the Curve is just thought of as "oh you did that boss when it was current... If anyone was anyone and they actually like both raiding and WoW then they would have done that too."
---
Pick up everything and vendor
---
Get as many bags as you can early on
---
Make sure to pick up both professions and level them 
---
This. Pretty much always go Loch for a bit after Westfall and before Redridge. Just get the tram and walk 1 zone, it’s nbd. 
---
You should be good to start redridge at 17/18 honestly.
---
&gt; so you aren't fighting to log on to your character.
---
This is why sharding exists.
---
Then how is/was T3 prestigious? If anyone was interested in WoW and raiding, they did Naxx.
---
Not even getting into the fact Naxx was farmable in BC anyways.
---
Yep, pretty much. But he asked. People think they want bad experiences all the time. Look at the idiots who don't want sharding.
---
Yeah, I think you're right.  I made a L1 paladin and was able to xmog in the T2 set.
---
One of the best. You can easily take on 2-3 mobs at lvl 5.
---
Same reason I stick to TV shows I’ve already seen (The Office, Frasier, etc).
---
When you have an hour or two of free time a day, sometimes it’s relaxing to enjoy something you’re familiar with.
---
It’s not illegal, just don’t word your response when you change your mind such that you’re not really admitting that you were wrong or changed your mind. 
---
I’m 30 and I’ve done some shit in my life. I’m an army veteran, a divorcee, a domestic abuse survivor, a suicide survivor, and much much more. 
---
Own your mistakes. It’s scary at first, but if you don’t let them consume you and you do your best to be up front, honest, and keep trying to learn from them and improve, people will really admire you. 
---
Everyone makes mistakes. It’s part of being human, and it’s not really a choice, it’s just how we are. Being petty or not admitting when you have made a mistake though, that IS a choice and people will not react well to that. 
---
When I was in the army one of my battle buddies came up to me after I got reprimanded for showing up to formation late one time and he asked me:
---
 “PFC ——, what’s the most important thing on your uniform?”
---
After thinking for a bit, I responded,
---
“U.S. Army?”
---
“Nope.” He quickly responded,
---
“The American Flag?” I asked...
---
“Wrong. Good guess though.” 
---
“My rank?” I was just shooting in the dark at this point. 
---
He looked me in the eyes and point right at my chest, on the right side, at my name badge. 
---
I was a little confused, but he quickly elaborated:
---
“Your name is the one thing that only you have. If you let yourself be that person that’s unreliable, or dishonest, or cruel, you will quickly tarnish this (while tapping my name badge), and in the end nothing will hurt you more.” 
---
That guy taught me one of the best lessons I ever learned from my term in the Army. 
---
You’re lucky. This is just a website and you’re anonymous and you did nothing too bad, plus I’m a little bored right now and had the spare time to write my thoughts to try and give you advice. You’re just acting a bit abrasive. Be more humble. 
---
Your actions affect you in ways you don’t yet understand. I deeply regret some things I have and haven’t done in my life, and I can never go back and change them no matter how much I wish I could and that eats at me and I will bear that burden until the day I die. 
---
When you’re doing something just ask yourself “Could I end up regretting this?”  
---
You’re smart. Use your imagination. You’d be surprised what a difference it will make. 
---
Mooncloth is always in demand but especially when zg and naxx are released since it's needed for bloodvine and a lot of t3 turn ins. If you can it's always a good idea to have a level 35 alt with tailoring making it on cooldown. Buy felcloth when it's cheap and then sell mooncloth any time the price spikes.
---
I still be watching Frasier non-stop. 
---
A lot of people don't realize that it's hard to fill a 40 man raid and a lot of raid leaders won't give a shit about suboptimal specs - they would prefer to have the raw manpower.
---
Leveling? Probably riding crop or the carrot.
---
At max level? Bloodsail hat!!
---
A fraction of teams beat the release patch and they are usually well geared. People who are about to weather the existing mechanics, before the patch update/nerf that's where the achievement comes in and would eventually be a feat of strength..
---
The only way Classic is really going to feel like back then is if they invent that machine from "Eternal Sunshine" and erase all wow and mmo memories from your brain.
---
Yeah I pretty much have the same experience as you man. We are probably the same age as well
---
How many SOJs is a perfect Shako worth?
---
A lot of things are definitely tied together though. 
---
Take the human zones. While there isn’t a narrative in the sense of WotLK zones and beyond, SW, Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge and Duskwood all relate to each other a lot in the nature of their problems.
---
The resource drain of the 3rd war leads to an undermanning of the outer zones, and corruption within stormwind’s beauracracy, which is why nothing gets done, adventurers are needed, and the Defias are able to become a threat (masons who didn’t get paid for construction work in SW)
---
In Redridge, which is in a terrible situation due to all this, you first learn about the incursions of the Blackrock orcs, who are taking advantage of the lawlessness. They naturally come back up when you get to Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes. Investigating further leads you into Blackrock Mountain, and you find out what the Blackrock orcs and dwarves are up to, what forces they are concealing and worshipping, which leads you into MC. 
---
It’s not all totally disconnected and random
---
Just sort of.
---
I disagree, I don't feel any loss of value because other people can also look badass. I'm not sure why you think you can only look badass if you look better than people around you. That's strange standards for awesomeness you have.
---
The fact that for the people that play Live WoW many didn't actually get themselves to raid until far later in the game's life cycle so to think about the fact that millions of people did indeed clear a version of an instance that was current 14 years ago seems a lot more of an accomplishment to the general playerbase than something which only happened a decade at most ago yet people barely talk of that.
---
Oh yes, carrot is a must have. It's crazy how much that 3% adds up. Luckily as a paladin I will have Pursuit of Justice though.
---
Just curious, how do you farm gold as warrior?
---
Playing on both! Playing a Vanilla server to practice routes, playing on BC incase Classic fails I can hop on that.
---
This is especially for the fact that you compare getting Naxxrammas to getting Ahead of the Curve... Which in of itself is doing a raid before the raid after is current. Nowadays people don't think of a previous raid to be all that of an accomplishment to defeat especially since the Ahead of the Curve achievement has just been used for either getting a mount within the past few years or just a requirement to get into Pickup Groups.
---
easy, this is only done for pve servers
---
left pinky toe in right ear and forearm to the meniscus.
---
I forgot the carrot existed. Everytime I read one of these threads I remember another nugget that made Classic so good.
---
For me it brings back some good things for sure. 
---
I am a bit older than a lot of WoW players as I was just turning 40 and had been playing EQ for years before WoW came out.
---
What made this era special for me, my oldest son was in his early teens and we had what you might say was a typical strained father vs teenage son relationship. He didn't play initially, as I didn't want him to spen too much time online at that age, but he wanted to badly.
---
So as a compromise, I got a second account and let him play so long as he played on my server and I could keep an eye on him. As it turned out, we started playing WSG together and I used my higher level toons to help him gear out some PVP characters and we  ended up starting a twink guild that only did PVP in the 19 and 29 brackets.
---
We had some great times and as it turned out, it was great quality time I got to spend with my son and we still talk out the good old days. I think it really changed our relationship for the better.
---
Can't wait to get back in there.
---
I will never forget how my DK when WOTLK came out ran a single run of MC, and got the bindings and within two weeks of launch had Thunderfury (did any...nvm)
---
Anecdotally I will say they’re very useful in battlegrounds. Utility and flexibility can’t be underrated in dynamic situations like that.
---
Yup. Get it in Tanaris if I remember correctly
---
The correct answer is nostalgia and nothing more. Less guilds downed pre-nerf M'uru than Kel'Thuzad but no one puts that on a pedestal and sighs and thinks fondly of wiping to that shit for weeks.
---
I’m almost sure it’ll be the same elitism on launch, not that it’s wrong though I just grew tired of it like seemingly you did. Hopefully we’ll find likeminded players!
---
I suggest you watch the rare spawn series by Huzzah for some excellent and nostalgic tours of the rare spawns by zone.
---

---
Yeah but if your dick don’t work, I doubt that’s what she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about a real man
---
That 8k pop server is miserable until it drops down to 3k.  I played on a PvP server in Vanilla.  On Nost, as soon as the PvE server opened, I transferred over and started from scratch, because there was no way in hell I could level a warrior on the PvP server.  Or most classes of alts, for that matter.  I will never again play on a PvP server that overcrowded.  I will just go play Heroes III, or D2, or emulate old NES game.  I will go back to my mobile game.  Doesn't matter what I do with that time, but it won't be WoW, because that shit is worse than getting kicked in the dick repeatedly.
---
What? Because the starting zones have a limited number of NPC's and even 100 players per starting zone is catastrophic to getting any progress. 1250 on alliance/4 starting zones = \~300 in a zone. everyone would be stuck waiting hours and hours to kill boars.   
---
The devs were clear that they considered sharding in these areas alone, purely to allow people to get through and actually play the zones.  
---
With that, people still on the "no change" train feel they'd prefer no sharding here. I disagree with them, but there you go.
---
While this is true for humans, it's not really true for everyone.  Night elves, for example, mostly deal with local corruption and the burning legion; orcs and tauren are mostly concerned with quillboar, undead are fairly isolated, and so on.
---
What I look at is the dungeons.  Take WotLK:  Everything either had to do with the Blue Dragonflight, Ulduar, or The Lich King.  Three of the four raid tiers primarily focused on the Lich King, in fact.  How many dungeons in Vanilla had nothing to do with any raid?  How many raids had anything to do with each other?
---
Where on there did it say he raided?  
---
Hogger won't jump ship, that's where all the seamen are.
---
If sharding is in the game at launch mage is fine for gold farming. If not, mobs will be far too contested for you to make more cash than any other class for a very long time. Rogue would be better, cause soloing pping dungeons will be viable from day 1. 
---
Applied 
---
Exactly my point. So he is not prepared for Classic WoW.
---
That's the strat! Way more involved than I remember. But that is 100% the one I was thinking of
---
This idea always seemed cool to me. Once you hit 60, you're done with leveling and when TBC released Kara, Mags, Gruul, etc. would all require gear from the previous tiers (BWL, AQ, Naxx) to clear it and so on. That way when new players join the game they'd most likely start at MC again and that way no content is useless, it's always being ran.
---
I think the retail player base will go to other games that are new and fresh. Not everyone wants to turn back the clock, no matter how good it was.

I was in a huge depression during a lot of my play time in WoW, lasted many years. So for me WoW was an escape from reality. Life outside of WoW wasn't much fun, so I certainly won't be playing because of the good ol' days of my life. In many aspects my life is so much better now and I am pretty much happy every day. 
---
Every class has something valuable to contribute to everything from levels 1-60. 
---
Triprunner Dungarees, every time.
---
Also any Wailing Caverns loot.
---
Your post was very touching, and I emphasize with the things you're facing right now.
---
Back in the day, me and my brother would fight over who would use the computer so we could play WoW. We were so competitive with who could progress more. I was 12 and he was 14 at the time. We never raided but we still loved everything about the immersive world that was Azeroth. To this day, 12ish maybe 13 years later we still only talk about WoW. Me and my brother never got along when we were younger but WoW brought us together and it's a bond I share with no one else.
---
Unfortunately, now I'm 24, and I have a 4 year old daughter. I need to be responsible and work constantly, and when I'm not at work, I'm with her. I barely can socialize with my friends, or live a normal life of a 24 year old. Cant hold down a girlfriend (cause no one wants to date a 24 year old with a kid, which I understand), cant really go out with friends, or go on trips like all my friends do. And it's tough because I usually resort to alcohol to cope with this loneliness, which is a slippery slope in of itself. 
---
But, 12 years ago I was lonely too. And I felt out of place like I do now. But back then, I had WoW. I could forget about the social anxiety of being a teenager.
---
Prior to the summer starting WoW, my father died from a heroin overdose that winter so it was a very tough time for me as none of my friends understood what I was going through, but I always had WoW. WoW was there for me through the good and  the bad, and currently I feel like I need an escape, and that's why I'm counting the days til summer so I can have that outlet again.
---
Sorry if this was choppy and a big jumbled up rant, but I emphasize all too well with your post.
---
Quest reward from thousand needles for killing summonable hydra boss in ZF (which is in tanaris).
---
Get a bank alt. You don't want to vendor anything that can be valuable on the AH, and if you want to save time traveling back to the major cities while leveling and keeping your bags clear.
---
It's probably different for everyone. I'm a business owner, and unlike my days as an employee where my worry about the job ended at 5 PM, my job is in my head all the time and I bring it home.
---
Classic WoW (confirmed with Nostalrius) is an avenue to just forget about my work problems and disconnect like nothing else. Hanging out with buds, going to the gym, spending time with my kids: All of this stuff helps. But nothing gives me total serenity the way playing Classic WoW does. It is godsent.

Looking for members of Ruins of Empyrean from the Windrunner server to reunite with
---
I always go rogue in vanilla and I always need the same items:
---
10-20 - Mace from WC/wingblade QR, of the fang greens and blues, rogue mask from west fall 
---
20-30 - outlaw Sabre, sfk rings, trip runner dungarees, frostmaw qr head piece
---
30-40 - STV leather rewards, crafted leather, white bandit mask, sword of omen/vanq blade 
---
40-50 rune of the guard captain, ring from zf qr, blazewind chest piece from the badlands qr and the almighty thrash blade 
---
50-60 BOE shadow craft, pre raid bis 
---
They also added the limit to how many times you can reset a dungeon within an hour (think only 4 resets). I think that was more for rogues stealth to high-level chests in dungeons over and over.
---
I feel like I need to make a video on this or something. There are a LOT of ways to make money in WoW. Grinding solo in the overworld is one of the least efficient, even at the top spots (which were overcamped in vanilla unless you played at odd hours). For any class. For the classes it is efficient for, they have better shit to do in instances, where there is no competition. 
---
However duos, trios, and full groups can be VERY efficient. Two man jump runs of DM, literally perfect for a Shaman+Warrior duo (neither of whom could do it alone). Hell, four Warriors and a Shaman is one of the best instance farming groups of all time for pure speed. Pick an instance with a rare tradeable drop, good cloth drops, and grind it. You'll make plenty.
---
WoW is a social game. You will not do anything efficiently on your own, unless you are good at playing the AH (speaking from experience even this involves developing a network of people who send you mats, behind every successful trader there is a small army of casual mat farmers who don't want the stress of using the AH). 
---
This is why people make a big deal out of Hunter Trib runs, Lasher farming for Mages/Priests/Druids, Mara runs, etc. There are probably less than 10 things in all of vanilla WoW you can efficiently do as a single player to make money and they all involve a specific class, gear, or even spec. But there are hundreds of things you can do that are better then all of them (except playing the AH, which is honestly the best way to make money if you're good at it) IF you do them with other people. 
---
I'll give you an easy example. If groups working together make more money, who would make the most money? Guilds. Specifically, raid guilds. My guild was transparent about this, we had a system where each member was credited with increasing the wealth of the guild and we used it to dispense cosmetic items, consumables, etc., from the guild bank. Despite being very generous with consumable prices, paying for repairs, etc., we had probably close a million gold in value in the guild bank, between actual gold and materials. In TBC we had even more, it was kind of nutty. 
---
TL:DR; Make friends, don't do things solo if you want to be efficient. 
---
A solid choice.
---
PI is the preferred spec for speedruns and farm content. Based on the content schedule presented, you could be PI the majority of your WoW career since early raids will be fairly easy. 
---
Is it possible to change jaina's purple to blue?
---
Legolas it is then?
---
You are welcome.
---
Well there is nothing stopping you from winning it again to get the other reward!
---
Cross realm BGs had pros and cons. Fighting new teams was refreshing. Not sure which I preferred but it's not a black and white issue.
---
I believe the release schedule for all content will be stretched over like 2 years, so this seems like a weird suggestion to me.
---
Belief based on your opinion or based on evidence?  
---
Don't shamans have so (crappy) poison remove totem?
---
I preferred the ranking system not being controlled by a small group of the servers' "top" pvp'rs who also ran a blacklist of players they didn't like.
---
That would be complete belief. Blizzard hasn't said much if anything about classic at all. Other than content is gonna be split into 4 releases. [http://puu.sh/CtR5Y/f9ab7df21d.jpg](http://puu.sh/CtR5Y/f9ab7df21d.jpg)
---
I could see Naxx being released as soon as a year after launch. But since Blizzard said they would support classic as long as retail servers are around, so I think their plan is pretty long-term. Besides by stretching it out they collect more subscription months I suppose.
---
But yeah, just educated guess / opinion. 
---
&gt;That 8k pop server is miserable until it drops down to 3k. I played on a PvP server in Vanilla.
---
You mean 4k. Vanilla servers capped at 4k Its likely you played on one. But yes, we know things are emptier at 4k but we **know people will drop off** thats the point. If you start at 2k after the drop off you have a dead server. Start at 6k or 8k and let it drop from there.
---
Only thing is Ill disagree with you on pop. I was fine on Nost when it dropped to 9k. It was the 15k at the relaunches that was too much for me. People everywhere. But 8k is a long way from 15k.
---
Exactly. This is 100% research-able, and I don't know why the discussion gets thin once we address this. There will be a constant bleed. The higher the pops start at, the more likely the settled pop late in the game will still be healthy.
---
I'm out of the loop. What is soldier 76?
---
What are you talking about? Over the whole planet... what? Thats the case no matter what the number of people online are on a private server. Your argument just points out that we wont have that sort of issue in classic where servers are regional. So give me an 8k pop because it will still be empty overnight when its late in the US anyway.
---
I never had any problem with it and I was playing on a 14k launch day. It was a bit crowded sure but I got the job done in roughly 9 days played.  
---
8k server pop is a perfectly reasonable population. The problem with it is that Org/IF would never survive without sharding because Blizzard's microservers would never have it.  
---
Funny, she doesn't look Druish.
---
I’d quit instantly if any of my characters ever got deleted 
---
I want my Red Defias Mask 
---
It’ll be Glorious 
---
I hope it's stretched out more than it is compressed. I want them to wait until people are *just* about to unsub before they release the next content bucket. We can really savor the content and get good gear from each bucket and go PVP with it for quite awhile, and then do it again on the next bucket.  
---
Even better if you can get someone to run you through at level 18 right when you're able to get it.  
---
&gt; whats stopping them doing it during the AQ event
---
They literally VERY SPECIFICALLY said they weren't going to do that.
---
Based on a 6 month life cycle being beyond ridiculous lol.
---
Unless you're horde and looking for a particular little kitty cat.  
---
This. 
---
That's not true. I thought MoP was pretty good in terms of gameplay. It's been my favorite expansion since wrath. Also I'm not talking about the armor, look at the setting, especially the architecture. 
---
Good thing the OP didn't suggest that then.
---
Lol Fresh day
---
I would like this information. I don't watch any of these streamers and never have been able to get a straight answer. What kind of server does "sodapoppin" play on?
---
All the more reason to kill him
---
Lmao jesus man it's bad and needs to be 
---
addressed but how hyperbolic can you get
---
I was on Spinebreaker US for retail Vanilla.  Med pop.  It's doubtful we ever hit 3k concurrent players.  Probably more likely that we floated between 1200-2k, but I didn't track that very carefully and wouldn't trust my memory at this point even if I had.
---
Yeah posers might get upset but truly competitve playwrs would welcome any challenge
---
We should call them "Old Blizzard" from now on, because we all know that current Activision-Blizzard is nothing like the original people in charge.
---
Riding Crop is TBC
---
So what would you do, just release new servers every year and have a bunch of zombie servers? Delete all the progression gear off your characters?
---
It was a thing in vanilla. We don't know if it will be a thing in Classic. 
---
Eh, if you read what he wrote... he said when a new server launches the old one would remain and stay as it is. Then when a new server is launched, the other two merge together. So there would only be 2 servers at any one time. Like a ladder system.
---
Not saying I agree with it just trying to be helpful and correcting this guy.
---
Leveling an orc warrior I will go out of my way to get [Rune of the Guard Captain](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19120)
---
Sul'thraze the Lasher =D always wanted this back in vanilla
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=9372/sulthraze-the-lasher
---
Your role is essentially the same with a few more tools. Basically throwing more renews and pws more often than direct heals. 
---
Go the cookie cutter 31/20 build. 
---
No thanks. Not everyone will be maxing a character and doing all the content in 6 to 12 months.
---
I can't wait for this either! I'm pretty sure every pserver had them wrong as they weren't rare (or elite) at all. Back in vanilla, I was genuinely chuffed when I'd see a rare elite and I'd massively struggle.
---
I just want to play a game I don’t have to relearn every other year. 
---
I don't remember how much played time I had in vanilla, but we raided 4 times a week minimum. So it was a lot. I leveled my alts while farming consumables for raids.
---
After TBC I slowed down. It jist wasn't fun anymore. The game had changed too much.
---
Somewhere at the end of wotlk I quit for good.
---
Vanilla + TBC was somewhere around 450 days played.
---
Few short months? This was 2001.
---
My life sucked when I first played WOW. I was 20 and had just gotten divorced (married hs gf when I joined the air force), so was feeling kind of down. Wasn't interested in being in a relationship at all, so I had no problems with devoting myself to the game. 
---
I actually like the idea of playing with more of a handle on my life. I won't play it to insane unhealthy levels, like when the honor system came out. I actually got an article 15, because I would pull all nights constantly or only sleep for a few. When my boss woke me up during her lunch break, I knew those days had to end.
---
One thing I like that I experienced a tad in the p server scene was people who are more mellow and casual who used to be crazy into the game. It's like riding a bicycle, so these guys are still good, but they are also chill and have great nostalgic stories. Then you see someone screaming in bgs and calling everyone scrubs and laugh at how you used to be exactly like that. 
---
Smart move :)
---
This so much. What's prestigious about putting some pieces of low drop rate gear that you one shot and speed ran the raids today? And once they drop they are yours to keep no exceptions.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't have sold my account.
---
Well, unless it was an obscene amount of cash - probably way more than anyone would be willing to pay. Those insignificant digital characters meant the world to me :)
---
I wish I had taken more videos. We used sapper charges to win a 5 vs 11 against our biggest rival guild while being corpse camped. They were also better than us and would win most fights with even numbers, so it was incredibly epic. It is one of my favorite gaming moments of all time. Maybe the top one. Wish I could watch it again.
---
Ok, I glanced over that part.
---
Well it can be over 2 or 3 years. It can be more than just two rolling servers. But fresh will be needed. It is the single most powerful thing vanilla servers have right now and it provides an oppurtunity to start from the beginning. There must be a balance between not too many fresh servers, thats why I suggested a year, but there also needs to be at some point fresh servers.
---
This game is literally getting re-released so people can experience vanilla wow, it would be so fucking hypocritical to gatekeep fresh servers.
---
Basically this. If I were to put my money on it, I believe the same restriction will be put in place, it was part of the vanilla experience.
---
I mean if you want to buff in raids, there's always Paladin
---
Hunter is a lot better. It's both faster and safer. With warlock, you have to do some really tricky moves to skip that one pack of lizards near the beginning, and if they all happen to roll at their maximum level, it can be nearly impossible. One tiny misstep and you die.
---
Well he is oddly close to Goldshire...
---
The one who stops learning is old. He may be 20 or 80 years old.
---
I dont have time to learn new video games every few months. I have a ton of adult shit to do.
---
This is quite the post. You managed to do everything except actually answer the OP's question.
---
OP - Shaman, just like druids, have a number of viable raiding specs, most of which tend not to too heavily invest in restoration talents. An easy one is 0/30/21 or 30/0/21 which gives you a boat load of combat talents while still giving you natures swiftness for both pve and pvp. They also have a pure 0/5/46 straight up gangster healing spec (which is almost certainly overkill).
---
Never forget that, unlike Druids, will always have a 2h weapon and windfury. No class is screwed outside of a raid, particularly when gear is so much more important than talents. You'll almost certainly collect a damage dealing set and a healing set, so you can switch between the sets as needed. As a final point, Shaman are an absolute joy to raid and pvp with. chain healing is worth its weight in gold in pve and the utility they bring in pvp is a god send. Even though my heart is set on druid, if I had to pick a second, it would be shaman.
---
you'll be fine.
---
You can just take your gear off and die.
---
You can definitely have horde and alliance characters on the same PvP server... if you pay for two subs.
---
I did it with SM/Ruin with blue gear.
---
&gt; I think
---
&gt; for sure
---
Nice try buddy, you’re changing your mind next week. Calling it!
---
&gt; Because crossrealm BG's fixed that.
---
Cross realms didn't fix that iirc. Cross realm or not, you still need a decent premade to get rank 11+ which means you need to get along with top pvp'ers. It's not like you can form a premade with people from other realms and you cannot get r11+ by pugging.
---
You could definitely get to R11+ no-lifing PvP, even in pugs. You couldn't before the change because you had to play ball with premade groups to get invites.
---
Im more or less in the same boat, having pretty much only played rogue. I think having played so extensively jumping back down to a much more limited spells and abilities etc. would be to much of a shock. So I'm going to play a warlock and then maybe level a rogue alt/twink once I've adjusted to the vanilla style of play.
---
TLDR: I don't want to play a rogue with out cloak of shadows/shadowstep
---
Warriors wep Q at lvl 30
---
The boomerang. And the awesome fishing rod. 
---
As a druid, I'm going to remember this, when I level and you all want thorns and hotw.
---
Elemental is great for PvP. It is viable in raids but good luck getting the gear to make it work. You can throw on resto gear and no one will know the difference unless they ask for mana tide.
---
&gt; Yes, not ideal. Still better than a dead server, or any other alternative.
---
And how exactly is it better than sharding? The net amount of inhibited interaction is greater in the type of planned mergers OP is suggesting than it is in the type of sharding Blizzard is planning to use for Classic.
---
&gt;Maybe relevant right when the server merges. But AH prices will increase on average (more money in the economy) and the differences will even out.
---
That does not change the fact that players are set back by the merge and need to do extra work to catch up. You are also ignoring the multiple other issues with merges, such as differences in content progression, faction balance, and social effects (suddenly half the population of the server are complete randoms to you, there are tons of big new guilds, etc).
---
I check for Tidal Charm every time I’m near Arathi Highland. 
---
this thread is so fuckin sad
---
Well apparently you're autistic enough to say all the quality aesthetics are on the store, so...
---
the only pro was to help pve and pvp servers find matches and not have multiple hour long queue times. obviously pve servers rolled alliance and pvp servers went horde so there was usually a faction imbalance. 
---
personally i preferred it when pvp was kept strictly within your own realm. i remember closing in on the tbc expansion, i would be playing arathi basin and see a horde warlock in full t3. first time i saw it but he was on another server. it made the experience so meh. 
---
This "reddit" thing you think exist doesn't exist. It's just a bunch of people discussing Classic WoW and you're a part of it. A hilariously cringy 12 year old part of it, but part of it nonetheless. God damn, bookmark this so you can repost it to /r/blunderyears when you grow up. 
---
I was PI before it was cool.  Most people in the guild didn't even know what it was.  I pretty much made the guild mage my bitch, as long as he kept getting that PI goodness during raids he would do anything for me. 
---
There must always be a F R E S H
---
Definitely the Robes of Arugal. I remember running SFK soooo many times on my warlock back in the day, just hoping they would drop.
---
I say shamans. Never even grouped with one, will not be missed.
---
I recommend switching to PI once you’re about 600 healing power. 
---
Ill give you a good example
---
When I worked at burger king and i recieved a 800 dollar paycheck I was super happy and it felt like a ton of money
---
Last night I cleared $12,000 in the stock market gains for the night and I didnt care because relative to what I compare it to it is not special. The more money you have the less it matters to you. Im literally at the point where it feels like monopoly money.
---
The more mounts there are the less each individual ones matter, the more cool sets the less cool they are
---
No.
---
I'm sick of having to constantly start over again.
---
There's no intensive to push for any big goals, like certain rare mounts or long rep grinds.
---
Stick to the private servers if you want to keep doing MC -&gt; BWL -&gt; ~~AQ40~~ lolnvmImbored -&gt; FRESH
---
I'm lucky to be lvl 40 in a year.
---
Can confirm this.
---
We require all of our Priests to be PI and have since MC.
---
Each Priest has a rostered DPS (usually a Mage but sometimes a Warlock) but it's expected that they cast PI almost on CD.    
---
(Unless there's a boss coming up that's &lt;3mins away or you're not in combat/at the end of combat.)
---
Just off the top of my head, I'd say fastest to slowest would be Mulgore, Tirisfal glades, Durotar. But the differense is really small, and the areas are surprisingly well balanced with type of quests and how long it takes to do them. Main difference imo is path between quests and terrain.
---
Mulgore is a wide open area with only the lake to hinder you, which makes travel in a strainght line possible more often.
---
Tirisfal glades, if you take the right quests at the right time, you can group them by area a bit better.
---
Durotar is an awesome place to start out, but the cliffs and ravines make travel a bit harder.
---
I wouldn't base any picking/choises off of the starting areas though. The difference is just too insignificant.
---
Mulgore and Durotar do have a huge advantage over Tirisfal Glades. Both areas are right up against The Barrens, which is by far surperior to Silerpine Forrest.
---
1) Move to Australia
---
2) Roll on the one of (probably) 2 Oceanic PvP realms
---
50% chance you'll land on the high population server.
---
Orc Warrior called Orcwarrior
---
Yeah every pserver immediately dies as soon as AQ is released. So fun! /s
---
Meh, I had a queue every time on the server I was on, you just logged on before you actually feel like playing, not really a big problem. Get home, log on, have a snack, watch a little TV, then play and remember not to log out.
---
Let's not forget about the gnomes, whose technological level is futuristic science-fiction.
---
This reinforces my view that vanilla was largely just a product of its time, and mostly emulating what they know. Replace Anarchy Online and DAOC in this text with Guild Wars 2 and TESO and of course the designer wouldn't know anything about player familiarity.
---
Crescent staff for most heroes. Lovely.
---
I mained a hunter and ended up as a CL for in a raiding guild. 
---
Everything went great until our dps started lagging in Naxx (maybe AQ40 too, cant remember). I had daily "discussions" with some of the other officers as to why they can't fill up the hunter spots with rogues/warriors. It got to a point where i couldn't justify having more than one or maybe two hunters per raid. I'm not making that mistake again.
---
Think I'll go with mage or warrior this time.
---
Mine are Ironpelt, Nordrassil, and Malorne. There’s also a special place in my heart as well as my logs for Lasherweave’s shoulders
---
Do you vendor the leather?
---
I guess it's got something to do with the "experience" too, but I think it was mostly in place because it would've made it way too easy to spy on/communicate with the opposing faction.
---
Nostalgia train choo choo
---
This and the level 30 robe quest for warlocks, I can’t remember the name..
---
I'm lvl'ing a warlock so yeah I've completed all of them. Indeed the last defias quest included several orange mobs and old murk eye was even red (lvl 20 i think?), but it wasn't that hard.
---

---
Naxxramas was extremely hard until the end of BC. Yes, even for 70s.
---
THAT’S why my hunter would agro some runs and others would be smooth as hell. Good to know.
---
Archeus!
---
Perhaps include Oceanic?
---
And does anybody knows a movie with all the animations of all the classes/races? I realy like to see if there are more hidden gems.
---
Haha
---
Actually in the video I had very few crits. I was a druid after all
---
That clip is from 2.0.

The video was a mixed bag of patches
---
Honestly, I can't wait to stream fishing in classic for hours on end 😆. Quality content right here!
---
Hydrocane [https://classicdb.ch/?item=9452](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9452)
---
Such intrigue! You're right though, have fun with it!
---
The game will almost certainly be released in 1.12 (or rather 1.13+ with even more changes) this ship has already sailed. 
---
Even if they don't add DM at launch, you'll still be playing an easier, streamlined and more balanced game than the vanilla experience. 
---
Yes
---
Honestly with DM being out at launch you will have options as a healer. You can 2 man jump runs. Also can farm lashes. Can also sell runs for gear. Very profitable 
---
This is simply false. There was a rank 13 Warrior on Dunemaul EU who was never in any premade and he got to and stayed on rank 13 for months and months trying to reach rank 14. He never got rank 14, but he did reach and maintain rank 13.
---
The fishing pools didn't come til later.....I'm pretty sure.
---
Lol why are you being downvoted so hard for this
---
Yes, but the human zones are the oldest*, most well designed and generally the most "lore friendly" probably because they have the best (and only) real culture to base things on. The remaining factions are much less fleshed out in this manner.
---
*This might seem paradoxical, but it is because the game was original designed in a much more "RPG" manner. Which is why the human starting zones are heavily interconnected and have a good reason for things happening. The other races are much more fantasy gamey with "kill these bad guys and collect 10 boar asses" type quests. 
---
Herod’s Shoulders for sure. When I first played I remember clearing that dungeon seven times before getting them. It dropped on the first clear but I lost the roll to a Hunter... I remember adding his name to a word document full of every shitty ninja looting, corpse camping, dickhead on the server. 
---
Blizzard triggering homophobes, i like it 
---
No, not at all. I've been playing long enough and I *formed* the Naxx farm group on Sargeras during TBC. It only took about 20~ level 70s, but 40 made it an absolute push over. The reason I never took 40 is it would take too long for people to get gear. Around 20 made it not so much of a grind.
---
Where did you get this OP?
---
[Original Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/Remarkable_Tea/comments/ae4oc2/for_the_alliance/)
---
And what if the retailers don't all leave? I'm not saying it's that likely, but what if? Are we then just gonna accept permanent sharding or massive lag?
---
Just put queues on it. Create more servers only if demand stays high. It's not that complicated. People don't have a right to classic anyway, since it's literally a bonus on top of the existing subscription. We'll survive some early days pressure in sure. 
---
Looks like Sco's old ui 
---
The joy for me would be knowing my class from the start. Classic/Vanilla is a game that rewards knowledge and planning ahead.
---
A new class is fun but you’ll be dragging behind and do less dps in raids. I’ll definately have alts trying out new classes, but my main I’ll play a class I know inside and out.
---
Or just connect realms together like on retail. There can be several players with the same name, only difference is you can see the server they are from in the tooltip and stuff like that. 
---
Totally not true. On my disorganized and medium pop server in vanilla, one of the only rank 14 horde players was a solo queuing rogue. We were in the same shitty pve guild together, and this dude would run MC with us after he got rank 14. Granted, he had to no life to do it, but our server didn't even have premades. Im sure other, bigger, more organized servers were consistently running premades and had the kind of hierarchy that you are describing, but it certainly wasn't that way across the board.
---
There are different ways, but it always boils down to the quintessence of the warrior life: team play.
---
\- You can farm DM:E as fury warrior, specifically killing 3 bosses in 11:30min for the whole dungeon. As gear improves and killtimes get shorter, you kill demons elites as well who guard Gromsblood and Dreamfoil and drop Felcloth. I did this on a pserver only yet, but economy was blizzlike. 
---
Your healer (pref shaman) takes enchanting and if favorably if he has herbalism too to pick unguarded herbs. The warrior takes mining to mine the rich thorium mines that are at the end of the dungeon by default. If you do it properly with the healer on discord, you can do 60-100g/hour in MC/ZG/AQ20 gear.
---
\- I found that running strat UD for the over 9000 rogues works very well when reserving unneeded BoPs and Stratholme crates. So you run this dungeon, you just roll on normal greens and BoE blues/epics just like everybody else, but if stuff like Wildheart Kilt or Twilight Void Bracers ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=13528](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13528)) drop, in 99% of the cases nobody needs them, because they are utter crap. You now roll need on them and pocket them for tanking the dungeon for them. Doing this in 45min runs can net a lot of gold. The Greater Eternal Essences were 8g at the time.
---
The crates I mentioned can contain Massacre Swords ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=15256](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15256)) which can sell for 15-25g and they always contain greater mana potions and grey stuff. The mana potions sell quite decently and the grey stuff can sell to the vendor for upto 2g, you can imgine that it's coming along nicely.
---
I did it and I sometimes made 80-100g per 45min run. 
---
I mean consider some of these are weapons made of magical materials - swords are pretty light as it is.
---
It’s not complete without a Master Builder’s Shirt.
---
You clearly don't understand how they want to use sharding, sharding is only in starting zones/only for a limited time (less then 1 month). So sharding is used to make the gaming experience better for the AVERAGE player, yes we on here are hardcore and don't want it, because we would rather wait 20 mins to kill 1 mob, atleast some of us. But a guy that didn't play wow 10 years and just thought about "giving it a try" or a retail player, they are not interested in waiting 20 mins for 1 mob. (Look at posts from a few weeks ago i calculated out Valley of trials, it's 20 mins per mob for a 5k pop server)
---
They use sharding to make this experience better, ofc we don't know yet how big the shards is, but we can hope they don't make it empty atleast and just make it "so u can lvl/quests but still feel like their is a lot of people" 
---
"Just put queues one" Their will be queues anyway and not everyone has time to wait for a 3 hour queue, like i said we are the top 1% hardcore players on here, we might not mind but lots of people do.
---
Also sharding solves the issue regarding a lot of retail players quitting etc. So we don't go from 2.5k servers to 1k servers cause all retail players quit, that way they can start it with "5k sharded players" and slowly move to the amount they want on the server. 
---
Crossrealm BGs did not destroy the community. Initially there were battlegroups, with only a few server added together. It did put you together with people you never met, but that wasn't much of an issue with random BGs to be honest. It had minor effects on the community. I felt introducing the LookingForGroup realm-wide chat had much more impact with all the players going ape-shit over it in the first few days. And looking down at it from this far that didn't have much effect either compared to other things that ruined WoW.
---
Thanks!

No, bad idea.

What do you plan on doing with a druid?

No shit
---
My biggest fear is, probably, to end up on a low pop and/or dying server. Stretching the playerbase across dozens (hundreds?) of "blizzlike" servers will definitely lead to some servers being overcrowded when others being empty. 
---
To avoid that, there must be no more than just a handful of servers with no hard population cap during launch to accommodate the initial influx of people. Probably it would be even better if Blizzard used same names as the most popular servers back then in order to spread playerbase more evenly.
---
Yeah everyone just reads what they wanna read
---
Right now, we don't know. There has been no official word or even hints.
---
Personally, I hope not.
---
I've lost Classic to BC once before. I really don't want to end up back on the private servers again.
---
What do you do after you get ctf gear in vanilla? Pvp? What else?

I'm going to stuff my bank twinks full of elemental earth for the aq40 opening.

Open YouTube, type in "Vanilla WoW Animations". [Magic happens.](https://youtu.be/BkyUIIDdjPE) Don't know if special animations are shown though.
---
Getting your bow ruined ?! Care to elaborate ?
---
Blizz said at Blizzcon that Classic will live as long as WoW does, so if retail dies Classic will die too.
---
&gt; WoW Retail actually dying this time around
---
They've been saying that at every expansion for a decade.
---
I don't see retail dying any time soon, subs drop drastically after every new expac but the game as a whole still rakes in billions.
---
Basically the same thing I've been doing for the past 4 years. Start again.
---
But instead of having my account deleted I can do it on an alt.
---
Or if I've got a guild to back me up, try some stupid specs and see just how far we can push the game.
---
Yeah like BG queue dodging! The best thing ever to stay in the game.
---
Started from the bottom... Valonien... ? 
---
It is fun and viable for dungeons. Raids are a different story. 
---
They won’t drop :( glad no one noticed I’m also missing the belt
---
If it's successful in sure we'll get it.
---
Actually their were "words/hints" and it was "Currently we are not making it and have no plans for it, but it's not out of the question for the future" so bassicly they will have to see how classic does before they want to say anything about it :)
---
I'm not sure to understand your point here.
---
Even at cap lvl a green mob will "grant" you experience, you just cannot benefit from it anymore so yes you'll proc spirit trap at cap lvl, that seems obvious.
---
I found that one as well, but I miss the special animations like kick (gnome backflip is one of the best) and more. But thanks for the link!
---
As a hunter, this bow is a must. And it's a quest reward so no crazy grinding or luck is needed [https://classicdb.ch/?item=17753](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17753)
---
And as a bonus the quest is in Maraudon which is the first dungeon really worth doing for loot as a hunter. I love that place.
---
Yeah, its the preferred spec in hardcore guilds. It doesn't even lose much healing from the normal holy spec, but casters will also suck you off for PIs. On some fights when not all healers are needed, you can even just spam Smite on the boss for extra dps.
---
Well following this formulas:
---
Auto Shot damage: SlayingMod\*(AmmoDPS\*WeaponSpeed+RWSMod\*(RAP/14\*WeaponSpeed+Scope+AverageWeaponDamage))
---
Aimed Shot damage: SlayingMod\*(AmmoDPS\*WeaponSpeed+RWSMod\*(RAP/14\*2.8+Scope+AverageWeaponDamage+AimedShotBonus))
---
Multi-Shot damage: BarrageMod\*GSMod\*SlayingMod\*MSCoEff\*(AmmoDPS\*WeaponSpeed+RWSMod\*(RAP/14\*2.8+Scope+AverageWeaponDamage+MultiShotBonus))  
---
We get the following for the top 4:  
---
 1 - Nerubian Slavemaker, 3.2 speed  
---
Best cycle DPS: 599, Full  
---
Worst cycle DPS: 503, Clipped  
---
Auto Shot DPS: 304 (1st)  
---
2 - Ashjre'thul, 3.4 speed  
---
Best cycle DPS: 571, Full  
---
Worst cycle DPS: 491, Clipped  
---
Auto Shot DPS: 283 (9th)  
---
3 - Larvae of the Great Worm, 3.0 speed  
---
Best cycle DPS: 558, Clipped  
---
Worst cycle DPS: 530, Full  
---
Auto Shot DPS: 290 (3rd)  
---
4 - Soulstring, 2.9 speed  
---
Best cycle DPS: 551, Clipped  
---
Worst cycle DPS: 534, Full  
---
Auto Shot DPS: 293 (2nd)   
---
Depending on weapon speed etc. you lose less dps while doing aimed shots and so on.  
---
Just as a simplified example imagine we have flat values of Soulstring doing 500 per shot, while Nerubian does 600. Then going for "aimed - auto - aimed" would lead to the following with quiver and IaotH online. Thats weapon speed \* 0.85 \* 0.7.  
---
Soulstring(Auto,0,Aimed,3,Auto,3,Auto,4.7255,Auto,6.45,Auto,8.1765,Auto,9.93,Aimed,\~13, Auto,13)   
---
500 + 1100 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 500 + 1100 + 500 = 4700 
---
Slavemaker(Auto,0,Aimed,3,Auto,3,Auto,4,904,Auto,6,808,Auto,8.712,Aimed,12,Auto,12)  
---
600 + 1200 + 600 + 600 + 600 + 600 + 1200 + 600 = 6000  
---
And sure, this is super simplified and very likely an almost worst case scenario for Soulstring, but as far as I remember the damage values plastered everywhere were wrong for it anyway. So it's not 60 DPS for soulstring rather than something less. The 60.7 comes from patch 2.0 afaik.
---
  
---
This, and if you got a mage with you then your mana problem aint that high since it would only take arond 5 sec afther a pull to get some mana back for the next pull.
---
Its true that paladins are the worst of the 3 tanks (I dont count shamans but they can tank 5 mans aswell). But i'm gonne be the best of the worst tanking class, and i'm gonne love it :D
---
U mum gay 
---
nps. In that case, my only advice would be to check the WoWhead Classic Dressing Room. Again, not sure if specials are shown, but I do know you can choose from a lot of animations.
---
I am personally going to take skinning and mining as professions for levelling. I'm going to skin and vendor the leathers, vendor everything else that drops. If I get a BoE I usually spam the general chat in the area I'm in, see if anyone wants to buy it for 20s or whatever. If no one wants it after an hour, I'll vendor that too.
---
My ores from mining, I usually save them and store everything in the bank. Then once the market has settled a bit, you can either try selling them on the AH for more gold or use them to level engineering on a twink character, which will be what a lot of people want 200 copper bars for. 
---
I'm doing exactly this on a pserver at the moment and I had around 8 gold by lvl10. It was enough for me to buy a good green wep and I've snowballed nicely from there. I'm lvl25 now sitting on 20+ gold. I am a very slow leveller, so I don't mind wandering off track to pick an ore deposit or skinning wolves for an hour getting my skinning level up. 
---
I like it looks really nice
---
I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry that you think 6 months is enough to clear all the content in Vanilla. I can see 5-10% of the playerbase clearing everything in 2 years.
---
 Thanks for all of these replies! I went to Loch Modan, the lowest quests turned gray when I turned 17 but they were complete when I reached that so no big loss there. Currently some green and yellow quests to complete. Gonna run DM with all quests when I'm 18-19 and proceed to Redridge. 
---
I find it hilarious that I see so many "top 8 class specs!", "all 8 classes fully explained!" and when you click to read there will be a statement like "no paladins though cuz I don't know them". It's such a half job. 
---
Wait. So if I get this right: If retail dies, the ”greedy, money-loving” Blizzard will change Classic to be more like the dead game? I don’t have a major in finance, but that doesn’t sound to smart - business-wise. 
---
Hogger x Gamon
---
Gamon
---
Played on my Macbookair without any issue, you should be good with an IMac
---
What race should I roll as my hunter?
---
Pretty keen on Troll, but I'm more of a fan of the Alliance Faction and towns (love the Darkshire, Ashenvale aesthetic especially). Very conflicted, because I don't want to hate the zones I spend time in when levelling.
---
Will mainly be pve and wpvp
---
You should get [[Skull of Impending Doom](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=4984)] as well.
---
&gt;Use: Increase your run speed by 60% for 10 sec, but deals 100 to 501 damage and drains 100 to 501 mana every 2 seconds.
---
This is one that I always pick up too.
---
&gt;Equip: Allows underwater breathing.
---
As well as [[Azure Silk Belt](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=7052)]
---
&gt;Equip: Increases swim speed by 15%.
---
I know they were definitely in during vanilla. They were probably not in at launch but added in a patch,  can't remember which one
---
I believe it was changes in TBC. I'm positive it wasn't vanilla.
---
Quick answer? No.
---
Even though I loved it, I was raiding hardcore at the time, warriors were at their peak in tanking, and I have good memories, but that's what they are: memories.
---
Just come be a dwarf!
---
Both great classes!
---
True. It's hard to think outside the box when you are in the box. That's why game design really is an actual (underrated) profession.
---
Reminds me of so many good days. Bad time in life pop on wow sink some hours it will be sure to cheer you up not only that the community feel was awesome. Guilds meant something meeting random friends doing instances was awesome can’t wait for classic hopefully the community feel the way I do. 
---
Overwatch character that has been retconed to be gay because Blizzard dont want to talk about the recent happenings in the overwatch scene. 
---
Yes, and some end game BiS came from MC. which is good imho.
---
Ya
---
Sounds like you want to play Night Elf. Most base agility and shadowmeld is fun in wPvP
---
Dragon's Call. My first ever epic. &lt;3

https://classicdb.ch/?item=10847
---
Cruel Barb! 
---
Yoo, thanks, but I’m wondering if addons work the same like “questie” with using a Mac 
---
But everything is Hunter loot isn’t it? Asking for a friend.
---
When has Blizzard EVER aggressively merged servers, patching up populations and stemming population decline? Why would they start now? 
---
People would rather attempt to spoonfeed *Activision Blizzard* desperate tactics on server merges than admit 2004 Pop. Caps are inferior. 
---
Agree with this specc, but if you are on a PvP server, or plan to do any PvP at all I would take 2 points from improved renew and put instead 2 into healing focus. It is also good in dungeons and the few situation in raiding where you have pushbacks.
---
Mate, what's that for a question. Obviously you simply win twice, duh!
---
And what about those annoying Dalaran wizards that block the way to Hillsbrad Foothills in Silverpine Forest.
---
You will most likely be able to use the same AddOns available on retail right now
---
It goes by level req for the item
---
Any Vanilla items can be transmogged at level 1.
---
I'm one of those people who can't decide what to level first.
---
When I first started WoW in vanilla I played together with my best friend on my account. We created a human mage and got to level 30 or so. Then I got bored with the frostbolt spam and decided I wanted something else. I created a Night Elf hunter and leveled that to around level 50 I think. That's the moment TBC hit.
---
In TBC the same friend had his own account and we leveled a warrior paladin combination mostly in dungeons. That's when I noticed I enjoyed tanking on my warrior. So for TBC I mained a Draenei warrior.
---
Most recently I played a paladin to heal some instances on the live servers and I also enjoyed that very much.
---
Therefore I have a list of these classes I'd want to play:
---
- Mage
---
- Hunter
---
- Warrior
---
- Paladin
---
The mage kinda falls off because I'd be bored the same way with frostbolt. The warrior is not the first character I'll level as it becomes way easier to do that with proper gear and therefore support from a max level. So that leaves two options, hunter and paladin.
---
I love the leveling experience as a hunter and it enables me to solo farm everything I need later on. My main issue is that I kinda want my first character to also be the one I mostly play in group content. That's were the hunter lacks, as in raids there won't be a lot of hunter spots. Also I enjoy tanking and healing more in group content.
---
The paladin on the other hand has a way less enjoyable leveling experience, less potential to (solo) farm as far as I remember, but had great options in group play. Also it's kinda nice to get a free mount for your first character. For group content I'd be rolling as healer.
---
Can anyone help me choose between these two classes?
---
PS. I don't PvP, never enjoyed it and never will so I plan on leveling on a PVE or maybe even a RP-normal server.
---
Fascist
---
I can't remember a single occurrence where a non-60 won the competition. Must have been a PvE Server for sure. Level 19 still sounds pretty unreasonable. Even when fishing at the sea you wouldn't be able to move freely around due to monsters having significantly increased aggro range.
---
Only thing I could think of is when these guys had been boosted by their 60 friends to win
---
Yeah, ever saw one of those edgelords tank in vanilla ? Or even group or chat with one? No, that's how self-centered they are! Those guys are just good to stole warrior gear.
---
By ruined I mean down to 0 durability, requiring a repair.  
---
Nefarian in BWL has these random "class calls" every 30 seconds or so, meaning all players of the randomly chosen class gets a punishment - like all druids shift into cat form, warriors enter berzerker stance (including the tanks).  
---
The hunter one destroys the equipped ranged weapon - in that durability goes down to 0. Because of this, you had to unequip your ranged weapon before every class call and keep it unequipped until you see which class is called.  
---
I remember carrying 4 backup weapons, in addition to the regular arrow quiver, pet food.. Bag space was scarce.
---
For me personally PvE is merely a means to acquire OP items to roflstomp people in BG's.
---
I'm looking at you Might of Menithil.
---
My point is. Any issues you have with a temporary high pop on a server are peanuts in comparison to randomly upending the entire economy and merging servers where new people appear literally out of nowhere and end up with 4+ Scarablords on one damn server.
---
Theres no way to argue that mergers are better for community than just having larger server caps. No way in hell. If we are going to merge servers like that then why not just do what they do on live with the terrible server cluster phasing....
---
This is very wrong
---
I think it looks dumb, I prefer The Unstoppable Force
---
Can see 30% of the screen, still topping meters on hodir lmao
---
I've spoken to a couple of people who currently play retail but also have some kind of experience with vanilla.
---
Most of them trashed Classic, cause it was "slow leveling", "too hard", and "endless boring grinding". What I really heard was, "I'm too lazy", "pay-to-win", "I get bored easily".
---
If retail in fact does die out, I don't think Classic will be infected with players demanding things, that where in retail (that they just left).
---
No my lifes great.
---
#1 tip would have to be don't have kids, everyone I know with kids is miserable as fuck most of the time.
---
I could easily expect in the first month, say Jun/Jul this year the population from retail and classic trying our classic might be about say 1m people. But a few months that decreasing to a few 100k. 
---
it's sensible for Blizz to create a structure which copes with that initial influx , but then creates a good way later on.
---
I could be wrong with those numbers of course.
---
I was in SW on my Turtle Mount and apparently you can now buy them off the auction house and it’s ‘no big deal’ :S
---
Uhm well ... nothing prevents you from staying on the endgame Server?
---
I always thought the way OP says is the way to go for Blizzard. Pretty similar to the Diablo season mechanic. Always one endgame/finalized Version and one fresh at a time. When fresh is kinda done, it gets absorbed by the endgame Server and new fresh goes on.
---
Could even improve that by letting the Server go into TBC and ongoing expansions and only copy to the endgame ones.
---
"Tag" boosting was a thing in early vanilla too, lowbie tags an elite, you kill it and they get full solo XP. Not sure if that works in 1.12 client.
---
48's are your worst nightmare. Only pass when they're facing away. Can squeeze by 47/46s for free. Always soulstone for insurance. 
---
Just unlucky mate. We got eye on our first ragnaros kill in vanilla, since that kill was a very early kill too we just borrowed the ingots from other guilds and made the first hammer, pretty sure it was world first too.
---
Transmog is good for the modern game imo.
---
By introducing it they made all quests, dungeons and raids from Vanilla to BfA relevant content again. Without it there is little to reason to go back
---
Got this yesterday :) feelsgoodman
---
My current take is, that I will Play 2 characters in my guild. One being mage, the other Paladin.
---
As I will have vacation for at least 2 weeks on release, my plan is to rush with my Pally to 60 and grind dungeons with friends and guild as protpally (cause stronk in dungeons), while collecting gear for me as holy (or ret if they somehow improve it &gt;.&gt;) and prot gear for our warrior to maintaink raids. Male human it will be for sure ... I dont like dwarves so much and +10% rep yeha! Enchanting (like always on main) and Engineer (pvp!) it will be.
---
For my second char it will be a mage, that I will Level with my best friend when hes online (he prolly wont have vacation). Later on the plan is to have 2 viable raid chars that I can fill in on what is needed. Im not sure about race though ... I absolutly dislike gnomes (damn gnomes!), but that +10% intelegence seems kinda strong for mage. But I just like the male human animations the most. Considering to take Alch/Herb for selfsuply or Tailor/mining for gear and engi farming ...
---
Im happy you have faith in blizzard that they will only use it in the startzones.
---
Sadly i have not.
---
Feels like a catch 22 sometimes when it comes to lgbt characters in media. 
---
Make Soldier being gay a part of his story/personality from the start? “I hate that they make it so obvious for PR points, ‘gay’ shouldn’t be a defining trait.”
---
Don’t focus on it outside of a minor plot point in a story a year later. “I hate that they suddenly decided he was gay for obvious PR points.” 
---
Not saying they planned this or not, just saying there’s no real winning here. 
---
[Icicle Rod](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2950)
---
Went out of my way on a P server on my frostmage for this, kept it until level 42. 
---
12 months...try with 3 years instead. 6-months or 12-onths isn't enough and will force most of the people to either no-life or quit. Also you get progressive release of content, which makes it even worse.
---
I suggest Pally.
---
I actually like the Pally leveling (cons aoe grind), especially when you have a friend with you. When you take some protection gear with you, you can easily farm via aoe grind later on to get Money and stuff. Every dungeon Group wants a Paladin. Blessings, Judgment, Auras, multiple oh shit Buttons ... yeah. Also protpallies are pretty viable in dungeons, if you get bored of healing. And lastly ... free Mount for the win.
---
The number 76 is bad news nowadays.
---
I believe none of the shadowcraft pieces are pre raid bis, might be wrong tho.
---
Many will flood anyway, just as tourists. They don't intend to play, but the WILL cry ALLOT. The first 6 months will be a nightmare.
---
If blizzards budges during these 6 months, in the name of people that don't even care for classic, the game is doomed.
---
Then again, only a fool trusts Activision, so who knows what will happen.
---
Tis why i separated it with a comma.
---
The three boe pieces are great to level from 52-60
---
prove it with a link or my friend won't believe you
---
Carrot on a stick.
---
&gt; And what if the retailers don't all leave? I'm not saying it's that likely, but what if? Are we then just gonna accept permanent sharding or massive lag? This is a very risky, if downright stupid, idea, and everybody knows it. 
---
No, its not risky. If by some MIRACLE absolutely everyone that tried classic wow stays **(This is a stupid hypothetical but Ill humor you)** then use server queues...
---
Done..
---
Why are you acting like this is some hard problem to solve?
---
What you need to avoid is EMPTY servers, not full ones. Full servers have a easy solution. Empty servers cause mergers that eradicate communities.
---
Warriors
---
Everytime I catch him playing wow he's either pvping in arena or doing open world shit with warmode on
---
He's pretty good in pvp and he usually doesn't shy away of fighting off gankers
---
t3 is obtainable
---
&gt;No class is screwed outside of a raid, particularly when gear is so much more important than talents. 
---
Id say holy pally, even with dps gear is pretty fucking worthless. Ofc you can just slow grind lashers for gold, or run 2m DME with warrior. But as solo, you cant do shit (outside lashers).
---
There will be other people that dislike the PVP aspect and there will be people that enjoy it so a mix of player base back in Vanilla I played on a low pop horde on Bronzebeard. Had a good time 7-10 good raiding guilds close knit server I assume some servers will be more populated for one faction but the other faction will still be strong lower pop faction can be slightly better your worth more to guilds then 
---
Just download the windows client as well as the Mac one but drag the WOW app file ( the icon you click to start the game ) across to the windows folder and away you go. I had the same problem. 
---
Thanks :) I'll try that when I get home
---
Yeah but still it's very rare.
---
Still actually quite unsure. 
---
I kinda wanna heal as I want to feel useful in a group or raid. I like Priest, it has lots of healing spells and fun bits like mind control etc. Though I am kinda scared of having too many keybinds due to all the downranking. Either Undead or Dwarf. 
---
Paladin seems like a 'cleaned up' version of priest due to having a lot fewer active healing buttons but at the same time, also seems to be a lot more boring when it comes to levelling and I'm not a big fan of wearing non plate. Would go Dwarf. 
---
Druid is an option because their healing style is simple but I'm really unsure about them in dungeons where I may be required to tank which I am not opposed to, but I feel like it might become awkward when rolling for healing gear as a tank, with another healer in group etc. I love Tauren though and if I could go Tauren Priest/Paladin I would go for one of them in a heartbeat. 
---
\+1 for night elf, although I hate the starting area with a fiery passion.
---
Two refined.
---
Back when Blizzard had solid devs before a majority of them left. Same has happened with companies like Valve, it's why we get games completely different than what we have come to expect. They simply don't have the quality staff to pull stuff like this off any more. 
---
I doubt it is even the fault if the staff at the lower levels, it's probably more to do with culture shifts at those companies. Meaning that new devs and designers aren't nutured properly. 
---
Here's another issue, look at all those fan artists that are going to be told to go kill themselves for shipping 76 with any female character, cause they are homophobes or bigots or something, now that the G bomb was so carelessly dropped.
---
Never was 
---
I had the same issue.  I think it's something to do with permissions.
---
Go to the WoW app file in the applications directory.  Right click and show package contents.  There should be a macos folder. Double click on the file in there that looks like an executable/script (it's icon is black), i can't remember what it's called.  The game will start.  You can create a shortcut to this by dragging it to your desktop.
---
That's a clunky solution, imo.
---
Loch modan
---
They’ve been saying it because it has been dying. Subs never really dropped significantly until Cataclysm actually so saying every new xpac isn’t entirely true. 
---
When at its peak WoW had 12 million subs it does take a long time for something that massive to die but starting with cata they began to lose millions each xpac. Rough sub counts- WotLK 12 mil, Cataclysm 10 mil, MoP 8 mil, WoD 6 mil, Legion 4 mil, BFA 2 mil. See the rough trend? 2 mil is still a decent playerbase. My guess is that next expansion is when it’ll really be close to dying based on the sub loss being roughly 2 mil drop every xpac
---
Hunter main forever. I really never got to play rogue past ~30 or so, which is why I will likely go that route for classic. Possibly shaman, which is my other severely underplayed class.
---
&gt; And then a few short months later they added cross realm BGs which instantly destroyed the community and turned WARCRAFT into mindless grind against random people from other servers you would never see again.
---
People like to pick and choose the "values" of the original devs that they liked. The same people that said this, were started approving larger server populations as early as late Vanilla and early TBC.....
---
Literally the same damn developers felt those changes were okay. Along with x-server bgs, flying and more.
---
I would love to be in my original server,  I think you are totally right,  maybe a lot of people make a character and then give up,  It would be really nice to not address the initial rush leaving realms with no 'real'  players, a small amount of realms seems the way. 
---
I am but on an Oceanic server. I think there's only going to be one Oceanic PVE server so I'm not worried about the population dwindling.
---
Also, isn’t Rogue T0.5 one of the better ones?
---
Whirlwind Axe. 
---
I bet 95% of the people aiming to get full bis geared arn't even getting close to it. 
---
There are some spot with no monster and few lvl 60 that pass by to fish, its not that hard for a lvl 19 to win (but it will depend on your luck)
---
You make a good point, but this highly depends if they will allow realm transfers and such in wow classic. You dont want your server to completely die after 6 months with no option to transfer.
---
Im usually a fan of medium pop realms, i think those strike the best balance between economy, raiding guilds, pugging etc.
---
I hope its just addons relative to the time. No fucking crazy shit we have on retail
---
There are plenty of glowing weapons in classic
---
what about tanking twin emperors in aq 40 or banishing/ voidtanking garr adds for instance
---
As far as I know, WotLK was the last expansion that you had to actually work for gear and levels in. And even it was a cake walk compared to vanilla. I quit at the end of wrath and came back at the end of Cata and was shocked. They were handing out epics for 30 minute quests, and pvp gear for a couple BGs. By the end of MoP, when I quit again, I had 2 geared 90s, 3 85 twinks, 2 80 twinks. It was a joke.
---
 If you enjoy working for absolutely everything you have, and even blue gear is something to be proud of, I think you will love playing classic. 
---
Half the player base will raid this time likely 
---
Subs were an important factor in WoW "not dying" only before microtransactions, they're not anymore.
---
People spend a stupid amount of money on the shop and services, that's why revenues are still rising regardless of subs dropping, the game is nowhere near dying.
---
Also there are still a few millions that buy every new expac at full price (60$), why would they care if
---
subs are only 2 mils. after one month when more than 5 mils. pay anyway?
---
People should really put their money when their mouth is, only then I can see the game dying.
---
Vanilla content was not tuned tightly, most any spec is viable. Just not optimal 
---
ExItEt 
---
Yeah they did
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/westofhouse/status/1082394625837428736
---
Excitement level over 9000 here!
---
The amount of flame-whispering lvl 1 characters on private servers shows why this wasn't allowed in vanilla and won't be in classic. 
---
too many people rage-logging after a gank.
---
We don't know if its less than a month do we? AFAIK they never specified or mentioned any time frames, just "limited"
---
I'm okay with sharding as ion spoke about it, but theres real reason for concern which is why the vagueness isn't that healthy for the game
---
Thats not going to work unless you level very slowly. I'd just do as many dungeons as I can.
---
We've had brilliant games recently, from several companies. Like, I get that there are franchises that desperately need help, but it's not like BotW, Mario Odyssey, Horizon, GoW, RDR2, and many more really haven't been amazing. We aren't really short on great games at all
---
Yeah, but thats not going to change. My life is still shit and I'd give everything for a Time-Machine to go back to 1998. 
---
But Vanilla is still a great and fun Game. 
---
&gt; because the horde are most of the time a bunch of kids :P
---
&gt; You feel like a Super Saiyen charging up for battle
---
&gt; Sorry for this low quality shit post :O
---
&gt; forgot about those bouncing boobies!!!
---
Hmmmm, I wonder if you understand my confusion...
---
Well for one pools were introduced in 1.9 and those had a great impact on consumables, theres a chance they keep that in mind
---
I wasn't talking about those companies though, nor was I saying there are absolutely none of the older companies are making good games. However Blizz are giving us Diablo:Immortals and Valve hasn't given us anything good since DotA2.
---
I hope classic brings some joy to your life.. but also bro seek help. Nothing about what you said is healthy.
---
I don’t get how you’re even guessing that. The shop and services has been around for awhile and now there’s less ppl using it so just guessing that’s down too unless you mean to say that the remaining players started using it more in which case I don’t get what reasoning you would use to assume that. 
---
Subs are still going down regardless. There’s less and less ppl that buy each new xpac, there’s less ppl so the cash shop becomes less effective. 
---
Honestly I’m confused on how you think that less ppl doesn’t matter. 
---
I’m not even saying it’ll die soon but it doesn’t take a genius to look at an almost 10 yr decline and not see that at the current rate it has another 2-3 yrs maybe. It’s not like the playerbase i suddenly going to stop that decline and stabilize when Blizzard hasn’t been able to make that happen for yrs now. 
---
My life when I started WoW wasn't all that great.
---
What I'm looking forward to is what I thought WoW was initially going to be. *Permanence*. When Burning Crusade raised the level cap it completely destroyed all of the effort I put in. And Cataclysm destroyed my memories.
---
I play retail and have never strayed from playing the same warrior I played in classic. 14 years of one warrior.
---
However, I'm looking for a fresh experience and will be rolling priest 
---
I’d actually be cool with that tbh 
---
IF you have millions of gold and the patience to snipe BMAH every night for months or even years, then yes. For most players however T3 is basicly unobtainable. 
---
Touché
---
It hardly is prestigious, maybe unless you got it first day / first week. 
---
Lok-tar ogar brother!
---
I like the Classic Dressing Room a lot.
---
Only missing things are the mounts, which they have not added yet. 
---
Still, can't make my choice between Orc and Human. I just love both animation sets so much!
---
[Glacier Stone] (https://www.wowhead.com/item=5815/glacial-stone)
---
No idea if it's actually any good, but I got the weapon doing furbolg quests on both my druids. Same location and everything, or at least I think so. 
---
Since then its been my trademark weapon, always got it mogged in retail. I'm gonna do a third druid for classic, and I'm gonna get it just for traditions sake. Gonna rest in my bank as a trophy. 
---
Plus the model is neat. 
---
Different servers will also generally be at different progression points, specially lower pop servers. Merging means that pvp brackets can get all kinds of fucked and both communities would have to adjust, differences in pve progression also means injecting servers with people at different power points that weren't really accounted for by both communities. Giving up clusters and then merging them is very similar in effect to what the talked about sharding would do, you wouldn't be seeing people that would suddenly show up
---
Why 1998 if I may ask?
---
wish they added more stable slots, feels useless to try and get rare pets otherwise
---
No. Just... no.
---
Not only would it be god awful it would also set an enormous precedence that Activision Blizz would immediately capitalize on with microtransactions
---
Nothing here suggest micro transactions.
---
I’d be okay with it being released on phone as long as it is also available on PC.
---
This item was such a hot topic when running SM back in the day. I remember warriors between levels 35-39 would argue with hunters and shamans in the same bracket over who should get it. Both made good arguments; a warrior will be using plate soon enough and there's a chance they will replace it shortly after hitting 40, whereas a hunter/shaman can't even use the bloody thing UNTIL 40 so they would be rolling on something they can't even use.
---
I can't wait to get caught up in that all over again.
---
Because I was 10 there and would change some decisions.
---
Isn't the crz implementation an aggressive way to merge communities? You're effectively playing with people in the same zone that are from a different server and people *hate* it
---
No. I was a total loner back in the day playing WoW 6-8h a day because I had no life. Just like people playing WoW now 6-8h a day means they have little social life or hobbies other than playing WoW. Which is their good right of course (if it's a choice).
---
I am absolutely glad I have more friends, dates &amp; relationships and sport a lot more now that I am 45 and actually go out a whole lot more to all kinds of things. I never want to go back to my 25-35 period in which I sat in my home behind the PC feeling miserable because I had no friends to go out with and therefore logged in on WoW again because at least that was a fun way to spend my time.
---
but 6 slotters are so useless, you should get them by just leveling and doing quests
---
The argument against sharding is that you don't see everyone. Merging means that suddenly a shitload of population is completely new. I don't see how that is a win
---
The 4 piece bonus procs energy gain, so yes - it's very good.
---
I'm rolling Holy Paladin so - Vestiments of the shifting sands. #PinkDress
---
no
---
No, but i suppose it's possible they pre-emptively nerfed those as wel with the same patchl. They basially just massively reduced how much gold the blues doan dropped sold for.
---
I remember the drop rate to be extremely low.
---
War effort alone can take months on lower pop realms
---
Not in vanilla. Or has my memory gone hazy?  
---
not on private servers but it might be completely different when classic comes out
---
We still have a vent server from the TBC years. People still occasionally drop in and out just to see if we're still around. Its fun.
---
It's quite a lot of inventory space. Being a Nelf Hunter would certainly make it better tho.
---
That end-of-chain-item requiring you to run all over Ashenvale that turns you into a Furborg for a while. 
---
This thing is bonkers. If you can get it as early as possible, for some classes I think it actually makes casting spells a net DPS loss, especially for priest as you pointed out.
---
I remember playing a priest, throwing on PW:S, hitting as many mobs as I could with SW:P and just standing there wanding them all down with this thing and just healing myself at the end. It was a weird way of leveling but damn it was efficient.
---
Lesser/Greater magic wand for any wand user. Absolutely game changers.
---
If that ever happens and they end up doing it cross-platform, then let's say I would have a real blast PvPing with mobile players.
---
All in all, WoW on mobile would be a horrendous idea. You have a lot of spells that can't be fit on the phone screen and trying to chat with your friends for important callouts during combat would also be terrible. No thanks.
---
Playing on a small classic pserver with just 20-50 people online, so basically every rare is there all the time. 
---
Sometimes even annoying if they link 2 mobs together so 1 of them pulls all of them or when the rare is 2 or 3 levels higher and elite or when the rare is hitting 3 times as hard as a normal mob and you only realize it's whacking on you when you see your health drop like a stone.
---
If it can be played with a controller it can be played on phone 
---
Here. I will be horde pve.
---
I think we will be in a minority. But that would be a true vanilla experience. 
---
I'm not worried 
---
True, but learning new video games only takes a very short time, playing thru that new video game is where the time sink comes into play, and the fun starts
---
But that’s okay, nobody is going to make you play it on phone, it would be cross platform in this hypothetical scenario.
---
Delet dis
---
Filthy hordses, we hates them!
---
You always have time.
---
Haven't you read about the 4 stages by Blizzard? 1 year will pretty much be stage 2 maybe the beginning of stage 3 depending on how far Blizzard stretches it.
---
So what you're saying is that we would restart everything when AQ comes out and splitting up the playerbase? I think you're too used to private servers constantly failing and you having to change servers over and over again. Honestly a really dumb idea overall.
---
You gave an orc swords and want an upvote?! *scoff*
---
Everybody that has played BFA and the past 4 expansions WISHES that wow was still what it was back in Vanilla.
---
Unfortunately, classic won't be the same as vanilla but it'll be as close as we're gonna get. 
---
It'll still be a much better and more enjoyable game than the current live version. 
---
Like most others, I've unsubbed for now. BFA isn't a game I want to play. Waiting on Classic. 
---
I have a feeling blizz will be eager to get classic released too so we may get it earlier than expected. I suspect they're wise to the fact that a huge number of players will resub as soon as classic goes live. 
---
You are on reddit, you are a redditor 
---
Specs like 1/20/30 do prove that end-node abilities were badly designed though. 21 and 31 should be corner stones of a spec and THE reason you select one.
---
Your priest one is completely wrong, a disc shadow hybrid is way more efficient until 45 and even then still on par with shadow.
---
I dont need this!
---
Im playing a Shaman! Or was it a druid? 
---
No thats right definitely Warlock!
---
1-1000
---
Because all was simple + no casual shit.
---
same result lmao. with sharding u see people disappearing everyhwere and appearing out of nowhere so how is having two servers made into won the same???
---
When I started playing vanilla in public school, my older brother and all of his friends played horde characters. Troll shamans, troll mages, troll priests, orc warriors, undead rogues, the lot of them all in competitive raiding guilds and gunning for high warlord gear. They all had their professions maxed and epic mounts with gold to float. They were gods.
---
Kids my age and younger all played alliance. They all ran around with a single point in every talent, most not max level, no idea how anything works, spending all of their gold in lump sums on BoE blues for alts they hadn't even made yet. They all wanted to play night elves because their preteen hormones would get sent out of whack by NE female models.
---
I am, so, so glad my brother forced me to play with him and his horde friends. I got the right amount of exposure to the hardcore scene tempered with friendly guidance and it made me fall in love with the game.
---
The only downside is that I always assumed alliance players were children, because in my own experience that wasn't far off-base.
---
Simply impossible with even the limited knowledge we have of the content release. The at war effort alone can take weeks/months. Gearing to clear aq40 another month minimum. That not even considering naxx
---
Since you pluralised and said things such as "Same has happened with companies **like** Valve" (emphasis mine) I took it as a more general thing
---
Sounds like you have to correct mindset for Classic. I bet you'll love it.
---
Do yourself a favor, and enjoy the ride. Don't rush it.
---
The first playthrough is amazing. One of a kind.
---
*Laughs in Druid*
---
Makes zero sense. In some alien timeline, perhaps for retail. But the audience they are currently not targetting but want to target with Classic does not very much overlap with the mobile market. Also, if they want to target the mobile market there are plenty of better games than ones where you're needing 10+ buttons and communication.
---
There would be so much rage if it would be cross platform and you get to UBRS and find out the tank is playing on mobile LOL
---
and will be the reason why classic will fail
---
This jokes quality is equal to the quality of retail WoW.
---
FOUR STRENGTH FOUR STAM LEATHER BELT AHHH OHHH
---
Hey OP you’re the one creating a monster now lol.
---
That's a fairly unique experience for you! I wish there was a way to put all of you people on one server so you could discover it together!
---
Yeah but mentioning games made by Sony and Nintendo (primarily) isn't a good comparison as neither are like Valve. I am talking about companies with services (Steam and Battle.Net) but don't make consoles so a better comparison would be Ubisoft or EA. 
---
Console makers like Sony pump way more money into their games and focus on quality because they want to sell consoles with exclusive titles. 
---
Verigan’s Fist. It’s honestly an overhyped weapon that’s not worth the effort, but it’s cool and I’m not exactly trying to speed level or anything, so...

https://classicdb.ch/?item=11122
---
Except that Vanilla enhance WAS a steaming pile of shit that couldnt do anything at max level....so wtf?
---
Noggenfogger is all I'll need.
---
Let me rephrase, who says he even wants to raid?     
---
I'm gonna echo the guys feeling above, I played the second Nost release and the most recent one. In every single character I made I had full bags without buying them before I left a starting area and most times even before I reached a main city. It feels a lot more common than what I recall, but memory is a strange thing so it can simply be bad memory
---
I think if you could toggle animations/textures for just yourself that would be okay. Sort of like the halo anniversary a few years back, where you could seamlessly switch between updated and vanilla textures. I'd be alright with that, and I think it would be easier to get new people on board and playing classic without being too off-put by the visuals.
---
Maybe making things soul shards stackable? I know people tend to view quality of life fixes as a slippery slope, but things like this really are harmless.
---
Totally disagree. Bag drops rates are insanely increased on private servers. They were rare in vanilla. Having all 16 slot bags was a feat of strength back then.
---
The easiest route initially would be buying bags from vendors. But that will only get you up to 10 slot bags.
---
&gt; The argument against sharding is that you don't see everyone.
---
No one is fucking advocating for sharding. This isn’t fucking sharding. Jesus Christ.
---
&gt; Merging means that suddenly a shitload of population is completely new. I don't see how that is a win
---
New people on a server &lt; Dead Server. Gotcha. Do you camp starting zones and scream at people when they roll on a server as a group bigger than a single new dude?
---
I'm planning priest as well.  My plan for keybinds is use Ctrl and Alt as modifiers.  For example Mouse3 is greater heal mid-rank, but Ctrl+Mouse3 is down rank, and Alt+Mouse3 is max rank.  Just need to test it and see.  Also might buy a Naga mouse...
---
A wonderful tribute to your love of the game, and more importantly, your friends.
---
People enjoy being intentionally stupid... I’ve given up trying to reason with people. Like I enjoy the content on this sub, but half of the fucking people are brain dead.
---
He stated "limited time" because they clearly didn't decide everything yet. Blizcon was like 7-10 months before release, why would they already have decided exactly how long sharding would take place. They most likely wanted to see reaction/feedback regarding it before deciding something like that. But we shouldn't exspect anything longer then a month, ofc it's possible but unlikely. 
---
It's also possible they never say how long sharding will take place because it will depends on how fast people leave the servers. If retail players keep joining for weeks instead of everyone at the start they might keep it "longer" then if not.
---
Those are the fights that remain with you for the rest of your life. 
---
I was a 13 year old brat when I started playing WoW on retail. The years before that, I was an even bigger brat, a child really, that played on a private server which a friend of mine dragged me into. I didn't have a clue of what I was doing,  but I was so impressed by the world my human pally logged into. That serenity of Elwynn Forest, entering Stormwind for the first time, killing ghost wolfs by crossing over onto Duskwood.. Those are some really fond childhood memories. I doubt classic WoW will be able to bring that specific feeling back, due to the position my life was in at that time. I moved to retail with a few friends I made on the private server I was on. We played together via Teamspeak, had a blast enjoying every aspect of the game. Back then, I was in puberty and really did not give a shit about anything, I didn't have a care in the world other than being in time for soccer practice, half assing high school and clearing Karazhan. My life's fine right now, but I guess the feeling I associate with Vanilla WoW reflect that fact that I didn't have anything to worry about back then. Now I do, as life, as it turns out, over the years starts accumulating things you lose sleep over like relationships, paying rent and job interviews. Vanilla was part both of my childhood and me (very) slowly becoming an adult. I doubt Classic WoW will give that carefree feeling back again, but I do very much so look forward to forging ingame friendships again, just like old times, to genuinely enjoy a great game and not having anxiety about anything other than making the top spot in AB.
---
You can put herb on the mage without alchemy. For everything but flasks you could level a twink hunter ti 35 and put alchemy/LW/etc on him. Opening up tailoring on the mage for bloodvine set bonus. 
---
Archmage robe can be used without 300 tailoring. If you do not need engi or tailor on the mage (just farm), go with whatever. 
---
I'm just trusting in what i heard so far and so far we have NO indication of it going beyond starting zones. But it would really suck if they decided to do it in ORG/AQ events or similar :p
---
If Im a rogue.. cutthroat shoulders :)
---
In the latest Dev Watercooler (from the Blizzcon panel) they said that they want to keep the classic experience as authentic as possible, with a "high priority on integrity of social dynamics as this defined WoW classic". This means things like no LFG, 1-hour delays, in mails to incentivize "physical" trades, no unified AH's, and most importantly NO CROSS-REALM GROUPING because they want to put emphasis on realm identity.
---
Please tell me why on earth they would explicitly say they'll never introduce cross-realm grouping in classic because they value recreating the original experience, and then introduce server sharing, a mechanic that is an even further evolution of cross-realm grouping and radically goes against the principle of realm-specific social dynamics. A principle they've said they want to abide by.
---
Yeah, the thing is blizzard might not even know, but they most likely have a good estimate of what will happen :P
---
On a druid, mark of the chosen.

Engineering as a Druid, yay or nay? Does it work?

They also said that they have a big suprise for diablo fans at blizz-con
---
That's your personal problem. I have no problem feeling epic in a great piece of armor just because someone next to me also looks epic. I care about my personal character's growth, not mine relative to everyone else. It's a bit silly that you want less great armor just so you can feel more special in the few pieces thst are great.

Nobody is making you play it that way, but if it was cross platform every player who joins a BG, or gets a raid/dungeon invite while playing on a phone is wasting time for everyone else in the group.

Anduin is totally transgender.
---
Let Blizzard cover the entire plethora of deviation, so they won't be accused of discrimination.
---
I can attest to that. Always roll hunter or druid and hunter 1-10 is way more horrid than druid. On druid I can at least just autowhack / heal to kill 2 mobs at the same time. Hunters have to run if more than 1 is pulled. And you need to annoyingly kite a bit to get that extra shot off and increase your dps a bit. Which sucks. Kiting mobs at lvl 3 sucks. Kiting at lvl 1-10 sucks. It.Sucks.
---
Didn’t even realize this was a thing! I will add this to my frost mage gear list.
---
Azure silk, dreamweave, and frozen wrath gear is all on my list.

Can’t wait to be deep frost again!
---
iirc it's like this:
---
pve realms: extremely heavy alliance bias. I remember census data which put alliance:horde ratio at 12:1 in case of certain servers.
---
pvp realms: just about equal.
---
so... I'd suggest before joining a server permanently, do a /who at peak times and look at the number of players, because deserted servers are quite the possibility. also, census data will surely be available for classic server too.
---
and yeah, undercity can go fuck itself.
---
I have a daughter and I am certainly not miserable. My daughter makes me smile many times every single day. For me she's really special in ways that I can't explain. Every time I hear her laugh, it makes me smile. When I see how she grows up, learns new things, words, every little thing, it's really enjoyable for me. And I really look forward to playing computer games with her in the future, if she's into that.  
---
I'd say it's ok to have kids, just don't start too early with it (especially if you're a man, for woman there's the biological clock which gives a bit less freedom). I got my daughter when I was 35 years old and to me that feels like a good age. If I take good care of myself (eat good food, exercise), it should still be possible to enjoy things together like trips, etc… once my daughter reaches 20 years of age. Another thing to look forward to :)
---
Since you reply to my comment about Naxx I'll assume you are talking about that, in which case you are very wrong. It doesn't matter that people are better at the game, that was never the deciding factor. The problem is the gear you need and how long it takes to get it. Most people won't have to time to get Naxx on farm, which is required to get fully Naxx geared. It will simply not happen to most people.
---
As for other raids, most people will likely get gear from them. Much more so than during vanilla.
---
&gt; To avoid that, there must be no more than just a handful of servers with no hard population cap during launch to accommodate the initial influx of people.
---
If it's so easy you should go and port a game from 14 years ago onto modern architecture and make its handle 20,000 people trying to logg into the same 6 zones inside the same 20 minute period and somehow make the game playable while 3k character fight for the same 35 mobs with a static spawn timer.

Wanna play a lot of pvp, but will be limited to \~10hr playtime per week, on an irregular schedule (hence i can't really raid).

Replace legplates of carnage with titanic leggings for worldbuff set. No real tryhard raids without worldbuffs!

&gt;"Just tune it". That is a ton of extra work for Blizzard that will ultimately result in people just stacking more of the most OP classes 
---
What are those?
---
&gt; Hmmmm, I wonder if you understand my confusion...
---
Actually, I switched sides several times :P
---
Vanilla: Alliance
---
BC to Legion: Horde
---
BfA: Alliance
---
Classic is most certainly gonna be classic as well, to a huge part because I just can't stand the crossroads :D
---
Not even close.
---
The reason is simple, for me. I have been playing MMORPGs since 2002. And I have played at least 20 of them, the most popular ones. Only ONE of them managed to keep me playing it for a period of time comparable to WoW. And that was EvE Online, a very niche game.
---
I come to the conclusion that WoW is the top MMORPG, hands down.
---
However, expansion wise, no expansion even come close to Vanilla, in terms of immersion and community, which for me, are primordial. An MMORPG can have an amazing story, fantastic gear, awesome graphics, or whatever...but if it lacks immersion and community, for me, it's not a game that I will waste time with.
---
Vanilla WoW, with all the ups and downs, was vastly superior to any other expansion (including TBC), hence, superior to any other MMORPG.
---
The Vanilla game design philosophy was constructed on 2 major pillars : immersion and community. Starting TBC, those 2 pillars began eroded, and we are now left with BFA, and those 2 pillars no longer exist.
---
Yep, I'd argue that both sides has both stereotypes... statistically that's probably gonna equal out quite nicely. I've played  on both sides and no matter where i was, the other side ALWAYS won the random BGs and the own side ALWAYS had more kiddies...
---
The quest is obtained in Menethil Harbour in the Wetlands, min req is level 20 so you can nab this very early on :) 
---
I like the idea of fresh servers, however the suggestion itself worded poorly IMO.  
---
The idea is, we don't wanna mess with the existing realms, let people to continue doing the stuff they're on.
---
We also shouldn't do it too often to avoid staff turnover.
---
However, we can open the new realms from the stage 1.
---
I like to start the new class/role from scratch, so I can do all the content from different perspective and not be boosted instead, and there can be no struggle in finding groups for dungeons.
---
And it seems that 80% of the playerbase likes that too. Numbers on the streams and such realms speaks for themselves. 
---
It could be a WIN/WIN both for players and developers *if executed properly.*
---
I disagree with your conclusion. Classic will succeed and will be a great addition to a retail sub. With the guarantee that servers will stay open and characters won't be deleted, something private servers can't promise, many people will enjoy the classic servers for many years.
---
&gt;Perhaps this one department in Activision 
---
Ok, so back when WoW was first made, Blizzard Entertainment (the video game developer studio) was owned by "Vivendi Games". In 2008 Vivendi Games merged with Activision and founded a new company called "Activision Blizzard". Blizzard Entertainment is still just a developer studio doing the same thing it did before, but now owned by a company called "Activision Blizzard". Other companies on the same level as Blizzard Entertainment in that hierarchy is Activision, MLG, and King. 
---
Saying WoW is developed by Activision is just misinformation. Blizzard might be influenced by Activision, sure, but you guys are not exactly being truthful when you say shit like that. 
---
Anyway. I don't care about the microtransactions in WoW tbh, at least not in the shape they are right now (only gold selling and cosmetics). If some people want to throw away real life money instead of farming for a bit they can do that. Gold sellers has always been around anyway, it's just sanctioned by Blizzard this time around. 
---
I'm 100% sure retail won't die any time soon. And I don't think classic WoW will have a particularly strong life in the long run, you guys are overestimating how long legacy servers can keep most people entertained. Only way I can see legacy servers holding a significant playerbase in the long run is if they continue releasing the rest of the expansions, in which case the whole "infection" thing is moot, as that happens anyway. 
---
&gt;That said fishing was never that efficient in terms of gold/hour
---
It was in very early vanilla. They nerfed it into the ground because that's what all the chinese gold farming bots were using.
---
I started playing 2 months before legion launch until about 2 months into bfa when i switch to a private classic server, been enjoying it a lot.
---
So pretty excited for classic.
---
Ah. I have avoided human leveling areas entirely, in order to get exalted darnassus rep on my human mage.

Thanks for the info!

As an extra (im assuming you already know about this) you can obtain this Mage Q item from SM [Icefury Wand](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7514)
---
&gt; Will I know why I am moving from one zone to the next?
---
No, this is a thing made in later expansions where stories ties together. In vanilla you are, as you mention, and adventurer. You get to different zones because your character travels. You then help people around the world. Imagine yourself as a guy traveling the world and help people in return for food, shelter, money or goods.
---
&gt;  Is it setup more like each zone is a short story or does it all build to a final plot?
---
Short stories for the most part. Think of zones as countries. A favourite of mine is Duskwood. There is this whole haunted storyline that explains a tragedy that happened. It doesn't have anything to do with what happens in other zones, it's a problem of this "country".
---
Now, with that said there are often cross zone quests. It's like a real world. The people in Westfall need military help and so they call for help from Stormwind City. This might also tie into Redridge where they also need help, as does Duskwood. Suddenly there is this bigger plot around 4 zones that all need help but doesn't get it. Why is that? Well, I won't spoil.
---
Another way to tie zones together is someone needing certain things from another "country". The guy might have a farm and family and can't travel easily, but *you* on the other hand, you are a working adventurer. So he sends you to another continent to get things for him.
---
Overall, don't think of a linear story like modern WoW, but instead a living world that you, as an adventurer, decides to explore.
---
&gt; However, I want to feel the story
---
Do read quest texts. I've leveled a lot of characters over the years so I don't read them all anymore, but some of my favourite I still read (again, you *have* to try Duskwood). Jeff Kaplan (lead designer of Overwatch) actually made most quests in vanilla and while he likes to joke about the quality of them they do have a lot of great stories.
---
I did get that, and the level 50 frost necklace that looks like an arcane crystal. Forgot what it’s called tho.
---
Delete this! If they see it, they might actually do it! 
---
[This saucy boy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20037) ?
---
I can't decide between Mage or Warlock for PVP only. Won't have time to raid. Which will be the most fun? Also wouldn't mind doing some 5 man's down the line.
---
New players for sure. Also ‘veteran’ players that aren’t really that good anyway, myself included. You got nothing to worry about :)
---
I expect many people who are playing BfA will at least give Classic a try.
---
Sure was a big surprise tho, just not a good one.
---
Yeah but then alliance would complain they lose their pve easy mode blessing.
---
No, it won't be. It never is. Maybe later in a server's lifespan.
---
Elemental is easy to gear all set pieces are damage/healing until t3 and 2.5 sett is awesome elemental gear. You will need to wait a bit for rings and trinkets tho. Problem elemental have is mana you can do good damage in 3-3,5 min if the fight is longer you will have problems.
---
Go on any private server for any expansion and you'll see plenty of new players every day. Most of the people I end up grouping with don't even know what they're supposed with their class.
---
I’d say wow retail will go cross platform with the next expansion without a doubt. 
---

Old comment but wanted to share my pain with you anyway. I remember losing perds blade to a keyboard turner rogue because i was defaulted nightslayer boots when I already had BF boots and it spent enough dkp to be 1 point under the other guy so he won the perds.
---
Never saw Core hound tooth or DFB either in 2 years. The perdition blade was just twice. I was literally a rogue with 7/8 bloodfang and 6/8 nightslayer and still used a lobotomizer and glacial blade till TBC came out.
---
OSRS works great on a touch screen, WoW wouldn't.
---
Yaaaaasssssss
---
If you want a farming class, make a hunter.
---
It's basically guaranteed that the best methods will be only possible with this one class. If trib runs are possible, this alone absolutely eclipses even the next best method.
---
The only way for the game to be truly authentic is for them to follow the original release schedule which they've already said is impossible due to them not having complete game data of WoW 1.1 through 1.11 (whether this is true or not isn't relevant). 
---
While that would be great, I think it's time to embrace the fact that Classic will be different, but that different doesn't have to be bad and that the experience would've been different regardless.
---
That's not necessarily true, if you made a name for yourself in your guild and they weren't a pile of dicks you could do end games. Especially MC was no big deal.
---
In 1.12? Warriors/rogues. They basically have AQ buffs, they never had, because casters later got 16 debuffs and mages could go fire post fire resist bosses. So everyone pretty much got buffed.
---
Like I said, that won't really break it though. I think it will still be challenging enough without all the other nerfs added to it. You could even argue it will result in more 5 man tanks which is a positive.
---
Yes you alone are the only new player that will be excited for it. Every other new player is dreading its release for sure.
---
Oh god, you're right!
---
All leather before Thick and Rugged Leather should be vendored. Those will be worth more on the AH.
---
This blind hope isn't the way to go about it
---
Do YoU gUYs noT hAvE PHoNeS?¿
---
Ahh, the triprunner pants. I remember in vanilla, my brother started several months before me and played a lot more so he knew the game much better. When I mentioned I wanted to do a quest in Gnomer to get pants with 18 agi he didn't believe me. "18 agi at that level? you're crazy"
---
not how it works champ
---
will do brotha
---
They also said that they'll NEVER EVER do classic WoW, so I wouldn't take their word for anything anymore. I'll believe it when I see it.
---
WoW Immortal
---
For real. Treadmill gaming setup
---
I just hit level 15 on NW and still haven't seen a bag drop... Time to find a tailor. 
---
I agree that a Classic that isn't changed or dumbed down too much will be a tremendous success. Dumb it down too much though and Classic simply breaks. Classic doesn't have the mechanics to skill lock people out. It's progression is gear and time locked, which many like myself will argue is superior design as I want to raid with friends, no matter their Dance, Dance Revolution skill. Remove the time and gear progression and you destroy a big part of Classic. Remove the raid and instance releases and you make entire instances pointless and others far too popular at release (Dire Maul).
---
You are taking MANY months of content out with all these changes, which turns the game into more of a gear carousel and the modern game. Vanilla is not a race. Vanilla is about slowly acquiring gear before MC, leveling up crafting (other than tryhards, which won't even have to be tryhards with all the nerfs). Then doing MC, then DM acts as a "catch up" later on as does AV rep rewards.
---
Every change made to Classic simply takes away from it and harms it. Change something enough and it's not the same. That goes with anything.
---
I'd play a mobile version of classic WoW.
---
You guys no have phones?
---
Yes thats a good idea , thank you &lt;3. I guess if i really cant find any decent populated pve horde server ill just join pvp /sad
---
Your argument is the more annoying one, and it's used too much as an argument for any change. People used to use that shit back in the early Halo days, when a change was made that made the game less-realistic, some jackass always had to say 'DUDE YOU'RE FIGHTING ALIENS IN SPACE ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REALISTIC.'
---
Shit, why even have characters then? Let's just all be big globs of glue floating around in space, because after all, this is just a fantasy game. 
---
With the new foldable phones that are coming this can actually work. No need to dumb anything down for it. 
---
Master Anglers have no fear of competition :-)
---
Here’s two working solutions:
---
1.	UI heavy
---
-	Locate your WoW.app file
---
-	Right click, press «Show package contents»
---
-	Go to Contents -&gt; MacOS
---
-	Double click «World of Warcraft»
---
2.	Terminal
---
-	Launch the program «Terminal»
---
-	Run the following (Change the path to be your place for WoW.app)
---
  `cd /Applications/WoW-1.12.1-enUS-Mac/WoW.app/Contents/MacOS/ &amp;&amp; ./World\ of\ Warcraft`
---
What's the logic in thinking this? I guess you can't trust them on anything. They said they're making Classic wow, but hey you have no faith so I'm guessing they're not making Classic, right? It's all a joke.
---
Meh, you don't understand how things work.
---
I played prot Warrior for the entirety of Vanilla. My alts were a lvl 1 banker and lvl 39 rogue twink. Before TBC went live I was one of the richest players on my server.
---
In Classic, I will do take the same path. I won't level a mage/lock/hunter for farming gold...because it's the dumbest way to farm gold.
---
The best ways of making gold in games (including Classic) is CRAFTING PROFESSIONS and playing the AH. Everything else is just waste of time. 
---
Sure, for people that do not understand how things work, farming is the way to make gold. And for them, having a farming character is a must.
---
If you think that in the first 6 months mats and gold are highly desirable...man, you are so wrong. The mats and gold will be much more desirable AFTER the first 6 months. I am not going to tell you why, because, tbh, I don't give free advices on how to make gold in Classic.
---
No u
---
Perhaps, but Legion (and WoD) Enhance was well designed and useful in more that just one raid. And didnt depend on you having to prove yourself. The class was simply better designed.
---
Now I also say that overall classic &gt; retail atm, but this does not hold true for all specs.
---
I could be convinced to run RFD additional times for another shot at [Robes of the Lich](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10762). It's such a monstrous amount of stamina at such a low level.
---
Once I get a mount and can effectively farm some mining nodes, I'll probably spend some time leveling Engineering so I can roll for some [Green Lenses](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10504).
---
That was ages ago. You'll need a premade for classic, people are way more organized now.
---
Keep your enemy close they say :D You infiltrated their ranks!
---
I did join alliance very very briefly at some point during cataclysm, while i can live with the races (i just went dwarf &lt;3), after beeing used to the open space from Og, i just find stormwind and ironforge simply suffocating, especially with no flying. Oh well :)
---
That is sharding. You'll be in shards, you won't see everyone provided that the zone is crowded.
---
I never said dead servers are better, CRZ was an answer for that, do you consider that a win? How about you discuss like a person instead of being an idiot?
---
I don't have a lot of experience with raiding on pservers, but wouldn't most of this be an issue there as well? I mean they are almost all on 1.12, have 16 debuff slots, have 1.12 talents an abilities, and aren't using progressive itemization; which are your biggest arguments. Smaller stuff like spell batching is worth talking about, but I don't think it will have a massive effect and there's not really much blizz can do about it.
---
Pservers have been able to play with this content and not have a problem, I'm not sure I see why it would be different in classic. Even with these changes, it won't be nearly as easy as LFR. LFR is an absolute joke, you can have 1/4 of your group doing nothing or spamming one ability and you'll still faceroll. People will still want guilds, because it's a pain to join up to random PUGs and have to worry about fair loot distribution; as well as wait around for hours while you try to fill 20/40 spots, as well as getting players that very clearly have no idea what to do. It'll be easier, but it's been working OK on private servers, and guilds will totally still be a thing.
---
I highly doubt they are lying. That is why my solutions have nothing to do with that. Blizzard probably simply doesn't know pre nerf values for bosses and some were just plain broken like C'Thun. There were also a lot of exploits in those earlier builds, even if they had them and the work required to fix that would be a pain. 
---
Nost researched all the old item values  and can probably provide Blizzard with all the old itemization. **This is something we should ask in the upcoming Nost interview to be honest.** You aren't guessing like you would with boss health, armor values or damage on their abilities, you are just putting in old values for items on a list. Simple change that would provide a huge uplift in difficulty and retain a lot of the progression of old WoW. 
---
Thanks for doing this post. I agree with everything you said. It disgusts me that people disagree with the facts that you written about.
---
For everyone's benefit, here's a list of nice gear I've compiled. Just to give me something to drool at while bored at work, and help me focus on the most important dungeons for hunters. I will take time to smell the roses on my way to 60 so I expect most of these items (from Dire Maul) to be available when i reach 55+

wtf is this. Every sentence includes a "must" or simliar.
---
1. Blizz does not have to do anything. They make classic happen, which is BIG. Will it be like in the "old days"? Hell no! Will it be good 6 months after release? That remains to be seen, we don't know until we get our hands on it.
---
2. They don't give a F\*\*\* about what people write on Reddit. Neither will they ever consult ther Nost team, ever! Pretty sure they have a feedback forum on their official website.
---
3. They said 1.12 is the only data they have thus that's what they will use. Everything else is a waste of resources and time, and thus money.
---
4. Why do you have a problem with people puging MC or BWL? Only because MC was hard at launch because the game was terribly balanced does not mean we have to relive that.
---
5. Personal opinion from a lock player: I actually like the idea of being brought to a dungeon or raid because I do some DPS instead of being a bot for summoning, imp aura and soul stone...
---
Lemme guess: You are on of those guys that wants to raid as a Nightfall melee shaman or some other bs and you prefer your whole raid doing no dps so the 0 dps you do wont matter?
---
Yeah and I am preparing to get downvoted by you...
---
in endgame T3 content (Naxx) the dps chart will usually look like this:
---
mage &gt; fury warrior &gt; rogue &gt; warlock &gt; all the rest
---
dO yOu GuyS NOt HaVe phOnEs¿?
---
What do you mean?
---
It was hard for me to get behind what they did to the class itself because it seemed like all they did was really dumb it down. I never had an issue back in the day competing for top DPS.
---
I think the enhance shaman stigma we're seeing now is something that has been exaggerated and spiralled out of control.
---
Druid for me, a real nightmare to play against
---
Office UK =  Vanilla WoW
---
Office US = BfA WoW
---
Hunter/mage
---
It's actually 38% more than a half job.
---
And "top 8" means one is excluded.  They should know that going in.
---
WoW has always had click to move, so it'd be perfect, for hunters at least.
---
I would love wow on consoles. 
---
&gt; I've spoken to a couple of people who currently play retail but also have some kind of experience with vanilla.
---
I fit that description. 
---
There really isn't any pay to win in retail WoW. You can buy gold, that's it. But you can't even get particularly good gear with gold, at least not easily (you would have to buy boosts from guilds and stuff like that). And you would still be shit. Any good player can fairly quickly gear up to around your level anyway, where they would easily beat you. You might be able to get slightly better gear than the average player if you have a lot of gold, but it won't be anywhere near good enough that you get a significant advantage over them. 
---
I'm pretty sure gold is mostly bought by people either trying to get rare mounts or shit like that or just lazy people who can't be bothered to farm for consumables for raids/dungeons. 
---
That sounds like sharding with more steps 
---
Sharding is cool in starting zones for a week or two and then it’s back to the struggle. 
---
Did you even read the OP? A PERMANENT merger of two servers. No popping out of existence because there is one fucking world server. How about you learn to fucking read? That would make this whole process a lot easier on those who have to be around you.
---
&gt;  You could even argue warriors being beasts as Fury will result in more 5 man tanks
---
No you couldn't.
---
I hit 60 over Xmas on my first pvt server and there is a severe shortage of warriors willing to tank - most of them wear leather.
---
The tank shortage means warriors and feral druids can reserve the first righteous orb in Strat, I also was recently paid 100g to tank DMW for a Hunter and Pally.
---
The only good thing it offers for night elfs is you don't have to get out of your way to tame an owl.
---
There's nothing really new here that hasn't been posted about 100x already. Classic is going to be great, relax.  Min-max players are always going to steamroll content.  Enjoy.
---
It has nothing to do with sharding.
---
I did read, a permanent merger of 2 communities is still putting a shitload of players together after never interacting with each other, it's essentially the same as sharding as currently proposed. Sharding, as currently talked about, is to prevent the initial load and not there permanently which effectively means that after that initial period eveyrone will be PERMANTENTLY (CAPS!) together. Personally, the latter is seems like the better option to combat the dead servers instead of merging 2 established communites down the line.
---
I wish this was the actual Alliance color-scheme
---
The shards are preconfigured and then you merge. It’s the inverse, but it’s the same. You’re just allergic to the word. 
---
I doubt they would progress every classic server onto BC, they'd likely have some kind of opt-in process or at least open new realms.
---
Mages are good early, warlocks are more gear dependant imo. Although after you start running into t2+ players your gonna have a tough time on either, but I would say mages are much more slippery so you can escape to reinforcements if you get in a bind
---
As I've stated you've got those jerks on either side in pretty similar numbers. Personally I believe that RIGHT NOW WoW is just about finding the right people to play with. The pug-world is just a horrible and terrifying thing to live in.
---
Classic will be the same. Either you surround yourself with people who share your mindset or you'll be doomed and experience something that is far from classic...
---
No, it simply has nothing to do with sharding.
---
“Bodies” by Drowning Pool. Actually a pretty good Nu metal band.
---
Exactly! Scrubs and noobs should look like scrubs and noobs. Forever.
---
What gets me is how big the OW story/universe is or could be and how little they have done with it. We know more about the sexual preference of some characters than we can theorize about the plot development or even some characters! Hammond is a space hamster, but how does he fit into the plot? How is JR and RH related to OW/Talon? Oh but Tracer is lesbian and her boo is named Emily. 
---
The other side to "vendor everything" is to pick up everything.  Just auto loot everything and sort it out at the vendor.  Also get a tooltip mod that tells you which item (when there is a choice) for a quest reward vendors for more.  
---
Oh, the “I was arguing something different, but I’m still right!” Defense. Just fuck off. You don’t know what you’re talking about and it isn’t worth trying to explain it to someone with this willfully stupid.
---
That works for me. Some of the newer OS versions just will not work with the .app, only thru Terminal.
---
The population of classic servers are going to be more of the hardcore and dedicated types. Or rose with unfinished business in classic. 
---
No they aren’t, vanilla classes could easily be played on a phone 
---
Nope, Curse of Recklessness and Curse of Elements are irreplaceable, massive DPS boosts for the raid (also Curse of Shadows assuming you have 3+ locks). At minimum you will need to bring 1-2 locks depending on content and your comp.
---
In fact, the mobs stayed on the path but *still* encountered enemies (the players) on it!
---
Wtf me and 2 friends all had full 6 slots before lvl 12
---
Like a joystick is your mouse? Honestly for pve stuff... to be able to sit on a couch... my god.
---
I'm happy you have faith in Blizzard that they won't be adding (flying mounts|LFR|heirloom gear|level 90 cap|Illidan Stormrage) into Classic. Sadly I have not.
---
 If I even enjoy it. I only have a couple free hours a day. I can't afford to waste them on trash games.
---
Lol, you completely remove the comment before hand and I'm the one "arguing something different" and not knowing what I'm talking about. It's hilarious. Are you sure vanilla wow is for you? Maybe retail would be better since interaction with people is minimal there. Maybe try to follow other people's logic instead of insulting them and you can have a proper conversation with someone, it's not hard I promise.
---
Not sure about phones, but it would work nicely on the Switch.
---
That's completely different. Many people assumed that legacy servers were just a case of digging up an old client and putting it online, and that Blizzard were denying it out of spite because they didn't want to compete with their retail client. This is false. Because they actively built on the old code over the years, there were a lot of technical difficulties with restoring the old client. Even though all the assets were there somewhere, they had to manage not just restoring the old game but running it on a modern client. This means investing time and resources that otherwise go to the main game. 
---
Over the years there were occasional voices asking for the old WoW back out of the previously mentioned assumption, but there was no actual proof that a classic version of the game would be succesful. "You think you do, but you don't" might've become a meme, but they had a point. I love vanilla, but it was an inherently flawed game. Nostalgia and the need to relive the golden days even if you didn't play back then is a key motivation in why people want classic. Questions remain even today about how popular vanilla will be in the long term. What happens when both those player types take off the rose-coloured goggles and realise vanilla has its flaws? What happens when content runs out after two years? Or what about the fact that vanilla players are now in their late 20s to early 40s and no longer have the sheer amount of free time to spend that vanilla requires? Every large pserver legacy project after Nostalrius has followed the same trend: a large population explosion caused by hype, followed by a steady but relatively rapid decline. And those are already hardcore players. Why would an official classic server, which is bound to attract more mainstream attention, be any different.
---
That being said, the succes of private servers was proof enough that however small the niche might be compared to the overall playerbase, there's still enough demand for legacy servers to justify spending the time and resources it demands. In other words Blizzard buckled because it's something the COMMUNITY wanted. They want the authentic experience, that's why they're keeping things like lesser graphics or lighting equations and gameplay mechanics like debuff limits or 20 per sec instead of 1 per 1/10th sec energy regeneration.
---
The social aspect of vanilla was a large part of that authentic experience, they've already acknowledged this. The point of the authentic experience is to attract a different kind of player that is no longer interested in the modern version of the game. Why on earth would they then implement mechanics that pushed those players away in the first place when they clearly have no intention to make classic "modern wow in an old content jacket".
---
Maybe once phones have more mouse and keyboard support. 
---
Lol I quite literally do not have the time.
---
If that was you that joined the discord then welcome!! :) 
---
How would you know if you would enjoy it or it’s trash if you already have a preconceived notion or is not even willing to try something new
---
They do have a problem (Private servers) actually. People reroll to a new server every 6 months. Then again these players are usually a lot better than what we will see on servers which will dwarf their numbers. So while they can do MC in Greens (that doesn't have all the additional nerfs Classic has at this time), that won't be the case with most players. These people have every square inch of Vanilla WoW memorized the way Red Shirt guy knows the lore. 
---
As far as what they do. They do 8 debuffs until 16 came in after the first few tiers. They delay DM because it breaks everything.  I think only Nost did itemization right as it took a ton of time to get right.
---
Private servers usually have late content PVP gear stats as well which breaks things a lot (Classicast had a Nost guy on who said they updated the PvP gear too early which ruined things a lot in their opinion). AV gear being in early can also break things. There is something you have to remember with these private servers though. They are almost exclusively PVP servers. They vast majority all typically reroll when PvP breaks , AKA when people are in full AQ gear and start to get Naxx gear. So while PVE is too easy, they simply don't care. There are no popular PVE servers and no one really cares about doing them right. Nost was the only one that really tried on that front for Vanilla WoW.
---
**The playerbase for Classic is not the playerbase for private servers.** PVE'rs outweigh the "I'm pvp mate"  people in retail WoW and always have. You have to give them something that will be somewhat challenging. For the record I only started PvE to get gear to PVP and the only enjoyment I have ever had raiding is being able to do it with friends who I can chill with on voice com. I just want the experience to be good for players other than myself and I think people need to realize that people loved Vanilla for different reasons. Different kinds of people and players is what makes WoW special. 
---
Most Private servers cater to a very small, insular, specific demographic (which will often pay under the table for that initial power imbalance due to accelerated patches). Nost was an anomaly and Nost also was helped in that their later raid content was in development, which delayed patches artificially and kept people getting to far ahead which is what Vanilla WoW did. 
---
From all of the classic classes Warlock is the one I haven't played yet. Then again I'm also not sure how I feel about the warlock. Currently I'm running in circles between Priest, Mage and Warrior...
---
Exactly I have no idea if I'll even enjoy it so I'm not going to spend my 1-2 hours a day plus the money it costs for the game to find out that a game producer produced a steaming pile of shit. I got a kid and bills to take care of. Extremely limited time and capital.
---
Dont know if its allowed to post Spotify playlists but here is my Drum &amp; Bass playlist ive been working on (and will continue to add untill classic release) If you are like me, and find it calming and relaxing to level and play mmos in general to DNB be my guest and follow the playlist or just pick out the songs you need :) link: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5uqzvE5rYBNWWyiwJImmem](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5uqzvE5rYBNWWyiwJImmem)
---
You can fit a pve rotation on a phone sure, but your movement and reaction time will suffer, you won't have access to all of your abilities, inventory management will be slower, targetting will be slower, in game communication will be slower, classes that have to individually buffing will be massively slower.
---
In pvp on top of all that you simply won't have enough binds to be effective.
---
honestly, I would rather them just buff the content than nerf too much. 16 debuffs sucks enough as it is, being forced to spam shadowbolts even though you have a huge diverse kit.
---
How does this sound?
---
\-Starting with a Mage, getting up to ZG farm. Make this my gold maker.
---
\-Rolling a Paladin to heal, seeing how far it gets me as raid healer.
---
\-Rolling a Warrior if I have time, hopefully get to DPS with him at 60.  
---
I LOVE druid fantasy and night elves.
---
But I like PvP and I feel like druids might be weaker than my alternatives (Priest / Rogue).
---
I'd enjoy rogue but NE doesn't seem viable as a race and I don't have the ability to commit to a raiding schedule, so I feel like my druid or priest would have an easier time gearing up... (Raid invites on the spot)
---
And it seems rogue needs pve gear to do PvP right? Whereas both priest and druid can take the blue PvP set and be viable (I think?).
---
Priest is fine too, might go with priest, but as I said I really like the druid fantasy and as priest I'd have to be dwarf :(
---
Plus, if I don't go rogue I want to go a class that kills rogues, and I think druids can do that well
---
Uuuuuuuuugggghhhhhhhhh
---
&gt;vanilla too, lowbie tags an elite, you kill it and they get full solo XP. Not sure if that works in 1.12 client.
---
It works on private servers. Not sure about live/Classic
---
I think you really nailed it. Blizzard is not thinking about this nearly as hard as your average redditor on r/classicwow 
---
That's a blatant lie tho. You are telling me a company as big as blizzard cannot make the same thing they have made back then? That's wrong. They can make exactly the same thing with less effort then you think. 
---
Good points concerning progressive itemization, but a lot of stuff is blown out of proportion. Private server experience has shown us that even with accurate itemization and gating it behind appropriate patches semi-decent guilds will be clearing it in the span of a couple of hours. The difference between the good guilds vs the alright guilds is whether they clear MC on farm in 30-40 mins vs taking more than 2 hours to do it. I'd say that your point is more accurate with MC loot since in retail vanilla guilds had around 3 months of upgraded loot before BWL got released, but the difference gets a lot bigger if people can start getting this loot at the start and they start overgearing BWL. Probably no one had both Bindings of TF when BWL was released in retail vanilla, but when you've got 6 months of them being able to drop you'll be seeing a lot of TFs right after BWL release.  
---
I do agree with the itemization stuff simply because it provides more content. You have something to look forward to when DM isn't released right away or when MC gets upgraded loot and you have a wide span of upgrades, this links with the content updates too, and is why having stuff like ZG release, 1.8 Silithus farming, etc., is good so people have something new to do every now and again instead of getting it in big chunks.
---
I dont know man. Having played both in retail vanilla and later on N*****lrius that had 15k online at peak hours, I still found myself in a great community with many recognizable characters.
---
I would love it if they went ahead with mega-servers for classic.
---
I would be shocked if we don't get some form of content after Naxx.  People quit when they have no path left to progress their characters.  Blizzard has seen this on numerous occasions during long content droughts (between BT and Sunwell, Between Siege of org and Legion) and at the end of the day they are doing this to keep people subscribed. 
---
I would think TBC would be the easiest and most cost efficient way for them to do this, I would put my money on that if they decide to allow us to progress past the vanilla content. 
---
Mained a Hunter throughout Vanilla but in Classic I will be maining a Mage. Hunters are a great class but imo too strong during leveling that softens the appeal of Classic in my mind. Have a 60 Rogue on a pserver and they are a lot of fun their class fantasy is superb. 
---
I've never multiboxed before, so my info on it is pretty limited. Most of the time I see it done it's with multiple casters, and I feel like positioning multiple melee characters will be challenging. If you're set on two stealth classes, for sure go Druid. Tanking in leveling dungeons should be a bit easier with swipe, and Leader of the Pack is a nice buff for your Rogue. If you want a healer, go Shaman or Paladin depending on faction of course. Healing in leveling dungeons is fairly straightforward and both classes have great buffs for your Rogue and the rest of the group. Best of luck to you.
---
Wow that's nuts. 
---
Do you think it would be tough for you to progress as a tank once you get into BWL/AQ type runs?  I bet at that point you might run into the wall of guilds that have no tank slots open but only DPS, whereas you might not have sufficient DPS gear to break in. 
---
You do realize that if half the server leaves to go play fresh every 6 months then no one will be able to stay because the server will die from lack of population. 
---
Played a Retribution Paladin back in vanilla because I was young, it was my first 3D MMORPG and I had no clue what I was doing. Only made the switch to Holy in TBC when I started properly raiding.
---
I'd rather blow my brains out than play a Retribution Paladin again. Will most likely go Shaman and heal.
---
Have we heard officially that DM is going to be out on release? I agree that it should be delayed, but it came out pretty quickly in patch 1.3. It'll be the difference of maybe a couple months running scholo/strat/ST/BRD instead, so while that gear is a power spike I don't think its going to be as significant as you are saying. Most raiders, especially pugs, wont actually be in full BiS, and will be trying to run MC/ony in a lot of greens. 
---
Pallys don't slow grind lashers though they can kill 2 packs at a time.   I can do 5 lock outs in 15 minutes if I am not herbing. Like the guy above us said killing mobs in the open world is very rarely a good farming strategy compared to other options. 
---
&gt; demand for legacy servers to justify spending the time and resources it demands
---
And I believe Blizzard will follow their heart when it comes to Classic design. If they know that they'll make more money using sharding, there's going to be sharding. I will be very surprised if store mounts will not eventually come to Classic as well. Not at launch, but after a year or two after people have settled in.
---
Exactly... a large amount of this post is alarmist hyperbole. Groups PuGing MC will not “lead to a community as toxic as LFR”. People just need something to scream about, and now the narrative has shifted from “BLIZZARD HASN’T ANNOUNCED ANYTHING!! LFR CONFIRMED!” To making dramatic statements about Debuff limits ruining the experience.
---
Even in 1.1 itemization Pserver guilds were clearing MC insanely quickly, this isn’t something that can be easily remedied. It’s the limitation of early classic design catching up with the present playerbase.
---
Made me audibly kek, thanks
---
the 16 debuff slots, 1.12 content, and progressive itemization parts all come later/are real. not sure what the fuck you're talking about tbh homie.
---
private servers update item stats/models every single patch because they know it affects the game. if blizzard can't manage this when 5 euros in a garage can (and it makes the game 10x better as a result), then yikes
---
Oh and you need to summon him with the gong right? How so you get the hammer?
---
I agree mostly with you which is why I want Blizzard to tune raid content.
---
\- People nowadays dont have 5-15 fps anymore in 40 man raids
---
\- People nowadays dont have 300-500 ms delay on abilities like in vanilla, spell batching will make a big difference
---
\- People nowadays use a lot of helpful addons which make the game much easier
---
\- People have access to so many guides etc.
---
\- 1.12.1 talents are confirmed.
---
\- If the game launches with 1.12 itemization a lot of very good items will be available with minimal effort
---
\- World buffs will be utilized a lot by the players
---
Raids felt epic back in the day because they were also a challenge (because of the points listed above). If they dont retune anything it will be very easy to clear/farm stuff, facerolling and ignoring most mechanics will be possible. I doubt this is in anyones interest because it is not how raiding was back then.
---
I actually don't enjoy tanking and am specced 30 feral / 21 resto - in raids I heal.
---
Most raids I've been in have featured one feral druid, either as an off tank, or cat DPS.
---
Programming isn't magic.  Without the old data, they'd have to recreate the old game data by trial and error.  Which would be a waste of time.
---
It's like saying that a company as big as the BBC should be able to simply recreate the old Doctor Who episodes that were destroyed.
---
Still maining my mage from vanilla in retail, and have continuously after all these years. Going into classic as a warlock now. Similar, but different. 
---
Why in the actual fuck would you want to use a mouse and keyboard on a god damn phone instead of a computer? 
---
The zf hammer is from hinterlands (top of the elite troll area).
---
There’s an add on that supports this and it’s insanely well polished. It blows my mind that so much effort has gone into this by people not being paid to do it. It’s not even hard to setup and supports Xbox/ps4/steam/other controllers.
---
Since retail went downhill I’ve started leveling alts through old zones from the couch on the tv. It’s like playing a whole new game. 
---
Link to a guide for setting it up:

Level 60 rogues would stealth to the last boss in library and kill him, blizzard nerfed the vendor price of the items he dropped to lower the amount of gold they were getting.  Keep in mind this was before the 5 instance per hour cap which was added shortly after Dire Maul.
---
to my knowledge, ele was too mana inefficient to be viable, and enhancement although has strong burst cannot sustain the numbers throughout a boss encounter. I do remember some guilds having max 1 raiding enhancement shaman whose sole purpose was to debff the boss with the 2H axe ( nightmare or something) this would allow casters to do extra damage to the boss. 
---
Mobile PC gaming. On an airplane or in a log trip.

The same thing we do every night Pinky: try to take over the world.

Actually I mained an undead rogue with an undead mage alt and came from Ultima Online where all I did was PvP, where I had a mage and a thief. I always play those classes. I loved characters like Jimmy the Hand and Mat Cauthon and Garet Jax on the rogue side and mages like Raistlin growing up. I also said in my OP they were the two classes that are OP as well, so good luck with that bias claim. I steamrolled people on the mage in blue pvp gear and the rogue had  cutting edge raid gear throughout, which made PvP laughable until later patches. The only shaman spec I personally find interesting is elemental as Tauren, because warstomp allows for some fun combos with firenova, stun, chainlightning shocks, iron grenade lbolt, but I do think it's interesting you want to put people down for a spec or class they play. Nightfall was a pain to craft. If someone puts that kind of work in, I don't see the problem. Enhance Shaman and Ret are about the only two specs I never played in old WoW, whether on retail Vanilla or private, but I'm not going to put down people for playing them. Those specs are there for a reason and those players have as much right to play the game or the class they want as you.
---
Anyways...locks do great damage in dungeons.  The reason you probably didn't get brought to raids or dungeons is because you appear to have social interaction problems, not because you were a warlock. Also you are going to have to summon and stone regardless of patch. Don't like it? I suggest playing another class. You would probably hate making water/food. playing with amplify/dampen, int buff and decursing/CCing though. With hunter you have to tranq shot, trap and kite and they had the hardest rotaton for ranged so I guess that's out to, even though you probably talk trash on hunters to. I highly suggest not playing a rogue or a dps warrior as those spots are very hard to secure without making friends
---
Have fun playing a MMO alone again though. Maybe if you work on improving as a person you would find that the character you have in Classic skyrockets in power and gear as well. Just a thought.
---
To all the enhance shammies out there with Nightfall? You keep doing you. May all your windfury hits be crits. 
---
I reckon if you have the opportunity to use mouse and keyboard you also can use a monitor instead of a phone. Unless you're a lunatic, that is.
---
You will never be able to efficiently play 2 characters at once without some kind of automation(bot) helping you. That goes double for a healer or tank whio has no set rotation and has to adapt on the fly all the time. I would definitely advise against doing this in a group setting where other people are relying on you. Things can really go wrong quickly in a dungeon. 
---
I'm with you as far as not knowing what to play though. Just like you I was a young teen playing a rogue in Vanilla. I've made up my mind to play a caster this time around but the rogue keeps calling out to me. I will probably end up playing both.
---
Druids. They don't offer anything other classes can't except combat rezz and motw.
---
So, a laptop?
---
It just sounds terribly awkward to use to me. Might as well use a small laptop instead.
---
Yes, but also can be your phone after you're done gaming. Everyone with a gaming PC also has a second device to make calls. 
---
I hope they won't, and instead create some new content  but based on classic gameplay/principles. TBC had its good and bad despite being overall ok.
---
It'd be really hard to multi box with classes of such different roles as heal + tank.  I think the druid is by far the most viable partner for you, but Paladin or shaman could be good as well.  Both are decently tanky and offer you a lot of buffs- but the thing is that as a rogue you can't be like.. taking on 2 or 3 mobs at once without taking ludicrous amounts of damage.  I think druid is the best choice for that reason, but it's still definitely an awkward setup.  Druid heals will never go OOM once you get innervate, as you could basically follow yourself stealthed in cat form, then later in a fight once it gets a little hairy pop out, put up hots, and pop into bear or something to sit there.  Can also root adds which is a GREAT cc for small scale PVE. 
---
Still a very awkward thing.  Most effective multiboxing seems to be multiple casters as positioning isn't nearly as important.  Two stealth classes will be quite a challenge. 
---
A lot of people around the world only have a smartphone, no gaming PC or $100 monitor. This technology would have allowed billions of people to access content they otherwise wouldn't be able to access. 
---
Yeah Feral definitely has a role- cool.  That druid spec 0/30/21 or 1/29/21 is so money.   Personally I love 1/29/21 because PVP is my first love so having at least the basic nature's grasp is too good to pass up.  
---
I'm guessing new tbc servers you can copy or transfer your classic character to.
---
But can't answer calls while you're playing games without interrupting everything though.
---
They’re going to use substantially higher caps. 
---
With the expected tourism rate 2500 pop realms are too small. You’ll have SWTOR problems within a month of launch. 
---
Well you could be absolutly right.
---
What I noticed though from playing on multiple different private Servers is that ... People want to restart quite often. Not only in classic, its overall on many games. And having an Option for both These People and the ones that prefer to stay on a finished Server is the way to go in my opinion.
---
One Thing to add though: It heavily depends on the Population and the Hype towards classic. Of course, if you have like 10k People playing on the endgame Server, it mostly wouldnt make sense to split them then via a fresh Server. However, if you have 50k People spread across multiple Server, there would be the Option to merge together different Servers while also creating the new fresh ones. I doubt the endgame Server would really Change (I mean new faces of course and prolly some guild merging but ye) to much.
---
T2.5 doesn't glow either.
---
the glowing stuff is often not even BiS.  
---
its not about power levels, only visuals. there are glowing items even from BRD.  
---
the point is that items with a unique and visually appealing design have a value besides the stats they give. they look special even if they may not be in regards of itemization.
---
They possibly *could*, but it's not as easy as you say. I usually don't address one-off statements like this, but I perceive an opportunity to educate others reading the top comment, so I'll weigh in here.
---
Working in an SaaS environment (software as a sevice, not dissimilar to an MMO), I can say that based on the dev watercooler statements, this simply isn't worth the cost.
---
Realize that the values the OP is talking about *were not backed up*, but overwritten every time a change was made. 
---
This isn't code. 
---
They hadn't previously worked on an MMO of this nature, so the deployment package didn't get conceived of having to save those values. Rookie mistake, but we've all made them.  
---
In our application, we had a similar thing happen when I started working with the company. I'll try to simplify the matter so it's a bit more understandable for the layman, but this is the basic gist:
---
When you write programming code (say Visual or C#), you are writing the *action*, not the framework. Like saying "when a door opens, do this". The specifics of the door were stored in data base tables (Is it red? Does it have a window? Is it locked?). If those specific values (red, yes, no) aren't what's called "hard coded", then it's something you look up in a table.
---
Problem being, if that table says "fuchsia" in patch 1.8 and "red" in patch 1.12, but all you have is the snapshot of 1.12, re-creating "fuchsia" is going to be a nightmare.
---
Now think of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of those. Classic is supposed to be a snapshot of original WOW, preserved for posterity, in a modern client. 
---
That's the technical hurdle. Let's go into product management, which is ROI and all that fun stuff that companies have to pay attention to.
---
There is very little financial incentive for Blizz to re-create hundreds of thousands of bits of information for iterative patches, from scratch, when the absolute value of the product and user-base doesn't equal the number of players of the original product.  
---
As keen as I am to play, I don't see that the value add of that type of progression will affect the majority experience, or prevent them from playing. This is how things end up on the chopping block. If doing iterative patches gains you, say, 10K users - but requires 1,200 hours worth of work to implement - that's not a good value add. If doing patch 1.12 data gets you 90% of the subscribers in happy mode, and they sub for at least one month, that's far more valuable than the spend for 10K users.
---
All of the above numbers are fictional. While Blizz (JAB) has stated he's going to keep the servers up no matter the number of players or how successful it is, the numbers are the key. If this makes loads of profit, progressive servers might be a viable ask in the future. But certainly not at this point in the project.
---
Engineering helps every class.  Druids are the hardest to squeeze value from it because you can’t use items in forms.  It just raises the already high skill ceiling on druids in PvP.
---
Just cuts waste down, by merging multiple devices into one. 
---
Yea I wonder if NWs droprates are lower or the other servers are higher
---
Just like a YouTube video, pauses the content when a call is incoming. And in online games, the call could be ignored. 
---
&gt;I check for Tidal Charm every time I’m near Arathi Highland.
---
I remember the rogue on my server who first started using this in vanilla and that thing gave an extra stun and was crazy 
---
Pally is pretty dumb from 1-7 if you get lucky and get a really slow darkgrey weapon early. With SoCr took 2-3 melee hits to kill a same level mob. Plus with all the armor you get theres never a need to drink/eat. After that is slows down untill you get Conc. 
---
That's so cool thanks for the link. On people not being paid, it reminds me once of this dumbass economist on the radio saying how much hobbies cost our economy per year. Because people are just voluntarily very productive and motivated and if that were work the value it would create. Anyways thats my little bit about hobbies, still very cool though.
---
Hey everybody, I plan on maining arms warrior for doing a lot of world pvp, are there any must have addons when playing this spec?
---
I really don't get this. 20% casting speed for 15 seconds for ONE player. That's like 3k total damage in excellent gear. Thats nothing. I'd rather just take the best possible healing talents. 
---
Sounds like you better have a lot of free time 😁
---
People vastly underestimate how hard content is. On my pserver groups with AQ/Naxx gear still wipe in Strat or DM.... over and over...
---
Indeed, Tear Away is also an excellent song from that Album.
---
Downvote this! If they see it. They may do it
---
I did with no talent points spent, naked, never died, and earned 80 gp/hour. I'm the best!
---
oh boy, gues I'll try even though I may forget a few points.
---
talents:  
---
yes, some classes (lock, druid) were simply broken. and I don't mean that the way this term is usually used. they classes were fucking BROKEN. as in close to unplayable.  
---
the only reason this wasn't a problem in vanilla was that the game was new and exciting.  
---
keep in mind that this shit situation was lasting for about 1y for locks. imagine having this happen today. nope
---
patch:  
---
this one is fairly simple.  
---
you want to have all the nerfs, buffs and fixes in the game. there were made for a reason during vanillas lifetime.  
---
I even believe that further adjustment will not be detrimental to the game experience. I know that #nochanges is what many seemingly prefer, but I truly believe that the game can still evolve in a good way if the devs aren't idiots.
---
itemization:  
---
1.12 itemization is heaps and bound better then early patches.  
---
and with better I don't mean stronger. I mean better. more thought through.  
---
stronger stats are no problem for me, that only means you run MC a week earlier (or w/e) then you would with the old gear.  
---
go raid in greens if that is really a concern to you.
---
DM:  
---
not a problem either. by the time DM was released a large proportion of the playerbase was not even doing MC.  
---
having DM available when you are at the verge of progressing into raids was therefor normal for many, even back then.  
---
debuff limit:  
---
same as itemization it shifts the gear requirement further back as the raid dps increases and bosses get weaker (more/other debuffs).  
---
if the difficulty of MC is what you are anxious about then unquip some gear or do it 20man.  
---
take a chillpill
---
I think having to do this every week would make me miss rogues more than druids.
---
but everyone wants to glow..
---
Progressive itemization is going to be much more work than simply re-balancing the endgame content for 1.12.
---
Thanks a lot, indeed positioning seems like a tough thing.
---
This is 100% possible and you CAN be efficient, but you need to have a ton of keybinds(enough for two sets of abilities) set up and extra bars. Ive done this multiple times, the only problem is that it is mentally exhausting tanking while healing yourself and others at the same time. It is much easier to simply go with 2 ranged dps or two melee dps and set up bindings so that similar abilities have the same types of keybinds. The more effective you want to be, the more keybinds you will want.
---
I would like to find/organize a guild for people who never cleared any high lvl content so we can all find it on our own like plebs.. No guides nothing just the guild
---
Haha someone that shared my struggle. I was 15 when raiding MC and my mom was very strict about playing time in the evening. So I pretended to draw or read at my desk, with my foot on a switch to shut off my monitor whenever she came/was near my room. Never could really enjoy raiding because of this and I am so hyped now as a 26 y/o.
---
I plan to over a long period lol this is like couple years of progress.
---
Most importantly, what timezone are you and when are you planning on playing?
---
All of these solutions are just temporary. Eventually when Naxx is released the servers will be at the 1.12 status anyway and everything will be the same. The servers are going to be up and running for years and years so what happens in the first 6 months really isnt all that important compared to making sure the 
---
MC will be pugged. New characters will grind Dire Maul for gear before hitting MC and then faceroll it and BWL. That's FINE though. Classic isnt about replicating the exact feel of progression else we'd have every patch released in exactly the same order. It's about maintaining a sustainable server that sits on patch 1.12 potentially forever.
---
MC is going to be hellishly easy even with the pre-1.12 items/talents simply because the entire world as a whole has got better at MMOs. 90% of people in the MC raid will have cleared MC before and know all the mechanics. People will understand how raiding works. You can NEVER replicate the "original difficulty" of release MC due to simple knowledge above all.
---
What matters most is that the 1.12 snapshot of WoW is released stable and sustainable. People that want to clear Naxx will form their early raid groups and run MC "properly". Casual people will form pugs. That's fine. Just because casual pugs didnt exist in the first year of Vanilla doesnt mean you should stop them happening.
---
Classic is a "museum", as blizzard have said. It lets people experience WoW prior to any expansions as a museum piece. Maintaining the feel of progression is not something that can viably be done because this is a time-based, transient feel. What matters is the fact that 1.12 exists in a playable state and people can attempt the content however they prefer.
---
A buddy of mine had one on his rogue before CC had diminishing returns. It was disgusting. 
---
Thanks fam, alchemy and tailoring it is.
---
I've found that some guilds are actively looking for classic members on the less-than-legal servers. Might wanna check there.
---
Yes. Here is the slide from Blizzcon.

---
Haha indeed my rogue was a NE called Elfenoir basically BlackElve in french.  
---
I hear when you're talking about having to adapt all the time, that's actually what I loved about the tanking role.  
---
I would imagine except for when I would exclusively play the rogue in a Raid, when tanking having the druid in the main window, the main challenge would be keeping track of my combo points, furthermore when changing targets, while playing the druid but IIRC since spells like taunt or charge for the druid have have a 4sec minimum cooldown, there are some moments when you're just repositioning and switching target with your tank but not doing anything fancy.  
---
As a heal, I guess I would play the rogue as main window switching sometime to the druid for positioning, apart from that having macros to heal specific group target and paying attention to my allies health bars while dpsing.  
---
I do agree that it seems like a lot of multi tasking and a really tough challenge to be effective, without even bringing the kicks, stuns, blinds on the rogue as well as sarments and xxx on the druid.  
---
Writing all this makes me think that having a good guild to run dungeons with would probably be easier in terms of group finding.  
---
Still the question of the leveling speed (since it matters a lot to me in order to get in a good guild early), ease of farming, and multiple profession make me wonder..  
---
Thanks for your answer.
---
I'm gonna begin my search by doing dungeons and saying "you're cool, is your guild looking for more players?"
---
It is gonna be on release, atlest acording to Blizzcon.
---
BUT! Ragnaros didn't die until 1 month after DM was released originally. So time gate raggy 1 month after release of DM and we're getting somewhere! WOOP.
---
Post proof of killing it in quest greens because I smell bullshit
---
My problem with this post? It starts with the assumption that Classic is supposed to be a complete reboot of WoW.
---
It isn't, and it isn't supposed to be. This is as close to a "remastered" game as we are going to get. The content is still going to need to be done. It is still going to take a dozen UBRS runs to get your Pre-BIS shoulders. Some players may stroll into MC in the first month and start steam rolling it. Progression will definitely move faster than it did on the original launch. 
---
But as another commenter said, this post smacks of "alarmist hyperbole". Seriously, SO WHAT if Garr is 7% easier for the first 6 months of Molten Core? Practically no one could do ANY progression when the game was released because of how terribly tuned the classes and the gear was. Molten Core took FOREVER to clear because there were barely any tools available to clear it with!
---
I mean hell, worst case scenario they just throw out some +%hp buffs to bosses if it turns out that indeed, guilds are facerolling through MC in level 50 greens. But it just isn't worth getting all worked up about at this point. 
---
There are already weekly threads here and various Discords. But I'm sure there will be even more as Classic nears release.
---
In any case, I'm building a guild. Very concisely:
---
* No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and find out things ourselves. (This is not to be taken as absolutely absolute and of course veterans are welcome if they are fine with the style.)
---
* Progression. We shouldn't rush, we should enjoy ourselves but in  the end we should see and clear all the content (raids). This will take years. That's fine.
---
* EU, PvE server, Alliance.
---
If you (or anyone else) is interested, just PM me.
---
I will wait for Classic and refresh this subreddit every hour or so until Classic releases and that is final.
---
# Good day, sir.
---
How is having interns change a number in a database, where the leg work has already been done by people at Nost harder than having professionals test raids with different comps etc? How many warriors do you have in the raid? How many rogues?  How many windfury totems? You would basically be asking them to design all new encounters.
---
Where can I apply for this guild?
---
He posted an excellent write up of the issues and pitfalls with recreating Classic - and obviously wants it to succeed. 
---
Your response did not address a single one of the issues he brought up.
---
Please try r/wowservers for private server discussion, including setting up a local client (Rule #1). Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
female dwarfs are ugly but male ones are fine? lol
---
Classic on a tablet could be fun...I'd imagine youd lose PvP for sure
---
Vanilla WoW came out on  November 23, 2004 . Naxx was released June 2006. That is a year and a half. Not "6 months". Accelerating broken content also breaks Vanilla. Vanilla is not a rushed gear carousel.  That is one reason people quit the modern game.
---
Thanks for you answer, the goal would not be to have a pocket healer while leveling otherwise I might just go priest  which is still a possibility but I'm not sure about the efficiency of the combo.   
---
But more having a character with me that allows me to level up at least as fast if not faster than leveling the rogue solo.  
---
The feral druid seemed like a good choice synergising well with the rogue in terms of buff, while being able to tank multiple mobs if I aggro by mistake, and able to heal in combat / in between pulls reducing downtime to a minimum of not zero.  
---
I never thought of the /follow in stealth but as I recall stealthing in BRD being sometimes quite sketchy it would as well be quite a challenge !
---
I got back into OSRS to hold me over for Classic, and I even play the mobile version so I can grind certain things when I’m bored and away from my laptop/desktop.
---
I gotta say, it’s been great and the mobile version is pretty nice. Although, that’s because OSRS is a click-based game. Going from clicking to tapping makes sense.
---
This guy is ridiculous if he thinks Classic would be enjoyable on mobile given is controls. You’d need a simulated analog stick for movement, the camera would basically have to always follow behind you, and you’d have to tap all of the attacks on your screen.
---
ALTHOUGH, if this did happen and we could tell when someone on our friends list and guild was playing on mobile (so we know not to invite them to raids because they’d definitely be a liability), I really wouldn’t mind if this was a thing for the sadists they want to play this way.
---
It would allow for more players who never reach end game (assuming some people literally only play the mobile version), which can actually be important for the economy.
---
It would also allow for easy PVP kills, sometimes. So I’m in support of any possible platform that Classic could be on, so long as Blizzard is up front about any other platform being an inferior way to play that’s only an option for people who don’t have a desktop/laptop or people who want an extra way to play when they can’t access their desktop/laptop.
---
More players, better economy, sometimes easy PVP kills. Doesn’t seem like a terrible idea, just a sadistic desire.
---
&gt; If you have to think this much about food for a pet then boyyyyy vanilla must be a bumpy ride for you.
---
That and catching other pets just to train *myself* new abilities.    
---
A bumpy ride would be running around with a pet that didn't know Bite above Rank 1, or any other abilities at all.
---
It comes with the territory. And it was never just about myself. Buying the appropriate level bullet and arrows is another one. Ran into a hunter that I friended after helping him finish some quests. He was in his 30s for level, still using starter toothpick arrows, and running around with a pet with growl turned off, and the pet didn't know any higher level abilities, because he didn't know about "catch and release" training (hence, needing a wide variety of foods).  Some of the vendors round and about (Crossroads and I think Thousand Needles and so forth) have green-named bows that are better than the lowbie greens of the starter area. Hell, even getting their white-named bows/guns can out-DPS.    
---
He whispered he felt like an idiot and n00b after explaining stuff to him. We had worked on it that afternoon, got things corrected for him... no need to feel dumb. WoW is more complex than, say, Runescape. Everyone starts out new. He was gonna log out and do some reading about the class. Good guy, overall.   
---
 That afternoon was spent helping someone I had just met. I don't consider it a waste of time, nor a bumpy ride. Perhaps he became a better WoW player to everyone he met after that. Think we ran Kara together at the end of TBC, where they had added that one Boss (temporary, no longer in the game) who dropped the two-handed guitar axe.   
---
Would work prett great for paladins too lol, until they hit hostile mob groups 
---
So I'm EST and will begin playing around 5pm my time. I'm assuming that's too late your time!
---
Hahaha so true, I remember just jumping from my chair to my bed pretending to sleep in just half a second.  
---
Eventually I would get caught and slapped but it was well worth it !  
---
Thanks for sharing and 26 is a nice age to get back at wow :)  
---
Those Ls throw new off though
---
Sounds like you just want to go NE druid, my friend. Do it and nuke people on PvP with Starfire.
---
This is a recreation of vanilla, not a recreation of a private server's recreation of vanilla. Exactly 0 leg work has been "done by the people at nost", and blizzard has already stated they don't have all the data for the patches between release and 1.12
---
They need to work with the official data they have. That's why it's easier to just tweak a few numbers in a handful of zones rather than go back and create multiple iterations of hundreds of items and ensure that they're pushed out at appropriate times.
---
Private server and Classic playerbase won't be the same. You also have a rush due to BG's being out right away (won't happen in Classic) and the honor system. There is no patience and warriors just want to get damage gear, Dalrends or their Reaper and start ranking in pvp as well. It's actually disgusting what Private servers have become and their mistakes should be an example of what to avoid.
---
There is always that one paralyzed guy who will level with nothing but his tongue and like his one finger that still move to 60. Stay tuned, Anything is possible. 
---
I remember in BC there were people using an addon to play WoW with a controller. And we made jokes about these people and how we would never bring them to a raid. 
---
Nowadays a ton of the classes could actually BE played with a controller, and I know some people that do, and they play well enough so we can't kick them.
---
Now people with phones can only be worse.
---
My first ever BRD run was amazing took nearly 4 hours to fully clear. I remeber entering the Great Hall area with the giant columns and the packs of adds and getting really excited. It was a great experience untill the last boss when some dirty mage rolled on my royal scepter. 
---
The “mage = food” part made me realize this is art.
---
&gt;tyboluck
---
Maybe I wasn't clear because my goal is not to fulfill both heal and tank role at the same time more like dps + heal or dps + tank since I'll be playing a rogue with another char.  
---
Thanks for the support anyway, having tons of keybinds doesn't scare me too much since I now became a touch typer and could definitely get one of those mmorpg mouse with tons of keybinds as well as voice attack assist.  
---
May I ask if you've done it in vanilla ? And if you would be up for having a little chat on discord if you don't mind.  
---
Thanks for your answer !
---
Lineage revolution such a well thought out mobile game. Nothing special on the first glance but very well done and implemented. If wow goes that route it will probably be similar to it.
---
I played it for 3months and gave up eventualy because of the passiveness of it all. Autoplay is an evil that should not exist but we see it in all the mobile games that go mmo route.
---
I would say Tear Away and Sinner are the 2 best songs on that album.
---
&gt; Pets at max loyalty rarely get hungry.  If you have a stack of food you shouldn't run out within a few hours.
---
Hmm, no. Damage will bring their happiness down too, I think. So will death. You're better off with at least two stacks, so you're not running to the vendor all the time. Full bags are a pain in the ass, but running out of ammo and/or pet food isn't a good call, either.
---
This guy lawyers.
---
It's going to depend a lot on whether they allow the 16 debuff slots, since then you'd have good  argument to keep improved shadowbolt,  shadoweaving, and CoS going. locks will end up similar to mages but like mages are gong to be threat capped so their theoretically DPs difference doesn't matter but warlocks need to be more careful with their threat due to the the spiky nature of ruin.
---
Part of the issue is that Druid’s find it a lot more difficult to get value from some of the key engineering items. Goblin Rocket Helm isn’t as useful due to having feral charge, dapper charges aren’t helpful as Druid’s have bad aoe damage and dont always want to be right in the thick of things, grenades aren’t terribly helpful as Druids don’t have a powerful ability to activate once the stun is applied, the list goes on and on.
---
Make no mistake, skilled players will be able to get use out of PvP engineering items, especially if you replace a gathering profession, but I figured it was better to just keep skinning to make money with than to switch to engineering which costs money. Lastly, Druid’s who are trying to rank up are likely going to be healing more than anything else, so having offensive tools become even less necessary.
---
Food for thought.
---
Yeah, that's 11pm here. That's far too late, sorry.
---
If the made the UI dynamically appear and disappear when needed/unneeded, and made you attacks bound to ABXY with holding LB, LT, RB, RS changing your ABXY bound attacks to other bound attacks (similar to how penny of people use shift and control for keybound attacks) it could work pretty well.
---
That’d make for at least 20 different abilities, they could even make the D-pad work like I said ABXY would work (better for buffs and heals since you’d have to stop moving for a second), bringing us to 40 abilities.
---
The only thing I’m not sure how they could handle is targeting. I’d really like the population boost from a console version, if they could make it happen.
---
Classic is NOT supposed to be a reboot/copy of WoW. it is supposed to be a SNAPSHOT of WoW at 1.12, and kept like that.
---
Accelerating broken content doesnt break vanilla. It's not a rushed gear carousel because items in MC are pretty much viable and desirable throughout the entire lifespan of vanilla. Maybe not the tier1 sets but people like to collect those for looks anyway. 
---
Naxx will always be hard, and T3 is something that people will see as a target, but the reason people quit the modern game was due to things being invalidated. You get a ful set of T2, you're pretty much always goign to be able to use that and feel powerful in all of the available content bar maybe naxx. What people hate is when you get a set of i level 300 gear and 3 months later you cant even queue for dungeons because you need full 340.

Try our Discord. We recently opened a LFG / Guild Recruitment channel. Guilds can freely advertise in there, and people looking for guilds can post with what they're looking for. That's one option, at least.
---
I downvoted you because your response is stupid.
---
1. Trivial non-argument. We already know Blizzard can do what it wants, the point is to convince them to do it a certain way that we believe will enhance the success of Classic (and make them more money).
---
2. They already flew the Nost team out and spoke with them for hours, which was one of the catalysts for Classic. Blizzard reads and occasionally posts on reddit and certain discord servers. Some actually whine because Bliz posts on Twitter/Discord/Reddit and ignores the toxic official forums. You can google the evidence I’m not finding it for you.
---
3. Pre-1.12 itemization data was reconstructed by Nost - so you’re wrong again.
---
4. Large scale PuGing did not occur in vanilla, except for the lowest tier of raids at the end of the patch cycle.  This project is trying to be as close to authentic vanilla as possible, so Classic raids should (ideally) be as challenging as they were in actually vanilla. Or as close as possible, and OP is demonstrating how they can get closer to that. You wanting to PuG raids and refuse to commit to a guild is not a valid reason to advocate for changes.
---
5. If you can’t handle that utility was one of the reasons warlocks were brought to early tiers of raiding - don’t play a warlock.
---
Not going to address the stupid accusation you made against OP at the end of your post. Thanks for playing.
---
No just dying brings their happiness down.  Otherwise it's just time decay.  At loyalty level 5 you need to rarely feed the pet if you don't die often.
---
Of course it requires farming a 5% drop from level 38 mobs so it's not exactly something you can solo at level 30. I got mine and then traded it for felcloth robe so quickly after that it felt pointless.
---
Wireless Keyboard and Mouse, HDMI to big TV, Soundsystem, Lounge Chair with massage.. what else?
---
You'll see salt/hides go from like 10g to 30g over the life span of the server. A lot of people level LW at first because it pairs up easily with skinning while leveling 1-60.  A lot of people drop it though over time because it's basically worthless which then creates a shortage. 
---
You know, a mobile and/or control version is actually a great thing, if people actually want it. Worst case scenario, they could just give them separate servers.
---
I want this game to be healthy, so it’ll need to be successful and last a long time. Adding in QoL features often would go against the core of what Classic is, which is only going to help with short term success and likely prevent it from lasting a long time.
---
Although, just adding different ways to play the game, that doesn’t seem against Classic’s core at all. Especially if you put them on different server or let raiders know what platform people are playing on before they get invited to raids.
---
Just think, maybe some day we could even get VR support. It’d be silly, but if someone already has a VR headset and just wants to play the normal way on PC, but with the 3rd person VR view, that’d probably feel pretty cool. I imagine it’d feel like being a Titan controlling your character lol
---
I'm definitely biased as a former warrior main, but I just feel like warriors who aren't open to tanking are a bit of a disgrace to the class. The ability to do it makes you a better and more valuable player. It builds character. I had to tank a *lot* and almost exclusively raided as Fury for years. People should play how they want...but if what they want is to be lazy or greedy then I reserve my right to mock them.
---
Will do, thx
---
I know perfectly well how programming works, being a software engineer for most my life. I dont make these comments randomly. They have everything they need to recreate it to the fullest extent, even having other sources (nost etc) to help out in the odd case where they do miss something.
---
Or a Surface Pro
---
Oh common, this joke isn't as bad as BfA. 
---
Not only that but it just makes threat more of an issue, especially for Horde.
---
I guess PI is worth having if you want it, but any guild mandating the Priest go for it seems a little excessive. Wouldn't it be better to just have one less healer instead?
---
I know I'll be downvoted into oblivion for making this comment on this sub, but I'm going to do it anyway. Part of the reason as to why classic resides so well within us is because of how "new" and seemingly "unknown" WoW was. We had a brand new universe to explore. People were still learning how to effectively play their class. People were experimenting on builds and itemization. 
---
All of these things resulted in a community that asked questions and helped each other out through the journey. Even up through raiding, nobody knew the encounters, but we continued to grind forward. It was a great learning experience, however, with the release of classic WoW, this fantasy will be nigh impossible to replicate.
---
Players are now experienced with their class (and even the role of other classes). Players will know the best talent build for leveling/raiding. Players will know the best leveling paths and boss encounters for 5 man dungeons and raids. Players, despite what people say, will min-max. It is was it is. 
---
I know we all want to return back to the glory days and relive our nostalgia exactly as before, but it won't happen. That's not to say though that we can't try. I'll certainly be having fun with my friends, but I think our overall expectations of classic should have all of those aforementioned issues. Just take it for what it's worth and enjoy the ride.
---
For the karma
---
OSRS is just a perfect game for mobiles.
---
But WoW? Fucking no. However I'm afraid Blizzard will definitely try it one day.
---
Throw more words out there to look like you know what you are talking about but that isn't how it works. I am a Software Engineer for many years, so i know exactly what i'm saying when i make that statement. Technology gets faster, easier and cheaper over the years. Recreating what they need out of what they have (which is at least over 90% of what they need) is easier then remaking it as well. They have the old clients, they have old servers (illegal servers have been going around since vanilla launch almost) so there is no reason not to create vanilla as it was/is. Biggest timesink is graphics, audio etc and that shit is still there.
---
did you forget your favorite courier?
---
Mage outdamage Warlock in all vanillia's Raids.
---
Warlock have threat issues, and debuff slot issues.
---
Retail = BAD 
---
great post. shame Blizzard won't do anything because it feels like a chore for them to even bother doing this, considering this is only happening because of the massive backlash from Nost. feel like they're just going to go for bare minimum and call it a day.
---
Hey look! This guy doesn’t have a phone! 
---
REEEEE
---
though you have time for continuous replies on reddit? with all the time spent replying, you could have tried out some very fantastic games
---
This is exactly what i would do on my lvl 60 rogue. I would also pick pocket the mobs on the way through. Every little bit helped back in those days.
---
Most people who can't afford to buy a PC have a mobile so shitty that they can barely open facebook on it
---
Audio settings that put discoed through your headphones. Just to keep the social option open 
---
Warlocks end up one of the best dps after the first two tiers regardless of any change Blizzard might make. You are required in early tiers for banishes, buffs. In dungeons locks are as good as a mage. In 1.12 they are as strong as any class in PvP in solo or group content (possibly the strongest 1v1 class as Soulink). Locks are among the best leveling classes and will be able to get ahead due to AOE spots being crowded for mages. Locks got a bad wrap in vanilla because their intiial talents/spells sucked. Deathcoil was trash before it was changed as an example. Classic is 1.12 so that doesn't apply.
---
Locks will potentially be even stronger in group combat if Decursive doesn't make it into WoW Classic. Blizzard never wanted it to work, repeatedly tried to break it and finally did later on. It was simply automated play.
---
If you like Lock more than Mage? Play it. In TBC Mages were just bad after initial tiers because they went OOM. . Mages and locks are pretty even in AQ and Naxx, even for pvp, even for dungeons and mages were better in tier 1 and 2, but that doesn't even matter in 1.12 because warriors will be doubling your damage anyways.  You are still REQUIRED for other reasons which is a good thing. In PVE you really can't go wrong. **Ranged DPS is always wanted.**
---
PvP is the big difference imo. One is a twitch class and one is a thinking man's class in certain specs. Locks have a lot of spells that you have to use in certain situations. Mages simply can't recover from mistakes in many matchups. I would pick based on that and if you only pve what fits you better as far as class fantasy.
---
Why did you downvote the comment, only to post it yourself?
---
I wont be able to join a raiding guild so my gear will extend to puging and mostly pvp,i dont want to bleed that much cause of that...i wanna do rogue but i know without proper gear it wont be as great and snatching gear wont be easy,i have seen druid footage and really like the idea of feral and balance hybrid specs for wpvp etc but im still not convinced i wont be trolling myself if i roll one,they outlast about everything but it takes long to kill anything,still very interesting an unique playstyle for sure.the class that would in theory make the most sense would be mage and while i like em im not crazy about them but they are the kings of what i want to do practically .lastly shadow priest is some of the most fun ive had in wow and that still applies to the van version of it i love that insane damage theyve got and the way the apply it
---
im looking forward to bg/wpvp a ton and farm a lot of gold for twinking,i dont mind not playing rogue at endgame since ill twink one at high lvl and gameplay wise its similar,also wanna twink a fc druid at 39 altho the playstyle would be very different to a max lvl druid.
---
Warlocks are limited by debuff slots and gear in 1.12. From the last blizzcon we can assume that they will keep 16 debuff slots from the beginning, so warlocks will have Shadow Weaving from the beginning, which is a big boost. 
---
However, depending on how Blizzard implements itemization, it is a huge factor. This is because warlocks have no +spell hit talents like mages, and there being a scarcity of +hit until later in the game. Warlocks start really taking off in late BWL &amp; ZG, they get a bunch of spell hit from bloodvine in ZG, as well as super bis items like Neltharion's tear in BWL and beyond. So while warlocks suck at the beginning in MC and early BWL, come AQ they should be up there with fury warriors, rogues &amp; fire mages in terms of DPS.   
---
Warlocks also scale well with each other, since a large part of their dps comes from critting, which procs ISB on the target, the higher the uptime on the debuff, which scales with the number of warlocks and better gear, the better the DPS of each warlock. It's just difficult to get a lot of good warlocks, in my experience, which is why most guilds are content with the 3 they have.
---
BoTw - 400$ for a switch, which is a hand held device that isn't a phone, doesn't have an OS, can't run apps, and essentially is a large gameboy that can connect to your tv
---
Controller - 80$
---
Game itself - 80$
---
Plus taxes, you're running close to 650$ for maybe 30 hours of fun
---
Mario oddyssey is the same thing
---
Horizon - same thing
---
God of war - same thing
---
RDR2 - same things
---
So its extremely expensive investment for ONE-OFF casual single player games
---
And i won't get into whether or not they are actually any good, because that up to the player.
---
We really ARE short on great games, worth playing for the price
---
There was another one a year ago that did no BG at start. They did progressive itemization 8 debuff slots and the stats were even original like they were in MC. Was around 6k player average it was amazing. 
---
And this project was going to turn those shitty phones into something more powerful. Give something for the bottom end to work up towards. 
---
If it was a snapshot of 1.12 then Naxx would be in at launch, AV would be in at launch. The argument you make is completely flawed.
---
So, I can't speak much to healers (never healed in vanilla), but from what I've seen priests are indeed more engaging at 60. They have a lot of spells in their arsenal, where as druids mostly use healing touch (unless situational requires something else, but most HotS are mana intensive). If you have the most fun on rogue, I would suggest you play that. Don't bank on healing being better at 60, because if it turns out you don't like it, well shit you just leveled to 60 :)
---
Retail should be playable on mobile,since there's zero content. 
---
It isn’t as easy as everyone thinks. People who seek out private servers are generally more hardcore players of course it will seem easier. The amount of times one guy was not paying attention on Geddon or Vael and blew us up was annoying
---
Yeah the trouble as I see it is that rogue has poor AOE abilities in many ways.  You have a lot of CC and control abilities, but those are much tougher to use effectively when controlling two characters at once.  You'll have to go NUTS with keybinds to get all of your potentially useful abilities accessible to you =P  Lots of shift, control, or alt!
---
There are some cool things possible though, like having both rogue + kitty open from stealth with complementary abilities.   For example rogue opens with Cheap shot/kidney and druid opens with bleeds + claw, then once Kidney wears off druid does the finisher that stuns, rogue gets a backstab.. who knows.  Things can go together pretty well there to provide extra effective stunlocks + damage. 
---
So some cool possibilities but I think rogue is probably the toughest char to multibox with because of the positional requirements and fragility of the class.  Good luck to you =P  Once you get good, there might be some really interesting fights that you could record and show people wacky gameplay
---
I actually wrote something ironically touching on a complete opposite subject in a similar fashion. I would 100% be in full agreement to try to keep these limitations and go from there. Mainly because I feel like these people at blizzard who are working now are not the people who made WoW back then. Learning to emulate something is a amazing way to learn how to design. When you mimic and re-apply something, you learn a thought process of someone. When you re-create their world your like "hm, this quest isn't one section, its interconnected in the world." and etc.
---
The same principles of actual gameplay and how you intend to direct a game would apply to this as well.
---
If private severs with teams of like 3 guys can do this there is no reason blizzard can’t.
---
No sidetracking. Rush only.
---
&gt; No just dying brings their happiness down.  Otherwise it's just time decay.  At loyalty level 5 you need to rarely feed the pet if you don't die often.   
---
Food heals, too.
---
Yeh I was da guild lord. I think I remember u. I were the local scrublord rite? Neway that old guild was scrub.I making new guild called &lt;Denny Smith Experience Official&gt;. 90g and u will be considered on trial basis.
---
They are talking about boss values, raid dmg etc. All raids and even instances are always tuned multiple times post launch. Classes were constantly tinkered with as well. They don't have those 1.1-1.11 numbers.  Itemization they have or can easily get access to. That isn't something that was constantly changed trying to find a balance that they ultimately settled on. You have old sites that had the numbers like thottbot, old patches that could be tinkered with (see the multiple youtubers playing around in Alpha clients) just to look at items or whatever. You just need someone to find them all, which Nost already did. The hard work was already done.
---
Was there ever behind the scenes plans to revive Nostalrius apart from the really bad E l y s i u m plan that happened, which Viper and Daemon ended up regretting?
---
All healer are engaging due to 40mens to heal. Your experience with druid is not complete cause you healed only 5mens. Paladin/sham or priest will be the same at this level. You just have to use one spell on the tank.
---
For warlocks, that's just a big ol mana pool dress essentially, right?
---
Except cleric
---
I wonder why it's not the goal on retail?
---
This is where I am at too.  Especially MC because it was the most farmed/familiar raid instance.  Make the content harder. Add more health to offset the boosted DPS from DM loot if blizz insists on including it.  Have the bosses hit a little harder, etc.
---
Innervate
---
Respect to both of you - first of all.
---
I watched the dev panel but I would be interested to hear again where they elaborated your “snapshot” theory about the future of Classic and ruled out “seasons.” I’m not saying they didn’t say that, I just don’t remember.  
---
As someone looking to retire from retail to Classic permanently come Summer I do hope that we will not be playing a permanent T3 frozen 1.12 server with no reset/future content and broken PvP. This would be a failure, even as a museum, because it would not represent anything close to the game as it existed through the majority of its lifespan. I would settle for seasons or a rerelease of the original trilogy. 
---
Frankly, I think depending on the success of this thing I think there is a minor chance we could be looking at a reboot, despite whatever their plans are now, but no one knows what the future holds. 
---
You guys say 'every pserver' as if it's a large enough sample size to actually mean anything which it is not.
---
The one that rhymes with frost the admins willingly decided to shut down...
---
Then like an entire year passed for another group of people reopened it and decided to also open a fresh server at the same exact time. Enough time had passed that people basically lost any connection to their old characters and everyone who was new didn't want to roll on a server with people already in T2 when there was an option to start fresh. 
---
Then, since pservers isn't a united entity but actually people competing with each other for population they release their new servers at the perfect time to steal people, which is aq40 patch. 
---
So none of this would happen if blizzard just gave ample time for the timeline to finish in its entirety (2-3 years). No way would they be dumb enough to put out a batch of fresh servers 8 months in when the gates are just opening. 
---
With arcanite the crystal is the more limiting factor. You'll see people in trade chat offering to sell their arcanite CD for like 5g because the crystal costs a lot and that's less risky than going to the ah. With mooncloth it's the CD that's limiting since felcloth is much more available. Also why you get better margins with mooncloth and the ah route is less risky. 
---
No. The progressive release of content is in there for different reasons. It will be a snapshot of 1.12 once the playerbase is naturally spread out across the level range, with many different players at different levels and progression points. The slower release of content isnt intended to provide an identical experience to vanilla, just to make those who roll on classic on Day 1 feel like they dont have to speed level and speed-gear to be Naxx-viable after 1 week. if you know you have 3 months to hit cap and get a handful of MC or Dire Maul gear in readiness for BWL the overall experience will be a lot more relaxed. Hardcores will still speed level but by the time Naxx comes out the playerbase will be nicely spread so your hardcores ready for naxx are all geared up in BWL/AQ40 gear, and those more casual are probably still getting their MC and BWL drops and have mostly Dire Maul blues.
---
Content will certainly be EASIER than in classic at first, for sure, but as said, overall community experience and knowledge will make far more difference than some talent and gear changes. 
---
Where is this from?
---
The fundamental question you have to ask is “who am I most interested in taking care of”? If the answer is others, play a healer or a tank, of the answer is yourself, play DPS.
---
Everyone has boring rotations for the most part in raiding, so whether you’re spamming flash of light or flash heal or healing touch or eviscerate really doesn’t make a difference. I love to take care of my homies and roll HoT’s on people to let them know I care, I could give a shit about doing damage. If your experience or desires are different, that’s perfectly fine.

Just do what I did, get extremely lucky and find several boe and high value recipes. I had over 2k g at 60 xD
---
It would not.
---
&gt; I agree mostly with you which is why I want Blizzard to tune raid content.
---
Yep, this is why I've always said that #nochanges is in many ways completely going to change the experience.
---
But the 30+ year old NEETs who screech #nochanges don't understand that.
---
I only had time today because I literally didn't sleep and have the day off. Can't play games when I'm watching my kid all day.
---
I’ve never played rune scape would anyone here play with me on mobile?
---
Yeah, it takes me back to middle school. It was the middle of summer. No job, no obligations other than occasional chores, and what seemed like all the time in the world to explore this brand new online game my friends had told me about that I had never played before. I had never played any online game like Everquest or any of the Warcraft trilogy before, so I had idea what WoW was, what I was doing or where to go, so I just mindlessly ran all over Azeroth grinding and occasionally doing a few quests whenever I could find one. I had this almost magical and wondrous sort of feeling when playing the game. 
---
Oh they never said they wouldnt do seasons. It was more that their original design stated (and used the words) "museum". They were talking about old games like, say, old nintendo cartridge games. The original Mario, the original Sonics. The systems are gone but you can still use emulators to play the games. There's no way to do that with classic, so they wanted to bring it back so there was a permanent record of what that part of the game was like.
---
I personally DO expect all classic servers to stay forever on T3 1.12 frozen with no changes. That's not to say though that they wont then open servers for BC or Wrath, or have periodic "re-openings" of fresh Classic servers so people can have another shot at experiencing the Gates of Ahn Qiraj. 
---
But it's clear that there's many reasons why Classic will NOT be a matching experience to Vanilla. All the dev talks mostly centre around replicating a server that plays the same as a 1.12 original, and then basing eveyrthing on that. If they intended to mirror the exact feel of vanilla they'd do a lot more of a staggered release than what they have already suggested.
---
Cross realm BGs were great because you could create a server group and kick the butts of other server groups and prove your server was superior at PvP.
---
Obviously somebody didn't collect their twill set.
---
&gt; As far as I know, WotLK was the last expansion that you had to actually work for gear and levels in.
---
Yikes. I can't believe someone actually said this about the one expansion that made famous the meme *welfare epics.*
---
Crit aura makes you popular with the melee as well.
---
This guy! **This guy do not have phones!**
---
You didn’t ask us if we had phones though. 
---
So I know you’re lying. 
---
Nost and all private servers are guessing on bosses resists armor damage abilities and you can't get that from a client. NONE are accurate and the people from Nost have said this.. Nost also used 1.12 because recreating all the patches was impossible and nerfs and buffs to raids, dungeons, classes was happening all the time until Blizzard settled on something. They were already guessing, so each patch would be guesses as well. 
---
Itemization was something they did not guess, because it's something you could easily access in either older clients or simply look up in an archived website. It still took a lot of work to compare all the items and find the differneces (which is why no other private servers do it). With the data they have NOW (Nost), the work would be minimal if they provided it for Blizzard. 
---
You called Druids totally irreplaceable in PvP but Rogues has no utility and most would not miss them? :O
---
Wouldn't it be more efficient to spend the 6+ days of levelling a mage to farming with your pally? Even if you made like 50g an hour and only took 6 days to level that would be over 7k gold from farming on your pally instead of levelling another char to 60.
---
Thats a good point, but sharding isn't a switch they toggle to enable or disable. It's based around the server infrastructure. They don't share what servers they use or will use for classic, likely for security reasons, but sharding will heavily rely on what infrastructure they use.
---
Exactly, if they feel like it could make more money. But logically this is not the case. By having the classic and retail version of WoW run on the same subscription system, they're doing two things. Giving an extra incentive for active players to keep their subscription up during moments they might otherwise choose to let it run out, and attracting players that are no longer interested in the retail version of the game. Even if that last group only attracts about 100 000 extra players, those are still players that otherwise wouldn't be paying a subscription. Unlike in the past where design choices were  a matter of one thing or the other, these are going to be completely different versions of the game running simultaneously. Blizzard are smart enough to realise the target audience of classic and retail is completely different, hence the emphasis they're putting on the most authentic experience possible. Things like server sharding and store mounts go against the very essence of that authentic experience. Player who are not interested in that authenticity can always play retail, but if they introduce invasive modern aspects into the old game they just end up pushing away those players that are interested in classic. It's just bad business.
---
Sounds good - thanks for the response!
---
&gt;Alexsensual
---
Yup I think we're done here
---
The man has harassed many CMs before, even calling one a "sand n****r". I wish I was joking about that. Why should I believe anything he says?
---
Yeah. The WoD mount rates have long variable respawn timers.
---
The Taldor mob, has a shorter timer. Something like 5-12 hours.
---
Then there’s Poundfist who has a 12-48 hour timer. 
---
Those are all legitimately rare. Even on empty servers. 
---
I am far from an expert on multi-boxing but when I have I usually wouldn’t pick rogue due to the way rogues really play in terms of combo points and not wanting to face tank mobs. 
---
So after some thought I would guess your best duos would be to play with a hunter or lock. Hunter you would spec into beast master and buff the pet as much as possible and use it as the tank. Hunter auto shot and let damage are just to sublime to yours. You also have the oh shit escape if feign death and vanish. Hunters mark and aspect of the pack to increased move speed and increase efficiency. 
---
For lock a similar strategy using the void walker as the tank and dit up the mob with the lock and wand while you main your rogue 
---
You may struggle to change to a play style not using stubs but both should offer you a suitable partner
---
Consider that with warlock there is no loot overlap allowing you to use more of your item drops. 
---
This is all theory based and it’s not something I have attempted personally 
---
HTH 
---
If the damage is threat capped then would alliance warlocks do more damage due to blessing of salvation?
---
Ill be doin pve or rp horde. I wanna avoid the toxic people as much as i can.
---
Crit aura is the 31 point feral talent, so you can't actually get that and Nature's swiftness (21 point resto) at the same time.  
---
This is great info, thank you. Crystals being rarer than transmute cooldowns was my main concern as I'm planning on having multiple profession alts.
---
not totally true: friend of mine got the mini diablo in vanilla from a GM because they took ages fixing his problem
---
Looks like it's an excerpt from John Staats new book The WoW Diary which is shipping to Kickstarter backers right now. Got mine yesterday, can't wait to read it. It's going to be available on Amazon soon(tm).
---
Wow classic mobile would actually be sick if it was just wow classic
---
You have to walk. I don't recall dying in Silverpine tbh. The only major threats are the Dalaran mages towards the south. Tarren Mill however pretty much requires that you die, but I've always spawned right in town whenever I die there. You can usually make it to around Southshore before mobs murder you.
---
The Barrens walk to Camp T and Tarren Mill are the two highest death rates. The Barrens are worse in my experience.
---
Illegal servers at the time of Vanilla were bugged mess where 90% of stuff did not work. Modern private servers all operate on 1.12, so any data they have are less valuable than what Blizzard has with their own 1.12.
---
You claim how "you know exactly what you are saying", yet you seem to have absolutely no idea how private servers operate.
---
Food doesn't heal.
---
You're totally right! I didn't think about being able to win it twice, I figured it was a "one and done" if you win and if you lose you can keep trying! But then again, winning once won't be easy, and winning twice is gonna be a big challenge!
---
Same as many here. My WoW period was actually a few of the lowest of my life and WoW was partly how I coped. In some ways I'm looking forward to going back to Azeroth with a healthier real life. I'll probably never be top tank on the server again and that's okay. I don't have nor desire to spend 40+ hours a week playing. 
---
1. Not one "must" in my entire post. 
---
2. Their official website has no communication. There has never been one post from anyone on Classic in it.   
---
The forum is also full of trolls who never wanted Classic and who want to harm it because they think it's ruining the version of WoW they like (which is absurd).
---
3. 1.12 has nothing to do with itemization that Nost already looked up for them and that they could access from an old client or archives. I am just suggesting they take the easy way out.
---
4. Because that's not Classic until much later. It was pugged later because of all the CHANGES that you want to say is ok at launch.
---
5. You are never going to have to stop doing those things as a lock. I suggest a new class if you don't like it. Lock also brought dominant damage in dungeons, later raids and ranged dps is always wanted.
---
6. I played rogue with a mage alt. I would take that shaman with the Nightfall over you any day though in a raid. He took time to research his spec, spent time/money on the Nightfall and obviously cares and wants to be part of a group, while you can't even get invited to dungeons as ranged dps (easiest dps to get invited as), because you are an abrasive human being who was obviously left behind for good reason.
---
Druids as flag carriers in WSG is mainly what I mean.  They're also healers which are rare enough in classic, so having 5% fewer healers would exacerbate that.
---
Rogues are just DPS, their only unique utility is disarming traps.  You know what else disarms traps?  Sending wave after wave of your own men at them.
---
**- Itemization is wrong** 
---
**- Molten Core Itemization drops are wrong**. 
---
Maybe, but i really dislike the "progressive itemisation" than some server promote, people end up rolling on what item are gonna be bis instead of the current good item and people that don't know what item become what are screwed. When you are looking for upgrade, you try to look which item could be one, you farm it and then end up wasting time because you then find out you weren't looking at the good version of the item. 
---
Blizzard need to be careful with item gating too, i know some people that farmed a specific dungeon for more than 100 times hopping for a particular drop without knowing it wasn't out yet (and they quitted).
---
**- Dire Maul loot at launch**
---
Dire Maul was released weeks before the first rag kill, for EU players it was here before they even reached 60 (well for 99.9% of people it was the case actually). Maybe the first few MC trash pack and boss were attempted without this but for most of the content, top guilds had access to Dire Maul loot.
---
Gear isn't the issue anyway, people are clearing MC with quest green on private server, there are BWL pug where most people don't even have MC loot but pre raid items. With every information available about strats, rotation, stats priority etc...  you aren't gonna recreate how it was during vanilla.
---
Ive had both extreme happen on the same server. 1 char got no bags and 1 got 10
---
That right there is Trade chat. Now let's talk about Trade chat, can we talk about Trade chat, please, Mac? I've been dying to talk about Trade chatl with you all day, OK? "LF Tank," this phrase keeps coming up over and over again. Every day inquiries about tanks are getting sent back to me. "LF Tank! LF TANK!" I look in Trade chat, and the whole chat window is "LF Tank"! So I say to myself, "I gotta respond! I gotta type /r and tell these guys I can tank in dire bear form! Otherwise, they're never gonna find a tank and they're just gonna keep typing in Trade chat."            
---
                   
---
So I whisper this guy and what do I find out, Mac? What do I find out?! "Druids aren't good tanks".Tank druids do not exist, okay? So I decide, "Oh shit, buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper." There's no druid tanks? You gotta be kidding me! I got a talent tree full of tanking choices! All right. So I start searchin' through my guild roster, find some priests and I type in guild chat and I say, "Healers, healers! I got to talk to you about running a dungeon as a druid tank." And when I get the whispered responses what do I find? There's not a single goddamn holy priest online! There...is...no...healer in guild chat. Mac, half the players in this guild are playing meme specs. This roster is a goddamn alt factory!
---
I think its pretty sad that the overall intelligence of the internet community has completely forgotten about "numbers can be changed"
---
Like everyone here is focused on the numbers. That can easily be changed to 2 years or 3 years. My point being that fresh has to happen after launch and that it should not be gate kept by the very player base that has been crying for fresh vanilla for 10+ years.
---
I should have specified that my intention was to emphasis the mentality of my friends playing current retail, and not so much the game itself. I haven't played since early Cata, so I don't have enough ingame experience to share an opinion of current retail.
---
I'm fine with 2 or 3 years. I'm just saying it has to happen, it is the single most popular thing about vanilla and to ignore it would be foolish. There is a reason Path of Exile and other games that have a system like it are able to survive in a landscape they would otherwise fail in.
---
I'm pretty sure that the first cap was set to 5, then they later upped it to 10?
---
Yeah but that was also with 1.1 talents and gear. People will argue the newness of the game but most hardcore raiders in Vanilla WoW were hardcore raiders in other MMO’s previous to WoW.
---
Rag will die quicker on classic with or without changes. Even if they did 1.1 talents and itemization he’d still die in a few resets if not less. People just min/max more in the gaming world now.
---
thx bro xd
---
how about blizzard classic, or vanilla blizzard
---
&gt; Private server and Classic playerbase won't be the same. 
---
I really, really don't know what makes people think this.
---
Which class did you play?
---
/tips fedora
---
Server tech is far worse now than in 2004 but also massively cheaper.
---
Ragnarok Online Mobile is pretty good too. Just released today. I say go for it Blizzard!
---
Just do a flat 10% HP and DMG increase on mobs in MC, 10% Hp and 5% dmg in BWL, leave AQ and Naxx as they are.
---
Problem solved
---
If its a fresh server, druid is first because moonfire.
---
This is the perfect reply to your question. 
---
To be fair I don't think many of us saw flying mounts as a problem, WHEN they were released. I remember thinking that flying mounts would be awesome, then they announced them and I couldn't wait. I never even noticed how much the game changed right out from under me until wotlk
---
Sup Braden
---
Pretty sure John Staats said in the Classiccast they backed up a compiled client and database for every patch.
---
No, not even close. Locks do less damage than hunters also if hunter is geared and has their rotation down. Mages are the king of dps in naxx.
---
Rogues should have the 1.0 talents, going off 1.12 is too much of a nerf. 
---
For a mc farming guild yeh, but progression guilds never have issues with attendance if they are pushing content.
---
Yea I think you could pull it off in a normal scenario. The problem arises when something goes wrong and even if you were only playing one character you would be scrambling. There are times where every single GCD is critical. Like you said a well timed kick, stun, or blind from your rogue could save an entire group in the right moment. If you're also trying to spam heal a tank or pick up mobs as the tank that could be really really difficult. 
---
It is pretty common for PUGs to be rolled by vanilla 5 mans. Like you said though, if you can find a guild to run with all the time it will probably work. I don't think you will need to level extremely fast to find a good guild. Unless by good you mean best on the server. 
---
As far as professions go most are sub-par IMO. Eng is incredible and herb/alch can make some good money. Tailoring can be quite good as a clothie. All of the other profs are useful but you will only need 1 or 2 per guild. I prefer to take profs with personal benefit and just tip people here and there for crafting and enchants. 
---
World first thunder fury was really close to BWL release. Either just before or just after. The guy who got it auctioned his account on eBay in November of 2005.
---
You're right on all points, but most people aren't capable of seeing the bigger picture. This is a great example of "death by a thousand cuts".
---
Add things like loot trading or sharding and you've got a recipe for disaster.
---
What about creating new server names so people won't pick the ones which were (back in the day) over crowded?
---
This sub is one, as they now have weekly guild recruitment threads.

If you’re looking for something that’s more specifically made for Guild Building or Finding a Guild, that option is here on this Discord: https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq

Please God no!! Moblie is for 12 year olds on fortnite 
---
You can say Private Servers. I don't understand this hostility against them. If it wasn't for Private Servers we would never have got Classic. You can talk about "illegal" servers when they actually are competing with a product Blizzard is actually selling.
---
heal without addons and its suddenly fun and challenging again. 
---
at least if you have the ambition to do well. 
---
Yes I have some insider sources that tell me this will be the case. I cannot release the sources because they would be fired.
---
3.8 speed hmmm
---
fuck is a cleric?
---
I doubt a vanilla paladin’s ability to effectively farm, including at max level. Maraudon included.
---
I'm guessing in 2-3 years we'll be having the TBC conversation.  I'm also further guessing that a few years after that we'll have the WotLK conversation.  I highly doubt we'll ever see any other servers after WotLK.  I also bet if they DO opt to do TBC and WotLK, then they will be their own servers, not the currently planned Classic servers.
---
Thank you!
---
This is what I’m leaning towards too. But added in rogue for melee. Is rogue reliant on gear?
---
If you want to make impact on your guilds progress, you will pick healer
---
You may know about software engineering but you know exactly jack fucking shit about network systems and server setups.
---
Blizzard has redesigned it ENTIRE network, probably many times, over the years. They have went through full size servers, to virtualization, to docker and everything is DevOps and micro services.
---
You can't just thrown some servers into their network and hope it doesn't screw up everything including current WoW. Current WoW is design around sharding and they have setup the servers and network to support that feature. Having 2 separate systems means they have to retrain tons of CS staff to support the old game, each game would have its own set of tools for management and would quickly become a complete clusterfuck.
---
Old clients are buggy, have security holes and were designed at a time where single core PCs with a 1024x768 display resolution was standard. Now we have 8 core/16 thread CPUs, displays at 4K with a standard resolution of 1080P, and most desktops have more RAM that their servers did. 
---
Also, if they recreated WoW from the original client and data it would be a minimum of $30 a month and would possibly out by 2022. Blizzard is trying to do this while not breaking the bank and having the board ask where all this money is going. Whereas now Blizz will only has to listen to stockholders and board members about how subscription numbers are up and they didn't spend any additional money to do it.
---
Maybe you think Blizzard should just roll a mangos clone and be another shitty private server with everything except the look wrong.
---
You said "Vanilla is about slowly acquiring gear before MC, leveling up crafting (other than tryhards, which won't even have to be tryhards with all the nerfs). Then doing MC, then DM acts as a "catch up" later on as does AV rep rewards."
---
Does that mean that you believe people who used the catch up mechanics didn't do "what Vanilla is about"? I would venture to guess that MOST players experienced DM before MC, and their experience is just as real and 'correct' as what you suggest. Their memory of vanilla does not match yours, and they may like it just as much as you do.
---
Come off it--your one described way of playing is not the only correct way to 'experience' vanilla. 
---
"Every change made to Classic simply takes away from it and harms it. Change something enough and it's not the same. That goes with anything."
---
Some people started playing six months before TBC and I'm sure they loved it as much as you might have if you started playing in 2004. Because there is no one set way of remembering Vanilla, saying 'changing it will ruin it' is kind of nonsensical because there is no objective single point in time that accurately depicts what vanilla was over the course of its lifetime.
---
Just like most people did back in vanilla :)
---
100% agree with you, I think they will continue on to wotlk, cata seems a good point to stop at as the world is so drastically changed.  No matter what you do (well unless you just continue releasing every expansion) you will run into a point where players know there is nothing to look forward too.  This point of the game is the bane of private servers ATM
---
Definitely. It was early members of The Forgotten Order (on Stormreaver before they left for Korgath) who later shortened to TFO and kicked ass in arenas. 
---
The fact that they shat all over us in 90% of fights is what made it extra great. Lucky for us they were all dancing right next to each other, so the dapper charge blitz ducked them up. Even got that bastard hunter Lucilius who I fucking hated back then. Good memories
---
Are you sure you want to play Classic WoW, one of the most time consuming games out there? Sounds abit contrary to your chosen lifestyle to be honest.
---
I think this is really important if you want a good random selection. It would stop people immediately going to something familiar as the same names are even still used on retail. There are probably loads of potential server names they haven't used before 
---
I want to do this and raid with whatever specs people want to play.
---
Kids are work.  And like all good work, it pays.  The hard part of having kids is the commitment - 18+ years is a long time.  The only time I ever feel down about my life is when I realize I have no real freedom until my kids are grown.  But I remind myself that one day my parents will be gone and the only family I'll have left is the one I've built for myself.  Life is empty without family, and the one you're born into doesn't last forever.
---
Oh god no I haven't played wow in a decade I don't have time for that.
---
Rogues are fine. Hit up a channel like Perplexity or Payo.  
---
Rogues are utility in BG's just like mages. Is that fun? Depends who you are. If "fun" is topping dmg outside a premade where half the people are afk? Rogue is probably the worst choice of any class. If fun is messing with an enemy flag carrier druid, making him blow all his cooldowns, so you win as a team and win the BG? Then they are a blast. If it's harassing the other team and making them pull people off nodes in AB that costs them a node? It's a blast.
---
1 v 1? They are overrated. They are still "good" at it though. I think they are in a good place in 1.12. Not OP, but still very good at certain roles. That is what Vanilla is about and what made it great imo. Every class doesn't have to be good at everything and you can play the role you really like. Killing a lot of classes as a rogue in 1.12 is very satisfying. 
---
Played eqoa like that (Everquest on ps2).
---
Not joystick but controller worked very well imo the way they had the setup. 
---
Interesting, I did not remember that!
---
In the end it's still possible to get both bindings in a 3 month span, the odds just become that much better when you have so many additional resets. I just pointed out Thunderfury since it's simply the biggest item in the game (relative to when you are theoretically able to get it). It applies to a lot of the good items that become implemented with the 1.4 update, such as the various added weapons or offpieces like ToEP or Mana Igniting Chord, etc.
---
AQ shoulders being so goddamn hideous and BiS forever is literally why I won't roll a warrior. 
---
I'd guess lore/aesthetic. Orcs are choppy Bois, Tauren smash, etc.

I healed as all raiding content in Vanilla. This is my memories from raiding (although its blurred with patches prior to 1.12). This may be a bit harsh but true (in my eyes).
---
Holy Priest: Backbone of healing. Dwarf priests are superior to other races (for pve) due to Fear Ward. Pretty much good at all healing. At lower raid content, your back will be hurting.   
---
Resto Druids: Primary function to give priests innervate, cleanse curses, and battle res a person. Excels at slow steady damage on many targets.   
---
Holy Paladins: Primary function to dispel Magic, Disease, Poison (all in one button!) Good at tank healing, especially at higher gear levels.
---
(Note: I think 1.12 or prior added Paladin greater blessings. If not, expect to spend half of each fight reapplying buffs to 20+ people). 
---
Hunters/Mages/Rogues - Core DPS.   
---
Warlocks: Soulstone/Healthstone bots (maybe no healthstone well by 1.12- I remember helping warlocks farm 80+ soulshards).       Core DPS but gimped by lack of debuff slots and threat drops. You get to shine and feel special for one fight in AQ though!  
---
Prot Warriors: Tanks.   
---
Other specs of classes  can do things above, just not as well as another (IE a equally geared/skilled rogue will easily outdamage an equally geared/skilled ret paladin).  Exception to this is an Arms warrior, but they will be threat capped 99% of the time (or dead due to pulling aggro).
---
I don't remember if 1.12 is before or after the nerf to 'downscaling' heal spells, but for the most part it was not uncommon to have 2-3 different ranks of the same healing spell on your bar, used for different purposes.
---
&gt;Just like people playing WoW now 6-8h a day means they have little social life or hobbies other than playing WoW
---
Not true. When I was playing WoW for 6-8h a day I had a huge circle of friends. Simply because I was in Uni and had all the time in the world to play video games, socialize and study on *my* terms.
---
When adult life hit me, I stopped seeing most of them and had to limit my free time to gf and closest of friends.
---
Too many buttons to push to be on mobile! Too complicated of a game. 
---
Diablo makes sense. You mash a few buttons to kill bad guys. MOBAs make sense as well. The problem with Diablo Immortal is that it's a brand new story ONLY available to mobile players. An MMO wouldn't work unless it was insanely simplified. 
---
Yeah. Nice bunch of raw stats. Good mana pool boost and some additional health buffer for lifetapping. 
---
So good when +dmg boosts in armor are still lacking.
---
It's just what fitted the race. It's fantasy, so there are some archtypes. Like how elves often are rangers, orcs are not scholar type magician etc.
---
 Humans for example are soldiers and knights so they use sword and shield.
---
Also, not everyone are different. Humans, gnomes and night elves all use sword / shield. Dwarf and orcs gets a 2H axe. Troll got axe / shield and Tauren got 2H mace.
---
I call bullshit.  Reconstructing multiple versions of a program as complex as WoW would be incredibly time consuming, if it is even possible.  And how would they troubleshoot?  Any given bug could simply be something that was "working as intended" at the time of the build that they are reconstructing.  Do they fix it?  But then they are diverging from the original , which defeats the purpose of reconstructing the original.
---
Its fortunate that they have any early versions of WoW remaining, or else they wouldn't be able to do this at all.
---
That would be mages and rogues, undoubtedly. I've played both classes in vanilla, and I am more partial to Rogue myself as you can make your own PvP fights. There are many videos you can find of skilled rogues that aren't even level 60, but have no problem killing them. That's because rogue cooldowns are just some of the best for PvP. If you have all of them up, it's very difficult to lose a fight. The only classes that ever gave me a trouble were warriors. Fights against any other class felt pretty one-sided.
---
And once you grind your Alterac Valley rep and get that exalted dagger... yikes. It doesn't take much on a rogue to do well.
---
As long as they prioritize PC I don’t think I’d care. 
---
At a certain point in life, the novelty of "new" wears off.  You begin to see patterns in everything.  Everything is a a variant on a theme you're already familiar with, and you find you can predict the ending to most stories.  You stop looking for new music to listen to; you stop learning as much not because you *can't* but because you *don't want to* because what you already know has worked for you for so long that new doesn't seem better anymore.  I work in software where everything changes all the time and I've now reached the point where I've become one of those guys who wants to stick to older stuff that I know because the new is just a different paint job on the old.  It's the same shit with different flies.
---
When I was 23 I swore I'd never get like that, but I have.
---
So, WoW is a game that is good enough.  BfA is new, but not in the exciting way - in the way that it's just a new set of things I have to learn.  I don't have it in me anymore to learn new boss mechanics that are just recolors of mechanics that have been in the game since 2004.  Don't stand in the fire ... but hey, it's not FIRE this time, it's a train coming at you from the left of the screen!  How *novel*!
---
A few years ago I would have said yes, it reminds me of a good time in my life.  I was a senior in college and I only needed 1 class per semester to graduate with 120 credits so I played a *lot* of WoW.  All the adult freedom (including beer), no responsibilities, and my parents were paying my tab.
---
But now, I look back at that time in my life and realize that I squandered it.  The older you get, the faster the years go by.  I remember bringing home my son from the hospital and now he's doing multiplication.  It's winter again and I wonder where the last three seasons went.
---
Time is short, and I look back at all the time I frittered away and wish I had it back.  I don't regret it because at the time it seemed like the right thing to do and I did thoroughly enjoy wasting so many hours playing WoW, but you only get so many years on earth.  Using as many as I have on WoW is a questionable life decision.
---
That said, yes, I will be no-lifing classic and will be taking a couple of weeks of PTO and playing nonstop for a while and relive the glory days.  I can do and feel okay about it because my life still has plenty of balance.  I work full time, I have a family, I am athletic and healthy - it's all good.  I won't be able to play like I once did, but vanilla WoW will always be, to me, the perfect video game and I will play it as long as there's a way to do so.
---
Lore
---
Same deal with weapon training.  You have to go to different race cities to learn 'their' weapon style.
---
I actually got this on my first ever warrior back in the days. My first epic and I was the proudest human warrior in all of Gadgetzan I suppose.
---
Who cares that is has no stats. Who cares that it's a tad to fast to be effective. It's a unique model, even animated (the little skulls swirling around it) and a goddamned epic. I'd go for it again any day should I decide to roll a warrior again. Good luck on your drops, friend.
---
Alchemy is the most consistent over the life span of a whole server. 
---
Not only do you transmute arcanite bars but you can do essence of undeath to essence of water once every 24 hours. On my current pserver undeath is about 50s and water is about 5g so it's a free 4-5g every day. 
---
Remember it won't start off with ZG.  So that might mean you should change your order.
---
I disagree because as StaysafeTV says everyone but a few guilds is watching guides on how to do stuff in modern WoW raids, waiting for the addons to tell them what to do and not really figuring anything out themselves. 
---
**The argument that "it will be easy anyways" just means that every single nerf is even more harmful to the game and it's even more important for Blizzard to get it right.** 
---
I have watched multi glads wipe in Wailing Caverns on Nost btw. It's a completely different game with threat and CC more important than rotation or Dance Dance Revolution. Then again Wailing Cavers will be much harder than Molten Core and BWL will after all these nerfs. So will Deadmines. That isn't the way content is supposed to work in a MMO. The first 5 mans people usually visit (due to the guaranteed quest rewards) should not be harder than raiding until AQ. The 5 mans and 10 man to get gear to raid should not be harder than the raids.
---
That isn't progression. That is regression.
---
Is noone here going to point out that Android already has excellent mouse and keyboard support? There was (still is?) even a huge problem on PUBG Mobile where people played it with mouse and keyboard and absolutely dominated touchscreen users.
---
This has been removed because of Rule 1; Content must relate to Classic WoW. Posts about other games are only allowed if they're used to illustrate a point about Classic.

Rogue is fun in wpvp.
---
Not too reliant on gear but theyll beat anything if specced hemo sword in 1vs1.
---
They are easier than warrior. Beasts with their cooldown. Both warrior and rogue require good judgement on when to engage and when to run tough so not noob friendly at all. Ppl like blowing up rogues too
---
Here's mine:

https://youtu.be/XFqXph5wEzc
---
I'm really proud of what I achieved at the time. I always outnembered PvP and I think I managed to do something like that :)
---
Mobile port would be cool if DEX would work with Android and all the graphics integrated into tablets.
---
Oh I'm fine with keeping it hard and avoiding nerfs, but all I'm saying is that people will still download add-ons and min-max their characters. The days of discovery and venturing into the unknown are over. I think it's paramount that we understand that point. If you don't understand it now, you will be very disappointed come classic launch. 
---
You most certainly can play two  clients simultaneously. You will never attain the efficiency of two solo players but the test is trying to get as close to that as possible. You can do some crazy things with a shadow priest and warlock very easily with only a couple of simple macro’s on each character and have two monitors, or even tab clients 
---
In a threat sensitive situation mages will be able to deal up to 43% more DPS than a warlock. If the mage is threat capped it will be 43%, less if only the warlock is threat capped.
---
Warlocks don't get any threat reduction talents as their optimal raid spec, while mages get a 0.7 multiplier to their threat thanks to burning soul/frost channeling.
---
Warlocks are the most threat capped class in the game and heavily benefit from being on Alliance (blessing of salvation) and having threat reducing items, the prime example being [Fetish of the Sand Reaver](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21647)
---
Very true that warlocks suffer most out of any DPS class if there are 8 debuff slots rather than 16.
---
Night Elf, FD + Shadowmeld works like vanish 
---
I had a Night Elf Druid for a large portion of vanilla, and it became my favorite class. I played every class at 60, besides Paladin. As a druid, you are going to have so much utility to flex, and that was the best part for me. I had been feral spec and my gear was exclusively blues from dungeons. I did not raid as a Druid at all. Even still, I had no problems in PvP. On my rogue, I had problems fighting warriors. On my druid, I just opened in cat and put out as much DPS as I could before switching to bear form to finish them. I don't think I ever lost to a warrior unless he substantially outgeared me. I'm talking like end of vanilla gear. 
---
But let me elaborate on fighting rogues as a druid since your brought that up. Fighting a rogue as a feral druid was a lot more tough. They are essentially you, but put out way more damage, but also can't self-heal. You will have to heal yourself at some point and that can be hard against a class that can interrupt you often. Let's try to remember that as a druid, you are king of utility. If you can get a rogue to pop his trinket, and it's not very hard as you have bash and pounce to stun him, and he's likely to trinket out of bash as he will anticipate you're going to heal. That's not what you're planning to do though. Once he trinkets out of that, you also have natures grasp (if you speced for it, and I did) to root him. This is where you just get out of range and put a few heals on yourself before going back in bear form to tank and finish him. You even have frenzied regeneration in bear form to heal you as well.
---
That seems like a lot of dancing and anticipating to fight one class, but that's just how feral druids play. Some people would much rather have a linear rotation to use on every class they encounter, but you're never going to do well playing a druid like that. Personally, I plan to have an undead rogue, and a night elf druid when I play again. You are correct about how awesome druid fantasy can be, and especially the lore of night elves. I second that you should just go druid. I never played with anyone that didn't enjoy playing their, but I'm sure there's someone out there.
---
I do think more people will try to pre-form guilds today, because of at least one of:
---
* Knowing friends that play, instead of figuring out later on that your friends play
---
* Having a guild in live or rebuilding a guild from live
---
* Better Internet communication and guilds being able to form on Reddit or the official forms
---
* Guilds forming around high-profile community members like YouTubers and Streamers (not endorsing this, just saying it will happen)
---
* Guilds migrating from Private Servers to play Classic when it is official
---
You didn't have those happening before.
---
Classic WoW definitely reminds me of the best days of my life. I was in the final year of high school and pretty much had all the time in the world. Actually my time spent was very similar to yours: playing soccer with my friends after school, going home and playing WoW and then on the weekends going out and getting wasted. 
---
Barrens and Winterspring will remain ingrained in my mind and remind me of the days that will never return. Days of true bliss, happiness and carelessness. Life today is simply...average. I still have a good time, a good relationship and not having financial problems (yet), but those days man...
---
The problem is, Classic will not be a return to those days. Only time machine could.
---
Servers with popular streamers will be really, really crowded.
---
Just be sure to pick a streamer that really enjoys classic and will keep playing it, instead of the ones that'll just do it because it'll give them views/subs in the next 3 months.
---
They already said they are not nerfing content so why talk about it? 
---
MadSeasonShow.
---
Do YoU nOT haVE PhONeS!?
---
I started doing MC runs in Wrath, with my shaman, pally and DK.  I only just recently completed a Thunderfury and got the eye.  Though I didn't run it every week, I was well over 100+ runs. So I hope you aren't as unlucky as me.
---
Frostadamus is great for professions and goldmaking, as well as other guides. Defcamp &amp; Melderon have a wide variety of content from noob guides to talkshows. Raserisk and Docken have raid guides and streams/stream highlights. Docken streams pretty regularly with different raids and whatnot. Kargoz has a lot of speed leveling content, as well as, more recently, PvP workshops with top PvPers. SoupaSoka has a variety, as well. And if you're looking for lore, he's not specific to Classic but Nobbel87 is your guy. Also not specific to Classic, but MadSeasonShow has several ongoing Classic-related series. I'm sure I forgot some good ones, and I apologize.
---
Oh damn, that changes things again! I hadn't considered other transmutes. Are there more that are of similar value? And does each transmute have a separate cooldown?
---
I currently watch lezota. Really cool chill stream.
---
Sounds great, can't wait !
---
True.
---
I was almost certain that my old guild would rise from the ashes for Classic. But now I'm not so sure anymore. The few I've talked to seem pretty sceptical, or just not as hyped as I am. Makes me a bit sad. I feel like return for vanilla is the best thing that has happened, since WoW launched.
---
Well if a private group can release itemization faithfully as they were with content progression, surely a giant corporation like Blizzard will put in the resources to do it too right?

I just started myself on YouTube. I have played WoW off an on since 2006. Have been thinking about classic only for years now and am super excited for its release. I plan to upload every week this year for tons of ideas and I’ll focus purely on classic. Dove a lot into private servers for 2 years but can’t wait for true blizzard polish on it. If you want check me out my user name is
---
Classic Winds
---
What type of stuff are you looking for specifically?
---
Yea the stuff he does on classic WoW is great. I just don’t like the BFA stuff. Would recommend this guy as well 
---
It does work, mind control cap is amazing, rocket helm too.
---
I would use 2/4 grenades per bg still as a druid.
---
Net-o-matic is insane too
---
For pvp druid go engi/blacksmith for fear immunity thrinket
---
I was begging for WoW on consoles. If it ever came to phones before consoles, I’m gonna strangle someone and frame Blizzard
---
It’s kind of fun. Trolls are the only warrior that start with a ranged weapon. Really handy for tagging mobs 
---
Any addon to swap gear easy
---
We dont know yet how addons will work with classic but some good addons now are:
---
Outfitter( to switch gear, equip high stam gear in one keybind, equip shield+1h)
---
An addon that shows your thrinket and allows to swap then quickly even during a fight after use.
---
A dot/bleed tracker like chronometer.
---
Luna( shows incoming heal on you)
---
Theres prolly 4-5 other must have but check out
---
What monkeynews uses hes the reference
---
Because WoW was first and foremost a fantasy RPG. 
---
Yeah...no. I don’t want my data plan to be completely throttled for half the month. 
---
You can't adjust or tune content with player knowledge. All bosses will be downed relatively quickly (most likely same release day for some hardcore pve groups).
---
People know the best strategies and gear, the content will all be easy for the top % groups.
---
Duskwood is just a large “Fuck You” to the notion of roads being safe overall. Running in from Red Ridge? Enjoy the spider swarm and wolf packs!
---
I like the mood of Frostadamus videos. Very laid-back and just generally calming. He's doing great so far though I'd like for him to upload more.
---
I also doubt I would get my mage to 60 before they phase in ZG.
---
I want that Enchanting video! And the secondary professions! :D But yeah, Frost is terrific
---
Off the top of my head for Prot Pally, they cant reach the Defense cap and have no Taunt or really good way to generate threat. Moonkin go OOM too fast (oomKin haha xd), and Ret Pally are mainly just pvp, they prob have shitty dps numbers \\ its too much effort and gear for not a good payoff
---
LOVE Mad Season!    My favorite WoW  YouTuber.  
---
Gonna take a look! Cheers mate
---
Wotlk raiding was a cake walk compared to Vanilla? Jesus christ the shit you read on this sub...
---
John Staats said something recently along the lines of: (sorry can't grab the exact quote)
---
"The players would always have these ideas in their heads about how we decided to design things in the game or how a bug happened or how it was fixed or the reason why servers were down.  **The players were always wrong 100% of the time**."
---
With this knowledge, I'm downvoting every post that assumes what Blizzard does and I encourage all others to do the same.
---
&gt; Blizzard probably simply doesn't know pre nerf values for bosses and some were just plain broken like C'Thun
---
"Blizzard probably simply"?  As John Staats said, you are 100% wrong.  The players before you were 100% wrong.  The players after you will be 100% wrong.
---
I get it though.  It's fun to try to put the pieces together yourself and come up with "the reason".  However, it's easy to keep that to yourself.
---
Enchanting is out. But yes I want that secondary professions video. I'm very interested in what he comes up with next.
---
While I agree with the vast majority of your points I disagree with this:
---
&gt;"Just tune it". That is a ton of extra work for Blizzard that will ultimately result in people just stacking more of the most OP classes (mostly due to 1.12 changes) and make it even harder for DPS hybrids to get a raid spot. We will simply stack more warriors, rogues to offset any change they make here.
---
First of all, the easiest solution to the myriad of problems you've brought up is to retune the bosses, I'd argue this is an absolute necessity for MC/BWL.
---
You seem to be most concerned about raids being pugged, but then respond to retuning the raids with the idea that people will just stack War/rogue, that's not really as viable when you are pugging a 40 man raid, especially when the better players are absolutely going to join or form guilds.  While guilds might be able to force more class stacking, and likely will, I'm not sure there is a way around that outside of re balancing classes, which (cardinal /r/classicwow sin incoming) I fully support.  
---
At the end of the day regardless of how people decide to raid, there really is no strong argument against re-balancing the raids to at least counter act all the buffs players have going into MC/BWL, and even AQ.  Additionally, retuning, not redesigning the raids, should not require a ton of work.
---
It's a very low-effort response but there's been a ton of discussion in this sub already about certain "meme specs" and what their limitations are.  Have you tried browsing for that?
---
I will be a warrior, but can't decide between races and factions. Specifically, I am deciding between orcs and humans. Orcs have the upper edge regarding racials and are imo better in PvP. However, humans' racials are also really good in raiding and there is the paladin+warrior combo, which I would love to try out. Aside of appearance and faction preferences (which I do not have at all), what are your recommendations?
---
&gt; Everyone grouped, waited for other in an instance, CLEARED the whole instance, genuinely had fun and RP’ed.
---
No they didn't...
---
I call bullshit OP.
---
Your post certainly doesn't sound like you never played WoW except for two months of BFA and no other MMOs in general tbh. Seems like you just want to cater to this sub for upvotes or shit.
---
&gt;I have the feeling that all new players really just want max level as fast as they can and dont give a fuck about the journey, like what happend to leveling beeing meaningfull?
---
When was leveling ever meaningful to you when you never played WoW or another MMO?
---
&gt;classic is exactly what i thought WOW was gonna be
---
How would you even know? If you have no experience with WoW or other MMOs then I doubt you know enough about what vanilla is like.
---
Frankly no.  It might have though.
---
As soon as they insinuated they probably won't be any re-tuning, pre 1.11 threat changes, etc threw me over to the "probably not going to play" direction.
---
Vanilla was far more than just 1.12.  1.12 is a joke.
---
I understand that people will take what they can get, but for me, it's not the same.  
---
I won't ever pvp or raid ever again, but just knowing others would be playing some version similar to what I went through would be enough to keep me happy that I was playing a similar version to the old game.
---
Look through the retribution talent tree and count how many talents directly increase their damage, and compare this to the combat rogue tree and fury warrior tree. It's no contest - the retribution tree simply doesn't support putting out the most damage. It has a lot of talents that have *a* use, but if that use isn't doing more damage, then it's a point against them in PVE, where the most important role is doing the most damage possible.
---
This doesn't mean the trees are useless. A retribution paladin can do things a warrior can't. A balance druid can do things a mage or warlock can't. Generally, I think every class (and spec!) in the game has something worth envying - no matter which class you pick, there's always an ability that makes you think "i wish i could do that." Retribution paladins, balance druids, elemental shamans, and shadow priests all have unique, interesting kits that are fun to play with. A lot of people will bring up PVP, but the reason why isn't because PVP is more balanced than PVE, but because so many more things come into play in PVP beyond just how much damage you deal or how efficient your heals are. Some classes are still better than others in certain scenarios and matchups, but every class and spec has something to bring to the table in a way they can't in PVE.
---
The game isn't even out
---
A big distinction must be done between "unviable" and "inferior" in the OP imo. Prot paladin is most likely the only "unviable" class in 40 raids, since it's hard to deny that there are people who for the challenge cleared with at least a few of the other offspecs. For the prot paladin I would be surprised if someone showed a video of 2006 of their guild downing Kelthuzad with a prot paladin as the MT.
---
Now, unless all classes are homogenized and do about 95% the same dps / heal at equal skill and equal gear, there has always been inferior classes, specially DPS ones.  Really curious of what people are gonna say.
---
I made my own on-screen touch controllers that I used on a WOTLK private server while playing on a windows tablet. I was able to bind every ability, action, menu, and have full control of my camera. I can't know how it would have fared in raids since I wasn't interested in them, but I was able to pvp and duel succesfully on it.
---
&gt;Even with these changes, it won't be nearly as easy as LFR.
---
The last Pserver I rolled on, MC was cleared with significantly less than 40 people a little over a week after launch with people in quest greens.
---
MC with 1.12 talents and itemization is not just easy, its easier than most challenging LFR bosses.  MC isn't very hard period.  The first raid tier on private servers is over in weeks, with guilds doing 2 hour clears of MC and BWL isn't a lot harder.  People really need to grasp how much better classes are in 1.12.
---
I don't really get where the OP is coming from with all of this creating a toxic environment, Pservers are toxic as fuck, but that is more due to lack of moderation and no cost.  My concern is for the long term health of classic, and 2 joke raid tiers is not good for that.
---
That's exactly what I am looking for/considering forming. The issue I'm finding is how different each person seems to be in expectations. Anyway if anything comes of this drop me a pm.
---
Yeah they haven't said anything since the last time, and last they said they seemed very dedicated to re-creating an authentic experience so I really don't know why everyone is worked up yet. 
---
When was this guild most active?
---
take the lad out for some softball and Yoghurt
---
I haven't looked at those posts, because I thought "meme spec" was more like a random hybrid build instead of just "balance druid."
---
For example, Restokin or Smite Priest.
---
“hey guys, Frost here”
---
That’s how I know I’m in for a good time.
---
Mage with a warrior alt. Good times.
---
Same
---
Lol, he knows. In another thread he said it was the best picture he could find.
---
I feep like this is a valid point. Normal patch progression would have been ideal. 
---
I feel like the worries of toxicity etc are also valid. 
---
Alchemy, engineering and unique items like skull. This is just what I've seen, I haven't actually pvp'd as a warrior myself. 
---
Spawn timers also screw with the economy.
---
lmao, he put a dwarf on the front cover, seems like he's never even played classic
---
So what is it that makes the Retribution Paladin stand out?  What is it that it can do in PvP that nobody else can?
---
Princess is part of the body acceptance movement.
---
One thing that homogenization removed is the ability for classes to buff other classes.
---
For example, if you have a DPS that does 20% less damage, but boosts the other 4 DPS in the group by 10% each, that's a net positive to the raid.  But if that DPS does 5% less damage, and provides a similar boost to the group as another DPS, it's a net loss to the raid.
---
So when you have some classes that are primarily about output and others that are about synergy, that "inferior" class still has a purpose because it's boosting the others.
---
And the others might prefer the boost because it makes them look better.
---
keep hamstring up and keep intercepting
---
Do you think the time investment in posting some reddit comments while walking to the train, waiting for food, etc, is equal to the time investment to play a game?
---
They're not comparable. This comparison is terrible and you should feel bad lol. 
---
He's a girl and it's subzero here otherwise I would! Love my little cutie
---
Did you do like 1 frost spec and 1 fire when it was introduced?
---
yea if something like this gets formed please drop me a PM. i played a lot of classic wow but i was young and very bad at the game. I got it for christmas the year it came out but didnt even hit 60 till BC lol. 
---
In the common parlance of our times I feel like "meme spec" refers to any of the non-widely accepted raid specs, and would include basic stuff like Ret paladin, Prot pal, Enh sham, or Boomkin. 
---
Shadow priest are at least accepted one per raid for the shadow debuff and are widely accepted as good PVPers
---
Smite priest would definitely fall into meme spec category =P
---
Feral druid also, usually accepted at least one per raid for the melee buff and offtank/DPS.  But still kind of "meme"
---
Otherwise, most other classes/specs seem to have a defined PVE role other than like.. Survival hunter which is accepted as a solid PVP spec once you have good gear.  
---
Meme spec basically means prevailing wisdom = not optimal in a raid.  Fair or not. 
---
Princess is hardly a lead unless you just farm Maraudon.
---
During vanilla and TBC we were raiding hardcore.
---
Now imagine that, except instead of it being a group of 30-40 very experienced players who have been doing this content for years, and who know their classes, rotations, and consumables who were able to speed level up to 60, you have completely clueless players with no idea how to optimize their class, have never bought a consumable off the AH in their life, and have absolutely zero clue what the mechanics of any of the fights are. That's LFR. Yeah, it's easy for someone with a whole lot of experience, and of course people are going to be clearing MC very quickly. But it's still not LFR easy.
---
I'm not saying there's no problems, and that this doesn't need to be addressed at all. But I think OP is using some serious hyperbole. In addition, I don't think progressive anything is going to make that much of a difference, because this would only affect the first 5-6 months or so of release anyway. If it's a problem if it comes out like this, then it's a problem if it ends up like this... 3 years down the road, it won't matter whether they waited 3 months to release DM and change item stats around.
---
early on, warriors, rogues, hunters mainly, mage not being far behind, the later you go, the more fire mage rises iirc
---
Self heals as a melee character (only shaman can do this), incredible defensive cooldowns, support utility, instant stun (warriors can get one through prot, and rogues's stuns are more variable), instant spell damage nukes (again, only matched by shaman), resistance auras for countering different casters, just off the top of my head. And it's not just individual abilities, but the combination of abilities which make for a better kit - for instance, repentance is fairly underwhelming compared to an ability like blind, but it's still useful for paladins and can be used to heal, disable someone at a critical moment in a team fight, etc. The fact that they can help in the fight on the front lines but also throw out a heal for one of their allies can be useful.
---
Agree 100%.
---
Now, let's take again Moonkin / elecham / ret in Vanilla, which is before homogenization. Probably none of them to a net positive damage compared to an optimal DPS spec (on equal skill/gear), synergy or not, specially since most buffs those spec can give can be also given by heal specs of the same class. It's indeed what can be called an actually inferior spec (whether it's 5% or 30%+ suboptimal).
---
The real question is, were those specs "fixed" before the game entered a fully obvious state of homogenization, and if yes, then when, as you asked in the OP. I like to think it happened mostly before full homogenization.
---
Yeah , mindless self indulgence was always on classic videos . I remember bodies being on some pvp videos aswell. Brings back good memories 
---
If you have tier 2 / 2.5 plus a naxx weapon, a Ret can do very solid amounts of sustained and burst melee damage (depending on seal procs or crits) and still do great heals (though there are mana issues in longer fights for sure).  Combined with bubbles for self or others, blessings that easily break or limit many common types of CC, and defensive dispel and they are EXTREMELY useful.  Not in the same way an MS warrior is, but almost as much melee threat combined with a shitload of group utility and buffs.  Very fun to play. 
---
 Skull of Impending Doom - quest item. (Badlands)
---
Equips in off-hand so you can swap it in/out in combat.
---
\+60% run speed plus period damage to yourself as well.. you don't keep it equipped but if you have a hotkey for it you can break yourself out of Ice Traps and Polymorphs if timed right.
---
Holds aggro so they can do damage and not die.
---
I don’t buy it, there are tons of tauren shamans and orc shamans pictures floating around on the internet 
---
&gt; But for some reason, that bitter, nostalgic ache is kind of what I long for.
---
It was the hormones of being a teen. You miss feeling that strongly about something, even if it wasnt great feelings. I feel the exact same. Its wierd and unreasonable.
---
I imagine thats how hormonal pregnancy freakouts are but much more intensive and short. 
---
It's the first comment you see.
---
I can't imagine how a jump/spin/shoot would work on mobile. 
---
Sure.. I am just playing until classic starts!
---
Teebus...
---
Just to add to this DM was available at launch for Europe so a significant number of people, DM at launch WAS the authentic Vanilla experience and it sure as hell didn't ruin or harm Vanilla
---
When you swap to it the item starts with a 30sec cd before you can use it. So not that good for warrior
---
What’s classic?
---
Early levelling would work fine, it's 75% travel/drinking downtime anyway
---
Perfection
---
Funny you should mention than, the people making Diablo Immortal actually did make a WoW clone called [Crusaders of Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41XpjeCRrsk). They also make a Diablo clone called [Endless Of God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-SLvqXyrI4).
---
What, they they will or won't be the same? They will definitely be different playerbases
---
If its Horde NA im there.
---
Well crap. Yea that wouldn't work then.
---
hurr durr my best friend's dad works at blizzard.
---
That's the one thing I really like. I love all the new class/race combinations. It doesn't belong in classic, but it's fun. 
---
it's basically timing cooldowns (charge/intercept) around their blink/feign death &gt; trap, keeping hamstring up so you can get in/out, and trying to connect 1-3 times so you can get a kill off. you should watch monkeynews on youtube, he is absolutely incredible at kiting out mages/hunters, resetting combat for charge, and timing cooldowns so he gets good uptime and doesnt get kited/freecasted on.
---
on top of this, free-action potions + engineering items are required if you want to actually close the gap vs an equal skill player. it's a bad matchup vs both of them but absolutely doable with good item usage + use of mobility.
---
The company thats making Diablo Immortal has already made a WoW clone for mobile called [Crusaders of Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41XpjeCRrsk). If there is a WoW classic port, I think we know who may be doing it.
---
I agree definitely, though I haven't played since early Warlords. I guess I compare MoP to vanilla for the feel of it rather than the gameplay. MoP exploration felt like discovery, rather than just following a map, with good pacing, and no constant sense of foreboding about how the world is about to end. The zones had their own stories and I felt like NPC's had their own shit going on, rather than them waiting around in misery for me to show up and save them. The gameplay wasn't vanilla, but it felt similar fun and mysterious.
---
Keeeen!
---
My main problem with DM there at launch is how much fun the DM opening is from a pvp standpoint. Besides that, I always loved it on my hunter. So much more rewarding than any of the other 60 instances. 
---
Same as I did in vanilla, Orc Hunter
---
T H I C C
---
I usually play the first 30 or so levels using a PS1 controller with Xpadder. Works great when you have a small amount of abilities and all you do is move and attack. Addons like quest complete makes it easier too. I even tanked dungeons this way. 
---
However as you start to enter Ganklethorn Vale and other contested zones it isn't really viable anymore since PvP definitely doesn't work with a controller. On a PvE server you could probably play the entire game this way, except BGs of course.
---
That annoyance on p servers is almost enough to make me roll a warrior. Even warriors in blues and greens will ask for a lot
---
"Hey man, we need a tank, you available?"
---
"Sure thing. 25g, first 2 orbs, any boe's that drop, your first born child, and publishing rights to the Beatles music catalog"
---
LOL maybe everyone on the classic subreddit yes. their are non gamers who will be back for classic who haven't thought about it any more then to give it a try
---
Might be true for mages but hunters have a hard time with warriors. 
---
&gt; Lets check this. What was your vanilla realm. Lets see how many got into naxx and how many completed it. And the same for CThun.
---
Side note:  What is the easiest resource to use to do this if one were to want to checkout their old realm(s) to see if reality lined up with one's memory?
---
even if they could recreate the original progression of the game and exclude any bug/abusive mechanic then molten core and bwl would still be trivial and aq+ would barely be affected
---
people know where to go to learn shit about their class incl race, raid leader know shit about more than their own class and raid compositions and loot dristribution, raids are known, people have more experience with mmos in general etc
---
actually?
---
Make friends with two mages and hunters, just to be on the safe side.
---
I'm  not arguing with your definition.  Just explaining why I didn't look at those posts before making this one.
---
I was only asking because if your glory days were WotLK and Cata it's easy to see why people aren't super jazzed about Classic.
---
By rolling Night Elf to run back to your body faster. 
---
I think he really just means content creators, not streamers. Madseasonshow, kargoz, and frostadamus make great content that's been holding me over until release.
---
Sure thing- yeah I didn't feel argumentative at all.  No worries.  I tend to ramble a lot cuz I like talking classic wow.  
---
Ok. Take an app as big as wow, delete any archived data in your database, clear out your repository history, and then recreate the exact patch schedule and release it accordingly. 
---
Also, the other private servers never went with a 1.1-1.12 patch schedule, so I'm not sure how they would be of much help. 
---
I think that's part of what made some of those specs better in TBC or Wrath, things like Totem of Wrath (or whatever it was) where you would get better totems for going down Elemental.
---
Most private servers run on 1.12 however had 8 debuff slots until zq, had old loot stats, had no dm on release. At least recent fresh servers this has been the case and mc is still being pugged pretty easily.  This is how it should be honestly the early raids are pretty easy even with these restrictions
---
Some of the new class/race combinations are abhorrent. Fight me.
---
Most are these arguments are valid - 1.12 was easier than 1.1 - but the conclusions around just how easy things will be are very very wrong.
---
Private servers offer a dramatically easier experience than the live game ever did. All damage and resistance calculations are radically more and generous than they were on live, and all of them based on guesswork. If the live game is as easy as the private server experience, then the developers have failed.
---
AQ40 was never puggable on live - a few bosses in ZG would be pugged at 1.12, as was MC trash. On private servers, MC gets cleared in greens, but that's because the bosses do no damage and have incorrect HP and resistance values. Assuming Blizzard is working off the real code, things should be a lot different in Classic.
---
After reading your posts, I don't think for a second that you are a software engineer.
---
Don't you have Phones?
---
That is an indication of what John felt, what he was aware of, and possibly sloppy wording with the intent to say: "the players were almost always using different information than us to arrive at their conclusions". 
---
It's a pithy but fairly meaningless statement, not objective reality. Be careful of falling into this modern way of thinking that nothing is ever knowable and so we must defer to isolated entities who profess a supposedly unknowable truth. That's the path of religion, similar to the notion that the teachings can only be disseminated by God's chosen conduits (priests, bishops, and popes who just happen to benefit greatly from the common man's deference). 
---
We can and do know things, even without all the data. Humans are good at putting the pieces together. And those of us who played WoW back in 2004-2006 were correct about many things. 
---
According to these pages, they don't: 
---
* [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dispel](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dispel)
---
* [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Poison](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Poison)
---
Do you think the private scene will survive retail classic wow? 
---
Thanks!!!!
---
Druid. Always druid
---
we are devolving back to dial up
---
Which ones do you like/don't like? Here's my take!
---
* Goblins are awesome
---
* Worgen, Pandaren are pretty lame. Worgen are worse
---
* Dwarf Shaman is pretty gosh darn cool
---
* Troll Druid is great
---
* Tauren Paladin is interesting. I made one haha
---
Fortunately they’ve proven time and time again they don’t listen to us here
---
For example nelf mages. They should have NEVER been accepted back into Darnassus
---
Yes and I’m not ashamed to admit it. Safe travels friend 
---
not a single thing you see on private servers reflects reality. All the boss damage and resistance calculations are based on custom code, guesswork, and a bias toward easiness based on the part of the original mangos developers. 
---
Private servers regularly update the cosmetic stuff, but the under-the-hood code governing NPC damage and resistance is very seldom changed by any developer because nobody has ever seen Blizzard's own codebase and would simply adding to the guesswork.
---
I remember trying to get the Blackstone ring on my rogue by killing this vile thing and I never ever got it. 
---
I hear you my friend, I hear you
---
I wonder if anyone from the OG crew is still there 
---
I would think Nixxiom will probably be releasing stuff. He is a Machinima maker and seems like he has caught the hype.
---
I’m in an alliance one if ur interested
---
Private server bosses don't reflect reality. Blizzard's codebase is unknown and boss behaviour, damage and resistance is all based on 15 year old improvised code by the early Mangos developers who intentionally erred on the side of being easy. 
---
I think some of the modren combos are cool, but I've always been a fan of separating paladins and shaman. 
---
Stuff like undead and human hunter felt pretty reasonable.
---
I played on Stormscale EU, where our main compatition was &lt;Curse&gt;. So the bar was pretty high during vanilla. We raided 4-5 times a week and had a pretty good raid group.
---
TBC was a bit less intense. But we still cleared the content. In WotLK it sort os started to slow down a lot.
---
I'd say the game changed and irl caught up with a lot of people.
---
But everyone loved WoW back then, so I don't really get why the ones I still talk to aren't more hyped.
---
You've consoled me. Thank you :)
---
**TLDR** - You've exaggerated and overblown a lot of things in this post, Classic "as currently described" will be just fine.
---
**Talents** - Yes they make classes stronger at launch than during Vanilla, but most pservers use 1.12 and, that aside, it's a bad gameplay experience making characters worse and forcing players to play "bad" versions of their characters that they KNOW will be "fixed" later on. Yes it makes some of the early content easier, but honestly, the early content is already easy (and the ease of early content will be a re-occuring point in this post). Using 1.12 is fine and doesn't break the game
---
**Spell batching** - Irrelevant and unnoticeable to 99% of players. I've been a healer for a long time and the scenarios where spell batching is the difference between a kill and a wipe are few and far between and you won't even really know if that was the difference anyways. Besides, if you're letting a tank get that low you've got other problems to fix. While spell batching does have some implications on the game, it's not going to contribute at all to this so called "Breakdown" of classic you speak of
---
**Itemization** - If you want to be specific, MC actually started with T2 loot available so if we want to be authentic... That aside, I would like to see loot tables and available loot be part of the roll out schedule (shit like onslaught girdle and lionheart helm not being available at launch), but actual changes to item stats shouldn't really make much of a difference as they were never really the problem.
---
Dire maul at launch doesn't matter, it REALLY doesn't matter and you're making a much bigger deal about this than it should. MC is easy, early content is easy and Dire Maul isn't going to make a difference. The players that could even utilize dire maul that early don't need to, they'll be clearing MC in the second or third week regardless. The players that DM will help? Well Dire Maul should be out before they even start raiding anyways (as was the case in Vanilla). Also if people are having problems with MC with 1.12 talents and 16 debuff slots, it's not a gear issue which further shows how DM loot won't be a significant factor in that regard (again, nor will it cause Classic to "breakdown").
---
The same logic can be applied to the debuff slots, those hardcore guilds will optimize those 8 debuff slots while lesser groups won't even be aware and you'll have shit like deep wounds clogging up slots pushing off things like curse of elements. Again if those types of groups are having problems in MC with 1.12 talents, it's not a debuff slot problem. That aside there were only 2 raids with 8 debuff slots, MC and BWL, both of which are considered easy raids.
---
And if you think Vanilla raids are anywhere near the level of LFR it just shows how uninformed you are. Mechanics will wipe you in MC, they aren't the most difficult mechanics, but ignoring them will kill you. Even on trash, take the fire lords for example. Adds have priority, if you don't kill them they'll multiply and overrun your raid. It's a simple concept, kill adds asap but if you don't do it you'll wipe, no matter how many debuff slots you have, how much DM gear you have or what talents you're using. In almost every LFR encounter you can literally ignore every mechanic and tunnel the boss. Lots of PuG MC raids will fail and MC raids aren't going to be pugged for a while (I should know, I used to run PuG MC raids in Vanilla and I plan on running them in Classic)
---
**Conclusion** - No, the current plan (while I agree is not ideal imo) is not going to break Classic, Classic as described is still going to do very well and the planned release schedule for content at least follows the time scales of vanilla albeit clumping the content a little more.
---
If IRL caught up with people then, they've had like 9 years for IRL to push them further away.
---
I can definitely NOT argue with that!
---
Great tips, I would also add Huzzah who doing rare spawn videos for all zones and Platinum Wow for some chill humorous guides
---
I'm conflicted, but my conflicted choice is dependent on my best friend. If my friend decides to play hardcore, like me; and play his Shaman on a regular and dependable schedule - I'm going to go Warrior and duo level with him. If for some reason he doesn't, I'm going hunter. Whatever I do I'm going to be A Tauren because their lore and starting zone are my favorite :D
---
With leveling beeing meaningfull i mean in genneral, because im a very big fan of rpgs and always loved levling my character up, and i have also seen some videos on some different mmorpgs (Elder scrolls online, Orbus VR) and thought "Oh hey, i wanna play a game like that, but where do i start?" so i started with wow (After finaly getting a job and earning money to pay for the subscription) after i found out about level scaling i searched for some other mmos on the internet and found out that basicly every modern mmo (that i found) has it, and that people absolutle looove it!
---
&gt; How would you even know? If you have no experience with WoW or other MMOs then I doubt you know enough about what vanilla is like. 
---
After beeing dissapointed from what i got i searched the forums for answer, found out about "classic servers" (or however they are called) and also that they where shut down, then someone said something about a classic version beeing bade by blizzard themselves, so i searched youtube on what exactly classic is and thought, hey... this is way better that the "version" i have.
---
and now im hyped!
---
ive played WOW for 4 days now (96 hours) am level 52,  my name is Blocktophus (In game) and im playing on the Doomhammer server!
---
so Yes this is my first time playing
---
Put +100 health on it and it lasts to 60
---
Imagine playing a chick character as a dude.
---
I think part of this might be due to Private Server mechanics, but I can say that if a Warrior gets next to my Hunter, I've got nothing.  Hamstring and Wing Clip effectively cancel each other out (we're both moving slower) and actually benefits the melee because they have more time to react if I change direction.
---
Once we're in combat and you've got hamstring on me, the only thing I have is Intimidation, which isn't long enough to really escape.
---
Granted, I don't have Scatter Shot, and I believe that Feign + Trap is broken on the server I'm on, so there might be some options I don't have for one reason or another.  This is just my experience in dealing with Warriors.
---
I think you mean Activision. Blizzard has been buried already. 
---
You suck. Go away.
---
What's the first one from?
---
This is wonderful that you have this great memory, and can even remember the player's name!  
---
I won it on a level 12 on us-kel'thuzad, a pvp server, in 2006, solo.
---
You set your hearth to booty bay and fish at yojamba isle.
---
/shrug
---
Hunter range is higher than charge range, plus their wind clip is stronger than your hamstring. Unless you manage to get a charge in and one shot the guy, you're never winning against a hunter. 
---
So either have more gear or more consumables to win. Free action potion + charge and engineering grenade can give you the upper hand, but on equal grounds warrior loses every time to a hunter. 
---
I was watching a video about Star Trek: Discovery, and how the cast and writers think they're all woke and introducing diversity.
---
Into a series which had black and Asian stars in the 60s, several strong women in the 80s, a black lead and a female lead in the 2000s.
---
sToP gAtekEEpiNG!   
---
REEEEEE
---
Wing clip is stronger than hamstring, so unless he one shots you, you should be able to outwalk him. But yeah if you can't fd trap and don't have scatter shot you're losing two of your most important tools, so it makes sense that you'd be struggling. 
---
sToP gAtekEEpiNG!
---
SoupaSoka
---
Run up on your mount or use free action pots.
---
Or better yet, use a pocket healer. 
---
Here is my guild's website and write-up. Check it out and register on the site if you wanna join us at launch: http://karmaguild.club/topic/2/what-are-we-about
---
Fire, Arcane*, and I still hated it xD
---
It was the day being known as a spec died and you became 'class' instead. I went from being activly known as one of the few fire mages to just being a general mage. Every warrior on my server was expected to tank and everyone who could was a "lol wtf, why?" if they didn't have a healing spec.
---
For me it was the first in a long line of identity loss in wow. 
---
People pugged up to AQ20 in Vanilla. I know what point you were going for. Just saying. Eventually DireMaul did come out, and people pugging up to AQ20 did not harm our servers or community at all.
---
There are two main target audiences for Classic.  I'm honestly not sure you fall into either of them.
---
1. People who played Classic and want to play it again.
---
2. People who started after Classic and loved the game, but want to see what Classic is like.
---
The game changed substantially every expansion, with probably the biggest shifts being Wrath, Cata, and Mists.
---
* Wrath moved from a player-focused game design to a group-focused game design, where classes started to move towards fulfilling specific roles.  
---
* Cataclysm completely revamped the 1-60 zones and wiped out the previous versions of them.
---
* Mists revamped the class system and the Mists progression model has largely been what's used ever since.
---
The biggest things for you are going to be:
---
* More class identity and less class capability than what you've seen (as a result of the WotLK changes)
---
* Completely new zones (as a result of the Cata changes)
---
* A new way of building your character and a different way of progressing through raids (as a result of the Mists changes)
---
Even worse, that set he's wearing is using the Horde Logos as head and shoulder pieces.
---
Thanks for the link, so I see what you're about, but what time zone and hours are you playing!?
---
If you're mainly doing random solo queue BGs, you'll probably have a lot more success with Disc, just because in random BGs success often comes down to which side has healers.  
---
1v1 shadow is better. For raiding it'll be much easier to get a spot as a healer, even a pvp specced one, shadow isn't considered a competitive raiding spec. Yes of course you will need two sets of gear.
---
You can even go 31/0/20 and be utility spec to the max. PI for casters, increased shadow damage for the warlocks. 
---
If we get both Classic and BC it won't be an issue.
---
Anyone who says "we need Classic" but says no to BC is worse than anyone who says we need Live and says no to Classic.
---
Because you think its okay for them to recreate YOUR favorite experience, but not mine.
---
I would not mind WoW classic for my phone/tablet -  not to PvP or raid etc. but crafting and some solo PvE would work just fine. 
---
Would be perfect for my commute and some sneaking farming while farming rep with the gf 😉
---
Tbh I don’t think it would ruin anything, and the game could still be “no changes” 
---
I hope its a thing.
---
*creak*
---
I remember when Mara opened.  Of course, we had not one iota as to where to go and how to do this.  All I remember is the green blobs and the poison basically wiping us each time until we realized the technique of kiting with ranged dps.  This was before the nurf of the instance, and those things were group killers.  Ditto those little ones coming out of the pipes.
---
We had been in the dungeon for about 3 hours, still killing everything in site, using SS, ankh, and just carefully staying alive.
---
We get up to Princess, and we're all like... WTF.  We had no clue about her gaseous outbursts, we had no clue how to move her, how to stay within range, nothing...
---
And our shaman was scared.  I'm not sure how old he/she was, but he was scared to go towards her to melee, so he was using range.  A fire totem was put down, and some lightening went out, but he was scared and did maybe 10% dps -- and he wasn't resto.
---
Funniest time of my life, reading his chat, seeing his character NOT move, run when she came towards him, unsure when the boulder hit, couldn't run out of the gas...
---
Fast forward to Nost.  I was running with a European group, and when it came to Princess, I figured that it would be about the same ol' same ol' -- some running out of range for heals, some staying in the water for ranged, and just making sure the tank stays up.
---
Imagine my surprise when the EU warrior used a technique I've never seen, kept Princess in one location, which allowed the ranged and melee perfect timing to stop to make sure they were out of her gaseous range -- and all I had to do was keep him up, and I needed to fade just once.
---
But this screenshot needs to be of the CLASSIC princess!
---
Does /who show the entire realm on blizzard servers? I haven't played in a long time but I remember it being capped to showing 50 players.
---
Lezonta is an awesome dude! He gifted me a 1 month sub because I show up most of the time. He‘s also a really good Spriest
---
Honestly, WoW Classic could actually work on mobile.
---
It's not much of a difference.  What is it, 50% and 60%?  By the time I out-walk him he can Intercept again.
---
MarkyMark has, hands down, the best most comprehensive Classic guides. He's not uploading much content nowadays though.
---
Why is there no 3. Pepole who started after classic, didnt like it, found out what classic was, decided that they think classic is way better?
---
&gt; But I like PvP and I feel like druids might be weaker than my alternatives (Priest / Rogue).
---
I seem to remember Druids being amazing in PvP.  They have the biggest toolkit in the game, heals, stealth, armor and ranged roots and instant cast.
---
"Sorry the tank died, guys, I got an call and my screen froze."
---
"Sorry the tank died, guys, I dropped my phone."
---
"Sorry the tank died, guys, battery went low."
---
Yeah, I agree with you there. Some didn't catch my eye as "cool" or "interesting." such as the ones you mentioned.
---
Yeah, it made sense that they sort of invented the magic, but with the Blood Elf stuff it doesn't make sense. You're right
---
Impossible to get before since you require mats from BWL to do the quest. You can do it within a week if you buy the mats from other guilds
---
I honestly do not understand why everyone says hunter sucks pre-10. Is it just because their afk-leveling experience haven't kicked in yet?
---
You can effectively kite while shooting auto shots and by the time the mob gets to you Raptor Strike is enough to kill it. Especially for a new server they are amazing since they can tag mobs at range but does not have a long cast like casters allowing to easily tag mobs before anyone else. With kiting your kill speed is pretty fast as well.
---
If you just stand still shooting and then melee when they get to you it's not a fair comparison, that's like saying a mage can only use *one spell* per mob and has to melee the rest while in reality they have mana enough for more than one spell per mob.
---
Yeah, that sounds plausible.
---
I guess it was a bit utopian to think everything would be exactly the same like back in vanilla.
---
But it's alright. I have a feeling that if Classic is true to what vanilla was, then there will be plenty of players with old school WoW mentality that I can group up with and start fresh.
---
Lately, I've been thinking about working on forming a guild pre-release on an EU PvP server horde side.
---
In open world pvp that kiting might work, but your never gonna pull this stuff in a battleground. 
---
Neither is better than the other. 
---
A skilled support healer is obviously more effective in pug encounters because there are rarely enough to go around and it could mean the difference between winning and losing a game.
---
In pve raiding? In a top tier guild you won't find more than 1 slot for shadow priest. There is always room for healers.
---
Any spec that's not going to get invited to raids because it is just that bad at its intended role is unviable. 
---
I’ve seen bindings drop in the same run twice in 5 years so you can get them in a week if you’re lucky 
---
sTop GAteKeEping!  
---
REEEE!
---
10% difference is still significant, you can get out of his melee range within one auto as he's most likely using a slow weapon anyway. 
---
Intercept into trap or scatter or intimidation. Warrior should never be able to auto you more than once on every gap closer. So either he can one shot you and win or he can't and you win. 
---
Aggressive vs control match up. If you manage to survive the initial burst, you're very likely to win the longer fight. 
---
Plus once you get bestial wrath you can absolutely wreck a warrior within a few seconds just by letting your pet do its thing and staying out of the way. 
---
The largest, and irreconcilable difference between vanilla 2004-2006 World of Warcraft and WoW: Classic is Information.
---
It will not matter if dire maul is gated.
---
It will not matter if there are 8 or 16 debuffs.
---
It will not matter if the gear is progressively itemized. 
---
And on and on and on. . . 
---
Players know too much about the game today - you can never go back to 2006.
---
Consider speed runs of games today.  AGDQ is on twitch right now, iirc, or if it's not, there are tons of speed running communities - look at any of them for classic games.  These games can have ZERO tuning changes - in fact, players usually seek out the most basic version of the game - emulators are usually frowned upon, but players are still significantly better today than they were when the game came out.  It's because of years of iteration of strategy and information.
---
This will be the same with WoW Classic.  You cannot and will not change this.  Raids would have to be artificially tuned to such an extent that casual players will be incapable of doing them.  The game would have to become everything the #nochanges crowd is rallying for -- in a word: massively different.
---
1.12 is the most complete and polished version of the game.  It is what we are getting.  My recommendation: Embrace it.
---
Time zone is EDT (UTC-5). At launch playing hours will be ALLL THE HOURS.  
---
Raid times are TBD but will likely be typical night timeslots.  
---
I'll add this to the write-up. Thank you.
---
IRL raid?
---
You mean like rioting?
---
We're talking about 1v1 situations so yeah I want thinking wpvp. In BGs the warrior most likely has a healbot following him around and you're unlikely to get charged on anyway because you'd be taking advantage of your range and stay behind your front line. A warrior charging a hunter in a BG is most likely just going to get rekt by everyone turning on him because he isolated himself from his team.
---
problem with this thinking is assuming private servers are doing it right.  
---
"doing it right" would require resources blizzard (and no one else, for that matter) does not have
---
If I'm a Hunter in a BG and you're following me around with a shield while I kite you and keep Viper Sting up on anyone around, I'm "winning" that engagement.
---
Because to be honest... there are some VERY BIG points that i really dont like about WOW now that are fixed in classic:
---
1. Level scaling: I reaaaaaally dont like it, i think it really sucks, and i just dont really want to play a game where leveling up feels completly meaningless (Im not saying its bad im just saying i really dont like it, if you like it its fine but if i DONT like it it should be fine too)
---
2. Levling beeing Waaaaay to fast: I cant even keep up with all this stuff, i just want to take a break from leveling and just roam around and explore, but oh boy what is this? a quest, i mean... i should do it, im right there... im never gonna come back here... BOOM +15000 XP. I... i just want to take my time...
---
3. You get gear to easily: I choose blacksmithing as my profession (along with Mining) but i have NEVER used even one of the things (Exept the steel helmet) that im able to craft, because i just get better gear from quests anyways! it really doesnt feel good to grind iron for an hour and finally making a piece of armor, and then complete a quest which gives me gear that is way better (Not one of the armor parts or weapons i can make is even cloose to beeing better thatn the stuff i got from quests(btw, im blacksmithing lvl 225))
---
&gt; Dire Maul loot at launch. Huge deal. 
---
How is this a huge deal, us EU players don't know any different (Diremaul came out like a month after EU release) and it was never a huge deal in EU. It was just fine to be fair. 
---
If items have unique effects, something will be the best. And the best is what everyone is going to get. Nothing to be done about it.
---
For vanilla it's all figured out. 
---
by that rationale, ragnaros should not be out on release, since he wasnt available until 1.3
---
Human, Blood Elf, Void Elf ?
---
also that very few people actually played the game prior to 1.3 compared to how many people played the game later on.
---
it would be entirely subjective (and is, of OP) to suggest 1.1 is someone 'better' than 1.12 -- or that a 'faithful recreation of the timeline' (to whatever standard OP assumes is faithful, presumably) is somehow better than 1.12.
---
1.12 is the most complete and polished version of vanilla.  It is what we are getting.
---
This could be a issue, however i would not look at pservers as "the benchmark" as those generally have a reasonable hardcore audience. 
---
If your average pop and moms friday night beer raid clears MC week one with 20 ppl in greens, then yes, it is a issue. If they clear it after 6 months of leveling, while having 40 man in the raid (some of them being deadweights, but that was the same in Vanilla) i'd say its less of a issue. The top end guilds always clear stuff a lot faster, and that ppl that have played pservers for 10+ years do it in a week, thats fine. as long as the majority of the players don't clear it that fast there should be no issue. 
---
But what if I want to look out for myself, but also shoot chain lightning into packs of alliance in AV?
---
are you guys trolling (legit asking) ?
---
you need elementium ore out of blackwing lair to make elementium bars required for thunderfury.
---
...also bindings didnt drop until 1.6 .....
---
You're right. It's been out for 15 years.
---
It's the middle of summer now. 
---
I'm not saying those people don't exist or shouldn't have classic.
---
I'm saying those are the two main groups I see.
---
Very well written sir, thank you for that!
---
BC, if released, will likely absorb Classic.
---
Even if Blizzard try to have both running at the same time, the bulk of the playerbase will move to the fresh.    
---
Leaving Classic a ghost town that will shut down soon after.
---
Oh I agree. I'm just saying that we need to remember that as far back as 05 I remember being told I was playing wrong. And I admit a lot of the time they were right lol if we are talking about efficiency, but sometimes I miss being a paladin tailor hahaha.
---
I plan to pick a new race and class I never tried to make leveling as fresh as possible for as long as possible, but agree I know some of the stuff by heart.
---
the most informed players early on in the lifespan of classic will be a subset of players from private servers.  without question.  they have been collecting the relevant information for years.
---
will they be the 'best' or most dedicated players on the servers?  unclear - there is likely to be some serious hardcore players coming across from bfa and elsewhere.
---
but the players who have been playing (and effectively practicing) various versions of vanilla for the last several years - those will be among your best players, especially early on.  if you try to tune the game around them, you have given up on an authentic experience.
---
Unless you buy a bow, the damage you deal while kiting quickly wanes.  It works best against a single mob (get 2 and you're screwed).  Kiting often runs you into other mobs.  Oh, and a lot of quests take place indoors or in mines.
---
My hunter went orc.  Level 1-4 wasn't bad, but the cave with the imps SUCKED.  Then the first quests you do in Durotar are usually the human Marines between Razor Hill and Sen'jin (which you go into the castle and there's a 2-mob pull) and densly populated islands.
---
At level 9 I would have to put forth a lot of effort to kill a level 8 mob.  At level 10 I would put forth less effort to kill a level 14 mob.
---
&gt; For example, if you have a DPS that does 20% less damage, but boosts the other 4 DPS in the group by 10% each, that's a net positive to the raid.
---
You're talking about hybrid classes. You have to account for the fact that those party-wide / raid-wide boosts are available to the healer role of those hybrid classes too, which is why the only viable specs for each hybrid class (Druid, Shaman, Paladin) for raiding in Classic will be the healer specs.
---
Yeah, I ran sub optimal classes because I picked the talents I wanted since raiding wasn't my thing normally so I won't be judging how someone plays their class. We should encourage that kind of learning to be honest.
---
Yeah no, i totally agree, from browsing through the forums and Youtube i got that same kind of feeling.
---
(My answer may have come across a bit wrong, im sorry, english is not my main language)
---
i think some of us understand it.
---
it's just throwing the baby out with the bathwater to tune around so-called NEETs without considering the rest of the playerbase.
---
Last Of Us 2 I think
---
How is seeing a spell hit and cancelling a spell to save mana "irrelevant". It's huge for healers.
---
1. I don't think that retuning content for 1.12 classes is THAT big of a task. Especially since the overall skill and knowledge level of the average player (including internet connection and framerate) is much higher than back in vanilla. Even watching footage from the PoV of the top guilds, you can see that they really aren't that great by today's standards. Tuning wouldn't be as much work as you think it would be because overtuning by accident is much harder to do with today's playerbase. If anything the only risk with retuning content is it not being tuned hard enough.
---
2. On top of retuning, a common suggestion is to disable world buffs (and some of the more obscure/abusable consumables) in raids for a few months after they're released. Even if a retuning doesn't happen I still think this is necessary, people are much more focused on min-maxing nowdays than they used to be, they'll just be abused more than they were in vanilla and trivialize content further.
---
3. Class balance has always been an issue. "We will just stack more warriors and rogues" doesn't make sense as a counter-argument against retuning, because people will class stack as hard as they can no matter what.  It doesn't matter how easy things are, hardcore guilds will ALWAYS go for the absolute best raid comp, a retuning wouldn't mean more class stacking because classes already get stacked as hard as they can.
---
4. The DM loot is pretty good, but DM was added relatively quickly, \~5 months after wow released. In fact, wow was released in europe WITH DM already there. Is it really worth it to replicate such a short time in the game's history? Especially one that many people never experienced? I don't think it's that big of a deal to have some MC gear replaced by DM gear. A lot of the MC gear is worthless in the first place anyway.
---
Retuning will take work, but you're going to be paying 15 dollars a month. "It's too hard to do" is not an excuse for a 12 year old game i'm paying 15 dollars a month.
---
 OH LAWD SHE COMINN
---
Not vanilla as I started during WotLK. I was on my prot pally harassing southshore, just being an overall dick killing quest givers. After a while an 80 prot pally comes and the longest battle ever ive had. We both used out lay on hands 3 times so the fight was over an hour long. Well he did, i didnt as it had 1 second to go as a died. I was furiously clicking on it to no avail.  That single fight to me is more memorable to than killing the finally downing the LK. Oh, also while we fought, we had gathered quite the crowd of lowbies. Some of them would throw a spell at me and do nothing but flag them for pvp. When my shield off cd throwing it at him killing 2 lowbies as well. good times
---
I'd say one class isn't necessarily more interesting than the other. It's all about preference and expectations. Some people are happy to spam shadow bolt in a 2 hour raid and then call it a day. It's whatever to me. 
---
I've played all four healing classes throughout Vanilla and I wouldn't say one class is that much more exciting than the other when it comes to 40 man raids. 
---
No, I'm arguing that the #nochanges crowd are the neckbeard, virgin NEETs.
---
The rest of the playerbase would be much better served by making targeted changes to better offer a truly Vanilla experience that you simply can't get by just porting over the raw data into 2019.
---
Things like population levels, access to Wowhead, player skill, are all going to ensure that you *don't* get the same experience, simply because you're not a braindead 14 year old anymore.
---
You are acting like the playerbase are morons and on some level you are right however, those kinds of players are not going to be the ones who actually continue playing classical because classical will be too difficult for them. With this in mind it would be much better if blizzard proposed ideas that players could vote upon and have a chance at denying something you absolutely detest rather than having it forced upon you by blizzard regardless of your opinion. At some point classical servers will be updated or it will be shut down from player loss/not making enough off of having the servers up in the first place.
---
Translation. It doesn't matter if it's easier, cus it's already too easy, so we should make it easier.
---
Do any of you realize how bad this argument is? Also this isn't "tuning". This is reverting CHANGES.
---
Staysafe
---
12 million subs to how many? A drop was inevitable, but it dropped by like half in 1 expansion and so on. Sometimes it isn't the players, it's the game.
---
Which makes it even crazier. BWL released July 12th and the first thunder fury was created on July 20th. So my statement was right, just after BWL release first thunder fury was obtained.
---
It was done in 8 days in Vanilla for the world first.
---
Raid healing is completely engrossing.
---
DPS is like playing golf. Every raid is a gold course, and every boss is a hole of golf. It's the same every time, you're just trying to do a little better than last time you played that hole. Maybe you got a new driver that lets you hit the ball a few meters further off the tee. DPS compete against each other on meters, but really each DPS is playing against himself, trying to top his own DPS from previous attempts.
---
Raid healing is like playing tennis. You need reflexes, anticipation, intuition, and decision making, and even if you're playing the same opponent every match has an element of unpredictability. Healers play against the raid encounter with all of its unpredictable damage spikes. The healing meter doesn't matter as much as whether you kept your healing assignment(s) alive.
---
&gt; All damage and resistance calculations are radically more and generous than they were on live
---
Would love to see this supported.
---
I offer an alternative hypothesis: MC gets cleared in greens because it is possible to clear MC in greens.  Because people have discovered it is mathematically possible to do so and therefore do so.  The largest single factor between private servers and 2004-2006 vanilla wow is not factors arising from emulation - it is 14 years of information.
---
Thank you.
---
At this point we should all come down a little bit and be happy about the fact, that Blizzard is making WoW:Classic at all. Remember, when everybody wanted them to make it happen?
---
Now they do and people like you start concerning about every little shit. 
---
If it‘s not like Vanilla, it‘s something else. But I will definitely enjoy it, even it‘s different. Because blizzard gave us what we asked for!
---
Warlocks are more threat capped than fury warriors?
---
I was in a PuG on a private server a week ago for MC. Wiped i think 4-5 times on Geddon because either people bombed the raid or nobody dispelled the manaburn dot all the DPS were oom @ 80%. We wiped another 4-5 times on Shazzrah and we were then out of time.
---
Before i had done this PuG, i was certain people would faceroll all vanilla content. After? Not so much. The encounters are not complicated, but they are very punishing for messing up. And with 40 people there are more people that can simply mess up. Like if you legit don't decurse the MT he's gonna fucking die on piss easy bosses like Shazzrah or Gehennas. "People will be able to handle that, it's easy!" Well, i thought so too, but apparantly not. There are people that are this bad.
---
On Nost i was so happy for the first time the ring dropped, then when farming it for gold I hated it, because it didn‘t give a lot of gold. 
---
The irony is real
---
Can't we all just collectively stop watching regurgitated garbage and fake news about vanilla on on youtube? The game is right there if you want to go figure something out.
---
&gt; and their dog kidnapped
---
At least it's going to a better home now
---
Gnome hunters make me want to die. Other than that I’m fine with most combos 
---
I leveled to 60 as a warrior on a private vanilla server recently and it was honestly mind numbingly boring.  I'm going to play classic and level another warrior and I'll probably bitch about the leveling again.  My favorite expansion was wotlk which I would rather play, but classic is the closest we're going to get on retail servers.  I'm sure I'll have fun on classic because all my friends will be on with me playing, but that still doesn't mean I won't think it's boring.  I'm just hoping that they come out with a TBC or WOTLK server eventually which is why I will support classic in the hopes that classic succeeding will make them want to make more legacy servers.
---
Kargoz has some really well made leveling guides for all classes and some other great Vanilla content!
---
tbh i think most of the minmaxers and toxic folk woll quit due to levelling taking so long.
---
If you are 1v1ing with an opponent of equal skill and equal items, you will lose. If you are a warrior with a healer, you are on another level.
---
Yes. Warriors in battle/berserker stance have a 0.8 multiplier to their threat. Warlocks are stuck at 1.0 multiplier. Heroic strike does additional flat threat that partially bridges the gap, but on threat sensitive fights warriors can elect to leave it out of their rotation.
---
It's fractions of a second, most players won't even notice or can't react fast enough for it to make a difference. It really only has viable implications in pvp.
---
it's not about difficulty at all, actually.  it's about standards.
---
I disagree.  There are lots of "Classic only" voices.
---
Isn't there a threat difference being in melee vs being at range though? I thought that there was an automatically higher threat ceiling for DPS more than ~15 yards out.
---
Big read coming up, but I've always wanted to gush about WoW and I like the way you've phrased the question!
---
I started playing WoW on release. I was 14 and shared an account with my 13 yr old brother and my mom. My mom rolled alliance, and my brother and I shared a troll shaman. My bro and I weren't the closest, but games brought us together. We played a ton of WC3 TFT (ladder and custom games) so we were already well invested in the world Blizzard had been crafting. The game always gave something for all of us to talk about together in a positive way. And despite the headaches that come with sharing an account and character with your younger brother, it was well worth it. The discovery and sense of accomplishment for little things was awesome. I remember going on a school retreat for a week and coming back and my bro had decked out our shaman with Scarlet Monastery mail gear and I thought it was the coolest thing, and I wanted to get back to helping right away so I started farming hides to be able to afford the lvl 40 mount. 
---
School was going very well, my friend group was growing through WoW and my other interests, and I was really happy. My brother eventually quit the game, and I re-rolled as a night elf druid. I made it all the way to 60 and started pushing PvP ranks as a WSG flag carrier. I still remember playing with some top tier players and trying to push ranks - it was serious and fun at the same time. I reached Lieutenant-Commander and had the full blue PvP set and my epic mount. This felt like a big achievement in the game because I was still balancing school and relationships. I didn't spend much time in the PvE content, so that's what I'm looking forward to most for when classic is released. After I reached rank 11, the core WSG group started falling apart and I looked to the next step. I re-rolled an orc warrior on an RP-PvP server hoping for a different experience. And it was great! I remember roll playing as the stoic tank for a while, and I had my eyes set on grinding out AV to get TuF and some sweet PvP gear on my warrior. I'd roll with the occasional RP session, but what I remember the most was a core group of dungeon runners who were much older (married) and more mature than me at the time and they really helped me improve at the game and level out my anxiety. Lots of laughs and dungeon runs were had, and I decided I'd stick with this toon going into TBC.
---
2007 was when the game really took off for me. I met more WoW players in my high school and we all agreed to transfer to the same realm about a month after TBC release. I left my warrior behind. Some of us started fresh. Others were already there and ready to help with the initial boost and grind to 60. I decided I would roll as a blood elf warlock, who became my favorite toon and main throughout WotLK. I focused heavy on PvP leading some pre-made AVs before being burned out by grinding matches as an SL/SL warlock with a resto druid. I never made it past Duelist but my resto druid buddy who I met on the realm was much more skilled than me and really helped me improve as a player. He eventually found a rogue who was better and could play more and he pushed and made Gladiator the next season. I remember seeing him in Shattrath sitting on his Glad mount and saluting him. He waved back, we chatted a bit and caught up, and then he flew off. It's little moments like that in the game that really stuck with me. I tapered off a bit but my friends and I would still play regularly - 5v5 serious mode taking down some Merciless Gladiator players, 3v3 with different combos to mess around, and lots of world PvP just for the shenanigans. I tried some PvE content, but I never seriously raided in TBC.
---
WotLK came out, and this expansion would prove to be my favorite. Sadly, it was also when the dip in interest started. I loved the 25 man option for raids and I decided to focus more on PvE this time around. ICC was an AWESOME raid and it is still my favorite to this day. I raided ICC regularly.  I'd theory craft all the time with my buddies, all of whom still played daily. I have a memory of us downing the Lich King as a 10 man group...we had lost our hunter to a DC and we were gimped heavy on DPS right at the start of the fight. It was chaotic pushing through and players started dropping towards the end. 2 guys were left alive as the LK fell and I literally jumped out of my chair to cheer. Vent was blowing up and I had my headset unplugged - right then my 2 friends who decided to surprise visit walked into my room in the middle of the nerd-gasming. They just shook their heads and sighed (they were a couple of girls who weren't into the game - one of them ended up becoming my GF and I'm still with her to this day!)
---
University and college culture started to take hold later into 2009, and that was when I eventually started to step away from the game in favor of shorter and less involved spurts of DotA 2. I just didn't have the same time or inclination to invest hours upon hours into a game like I did back in high school.
---
Then, real life really kicked into gear, and I saw the very real decline of WoW play out within my social circle. Stagnant friends on the list who hadn't logged in for over a year. Friends I had made online who just up and disappeared (I hope ya'll are okay). Less interest and optimism, more skepticism and questioning of 'features'. It felt much less like a World and much more like a game. And that was when it clicked for me - I knew the glory days were over and they'd likely never be the same. We all grew up, and priorities for most people shifted. I think the direction of the game had something to do with this change, but I think it was more of a life timing thing for my friends and I.
---
I skipped Cata. I skipped MoP. I played WoD casually, and finally got my own account (yes I was still sharing with my mom all that time because character transfers weren't so easy and money was a bit tight). I played Legion on a new character (troll druid) more seriously, but I eventually lost interest a couple of months after the expansion. The same passion and connection that I had to the game years ago was gone, and I found myself playing to just kill time and distract rather than to really have fun and let loose. I played other games from time to time and I did put a crazy amount of hours into DotA 2, but nothing really compares to the glory days of gaming and WoW back when I was a bright eyed HS/uni student.
---
Times change, people grow up, interests change, and things move forward. I'm at a great point in my life. I still connect with all my old WoW buddies, and I still loving playing video games, but I'm fairly sure that the initial sense of wonder and amazement that I experienced with WoW will never return with another game. But, here's to hoping. And here's to hoping classic can help stir up some of those memories and make some new good ones. If you made it this far, thanks for reading :).
---
TL;DR - WoW had a huge impact on my life in a massively positive way, and I hold and cherish several memories from that time. I do look forward to classic in hopes of reliving some of those days. I'm optimistic about experiencing some classic content that I have never experienced before.
---
Oh, you’re going to tell me what it was like for me when I played WoW from 2004-2007? Didn’t know you sat next to me the whole time.
---
That’s literally how it was, and I was joined by hundreds of other players. 
---
She's why I'm now into fart porn
---
Unit.
---
And Troll. 
---
Gotta get creative. Spell reflectors, grenades, mobility potions, etc.
---
"I don't want her you can have her, shes too fat for me".
---
Shift+V and on site healing.  It’s what I always do because I hated healbot.  I HATED healing with just “mouse-over + click”.  More engaging to do it without.  IMHO.
---
Yes you got the joke, good job.
---
I wouldn't want to play a game I thought was boring. It would feel like a waste of time.
---
I'm mega hyped for Classic and I'll probably even take a week off from work just play. However, I realize that Classic might flop, if Blizz don't stay true to vanilla. And if it does flop I'll be really sad, but I won't keep playing.
---
Props!  Those are the best fights!

Another "it's already easy, so making it easier isn't bad" post devoid of any logic, common sense and reality. If it's already too easy as you claim than you should be arguing to make it harder. 
---
Hyperbole? You did that when you associated "LFR confirmed" with anything in my post.
---
Generally too early for guilds to form. Might be difficult to find 40 people within driving distance for a LAN party though, and I imagine fitting 40 people with PCs into a room will require someone with some serious free space. Best of luck regardless, it sounds fun.
---
so, then, keeping that in mind, would you be for or against asking blizzard to emulate their own game for data they no longer have, ala 1.1 thru 1.11? 
---
&gt;Plus once you get bestial wrath
---
So you're refer to the leveling period. Yea, hunters are pretty top tier in that phase of the game. But later on nope, sry. Your pet is gonna die in seconds at 60 against a geared warrior. Even bestial wrath won't do much then against plate, since your pet doesnt scale with your gear.
---
I played on Theradras Server (EU). I was embarrassed when i saw where the name came from.
---
That sounds cool
---
Thanks for mentioning that, I had forgotten. Yes melee can go up to 110% of tank threat before pulling while anyone outside melee can go up to 130%. So then effectively fury warrior has about a 73% threat multiplier while a warlock has a 77% threat multiplier, making warrior only slightly better. Pretty much ties them for being the most threat capped class.
---
I can relate so much to this, thank you for an amazing read. 
---
Okay now this is e🅱️ic
---
Me and a coworker are planning on taking a week off as well.  I think part of my problem was trying to hit 60 as fast as possible on the private server.  This made me super focused on my xp rates and it was frusterating doing a 9 hr BRD full quest run (I think it was 13 quests) which had me up till 7am only to get ~1 level of xp.  Now I know what to expect as far as leveling goes so I think this time around I will have more fun with it.  I also know now that there really isn't any rush to hit max level as it's not like you get much of an advantage.  Hopefully my new mentality will mean I won't be as bored leveling because now I realize that leveling is basically half the game.  It's not like current wow where the max level content is where the game starts.
---
All that being said, I would never choose to play vanilla over TBC or wotlk as I think those games are much more well designed.  The lack of quests and class balance in vanilla kind of bothers me and I much prefer those xpacs.  Although vanilla is much more fun than current retail wow.
---
Blizzard doesn’t take feedback from players, this post is futile.
---
Has it been confirmed what they mean by “starting zone?” It appears the community is treating this in two different ways even. I’ve read some saying Northshire Abbey, etc 1-6 zones and others saying Elwynn Forest, etc included. 
---
I hope it’s only 1-6 zones but wouldn’t surprise me if it’s the 1-10 area, and I worry Blizzard might pull a fast one and make it all faction friendly territories. 
---
With a guild name like that you better have no irl friends.
---
You are refering to something different than me. Yes, Blizzard have made some mistakes. The biggest (which I assume you refer to) was probably WoD. The problem with WoD was the content schedule being so bad and eventually things being cancelled to focus on Legion. Personally I didn't like the lore direction either, but it wasn't what made WoD so bad for most people.
---
What I'm talking about is game design. Things like the LFG system, the progression etc. Those are Blizzard catering to the fans and then later, ironically, fans yell up about it being shit.
---
it’s to late 
---
they already started dev

Happy cake day! 
---
And thank you, was looking for this comment. 
---
[Fixed it for you.](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/heroes/news/47451.jpg)
---
I think it's hilarious, but doesn't fit. My little bro made one and he was fun to watch. These are the little things that removed race identity. I think Undead hunter is odd. It makes sense with Nathanos' lore, but undead shouldn't command living creatures.
---
In these fights grenades, tubers and major healing potions are all mandatory unless you massively out gear or out skill the opponent. 
---
That last one is a matter of preference though..
---
"the utterly broken dire maul present on pservers will ruin classic"
---
private server players are fucking retarded. 
---
Fart fart fart fart fart
---
If a warrior can predict your scatter and get a taunt off in your pet, the warrior usually wins. Can the warrior even make it in range to intercept you is the question though. 
---
At least you can swap out of it in combat, unlike a reflector or rocket helmet. 
---
I'm sure blizzard with tweak items going forward. I doubt they'll rework talents but if there is a problem with some blues being better point for point than an epic it'll probs get fixed. I don't think we need to stress. 
---
What makes you think hardcore players are ever going to bring 40 people to a Molten Core nerfed this badly? I don't think you have any idea how dedicated some of these guilds are. They are going to play Classic no matter what, because their achievements will have visibility. if Blizzard screws the pooch this badly with nerfs, they will instead run two raids and sell carries to clueless DPS classes with useless tier 1 sets, with everything else on reserve. Example. Mage Tier 1.
---
This will break progression because they will gear twice as fast, make a ton of money doing it and soak up all the best pures and DPS Warriors and be overly geared when BWL arrives. They will take some extras for BWL and then dump them in AQ which will be the first thing resembling a real Vanilla raid with all these changes and where people are all going to hit a solid wall because they did fake, nerfed content. In AQ they will just unify the two raids to be ready for Naxx.
---
If this seems "mean" or ruthless then you know nothing about Naxx and some of the fights and what they require as far as comp. Nerfing content this much isn't going to make it better for you. It's going to make it worse. Esfand warned about this on Classicast (accelerated patches/content) because he knows how hardcore guilds operate. Every way you make gear accumulation easier or sped up for them, the worse it's going to be for the non hardcore player base. You are going to end up with extremes with all the normal people leaving. Same thing you have with modern WoW. Two playerbases that hate eachother and that aren't compatible. Eventually the hardcore will get bored with no one left to crush and the toxic puggers will never beat Naxx. Then they will reroll. Over and over and over. That's all these hardcore guilds do. They don't care if the server is cut in half from a 2 plus year game to 1. It doesn't ruin their game. It ruins yours. 
---
&gt; Another "it's already easy, so making it easier isn't bad" post devoid of any logic, common sense and reality. If it's already too easy as you claim than you should be arguing to make it harder.
---
We disagree with your post, your ideas are tired and bad, and you resort to insults incredibly fast. Shoo.
---
&gt; Unless you buy a bow, the damage you deal while kiting quickly wanes
---
Well, buying a bow honestly doesn't mean much at that level, especially as a Hunter where it's not a big deal to miss some abilities at your trainer. And once you are past level 10 it doesn't matter that you spend a few more silver. Also, knowing which quests grants a bow is a big help, but then I guess it goes into how one should rank classes - based on a new player or someone that knows about the game.
---
&gt;  It works best against a single mob (get 2 and you're screwed). Kiting often runs you into other mobs. Oh, and a lot of quests take place indoors or in mines.
---
Well, don't pull two mobs then. Same goes for many other classes. And kiting around without pulling more mobs are like hunter 101. As for caves or other indoor areas, you are right that it's hard as a hunter, but remember that on pservers it is often harder due to dynamic respawns. In reality you can often kite backwards where mobs are already dead. Still, caves are a weakness, but honestly I don't find too many cave quests pre-10 and hardly anyone in houses that you can't just skip (mind you I mostly play Night Elf hunter).
---
&gt; At level 9 I would have to put forth a lot of effort to kill a level 8 mob
---
Might be due to your weapon. Personally I always have an easy time with hunter and deal nice damage. Again, just buy a bow. It's no different than a mage training new frostbolt / fireball.
---
Lestherclub is two blocks down.
---
pretty much everything pservers do is terrible.
---
EVERY pserver still has the same broken ass core, mangos.
---
LoS is busted, TBC quest rewards, non elitee where elites should be, broken mob groups in dungeons.
---
as a matter of fact, I've never seen the DM farm done in vanilla. for all we know it is not even possible in classic.
---
And you know the pserver ingrates will complain about every thing diverging from their shit mangos pserver.
---
No changes.
---
"it is possible on literal trash servers with guessed data so it will be possible on classic"
---
I'm relaxed about the itemisation etc - if they don't have the actual data, then they just need to tune the encounters like absolute fascists.
---
So you are saying original WoW was bad and you want it changed? 
---
Real talk though, TLOU2 is about the only thing I'm more excited for than Classic.
---
But a warrior with a more powerful weapon also grows super strong.  So does anyone.  Give a caster a wand and they grow a lot stronger.
---
Everything I listed in my original post is a CHANGE. You are supporting lots of "changes". 
---
Shut up you moron. 
---
Sorry, misunderstood you then
---
Undead Hunter should have been in Classic. Our freaking Queen is one!
---
hahaha
---
Who is we? OP wrote a decent summary of the outstanding issues with adapting Vanilla into Classic. I haven’t seen you contribute anything substantive.
---
Sylvanas is an undead hunter. I think Undead are the only race who can't play their leaders class. 
---
is it why blizz added the pvp trinket in later patches
---
Bonereaver's Edge, if this weapon were to be in its final state for the launch fo Classic WoW, we would have a weapon that:  
---
* 1.12.0 Proc: 700 armor penetration buff on yourself that can stack up to 3 times, for a total of 2100 armor penetration(this is an absurd amount for vanilla). It's proc frequency was increased both in patch 1.7.0 and 1.10.0.
---
* Launch Proc: Debuff on enemy that reduces armor by 300, lasts 60 seconds.
---
This weapon that drops from Ragnaros, in it's 1.12.0 state can be comparable to an AQ/Naxx weapon.
---
What's the original source for this?
---
You can bring your own gear if you want.
---
Most people didn't even raid in classic, and had a hard time even doing the the things you mentioned on a PC. Really it would bring that authenticity of noobs back to classic, and also secretly I want mobile so I can farm while on break at work or waiting for food at restaurants.
---
I’m confused, are players going to be way better than they were in Vanilla or just as bad? Nobody can make up their mind.
---
&gt;I am not going to tell you why, because, tbh, I don't give free advices on how to make gold in Classic.
---
Oh wow, what a glorious dickhead
---
Light of Elune - it's a quest reward in Ashenvale that gives you 10 seconds of immortality. Of course, then I will keep it and never use it. I still have it on my first character on the live server from like 13 years ago. Never used it!
---
&gt;Would love to see this supported.
---
Visit the mangos forums, debates over NPC damage and damage resistance persist to this day.
---
&gt;I offer an alternative hypothesis: MC gets cleared in greens because it is possible to clear MC in greens. 
---
It was not possible on live. Raggy's splash ability thing would 1-shot any player in greens on live, even with the BRS buff. This is a good case in point for private servers not representing reality.
---
&gt; The largest single factor between private servers and 2004-2006 vanilla wow is not factors arising from emulation - it is 14 years of information.
---
This is incorrect. No more information about MC encounters have been uncovered since 2007. People simply moved on to playing a nerfed version of MC.
---
All I could do was down vote this once.
---
And here I was expecting [Princess Huhuran](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Princess_Huhuran)
---
Commented PvP content - there is a big lack of it out there for people who want to improve. Explain what is going on and what the thaugt process is during fights and I'm sure you'll have a big audience.  
---
i guess i'm rolling arms warrior now
---
Hate goblins and worgen. Pandaren were a joke. 
---
Troll druid and Tauren paladin I could sort-of tolerate, but it seemed unnecessary, and just increased the general "bleh" homogeneity of characters.
---
Bonereaver's Edge, if this weapon were to be in its final state for the launch of Classic WoW, we would have a weapon that:  
---
This weapon that drops from Ragnaros, in it's 1.12.0 state can be comparable to a AQ/Naxx weapon.
---
God that's typical. Best thing is to ignore them and give them no exposure.
---
Cool
---
staysafetv
---
“No”
---
There's going to be a huge spread. Private server players, especially the ones getting server first kills, are going to be ridiculously better players than the ones back in vanilla. A lot of classes, specs, rotations, consumables, and BiS lists are "solved", along with a lot of raid bosses, comps, farming strategies, and leveling strategies.
---
On the other hand, we'll see a lot of people that haven't touched private servers but want to see what all the fuss is about. Probably a lot of players who've never even played wow and were convinced by their friends now's a good time to join up, or people that started playing in the peaks of wrath and cata and don't know what old school wow was like. 
---
Overall we're almost guaranteed to have a better player base overall than back when no one knew what was going on, but I think the worst players of back then will be pretty comparable to the worst players when classic drops.
---
I fail to see how any of this matters tbh. I play on a private server, pretty damn casually. The hardcore guilds haven't ruined my life at all, i don't see how they ever could.
---
I was in a hardcore guild in vanilla, i cleared everything but three bosses in naxx. I don't see how this is any different, there will be guilds that outgear everyone, this concept isn't new. There will be guilds that dual run BWL for farming, this isn´t new. Nothing you are mentioning is new, it happened in vanilla too. Yeah we were all shit back then, but the shit players were even more shit so i'd say the gap was relatively the same.
---
And the truly hardcore people like you mention here, there aren't that fucking many of them. We're not talking about 10.000 of these players. And personally i wouldn't mind buffs to all the raids, doubt it will ever happen but, i wouldn't mind it. When i raided MC spell power didn't exist, itemization was shit. We still cleared it while being shit players compared to now to boot.
---
But i thought PuGs would easily clear MC in blues, after being in one i have totally changed my mind. You're asking to rebalance everything to cater to a very very small amount of people here, something that games usually never do unless they are competitive like dota2, cs, sc2 etc.
---
As for  "achievements will have visibility" lol it's 12 year old content, what is there to actually brag about. Clearing 12 year old content using strategy guides?
---
And your comment about Naxx, what it requires, i don´t understand what you mean. You´re saying naxx requires insane amounts of min-maxing and every buff in the game? Because it doesn't.
---

Most likely wishful thinking, unfortunately

---
Thanks! I was searching for this weeks ago and couldn't find it. 
---
I can agree
---
I thought classic was meant to be like real vanilla tho :/ why would they remove something that was [done on retail.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtdik-lF1ik) Very interested to hear your take on this.
---
Retuning raids *can* be tricky.  Or it can be simple.  There is a right way (increase mob health) and a wrong way (do anything else) to approach tuning.  The trick comes from knowing when to quit and understanding the consequences of retuning in the first place.  For example, any change that makes an encounter last longer favors alliance over horde in pve. 
---
 It makes the encounter harder for both - just harder-er for horde.  This is due to the mechanics of shamans that favor thruput and the mechanics of paladins that favor efficiency.  And it should go without saying that trying to balance around the hardcore base leaves the more casual base disenfranchised when there is only one difficulty level for everyone.  The safest 'solution' here would just be to stick to the standard (which is 1.12 database values in this case), even if that means the game is too easy for some vocal minority voices.  Maybe worth noting this is *probably* a non-starter for blizzard since brian birmingham stated they did not want to mess with the 1.12 assets, which would include the obvious retuning 'knobs' like armor values, mob health, and resistances.
---
Disabling world buffs is a good discussion to have - a solution not entirely awful in theory because you get to keep to the known, 1.12 assets standards, and are only enforcing a behavior on players (to not buff) that is effectively forcing the more-hardcore base to act more like the casual base.  This comes with the negative of again favoring alliance over horde at the hardcore level (horde lose all of the above plus warchief's blessing; shaman thruput vs paladin efficiency argument again), but comes with the positive of generally being a positive QoL solution, as world buffing isn't fun or engaging content in and of itself.
---
Please keep me updated!
---
if that is indeed a video from 2005 era retail, i fully support it being in classic. 
---
disastrous as it may be. 
---
Reading this thread - I think half the people here didn’t even read OPs post or understood what he was trying to say.
---
He literally choose that picture as clickbait and you're just helping him get views.
---
whats bmah
---
like when i came back to find they brought back amani war bear

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btJjKjrtPB4&amp;

like so.
---
other options include FAP (free action potion) and other fun things.
---
She was an Archer right? She didn't necessarily have animal friends. Nevertheless, the closest thing to an Archer is a hunter. She DID start the Forsaken, so she would've started teaching the turned Scourge to fight using a bow. Nathanos was also one of the first that Sylvanas recruited.
---
I'm fairly sure FD + ice trap was a thing in vanilla. 
---
would love to be corrected, though.
---
&gt; Then again Wailing Cavers will be much harder than Molten Core and BWL will after all these nerfs
---
absolute lolz
---
They're not gonna do any of that. It's way too much work. 
---
Son, are you lost?
---
Started osrs mobile last night, but fell asleep before getting too far in the tutorial.  I'm still excited to check it out.  I don't know shit about the game yet, any advice for a vanilla wow vet going in to osrs blind?  I really don't know what to expect yet. 
---
What "standard". Official Vanilla had a ton of things they want to change. Official Vanilla WoW is the "standard". Everytime it has a change it deviates further from that standard. When those changes make a 2004 game easier and accelerated in numerous ways it's going to break.
---
Interesting. What point are you bringing up with this? Is it a bad or a good thing? *I'm not being rude, I'm just wondering what you're telling us beyond the fact of the changes made to the item.*
---
&gt; This weapon that drops from Ragnaros, in it's 1.12.0 state can be comparable to a AQ/Naxx weapon.
---
This makes me think it's a bad thing. Does this mean they were trying to help bring people to Naxx straight from MC?
---
I don't think anybody knows. They may have a tag with "Classic" next to it. 
---
Aww a Nost fanboy :)
---
Having the item in its final state on release would be bad in my opinion.
---
One can only guess why they buffed the item in later patches, probably as a catch-up mechanic and to high end guilds continue to run Molten Core maybe.
---
What makes druids so powerful? Looking into playing druid myself
---
Are you kidding? In Vanilla if you pulled more than one mob you had to be very careful or you would certainly die. In MoP you could pull 4/5 mobs and not break a sweat. MoP did a lot of things right, but difficulty was not it. The world of MoP was easy mode.
---
What makes druids strong? Considering playing myself
---
For me it’s simple:  I get cool looking BIG weapons and I can actually hit stuff with it!
---
*cough* looking at you, hunters *cough*.
---
MISS OBAMA
---
Got partly similiar situation. My dad was cold, distant person I couldn't really talk to on daily basis, however he somehow introduced me to technologies and computer stuff. I was kind of opposite of him by nature, extravert that spoke with ease and honesty, because of that I felt kinda isolated and depressed being at home. Thats why online games hooked me on spot. 
---
For me, WoW was this place where many different individuals met to circle a communities, and it was different experiance, I had sort of exotic social clash. School, usually was fun but after few years you are kinda tired or bored of people repeating social patterns. Those bonds out of necessity between people just to gain small perks in life and common traits connecting inclusive friendships. Thankfully, I also had few honest friends with whom spending time was great, some with I even played WoW.
---
WoW was always there. And this stability led to situation when if something bad happened in real life I could jump to WoW to find equilibrium or chill. I'm thankful for that experiance, because some bad decision probably would be made.
---
Now I don't need to escape to WoW diverting my mind. I have beautiful doggo (ok, GF too), career, spare time and still long a looot for classic WoW to hopefully create quality memories again.
---
First run, boiz.
---
Last of us 2 is correct.
---
&gt; Visit the mangos forums, debates over NPC damage and damage resistance persist to this day.
---
There are no large-scale private servers running stock MaNGOS.  Every single one of the current generation of projects branched back in 2014, for better or worse.  So unless they are actively analyzing these third-party projects, I'm not sure what the MaNGOS forums have to do with current-generation private server values.  
---
And again, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying emulation is perfect.  But you made the claim that *"ALL damage and resistance calculations are RADICALLY MORE and GENEROUS than they were on live"*, which I think is patently unknowable.  Emphasis my own.
---
But I could still be wrong - feel free to post evidence to back up your claim.  I suspect the private server communities would also be interested in it.
---
&gt; Raggy's splash ability thing would 1-shot any player in greens on live, even with the BRS buff
---
I don't remember it being this way at all.  So I guess we are at a stalemate unless you have something tangible to offer.
---
&gt; No more information about MC encounters have been uncovered since 2007.
---
Technically true, if you take a hard line on the definition of information to mean cold, hard datamining.  But you're ignoring research, iteration, and dissemination.
---
If you FAP you don't need any other fun things :p
---
That’s definitely not true. I was a hunter back in vanilla and I salivated at the sight of warriors. Easiest class to kite. I’m sure most hunters feel the same way 
---
If you’re having trouble fighting warriors as a hunter than you’re doing something wrong 
---
Funnily enough, even though the updated BRE seems OP from a personal DPS point of view, if the debuff from the old BRE stacked with other armor reducing debuffs it would be far stronger since the raid dps increase would be way more effective than simply increasing one person's dps.  
---
Also, since it isn't really known for certain, the updated BRE's power depends on what sort of armor bosses had in vanilla. Evidence and some easy math points to bosses having around 3.7k armor, meaning that you would be bringing down their armor to 0 easily with Sunder Armor, Faerie Fire, Curse of Recklessness, and 1 stack of Annihilator - and since negative armor isn't a thing would make the updated BRE basically worthless to use on most bossfights (it would still be extremely good on trash packs and cleave fights).  
---
I get the point you're trying to make and hope classic has progressive itemization, however.
---
To be perfectly honest with you. I'm looking forward to classic, because classic was just hella good fun. Way better than any expansion and probably one of the best games I have ever played. I would have never left if I knew what was in store for the game.
---
We're all gonna meet up in Detroit, and have an IRL raid on Lansing.
---
Is there some place I can look up those stats changes for Molten Core gear?
---
Large scale private server projects have changes pushed every few months
---
There is already a thread like this about guild's forming here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ae7z1w/are\_guilds\_forming\_if\_so\_where\_can\_i\_begin\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ae7z1w/are_guilds_forming_if_so_where_can_i_begin_my/)
---
This is random as fuck but... thanks for sharing?
---
This ^
---
Just wondering if there is any information about this? My little brother told me that these "Red rarity items" are only made avaiable for GM's. I couldn't find any information from the web so I wanted to share this here
---
My point is mainly geared towards PvP though, which the 1.12.0 version of BRE is vastly superior to it's launch version.
---
BRE in its final version for pvp is superior to practially every weapon until C'thun/Naxx(except hand of rag).
---
1.3* talents and gear but yes, all yes.
---
I see three crappy items and an overpowered one.
---
Convince me why the crappy items are desirable?
---
Like I said, it's probably just broken on the server I'm on.
---
It wasn't an issue after Vanilla, because I believe in TBC traps could be used in combat.
---
I'm sorry. I couldn't make it past the 1st sentence. 
---
blizz like thank you very much
---
Classic wow is ridiculous, few other things besides this game can have me listening to hours and hours and hours of discussion about it.
---
I was in my late 20s already when WoW came out.
---
Ultima Online were my "good ol' days". I laugh when people say the only reason people want vanilla WoW is relive their teenage years... 
---
I'm like "Umm...."
---
No, that's proving the importance of buffing content to deal with 1.12 itemization.
---
No class is perticularly difficult or engaging in Vanilla imo, but PvE Mage is just a snoozefest.
---
Is this not a post about strong female characters?
---
Just wondering if there is any information about this? My little brother told me that these "Red rarity items" are only made avaiable for GM's
---
what does that have to do with anything i said
---
i agree with everything you typed except for the last part, which like the other guy said "Large scale private server projects have changes pushed every few months".
---
Well its not a question of engagement. Mages are tapping frostbolt all day just like Locks do with Shadow. Most classes are quite montonous when you come down to it.
---
My concern is the ease of leveling, plethora of abilities that make life easier farming/pvp and just being top tier dps. I find it hard not to just go mage given all this.
---
I would hope that they will do progressive itemization to some extent, since it's only consistent to what was said on the blizzcon panel. If they consider Unstoppable Force too overpowered for it to be on launch, since it's equivalent to most MC tier weapons, then surely the updated BRE won't be allowed due to the same logic. People who are against progressive itemization just haven't been railed by a geared arms warrior using the updated BRE.
---
Shocking patter 
---
Prettt sure they said the debuff limit would progress as it originally did, because it would destroy early game balance.
---
Hunter dps is mid tier in MC/BWL and then completely falls off a cliff in AQ.
---
I love what you are doing. This is one of the (if not the best) Guide/addon for questing. I would love to see this turn way bigger with a big comunity and a lot of different routes.
---
I was going thru the pages for fun and noticed that (at least on alliance) there are class only quests in the route. In this case the whirlwind weapon for warrior [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1792](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1792) 
---
Now the question is, are you planing to have the different classes as an option like you have the different races?
---
Since I havent seen someone mentioning this and could not find something on the manifesto I am courios.
---
Keep up the work. I love it.
---
Shadow is just plain 100% better then disc. You will heal your entire party for a good amount with the damage you deal and, you can cast dispel magic and, shield from shadow form. You will also be far harder to kill. Shadow priest is prolly the most scary all around PVP battle ground class. 
---
Mages have a lot of competition for drops. You may go weeks without getting anything.
---
They also have to spend a lot on consumables, assuming you're raiding with a top end guild.    
---
(Which is my prefrence, because 2hrs for MC+BWL is so much better than 3hrs for MC and getting stuck on Razorgore for months.)

From what i remember from when i had my own private server back in during vanilla, all the stupid op items that were in the 
---
game-files(GM items) were red.         
---
You should find them if you just google for old gm items.
---
I never played on nost, so no not at all.
---
Running through this instance with NO prior knowledge, I was on TeamSpeak with the party when the party leader was hyping up just how BEAUTIFUL the final boss was. He said she was hotter than a night elf. As I make my way down the final room and get closer and closer to Princess I come to the realization that this fat ugly shit in a bra was the Princess he spoke of. I laughed my ass off. Good times!
---
I'll admit that nostalgia may have affected how much I liked Maraudon. I only ran through it once in Vanilla and it took around 2 hours to clear. I couldn't believe how large it was. I ran it on a PuG because this instance and Desolace were hated by most players (except me) so you'd have to find the few who dared.
---
I'm almost of the opinion that item stats and abilities should be redistributed so there are new BiS items that people need to discover again rather than try to farm the ones they know (or in your case those that aren't BiS at the beginning but will be later).
---
IMO I just want the same experience I got in 2005, that doesn't necessarily mean the boss mechanics and item statistic distribution needs to be identical.  We already know they are going 1.12 talents which is going to make a lot of previously challenging content easier, why not make things a bit harder to balance with 1.12?

yhea, but he said best picture.

40 spellpower, while people claim this is not a big deal.

Horde EU?

Thanks for reading.  Anu belore dela'na :)
---
Since people seem to not know just how much some loot was changed, this should provide a good example and this is one way people researched the items for Nost. The first number is the address is the date and you should be able to compare any item by changing it to the earlier patch.
---
Pre change Azuresong Mageblade. No spellpower

Post change. 40 spellpower. This isn't a slight upgrade. This is not a small change. This makes this content stupidly easier.

Hi, /u/Tulkazz
---
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
What
---
The concern is with classic servers, why would we care if they leave if its affecting us until tbc
---
tbc isnt confirmed
---
"tourist" implies they aren't going to stick around in classic long enough for tbc?
---
what is this comment or am i going insane 
---
Took months on Ragnaros EU when I was playing, one of the highest population servers in Europe.
---
So you believe they'll stick to the 15$ a month subscription for Classic and no other revenue streams?
---
I’m excited for both. TLOU2 will be quite the adventure for what will likely be 14-18 hours of story. It’ll be harder to find time to devote to Classic and get the same sense of accomplishment 
---
Bit toxic there friendo :)
---
That's why I have such great memories of vanilla. I remember 3 people from that guild alone (Lucilius, Klo, and Shukkz). 
---
Unfortunately, the game took over too much of my life trying to rank up, and I had to quit a few weeks after that happened. I made an ally char and joined their guild as a level 1 to say some goodbyes before quitting, which was fun. They were all cool as shit, despite having corpse camped me dozens and dozens of times lol.
---
1.12 is a standard.  we do not have the 2004 game.
---
asking the 1.12 standard to be made *as difficult as* the 2004 game (which i would argue is *literally impossible*) is asking for a custom product - literally asking for changes - because... why exactly?  what is the benefit for this cost?
---
I really like priest and mage for casual play.  If I were trying to be objective, I would say your top 5 are all reasonable choices.
---
But play what you like.  It's about having fun.
---
Ah, the good old double Blackstone rings you can't loot, because you already have one and they are unique
---
&gt; black lead and a female lead in the 2000s.
---
Ehhhhh DS9 ended in 99 and VOY ended in early 01....not exactly the "2000s".  It does, however, make your point even more salient.
---
You're going to be in for a bit of a shock if you think healers are going to have an easy time finding dungeon groups (at 60).
---
I agree with you. I was asking for opinions, not stating my own.
---
Having interns inserting values in a field that Nostalrius and amateurs already did the leg work for is too hard? For a game that was already made and that has a sub fee of 15 dollars? 
---
They will make back the development cost of Classic in the first month of subs.
---
1 *billion?*
---
Lol, we should collectively start a weekly *huffing on them fumes* compilation thread for all these posts on r/classicwow made by folks who are clearly sniffing some shit.
---
Hm, I honestly think it would be a bad idea to allow cosmetics in Classic. Part of the sense of achievement comes from knowing that if you've got good looking gear, then you've earned it ingame, not via a cash shop.
---
Basically Free action pot and, Pray to the RNG gods you crit the S.O.B so damn hard he don't have time to ice block. There is no reality in which you beat a good mage with any regularity lol. As far as hunters go. Free action pot and, Bashem. Or die.
---
&gt;So basically, what do you think if the rumors are true about WoW Retail actually dying this time around?
---
This was my original sentence. You're misquoting a bit here, changing the meaning of what was said.
---
 I could do it with a team of 3 homeless people in a couple weeks without Nost providing the numbers just using internet archives. With the numbers already provided me it could be done in a day by interns.
---
Nothing I mentioned is "impossible".
---
What you say here rings true, and this is why my concern is that Blizzard will introduce microtransactions to Classic, thus tarnishing the sense of achievement that was so strong in Vanilla.
---
I'm pretty sure almost all people playing (aside from private server people) will come from retail WoW, or at least some of the more recent WoW expansions. They are used to having to optimise their play. It's expected of you in retail if you want to do any kind of real raiding to be looking up guides to learn how to play optimally. People will do that in vanilla too. 
---
All the knowledge private server people have will be easily shared with everyone else. People, at least those who reach higher levels, won't be running around like fools like a lot did in real vanilla. The culture in WoW has changed since then in that regard. 
---
Happy to see someone bring forth their opinion instead of slamming me assuming that what I posted was a representation of my own opinions.
---
Fuck. That's so spot on.
---
Tyvm
---
Let's  be real ;) if everyone that played before jumped on board for a taste that's probably over 50mil. With those kind of numbers it would create a hype vortex. Gaining max momentum at 500mil with a possible standard error of + or - 500mil
---
Ok. Thank god. I thought you were serious for a second. Lol ;)
---
Thank you for you opinion, much appreciated.
---
Princess want smoosh smoosh
---
Good points, thanks.
---
Saying wow wouldnt fit is an understatement, BFA would be more viable then Classic, purely because of the amount of abilities currently in the game.
---
How would you even fit half the abilities on the screen, whilst actually being able to press them with your finger.
---
came here to mention this guy :) he has really interesting videos!
---
Red item were not that rare. I had several after a long and unsuccessful BRD run.
